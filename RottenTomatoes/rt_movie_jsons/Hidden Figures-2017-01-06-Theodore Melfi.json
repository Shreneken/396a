I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the costumer needed to do some research or at least look at some pictures. They could have at least used an Army officer's uniform instead of an enlisted uniform for Col. Jim Johnson. An officer's uniform has a stripe on the cuff of the sleeves and stripes on the pants. Also, there is no unit patch on the left shoulder and no ribbons. Since a Colonel would have some ribbons, even if just the National Defense which is given to everyone. No nametag as the Army wears a name tag on the right pocket. At least splurge for a few ribbons, they are cheap. A complete omission of attention to detail. I have read that the \"colored\" coffee pot scene wasn't in the book and didn't happen. How much more was made up?",

Admittedly there is a sort of \"token nice white guy\" who's used as sort of a Deus Ex-Machina to resolve the main conflict of segregation in NASA. However, I'm not too well versed for how it actually went down, so I won't make too many harsh judgements on that particular scene.

As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold. \nI literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put \u2018minorities in their place', but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.\nIt takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",

Henson is the standout of the three, there's one scene of pure frustration for Katherine where Henson's performance is simply fantastic.\n\nKevin Costner is good here as Harrison, though the characters of Jim Parsons (Paul) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian) are a little roughly developed. Other pluses from this film include the music and the cinematography.\n\nThere does seem to be a load of artistic license used, even for some important scenes, which is a little disappointing as it would've been nice to have a more truthful telling of this era in world history.

Sure, time is compressed from years and years of sterling work yet slow career progress on the part of the three main characters into what seems to be the preparation for a single mission, namely John Glenn's first orbital space-flight. And some supporting roles are several people conflated into a single representative character but the lead roles are played so brilliantly and the story developed so seamlessly that these can all be overlooked. Your emotions are played like a harp and yet it never feels as if the movie-makers are actively trying to pluck on heartstrings; they're just telling a story and you're along for the ride. If RT gave the option for six stars, this film would earn them every time.",

            "content": "As well intentioned as this film is I don't find it to be a film that adds anything new to the traditional formula of the race relations drama with the prestige of being based on a true story. This certainly presents African-Americans in a far better light than the similarly condescending The Help (2011) but all of the clich\u00e9s are still there and they aren't particularly entertaining. I can't see why this film was nominated for Best Picture when it is so milquetoast and boring, I suppose the Academy do love that, and when it is going up against competition like Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Arrival (2016).\n\nAfrican-American mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson, Taraji P. Henson, Dorothy Vaughan, Octavia Spencer, and Mary Jackson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, face racism as they work at the Langley Research Center and attempt to advance the Americans in the Space Race. Johnson begins a romance with Jim Johnson, Mahershala Ali, while facing off against colleague Paul Stafford, Jim Parsons. The women are helped by their white supervisor Al Harrison, Kevin Costner, who attempts to break down the barriers between black and white employees and battle prejudices. The launch is ultimately success due to the hard work of the mathematicians and the women receive recognition for their efforts.\n\nThe problem with the film is that so much of it feels contrived and too much like many, better films we have seen before. Spencer trots out the same old routine that we have seen in countless other films from The Soloist (2009) to Gifted\n(2017) and yet here something seems to be missing as even she seems tired with her sassiness and firm but fair persona. Henson and Mon\u00e1e additionally struggle to inject their characters with any real life as they feel more like symbols than real, human characters even as we see snippets of their love lives and friendship. The writers, actors and the director Theodore Melfi, known for such highbrow fare as St. Vincent (2014), should have tried to add something new to a story that has been told a million times before and for now their workmanlike but unremarkable approach is just not good enough.\n\nThe only element of the film that is really of note is the score which is bright and lively and all of the things that the rest of the film really should be. We understand how empowered these women feel as catchy toe tappers play during scenes in which they make their way confidently through their workplace. In some ways the film reminded me of Working Girl (1988) in these moments as while none of the songs on the soundtrack even come close to rivaling \"Let the River Run\" by Carly Simon. Hans Zimmer is mostly known for his work on Christopher Nolan films and other serious dramas but he gets the cheery tone that this film needs just right and while he could be accused of ripping off Thomas Newman's score in Erin Brockovich (2000). I would happily remove Mica Levi's nomination for Jackie (2016) and replace it with a nomination for Zimmer's work in Hidden Figures.\n\nInspirational films about real life African-American figures that I would recommend watching before seeing this film include Rosewood (1997) and Ali (2001). Those films try to say something interesting about their main characters as we see Mann as a man who is a cause for change but also an overly violent man while we see what an impressive athlete Muhammad Ali was as well as being a drain on those around him in his personal life. It is disappointing how few films that are not about real African-Americans get wide recognition and I wish that more African-Americans were given opportunities to make films that take more risks than this paint by numbers biopic.\n\nThis is a film that won't offend anyone, to my knowledge, but it won't inspire any great passion in anybody or teach them anything they don't already know. The content of the film is rather boring despite it's worthiness and the performances are not the best of the admittedly talented actresses involved. See Moonlight (2016) or Fences (2016) if you want to see fascinating films that explore the struggles of being African-American.",

It's just so glossy and picture perfect it defies belief, I would've preferred to see something a little closer to reality, none of these characters seem to have a single substantive flaw even. I'm reminded of the film Imitation Game and how Alan Turing was a more interesting character because he was kind o an asshole.\n\nStill, these are minor gripes. I'm confident most people will enjoy this film as I did despite wishing they'd taken a few more risks. The film is worth watching to cement these three women in our collective memories at the very least.\n\n8/10 Stellar",

But I want to underline the defects because I fell like this movie had so much potential but it has been wasted quite a bit. The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them. On the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances waere great and the music is suited. In conclusion it is a movie which probably most of the people will like (even strongly) but very few will love or hate (unless you are personally so into its inclusion message).",

This movie takes place during segregation and the main three characters are African American females, which isn't the best time for them. Anyway, the three are extremely smart and they work at NASA, but only in shitty conditions. They argue and argue and finally get promotions that make their jobs better. They work on the spaceship that John Glenn uses and the math and physics behind it just leaves me in awe. This film captures powerful messages such as: don't let people get you down, just try your best in life, and always be there for others.

            "content": "The 1960s was the age of political movements and changes, which makes it one of the most hectic and violet decades in American history. Hidden Figures, a 2016 drama directed by Theodore Melfi, features the racism and changes the sixties had to offer. Throughout the movie, three African American women break human history by working on NASA\u00e2(TM)s project of getting a man into space while also struggling with racism and gender discrimination in the workplace. They defy all odds against them and become some of the most vital parts of the age of space. Hidden Figures is an inspirational, eye-opening story that can capture anyone\u00e2(TM)s attention. \n\nIn the beginning, the movie emphasizes the inequality the three women, Dorothy, Katherine, and Mary, dealt with in their computing jobs at NASA. After the Russians began making advancements in the race, the Flight Research Division needed Katherine\u00e2(TM)s mathematical specialties for research documents. She started working with white, male mathematicians and engineers and this is where she had the most struggle with racism. She got no clearance, had separated bathrooms and supplies, and was treated with disrespect, yet she kept working until she earned the respect of everyone around her. \n\nDuring this time Mary applied to be an engineer which required her to go to an all-white college during the nights which also presented problems. After graduating from that college, she became NASA\u00e2(TM)s first female African American engineer. While both Mary and Katherine struggled with discrimination in their new fields, Dorothy struggled with getting the raise she deserved. She did the work of a management job, but NASA didn\u00e2(TM)t give \u00e2the colored division\u00e2? a supervisor. This caused her to use her skills to program one of the newest machines to NASA; the IBM machine which was too complicated and could not be programmed by anyone but Dorothy and her workers. \n\nHidden Figures used multiple perspectives and issues to create a clear idea of what life was during this time. It represented the changing of society, gender discrimination, racism, eagerness to discover more, family and love, and the idea of working hard will pay off. It can play with your emotions to form a connection with the protagonists and the victims so easily. If it had less talking and more clarity of some scenes, it would be a better movie for audiences of younger ages. But its maturity and deep scenes make it an extremely watchable film. \n\nThis captivating drama is so appealing to the audience and makes them feel like they\u00e2(TM)re getting a first-hand experience of discrimination. It can be enjoyed by men and women of all interests and almost all ages due to its humor and diversity of characters. It brings the viewers back to a time when discovery, the fight for equality, and family were the most important things to everyone.",

The Space Race was a competition between between the Soviet Union and The United States, during the cold war, to see who could reach space first. The United States \"won\" the race, but not everyone who helped is recognized. Hidden Figures is a film directed by Theodore Melfi, about three black women who worked behind the scenes to make sure John Glenn (Glen Powell) would get safely launched into space. These women were Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). Hidden Figures shows the true story of these three women and their battle against racism and sexism to be in the STEM field. Although it is an inspiring story, it doesn't tell the full truth.\nThe movie did tell the true stories of the three women and the NASA space launch. The three women all persevered to achieve their dreams. They worked as computers at the beginning of the movie, but all slowly worked their way to their dream jobs. Katherine Johnson was an extremely talented mathematician who ended up working with white men to calculate the correct landing spot for the Freedom 7. Mary Jackson is an aspiring engineer that struggles to work in her own field. Dorothy Vaughan runs the black computers and learns the code for the new IBM computer (IMDb). It shows the classic \"anything is possible\" kind of moral. \nThe movie in of itself wasn't terrible, but it was not fully historically correct. Many things happened in the movie that did not happen in real life. The film exaggerated the racism, by adding scenes that were not true, but made the plot and or movie more interesting. For example, many times we see that Johnson has to go across campus to use the colored restrooms, but this is untrue and did not really happen. So by Hollywood making the movie more dramatic, it made the movie less historically accurate. The characters also lacked depth and complexity. Most had one defining characteristic. For example, we notice that Jackson is sassy, and that is her defining characteristic (Oclese). It also is mainly focused on Johnson's story, even though ll of their stories are interesting, and all had the same determination to achieve their dreams. \nEven with all of the things that were inaccurate, it doesn't mean that the movie was necessarily bad. It was still a great, inspiring film. This film is great for most age groups, the youngest probably around twelve. It is great for anyone to see this and be inspired, especially young women children. It is important for people to see that being prejudice, rasict or sexixst will not and can not stop anyone.",

Hidden Figures, directed by American screenwriter and producer Theodore Melfi, illustrates the experiences of African American women Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson during the 1960s. Based on a true story, the three women worked at NASA, serving as the brains behind one of the most monumental operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. This remarkable achievement restored the nation's confidence, turned around the space race, and galvanized the world. The protagonist, Katherine Johnson, was the first of the trio to work at the NASA space test group because she was incredible at mathematics. Throughout the film, the visionary trio battles with not only personal affairs but the harsh realization of segregation and gender inequality throughout the workplace. Hidden Figures is a fascinating and inspiring film that keeps the audience enlightened and engaged.\n\nKatherine Johnson gets the opportunity to join the big leagues, where decisions are made, and she can finally explore her talent in mathematics. Unfortunately for her, she struggles through tough times along the way. No 'colored' men had ever been selected to join the test group, let alone 'colored' women. Katherine had to use a separate empty kettle for her tea and to \"relieve herself,\" she had to travel half-a-mile away to a building that had the appropriate restroom for her. Despite all of these challenges, her brilliance in mathematics made sure she shined the brightest among her white male colleagues. The three female mathematicians and physicists, also known as 'human computers,' were some of the most substantial brains behind NASA greatest accomplishment. As Katherine Johnson was out working at the space test group, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson were out making their dreams come true. Dorothy battles with her condescending boss, Vivian Mitchell, to become the supervisor in NASA's West Area Computing division, and Mary takes to the court in an attempt to become the first female African American engineer. \n\nTheodore Melfi does an outstanding job of keeping the plot easy to follow while also portraying emotion. Even though overcoming challenges is an all-too-familiar topic, Hidden Figures manages to tell an inspiring story. In one of the last scenes of the film, John Glenn commands that he will not complete his mission on orbiting the earth unless Katherine Johnson checks the numbers. He says, \"Get the girl to check the numbers\" and \"If she says the numbers are good, I am ready to go\" (Hidden Figures). This is an inspiring moment in the film because it shows how Glenn trusts Katherine calculations, despite her being an African American women, and this could mean the difference between life or death for him. Glenn saw the brilliance in Katherine and knew the potential she had.  \n\nHidden Figures is a fascinating film that tells an inspiring story. Theodore Melfi illustrates the experiences of three African American women overcoming segregation and gender inequality not by violence and protest, but with skill and persistence. The film teaches the audience not to judge a person by the color of her skin, but by her character and the knowledge she owns. People ages ten and up who love history and are interested in an inspirational plot should watch Hidden Figures.",

Hidden Figure is a movie directed by Donna Gigliotti. It takes place in the 1950s, and it takes a glance at what it was like to be an African American woman working for the NASA program. This movie showcases three African American women who take on the endeavors of working for NASA and the racial bias that they encounter. Hidden Figures was an eye-catching, storytelling movie. However, it lacked a real sense that others movies have.\n   Early in the movie, the director did an excellent job at capturing the viewer by adding Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s childhood and how she became a mathematician.  The protagonist, Katherine Harrison, started her life from humble beginnings. When she was young, she was a math prodigy and was accepted into some of the best schools in the country. Twenty years later,  Katherine became one of the only few African Americans working for NASA. Katherine was one of the best mathematicians at NASA, but many of her white counterparts did not want to recognize her abilities. She was one of the only African Americans working at NASA that had a significant impact on the space program.   \nKatherine occupied one of the highest paying jobs at NASA, predicting rocket trajectory. During her time there, many of her white counterparts did not believe that she had the capabilities to be there. Furthermore, they felt that she was inferior to them. The movie does a great job of capturing the viewer and getting them interested in the plot. The film mainly captures Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s side of working at NASA and did a great job portraying the overt racism that was seen in the workforce. Although the movie was detailed and right to the point it lacked in some areas, such as it did not feel realistic. Harrison was asked a question about her time working in NASA, and she said she never experienced racism. The premise of this movie is based on the issue of gender bias and bigotry. The fact that she stated that she did not experience racism makes the film inaccurate.\nAlthough this novel creates acknowledges what it was like to be an African American women in the 1950s, it was inaccurate in its storytelling. These young women did the unthinkable during this time by and becoming some of the best African Americans women working at NASA. This movie shows that success can be achieved through the roughest of times even when gender bias and racism are not in their favor. This was a fascinating film that would be great for adolescents and adults. It would not appeal to children under the age of 12 because it would be hard for them to understand the racism aspect of the movie. \n\n\n\n\tRating: 4.5/5",

A second prejudice existed against women in the scientific/engineering space program at NASA. This movie is about three outstanding women who wanted to make a difference in their community. Katherine Johnson, the main character, worked on the calculations that allowed John Glenn to orbit the earth. This was a fascinating movie, and it proved that women during this time were capable of achieving goals that were only assigned to men. It was even harder for African- American women to succeed.\n\tKatherine Johnson, a brilliant mathematician, was selected to join the space test group because she was one of the few individuals who knew how to apply analytical geometry. Although she experienced many challenges, for example, Katherine was asked to examine and check her male coworkers math calculations. Her male coworkers decided to black out this information by telling her it was classified. She overcame this problem by holding the paper up to the light. Also, when Katherine wanted a cup of coffee on the first day of her new job, she had to use a separate coffee pot because of segregation. Finally, when Katherine had to use the bathroom, she would have to run to the other building where all the African American women worked to relieve herself. Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s boss later tore down the bathroom sign because he believed that African- American women should be equal, and he didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t want her to waste valuable calculation time running back and forth to use facilities every day.  \n\tThe title of the movie is Hidden Figures; this was interesting because the African- American women who worked at NASA were \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2hidden Figures\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? during the 1960s. These three main women were the hidden keys for success. This film was fantastic and was written about prejudice and segregation which is still a problem that needs to be resolved to this day. More truthful information about the contributions of these dedicated women would have inspired and benefited young girls of all colors to study math, science, and engineering. Katherine Johnson and the other two women strived for what they believed in. This inspires all of us, and all ages (school age and up) should see this movie.",

Katherine Goble is a genius mathematician who is promoted from being a computer to working with white men to calculate the landing point for John Glenn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s spaceship. Mary Jackson is an engineer who dreams of working on the shuttle but must win the right to attend night school so she can learn the necessary skills. Dorothy Vaughan is the unofficial supervisor of the African-American computers who strives to be recognized with the title and pay of a supervisor.  The three women have to defy stereotypes to win their co-worker and bosses\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) approval and achieve their dreams.\nThe movie was engaging and inspiring in multiple ways. One of the most impressive parts of the film is how real footage from the Friendship 7 launch in 1962 was used (Scubafiend). The historical accuracy added some extra detail to the movie and made it more enjoyable to watch. Also, the use of symbolism in the lot, such as the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2pearl necklace\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? that Katherine Goble does not own, added an extra layer of depth to the script (JRS). The three women were so inspiring, it would have been tough to create a story that does not demonstrate their perseverance and strength. The movie had a clear message and anyone would be in awe of Goble, Vaughan, and Jackson\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s accomplishments after watching it.\nWhile much of the Hidden Figures story is true to real events, many of the details were made up by Hollywood to make the plot more appealing. One of the most memorable parts of the movie occurs when Katherine Goble has to run to the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2colored\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? restrooms across the NASA campus every day, but this is fictional, as are the characters of  Al Harrison and Paul Stafford to show the racism and sexism of the time (JRS). Also, the characters in the movie are slightly one-sided and do not have many personality traits (Olcese). These women were geniuses, and do not deserve to be portrayed as any less. Finally, the movie focuses mainly on Katherine Goble story. Although it was possibly the most interesting, it made it seem that Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson did not work as hard as she did to achieve her dreams, when all three women were extremely perseverant (Olcese). If one is looking for a more historically accurate version of Hidden Figures, they should read the book Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly.\nHidden Figures had an inspiring moral and was entertaining to watch. Although some details were made up, this was done to make the storyline more interesting, and photos of the real people behind the stories were shown at the end of the movie. While the message to \u00ef\u00bf 1/2never underestimate others\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? is clear, the story could have had more complex characters and gone more in-depth with Jackson and Vaughan\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s stories if it were longer. These women\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s astonishing history is too complicated to be summed up in two hours. Hidden Figures should be recommended to any age group, especially for younger children, because it is important for children to see how unfair discrimination is, and the inspirational message to \u00ef\u00bf 1/2reach for the stars,\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? in this case, literally, are fit for anyone.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures: A Hidden Gem Of True Female Empowerment\nA movie review of the film Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi\nOvercoming racism and sexism all while doing a job is difficult, but especially for the three African-American women featured in the 2016 historical fiction film Hidden Figures. Loosely based on the novel \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Hidden Figures\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? and actual events, the movie follows African-American NASA (Formerly known as NACA) human computers, Katherine Johnson (played by Golden Globe-winning actress Taraji P. Henson.), Mary Jackson (played by singer, songwriter, and actress, Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e), and Dorothy Vaughan (portrayed by Oscar-winning actress, Octavia Spencer.). The three women face racism and sexism throughout the movie, encouraging others to fight for what they believe in, work hard, and take a stand. The cinematic gem features a star-studded female cast that makes Hidden Figures a true work of female empowerment in Hollywood, changing the movie from decent to excellent.\nThe 2016 historical fiction movie highlights the racism and sexism of the 1960s. The main three characters, Katherine, Mary, and Dorothy, know this all too well. Katherine becomes a human computer in the year 1961 in the film and experiences racism as well as sexism in the workplace by the fictional character, Paul Stafford. portrayed by Primetime Emmy-winning actor Jim Parsons. Stafford is Katherine's co-worker, and the two are not the best of friends when she arrives. Katherine is often told that she is not fit to be in her position, a useless employee and among other racist and sexist remarks. Parsons\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) character \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2shows audiences the symbolism of sexism and racism in the 1950s\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2?. (Hollywood vs. History) The characters portrayal gives us the emotion and depth needed to make Katherine\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s character work harder than before to prove she belongs, giving viewers a real cinematic view of female empowerment. \nActresses, Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e and Octavia Spencer\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s characters are no stranger to discrimination as well. Their characters Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan show the female audience empowerment. Mary Jackson is a female engineer and computer who takes her career to new heights when she goes to court for fighting for something she believed in. When Jackson is denied access to further her education because she is an African American woman, she takes a stand and petitions the court to level the playfield. Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s acting skills in these scenes give audiences the emotion, pain, and triumph needed to make her character embody a pure work of female empowerment. Dorothy Vaughan does the same as well when being chosen for re-assignment. Vaughan faces a difficult decision and must choose between herself and her fellow computers. Vaughan declines the re-assignment and gives her supervisor an ultimatum that she can only take the job if she can bring her equally qualified co-workers with her. This provides fans that female empowerment and diversity element that we need to see more of in Hollywood. Vaughan doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t only take the promotion for herself but expands the job to include her co-workers. Vaughan shows viewers that one African American women advancing in the workforce is a great achievement, but multiple African American women moving up in the male-dominated workforce is true female empowerment for all. \nAltogether the Film Hidden Figures is an outstanding film that all ages should watch. The cinematic gem gives audiences a perspective of female empowerment and diversity rather than historical fiction, making it a stellar film for all audiences to enjoy.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures, a 2016 American historical drama film,  depicts the inspiring untold true story of three African-American females working at NASA during the Space Race. The trio immensely contributed in launching astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The movie is loosely based on the non-fiction novel, Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although there are many informative moments throughout the movie, it deviates slightly from the actual historical events.\n\nOne of the essential characters in this story, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), is not a real person. His role is based on Robert C. Gilruth, the head of the Space Task Group at the NASA Langley Research Center (Loff). In Hidden Figures, Al Harrison is not focused on the prevalence of racism in the United States during the 1960s - He, along with many others, is solely concentrated on getting a man into orbit (Krizanovich). \n\nAlong with this, one of the most memorable scenes of Hidden Figures occurred when the Al Harrison smashed down the Colored Ladies Room bathroom sign with a crowbar. This transpires after Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), \"returns to her desk from a bathroom break, drenched after running for half an hour in the rain,\" (Thomas). Though this is a dramatic and substantial scene in Hidden Figures, this did not happen. \n\nA similar misrepresentation occurs in Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race. The novel states that Katherine Johnson \"refused to so much as enter the Colored bathrooms,\" and she was never forced to, either. Dexter Thomas, a VICE news correspondent, interviewed Katherine Jackson herself, who stated: \"I just went on in the white one.\"\n\nAlthough the movie portrays various delusive events, it comprises the reality of controversial topics such as racism and sexism, particularly during the '60s. It also discloses how individuals conquered these adversities.  This movie would most likely appeal to adolescent viewers who enjoy historical dramas. Viewers who are not interested in aeronautics may not find this movie about space science engaging. Overall, Hidden Figures is a wonderful film about self-actualization and resilience.   \n\nRating: 3.0/ 5.0",

            "content": "Being Bold In Life Is Hard\n\nHidden Figures, an incredible, untold, true 1960s historical fiction film directed by Theodore Melfi. This movie shows the progress of three African American women who work at the headquarters for NASA in Hampton, Va. These women are striving to create the most significant space launch in history, the launch of John Glenn into orbit. This film occurs during the time of segregation and workplace sexism was prevalent, but more specifically it tackles African American women's rights. The three African American women's lives the movie follows are Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. In the film, they were referred to as \"computers,\" as if they are simply machines, not actual people. Hidden Figures was a compelling and moving story; although it did not portray history extremely well, as there is a Hollywood touch added to the movie, and some scenes are not entirely historically correct. \n\nThe movie's main storyline is the division between the two colored skins, the blacks and whites, and how differently they were treated. In the 1960s, the white colored skinned people got treated like they were superior and people with darker skin were considered low-quality. The movie does not portray exactly the real historical events that happened, and some of the most powerful parts in the movie that were added in were not actually true events. Kevin Costner's character, Al Harrison, was not a real character. Three different directors at NASA inspired his character. Al Harrison was a composition character. Another scene in the movie that is false occurred when the white male workers thought Katherine G. Johnson was the janitor there to empty garbage cans. That was not true. That incident never happened. This was an element of fiction created by the filmmakers. Jim Parsons' character, NASA engineer Paul Stafford, was also a fictional character. He was designed into the movie to represent certain racist and sexist attitudes that existed during the 1960s. He then has a change of heart and brings Katherine a cup of coffee later. This character did show how terrible people were back then, and how people can change, but it was not the real events. These scenes are all fiction. While compelling, however, they were not real. \n\nThe most powerful scene in Hidden Figures was Al Harrison knocking down the white women's bathroom and making it a bathroom for everyone, coloreds included, so Katherine did not have to run half a mile to a different wing of the building, occasionally even in the rain just to go the restroom. That is all fake too. Katherine ignored the rules and still used the women's restroom in her wing. This scene signifies the experience Mary Jackson had when she worked for NASA. Also, there is no record of anyone ever personally taking down restroom signs. All these scenes are meaningful and valuable to the story, but leaving them out would have made the story exceptional. Viewers would know the real story and understand what actually happened to those women. Some viewers disagree and like having those fictional characters or scenes in the movie because it gives more examples of what it was like back then. Also, some people believe it captures the struggles of African American women more. Although, viewers should consider that if they want to see the actual battles of segregation in the 1960s, seeing the true story would show more. \n\nHidden Figures is a such a touching movie because it tells the story of how three strong African American women stood up to being kept down. They refused to go unnoticed. They demanded to be seen as equals to their white counterparts. There was nothing easy about what they did, but they did it anyway. Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan are such inspirational women and have set an example for future women to follow. This movie would be recommended more towards women because Hidden Figures is about the struggles women faced, but more specifically African American women. Women would feel very connected to this movie and understand what they are going through.  Even though this movie was so enjoyable to watch, had Hidden Figures followed the original storyline, it would have been exceptional. All being said, this movie deserves a 3.5/5 star rating.",

            "content": "Exaggeration or Excellence\n\nWhat makes a film excellent? Hidden Figures, directed by Ted Melfi, revolves around three black women named Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson who worked at NASA and were integral to the success of many of the Apollo missions including the one that sent John Glenn into space, which caused him to be the first American to orbit the Earth. Hidden Figures is a critically acclaimed movie that was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Hidden Figures was undoubtedly an enlightening movie that captivated its audience, but it also implemented exaggeration to entertain viewers.\n\nFew movies based on true stories maintain the delicate balance of facts and personal struggles like the film Hidden Figures does. The difficult tasks that Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson completed while working at NASA would not have been properly represented had the film creators decided to neglect the scientific and mathematical aspects of these women's careers.  Despite the complicated ideas that circulated throughout NASA, Hidden Figures was able to explain the basic function of each of the main character's jobs in simple yet sufficient enough detail so that the audience could appreciate each women's contributions to the space program. This movie induced feelings of inspiration and satisfaction to many of its viewers as it highlighted how Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan overcame various struggles such as sexism and racism to achieve success in their fields. If nothing else, Hidden Figures opened its audience's eyes to the idea that the space program at the highest level was not exclusively run by the white man, and everyone can make an impact in any field.\n\nMovies based on reality are subject to a certain amount of authenticity, and authenticity is one of the major reasons viewers decided to watch Hidden Figures. However, under further scrutiny,  the film Hidden Figures proved to have many inaccuracies. Arguably the most important exaggeration included the idea that Katherine Johnson suffered large amounts of explicit racism while working when in reality Katherine Johnson herself admitted that racism was not prevalent at NASA. Movies based on true stories are held accountable to a certain amount of accuracy, yet the filmmakers decided to add false ideas into the movie to make it more entertaining. There are times and places for artistic license, but it should be used to accentuate details not falsify facts. Developing a plot in a movie of this genre needs to be based on truth, and the film Hidden Figures was not able to meet that requirement.\n\nHidden Figures was an enthralling movie despite using false information to create conflict and entertain viewers. The film showcased Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Johnson's accomplishments with an appropriate amount of detail. However, the producers detracted from the value of the movie by trying to create a problem that did not even exist. Hidden Figures is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to understand the contributions that these women made to America, but not for those wishing to understand the full, accurate story of their lives. Many people can make an entertaining fictional film, but those who create movies that revolve around the lives of real people need to be held to a higher standard.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a dramatic historical film that gathers what life was like in the early to mid 1900s for African American women, and how the three protagonists push through discrimination with hard work and bravery, eventually gaining respect as workers in NASA (then called NACA). Despite both African Americans and woman being frowned upon by society, these courageous people fought for civil rights and a place among the workers at NASA, in a mission to reach space and bring an astronaut back home. Hidden Figures, based on a book sharing the same name, being published the year as the movie, has aspects of civil rights and courage that inspires the watchers, however is dramatized from the original plotline.\n\n\tThe protagonists, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, work as calculators for NASA, being called \"computers\". They would calculate some of the most crucial problems in NASA, though being constantly persecuted for being African American women. Eventually, the main protagonist, Katherine, gets a promotion from computers to work on directly checking and creating equations for NASA to confirm calculations are correct. In the movie, she arrives to her new office area to find that she is the only African American and woman there, with a separate low-quality coffee machine than the others, and only obtaining only censored writings due to \"confidentiality\". This is however different from what the story is based off of. Originally, Katherine actually had minimal discrimination compared to what they had to go through in order to get to NASA in the first place. Still, to make the movie more dramatic, and express the troubles the protagonists had before being at NASA,  they exaggerated NASA's dislike African American women in the movie.\n\nOther than the movies' flaws with being historically inaccurate, there were general themes, such as American hate and suspicion towards the recently launched Russian satellite known as Sputnik, that were fairly accurate a represented how the beliefs from the mid 1900s was different from today. Katherine Johnson, who is still alive at age over 100 years old, stated that \"[The Hidden Figures movie] was well done. The three leading ladies did an excellent job portraying us,\" according to The Los Angeles Times. This shows the movies accuracies with the bravery and courage of the original women at NASA, as can be seen frequently in the movie, such as when Mary Jackson makes a speech to a judge in order to attend an all-white school, one of the only things limiting her from proceeding to become a NASA engineer4.\n\nThe movie was overall entertaining, dramatic, and historically accurate in terms of themes, however being over-dramatized. The original women who worked at NASA were well portrayed, to bring together an inspiring film. The movie earns a well-deserved 4.5/5 stars for historical theme accuracy, entertainment, and being an inspiring tale of the brave women working at NASA.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures:  Discrimination and Determination\nThe Realities of NASA\n\nHidden Figures is a veritable movie, taking place in the early sixties, where three black women were discriminated against their race, and gender in the NASA computers division. The film is well characterized by the actors, with a powerfully written script by the director, Allison Schroeder.  This historical movie is based on the nonfiction book, Hidden Figures, by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although countable events that took place were real, the movie would not have been entertaining without further conflict.  The actors portray the hardships of being \u00e2computers\u00e2? at NASA, and their struggles to fight for civil rights and displayed tough female leads.  \n\nThis well written, award-winning historical movie is no documentary. For example, the three main actors, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson were depicted as being close friends. In the actual story, they were colleagues who supported one's dreams, but they never were close (Schroeder). These untrue events that are claimed to be right continue. For instance, Katherine Johnson\u00e2(TM)s scene when she ran all the way to the African American women\u00e2(TM)s lavatory never happened. Katherine Johnson was not the one running across the branch, Mary Jackson was. Jackson\u00e2(TM)s story of running to a bathroom with a colored sign on it is entirely different from the story.  Johnson had explained that she did not feel discriminated against, even using the white washrooms, (Harris). Also, Al Harrison, the head of the space program, melodramatic scene of hammering the sign in front of the ladies restroom was fictional. It seems as though the director added this dramatized scene  to raise the conflict of the story. Furthermore, without rising action, the storyline would have been disinteresting, and would not have been an award-winning film.\n\nThe three African American women faced many challenges through NASA. The movie depicts how the women were discriminated against in the 1960s. They were discriminated not just by race but by gender. For example, Dorothy Vaughan leads a group of African American women to the mainframe computer room. She saw this as an opportunity for her fellow African American colleagues to advance. This symbolizes the civil rights movement. In this time in history, women mainly worked as receptionists, and their talents for mathematics and science were shut down. Katherine Johnson took her chance and upgraded from being a human computer to working on the mathematics behind the Mercury 7 mission. She was highly discriminated against by her male colleagues. The movie shows a clear image of how Johnson struggled to work in a large room of white men. A clear vision the film tried to explain was the scene where Paul Stafford, a white engineer, forbade Johnson to sit in on a board meeting. Al Harrison, the boss, shut down his sexist and racist comments by allowing her to sit in on the meeting. Johnson even did calculations in front of the representatives and got assigned the Mercury 7 launch. All three of the women have had amazing accomplishments while facing discrimination and the harsh Jim Crow Laws.\n\nThis movie attempts to demonstrate the hardships the African American women endured. Hidden Figures does well to characterize the three astonishing women and their marvelous work. Although it is not historical in the least, the plot appeals to younger audiences (adolescent) as well as older adults. This movie will likely not appeal to history buffs who will not agree with the events that took place. This reason is that the film is not historically correct but still gives a vivid image of segregation. The maturity of this movie is not meant for younger viewers because they may not understand the symbols shown. Overall, this movie is a depiction of what African American women had to do to overcome equality issues and misogyny.",

Katherine Goble Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were three african american women who were great at both math and problem solving.They contributed to one of the United States most miraculous events when they helped launch John Glenn into space.\n\tHidden Figures is a movie and book based off a true story. When the story was told in the setting of the 1940's, African-American and women were discriminated against in many aspects of their life. Katherine,Dorothy, and Mary were black women working at NASA in the east wing with multiple other black women. That all changed when Katherine was offered a new job in the East wing with all white males. They looked down upon her at first but soon they realized she and the rest of the women would be a key math component in beating other countries in the race to space.\n\tHidden Figures deserves a ? star rating. The quality of the cinematography is outstanding. The way the movie is set in the time period of discrimination but the quality is clear is amazing. The perspective of the opening scene adds onto the star rating. It shows what talents the women have from the beginning and incorporates a sense of discrimination The reason one point was taken off was because of the way the story was told. Most movies don't show the whole plot as there's no enough time but the movie seemed very untrue to the real story. Women were treated unfairly most of the time at NASA but Katherine Johnson did work as hard to achieve a higher position.\nThis film should be suitable for childern to adults ages 10 and up because the themes can not be fully undestanded if the audience is young. This film would also be enjoyable for people interested in African-American history,NASA's history, or interested in learning about discrimination.

            "content": "Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi is a thrilling experience about two African American women, who worked for NASA in 1961. These women were named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, and they were part of one of the most inspiring movies to hit the theaters ever. They each had separate jobs, but have to push through the same problems. Katherine's job was to figure out how to make a spaceship go into orbit, Mary's job was to help engineer a spaceship that could sustain high heats and high altitudes, and Dorothy was the supervisor for her group, which she was then the first ever African American to do so. 1961 was a highly racist time, so the three women had to overcome lots of difficult problems such as having to run a long ways to go to the bathroom, and had to drink from a less purified container of coffee. These females also had to work in a separate room and had to deal with the prejudiced coworkers surrounding them. Hidden Figures gives watchers the thrill of overcoming racism while pulling together an astounding story of trying to figure out how to get a spaceship in orbit, and to land on the moon.    \n\tHidden Figures has many aspects of overcoming racism. One aspect is when Caroline first gets promoted to her job for the duration of the movie. Her co-worker, Paul Stafford, seems to be extremely prejudiced throughout the book. Caroline offers to check his work, and he says \"No it is already correct\", and does not let her check it. Also throughout the movie, Caroline is giving information to Paul, and he quickly tells her that it is wrong or outdated, which she goes back to her workspace, and retires at her work, clearly aggravated. In the next scene, Caroline begs Al Harrison, the leader of the NASA group, to let her in the meeting, and tells him that she has the right information, but Paul refuses to let her in the important meeting.  Al overrides Paul and Caroline is let into the meeting. Later in the meeting, her information is finally seen as correct, and useful, and later in the movie, this information helps NASA reach the moon. Another reason that these women had to overcome racism was that of the unfair gender separated bathrooms and coffee dispensers. This is inadequate because often times throughout the movie, Caroline has to run about half a mile in high heels, just to go use the restroom. Because of this, Caroline's work is often delayed and causes her to be yelled at a few times. This is resolved by Al because he knocked down the \"Colored Women\" restroom sign, and declaring that all women will be allowed to use the white women's restroom. This is seen as shocking by readers because, at the time period, many other companies would have not cared about it. Another scene where racism is taken place is when Caroline is riding the bus, she has to sit in the box. Surrounding her are African American people who are protesting for equal rights. During this scene, Caroline and her children are clearly upset about having to sit in the back of the bus, and they dream of a day where they will be able to sit wherever they want. \nTheodore Melfi directed this movie with almost perfection. The overall message is very moving and is an important message to know today. This movie is great for people of ages 10 and above because the topic is a little harsh for a 9 or below year old, and people who seek the excitement of overcoming racism should watch this movie.",

            "content": "How Stellar!\nMovie Review of Hidden Figures by Ted Melfi\n\nThe movie Hidden Figures represents its name to the fullest, bringing out colors that only select few have. It follows three black women named Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Goble that are employees of NASA. The story is set during the Space Race - a time where America and Russia battled to become the first on the moon -while women at the time were discriminated against. Despite all odds, Mary Jackson and her cohorts solve NASA's problem, calculating the trajectory of the Apollo 11. The movie has many controversial topics such as discrimination and feminism that are illustrated in much detail, and the theme of willpower is seen everywhere throughout the movie.\nSince Hidden Figures was set during the Space Race, there is still much discrimination against \"colored folk\". At the beginning of the movie, a racist police officer stops Mary, Dorothy, and Katherine and asks for their identification. This is a prime example of what the triplet had to go through, especially Dorothy, over the course of the movie. Also, feminism was still around back then, so when the people at NASA doubt the woman's mathematical ability, it is blatantly obvious that men still feel superior to women in all aspects. The movie reflects both of these points wonderfully, and it creates a situation that makes one sit on the edge of their seat.\nHidden Figures is a movie with tough inner struggle, and the theme of willpower is prominent throughout the film. There were several moments where the women could have given up and sought different paths, but instead, they overcame the hardships set before them. In the end, they accomplished their goals, and are honored because of it. Willpower is a strong force, and the movie proves how powerful it can be.\nThe movie Hidden Figures teaches the audience multiple themes such as discrimination, feminism, and willpower. The story is woven in a way that encompasses all three in a fluent, thrilling cinema. They are brought out the way a river flows; strong yet effortlessly showing the audience the reason behind the movie. This movie should be watched by anyone of any age, for it teaches and educates one with ideas that most do not understand fully.\nRating: 4.9/5.0",

The story takes place in Hampton, Virginia, in the year 1961. In this period America was segregated, and blacks didn't have as many privileges as the whites. This movie is centered around Katherine Coleman; one of the three young black main characters. In the movie, the audience sees Katherine's childhood, and her career in Nasa. In the movie, the director does a fantastic job showing all three of the young ladies triumphs and struggles.  Hidden Figures, although historical fiction, has an inspiring plot, satisfactory actors, and amazing themes.\nThe movie opens up, introducing the main character, Katherine Coleman (Taraji P. Henson) as a child waiting in a hallway naming all the shapes in a stain glass window she is looking at. While Kathrine is doing all this, her parents are talking to an official about moving her to a more advanced school for smart people like her. The official wants to move her to 6th grade even though she is only eight years old. Even though her parents are scared they decide to agree and let her take the classes. The next scene goes 35 years into the future when Katherine is older and stuck on the side of the road. This scene is crucial because it introduces two new characters. This scene introduces Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). Hidden Figures tells the true story of three young women who were the brains behind one of the biggest operations in all of NASA. The movie then goes on to show the audience the struggles and success of their careers at Nasa as they race against Russia to get the first person to do one orbit around the earth. The actors do a fantastic job showing the characters emotions, and each actor plays the roles very well in each scene. \nWhile the characters in the movie are strong, the actors behind the characters are stronger. Each of the actors was experienced and have been in other major productions. Each of the actors portrayed their roles very well.  All of the actors are well known in today's society and are still very successful in acting. \nAlthough Hidden Figures has many important themes, racism and inequality are the most important themes seen throughout the film. During the movie, Kathrine experiences many racial injustices. For example in the film Kathrine has to run across the NASA campus to use the bathroom, she has to make her own coffee because no one made coffee in the \"black\" coffee machine. She also experiences many inequalities. For example, during this period girls didn't have many  high ranking positions. And because Katherine had such a high rank in this operation for NASA, during the film, the audience sees her going through inequality. Since this movie is based on a true story, not everything that happens in the film is true. For example, all the racial and inequality the character goes through in the movie didn't happen in real life. Maybe the film producer put these inequalities in to show what was going on in the time period of the film. \nThis movie targets everyone in the ages ten and up. This audience is targeted because people have to understand and know the history behind America. People can't watch the movie without knowing the events that happened during the year of this movie. Although not fully accurate the movie did a great job showing how she contributed to NASA and US history.\nHidden Figures is a well-rounded movie overall. With a satisfactory plot, amazing actors, and important themes, this film does an excellent job telling the story of three women that changed history.  This film allows people to see history from a different perspective. The audience also sees NASA at a different perspective. Although targeting anyone above the age of ten and up this book will open many peoples eyes to see history from a different angle.",

            "content": "Figures No Longer Hidden\nA Movie Review of Hidden Figures written by Margot Lee Shetterly\nHidden Figures, a film written by Margot Lee Shetterly and directed by Theodore Melfi, is a detailed representation of the young lives of former NASA workers Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). The drama shows the viewers what life was like for the three black women working in a \"man's world\" during racist times. In this film, Katherine Johnson grows up a mathematical genius with a bright mind but a slim chance. Because of racism and sexism, Katherine faces challenges of making a living when she cannot find a job where she can work to her full potential. After her talent is noticed, Johnson and her two friends finally get employed at NASA as a computer. In the beginning, she is discriminated and struggles to prove her skill. The film Hidden Figures thoroughly describes the hardships black women had to go through during the 1930's and how they were recognized as heroes. \n    The film exemplifies all the challenges Jones, Vaughan, and Jackson faced through subtle but significant events. For example, when Katherine needs to use the restroom, the racism is so extreme, she needs to walk across town to use the colored restroom because there were no colored restrooms at NASA. This issue was only brought to attention when Johnson's boss questioned why she was gone for so long every day at work. The women of the film constantly struggled with being underestimated. This is evident when Johnson's co-workers thought she was incapable of understanding most of the calculations in one of the documents used to build the rocket. The person who gave her the document blacked out the majority of the page because it was confidential. Johnson proved herself intelligent enough to comprehend the numbers by looking at the blacked out numbers through the light and correcting them, so that the rocket could be corrected. Because of her actions, she earned herself more respect in the office and deemed herself reliable enough to solve issues. This event is an inspirational lesson on how not to give up when doubted, and to keep working hard through challenges. \nUnfortunately, women were still doubted and underestimated during the 1930's. Because of this, Hidden Figures focused deeply on bringing attention to why these women should not have gone unnoticed. The purpose of the film was to make its audience realize how powerful Johnson and her friends were in ways that their co-workers never imagined. Today, the world still partially struggles with sexism and racism, but this could be changed by bringing other historical female-heroes out of the shadows. The title, Hidden Figures, is a clever way to express what the topic of the film was. Figures, as in geometry, apply to this movie because to make the rocket successful, Johnson needed to find out what went wrong in the calculations. Figures, as in important people, pertained to this film because the three heroic women were under the shadows of people who thought they were better than the rest. Therefore, this film brought out figures that were hidden in two significant ways. Hidden Figures efficiently brought attention to three important women of U.S. history. \nThis movie exceptionally shows true heroes through a sweet and detailed story. The way humor and romance were incorporated only made it more interesting. Hidden Figures might be enjoyable to those seeking an inspirational story of the underdogs of the world. This movie can make the audience smile with its witty humor and sentimental storyline. Someone who desires an action-filled film might not want to watch  Hidden Figures.  This movie receives 4/5 stars.",

            "content": "Strengths: It's called Oscar bait for a reason. The performances from the three leads are what drives the movie. Taraji P. Henson (Katherine Goble Johnson) is the strongest of the three and mostly feels like the protagonist. Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughn) is strong and Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) is the surprise standout. The supporting cast is mostly very good, with Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) the best among them. The script allows for several powerful scenes and monologues that really showcase what these women went through and how strong they were. It's uplifting, empowering, and hits all the beats it needs to so we get the desired feeling when it ends. \n\nWeaknesses: I understand how smart these women were, but I think the film goes a bit far in making the men in the movie seem dumb. Jim Parsons' (Paul Stafford) character is a head engineer, but is made to look like a total idiot. The same goes for the IBM guys. There were ways to ensure that the main women looked smart without having everyone else seem incompetent. Several beats were overused. The moments where the women experience racism are crucial, but it gets done so much that it feels redundant. I also felt that Mahershala Ali (Jim Johnson) was underutilized, while Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Mitchell) wasn't very good.\n\nOverall: There's a lot to like about this emotional journey. It just could've been handled much better to make for a better film experience.",

            "content": "these are big shoes to be filled..\n\nHidden Figures\n\nMelfi's adaptation of Shetterly's book fails to grasp the stakes and magnitude of the content that the entire feature orbits around. And it can easily be filtered out from all the running sequences it executes since it could have been a bit more intense than it actually pretends to be. The narration is not only adaptive and gripping but contains layered dialogues that strikes well on your mind that highlights the entire sequence through it. If Henson; the protagonist, fails to live up to the potential of the role offered to her and mind that these are big shoes to be filled, she is blessed with an incredible supporting cast that helps elevate the momentum in each frame. \n\nNo matter how stereotypical Costner's character gets, he still delivers thoroughly and on the other hand Spencer too leaves a long lasting impression through her performance. Although, Monae, Dunst and Parsons are surprisingly not convincing enough to blend in aptly into these numbers along with a bit amateur editing and lazy background score. The theme of the tale is genuinely fascinating as the three lead characters resonates their persona with such impactful notions in the storytelling that you cannot not be moved by it. \n\nThey swoop in as their savior with such subtilty that you are practically wolfish rooting for more and more. And with the conflicts like such and the rivalries that anchors and holds them down, these moments glorify them itself. Melfi is undoubtedly a better writer than the director, his nature to weave out a gripping structure is much more powerful than convincingly projecting one. A tale fragile and powerful as Hidden Figures probably required better methodology and treatment in order to draw out more than a nod from the viewers, but the work that went in here is still plausible enough to explore these figures.",

            "content": "Virginia 1961. The United States and USSR are heavily in the Cold War. Internally, there is still many problems between the 2 main races, white and black, that have left major divisions within the country as not all states have embraced the federal government's treaty to end segregation and persecution. One of these states is the home base of NASA. Segregation is abound and white people seem to be very OK with this, despite it making them look like creepy villains whenever they feel the need to take charge of a situation. The movie follows 3 black women, each as brilliant as the other in different ways. A mathematician, an engineer and a self taught computer wizard, these women are employed by NASA in there computing division. They seem to be treated more as a token division then a hard working, noteworthy division filled with intelligent, talented women that can take NASA to that next level. Once Sputnik is launched into space by the Russians and then they send a man into space for a few orbits, the Americans are basically forced to rush into the space wars or else get left behind. Having exhausted themselves, NASA brings in Katherine Johnson to help troubleshoot the math that the white men she worked under had put together. We watch her slowly earn their respect by running circles around them with her brains both in her equations and problem solving abilities but also in how she is able to manipulate office politics to further her pursuit of being taken more seriously. We also watch the other two women take matters into their own hands as they are constantly berated and belittled by white people seemingly just for fun. Watching Mary Jackson manipulate a judge in order to gain admittance to an all white school so she can obtain an engineering degree that would aide in her quest to be deemed an equal amongst her peers and to be able to help build and design future NASA tech. However, in my opinion, the star of the movie is Octavia Spencer playing Dorothy Vaughan. Seeing this oppressed woman fight back by simply taking initiative is heartwarming and also inspiring. Teaching herself how to use the brand new, state of the art IBM calculating machines, she becomes a necessary asset within the NASA ranks despite never being asked to nor being encouraged to do more then she already was with her duties. We watch her simply do what she wants, with the caveat that she is not being selfish but instead working to better NASA as a whole. Her journey is long and arduous but has a very satisfying conclusion. Based on real events, this movie is amazing and a must see for anyone looking to learn more about events that helped shaped our world.",

            "content": "After watching the diversity film Hidden Figures, I felt that the movie could have been so much more.  Sadly the movie continually bashes white males, making them look slow and stupid, while showing the trio of Hidden Figures as genius unrivaled.  Especially disappointing is the demeaning manner in which IBM computer scientists are treated. Too stupid to even find the right-sized room, set up a mainframe, or program it, in one scene, as the IBM males clumsily stammer about, Dorothy Vaughn walks in and at a glance, finds the problem, a loose wire, which she magically plugs in and solves everything!  Vaughn  is also cast as a genius FORTRAN expert who must do her work after hours because the white male neanderthals won't let her work normal hours.  My white male cousin went to MIT and became an IBM computer research scientist, so I take the portrayal of IBM scientists as defamation of character.  Moreover, it was an IBM research team that developed the FORTRAN language.  Who deserves a Congressional Medal - the team that developed FORTRAN or the Hidden Figure who learned how to use it, like millions of others?\n    In its hate fest against white males, the movie portrays NASA engineers as racists who are all much dumber than the Hidden Figures. In reality, however, Mary Jackson was mentored by a brilliant NASA engineer by the name of Czarnecki who published over 300 scientific papers, to about 26 for Jackson; and many of Jackson's papers were written with Czarnecki.  But the movie ignores the fact that Jackson was helped because it's goal was to demean Czarneki and other white males as essentially Nazis.\n   Speaking of Nazis, the movie also overlooks the fact that a real Nazi, Von Braun, was responsible for getting the U.S. to the moon,  This is an important historical fact for our young people to know, but in the world of diversity, who cares about real history?\n    In the movie Katherine Johnson is cast as a mathematical prodigy who, though more brilliant than her male counterparts, is treated like dirt.  Johnson is from a small town in West Virginia, not far from Bluefield where John Forbes Nash was born in the same time period .  Lets's compare these two mathematical geniuses.  Nash, portrayed by Russel Crowe in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" won the Fields Medal in Mathematics, and  many other prestigious awards for his groundbreaking  work.  However, I haven't found anything comparable for Johnson that thousands of mathematicians haven't accomplished.\n    Oddly enough, Dorothy Vaughn went to school less than 100 miles from John Glenn in Ohio.  Glenn's character shows that Ohioans had a totally different view of Blacks than did Virginians in that time period. Glenn would have been horrified to see that in Virginia, that \"five and dime\" stores had drinking fountains labelled \"Colored People.\"  Yes, the south was a different world than the land of Grant and Sherman.\n    It is so sad that a movie like this would have such a small-minded and hateful outlook (so many outright untruths) against white males, rather than celebrating that opportunities and mentoring  offered to African Americans during the early period of the space race.",

There couldn't be a better time for the U.S. and the world to receive this gift of perseverance and unity in an era of apathy and individualism.  \n\nAnd to top it off, Hidden Figures is just so much fun!  \n\nThis incredible true story follows three African American women mathematicians working for NASA during the space race.  The film is based on Margot Lee Shetterly's nonfiction book of the same title.  Our three heroes played by Taraji P. Henson (Empire), Octavia Spencer (Fruitvale Station) and Janelle Mon\u00e1e (Moonlight) support John Glenn in his historic three-time orbit around the earth by calculating his flight path.  They've been hired as \"human computers\" by Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia in an era long before the use of electronic computers.   \n\nIt's 1961 and computing the calculations for NASA's projects is done by hand and is considered secretarial. Secretarial means that this is a job relegated to women.  Despite their bright minds, our African American heroes are segregated from their counterparts due to Jim Crow laws.  These women were first classified by their gender and then segregated by their race.           \n\nI have a complicated relationship with the issues of racial and gender inequality explored in Hidden Figures.  I am mixed.  I'm so mixed I'm multi-racial.  My dad is black and Puerto Rican.  My mom is white.  This makes me what I call a white-passing WOC - woman of color.  I say white-passing because despite my mixed lineage, the world views and treats me as white because of the light color of my skin.  \n\nI don't have to face the daily hurdles that someone with a dark complexion does.  Were I smart enough to work at NASA and it was currently the 1960s, I may have worked with the \"computers\" rather than the \"colored computers\".  Hidden Figures, although set in another era, reflects the contemporary debates surrounding gender and race.  I wonder, how much has changed?  How do I fit into this current social, cultural dynamic?  \n\nKatherine G. Johnson, played by Taraji P. Henson, graduated high school at 14 and college at 18 summa cum laude.  If you are not already dizzy in love with Taraji P. Henson who plays Cookie in Empire, this is your gateway drug. Her performance perfectly captures the mind boggling smarts and determination of real-life Katherine and hit me right in the heart.  \n\nAs the only computer with a deep knowledge of analytical geometry, Katherine receives an assignment to calculate flight trajectories for upcoming missions.  This new project suddenly makes her the only African American woman on the team.\n\nDue to her new and unusual placement, she's now forced to run half a mile to use the \"colored ladies\" room and is given a small designated coffee pot that no one else will touch.  For me, this was rage-inducing.  Combating that negativity, we are invited to whole-heartedly root and cheer for every late night number crunching session and every mathematical triumph, all underscored by Pharrell Williams' nostalgic and superb soundtrack.  The song \"Runnin\" perfectly punctuated Katherine's high heeled shuffling trips to the bathroom.  \n\nThe Hidden Figures soundtrack which also includes Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Alicia Keys and Mary J. Blige is now my household listening requirement by the way.    \n\nKatherine's two best friends Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) have worship-worthy stories of their own.  Dorothy is lobbying for a title and pay that match the high level of work she is doing while she studies electronic computer programming on the side.  Mary progresses her own journey for advancement via the white-only school system in an attempt to become NASA's first black female engineer.  Hell yes.\n\nThe movie's highlights of strength in the face of adversity were as satisfying and entertaining as the soundtrack.  One particular moment stands out.  Katherine's boss, played by Kevin Costner (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Company Men), clearly doubts her mathematical prowess and begins to ask her to use a certain calculation technique.  She interrupts him with more knowledge than he seems to have expected. \"Orthonormalization algorithm? Yes, sir. I prefer it over Euclidean Coordinates.\"  \n\nDespite having no idea what any of that means, it was so fun to laugh while clapping at Katherine's show of knowledge.  The whole theater erupted.  It was an amazing feeling of common unity and celebration.  A feeling that lasted throughout the entire movie.  \n\nVivian Mitchell, played by Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), works as a supervisor in the white segment of the computers.  While Dorothy does the equivalent job of the black workers, she is given a higher status and paid more.  The tension between Vivian and Katherine highlights the divisive subject of women undermining other women in order to succeed.  The breakdown of oppressed groups that can't, won't or haven't united for equality could fill many libraries.  \n\nBut Hidden Figures is as much about unity as it is about racial and gender divide.  The characters who join together and do not leave others behind were the most successful in this story.  It's a beautiful picture of what we can achieve as people if we look out for more than ourselves.  This is best exemplified in the pivotal moment when Dorothy is finally offered a promotion. She will only accept it if all of her co-workers are able to advance with her.  \n\nDorothy could easily have taken her prize and left all of the others to their own devices but the movie rejects that kind of individualism.  In keeping with the movie's message of strength in community, she has already trained her co-workers in her newly learned computational skills and prepared them for advancement.\n\nHidden Figures' heartfelt message sliced through the complications of inequity and offered a story of empathy and unity. Its bold message declares that working together and caring for others is the only way to glory and success.  This message is heartening to me.  And it's important - now more than ever.  It's important to share ideas of community and compassion through mass mediums like film and Hidden Figures delivers this in delightful spades.  And not only that, it makes math and intellectual pursuit seem like a blast!\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/hidden-figures, and was written by Melissa Balint.

This is not to say that such storytelling is easy work, however. For a teaching moment to be this heartwarming, entertaining, and rousing, it takes a very intelligent design and the true beauty of the film comes down to how the whole production explains a complex problem involving segregation and empowerment with such a single, satisfying solution. This PG-rated drama presents the story of a team of female African-American mathematicians (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae) who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the U.S. space program.  \n\nCertainly, the true events on which Hidden Figures is based didn't unfold so breezily in real life and the actual hidden figures themselves didn't enjoy such a breezy journey. This is a film meant to fuel the soul of all filmgoers, however, especially women and people of color. Its intent is to raise the spirits--not look back in abject anger. This is why their story has been re-purposed as a crowd-pleaser. With a PG rating, it is meant to be accessible. If it encourages action as well, this is only a good thing. But Hidden Figures's main purpose is to inform, honor, and celebrate, which the film does with great dignity and grace. \n\nAdapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi's screenplay provides the perfect template for this successful rendering. The casting only sweetens the pot. Spectacular turns by veterans Henson and Spencer as well as relative newcomer Monae (a breakout role, to be sure) drive the strong narrative. The great supporting performances of Kevin Costner, Jim Parson, and Mahershala Ali likewise deserve mention but this is definitely the ladies' show. As director, Melfi has pulled off a ridiculously impressive feat. Not only does Joan Q. Filmgoer learn about some criminally overlooked figures from American history, but she feels pretty damn good about doing so.\n\nTo Sum It Up: All Plusses, No Minuses",

            "content": "As they probably say in NASA, if you don't reach for the stars, you won't get off the ground. And boy, that is true for movies too!\nHIDDEN FIGURES\nIn the light of the recent Oscar nominations I've started my yearly goal of watching every single full-feature film fiction before the ceremony. The last two years I've been successful at this task and I figure this time it will be no different. To keep you updated in my task, I'll post reviews in almost every film nominated this year, including films I've seen quite a while ago and that I didn't have time to write a review about. Shifting now my attention to the movie in cause, I have to say that, from the movies nominated, this seems like one of the weaker offers. Despite rating Deadpool just a little higher, I'd be quicker to nominate it for Best Picture first (same with Civil War, Silence, Zootopia, etc.). Despite this, I get why this was nominated as it's almost an obligation to the Academy to nominate films that perpetuate anti-racist messages, especially under the new president. You have to understand that a film's right to be nominated for best picture isn't based solely on the quality of it. With a Best Picture nom often comes a lot of visibility to the film and, consequently, to the matter in question. That's why many studios spend some under the table money to get their features nominated, as they know they'll make back that amount and way more. So, there's a social conscience rescuing this movie from falling flat and from being goldless. In fact, this movie's success pivots around the plot and makes me think why haven't I heard this story sooner. It's an excellent story revolving around a smart script that matches it. The performances are all solid but I was expecting them to be better. Octavia Spencer gives one good performance but a quite manageable too, judging from most of her filmography. I find that she didn't quite deserve her nomination and many performers could have had her spot, though it's amusing to see Viola and Spencer nominated again, the former winning this time around. It also has a strong supporting cast, with Jim Parsons, Kevin Kostner and, especially, Kristen Dunst. However, there's something too neat about the film's directing, editing and cinematography. The director doesn't take many chances, he shoots a scene like any other person would and in this case I don't mind it so much, but it leaves edginess to be desired, that extra excitement that should come from watching a movie for the first time. Ultimately, it's a very good movie that would have been better if it hadn't relied so much on its release date and important plot. It's one of those movies that you should see as a citizen of the world, not much as a cinephile.. .",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is the true story of the women behind the space program in 1961. The three women face issues besides the math behind the launch, they face segregation and sexism. This movie was a successful attempt to inspire women and those of color. Trying to encourage them to break through stereotypes and do what you must even if it is difficult. Besides inspiring, this movie wanted to bring the stories of the quiet heroes to light. The director and writers did just that. They showed the struggles these women faced for their country.\nOne way that \"Hidden Figures\" tried to inspire was by inspiring women and young girls to go for a career in math and science. In the movie not only did the three main women have to face and get through the racism that was still present but they had to face sexism that was still just as much of an issue. It was believed that women aren't as smart as men and that they were meant to just raise a family, clean, and cook. Hidden Figures shows girls that a career in such field as math or science is possible and that they can make a difference. Actor Aldis Hodge said \"I love the fact that a lot of these girls are now getting support for their interest.\", though his role in the movie that quite small he still gets to witness the difference this film is making. The screenwriters even snuck a little hint towards inspiring women in these careers into the dialogue. The character Karl Zielinski says \"a person with an engineer's mind should be an engineer.\" this was towards a black female character, Mary Jackson, who was struggling following her dreams.\nIf it wasn't for this movie then the stories of these women probably would be unknown to all. If some people did know of them before the movie that's amazing but it just isn't enough. These women did extraordinary work and made huge breakthroughs in history. Honestly if it wasn't for their hard work and calculations the space launch could have failed or even been delayed. The directors found it important to show what they did to the world using the big screen and by adding slight humor to it. Obviously the movie isn't exactly accurate but it still accomplishing showing the work of these women. Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan are all now recognizable names.\nAlthough this movie added humor and made it a nice family film, the subtle racism and sexism behind are made apparent to adults or older people. When irritated the character Mary Jackson says \"Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line.\" this really shows how much harder they had to work just to do what a white man could have done in half the time it takes the black women. It shows just how strong and brave they are because they still tried and never let anybody stop them. Knowing the struggles they had to go through while just doing their job and trying to help their country makes it even more amazing.\n    This movie is just as important as it is entertaining. The writers accomplished a lot by making it funny and cute while still addressing the problems they faced. Everybody who worked on this movie hopes that it will, inspire, bring the hidden stories to light, and show the struggles these girls had to face. It's important to know these things so we can have an appreciation for the hidden heroes. Which sometimes are the most important ones. Some would say it's the perfect movie, entertaining for all ages, has an important message, and funny.",

And do some research to check some details - love the Internet.\n\nYes, I know the film is not a documentary, I know that there is such a thing as dramatic licence and artistic licence and so forth, but - Holy Fuck - this was not, as advertised, a \"dramatic biopic\"; it was fairytale. The impact was doubled by the hideous dumbing-down of everything. Everything was a caricature. There are no real, 3-D people in this film. There are only goodies and baddies. The goodies are always right, and the baddies are always wrong. In fact, some of the goodies have magical powers and do things that are ridiculous and impossible - sort of the cerebral equivalent of action heroes in a Chuck Norris film, I suppose. There are 2 speaking part baddies who get redemption at the end of the film by seeing the error of their ways and finally behaving nicely. Ta-dah! Redemption level achieved. Lesson learned. Example set. Didn't see that coming, did you?\n\nThe central theme is that both black people (\"coloreds\") and women were treated unequally at the time in the US, and the film lays this on with a trowel. And then a shovel. And then a series of dump trucks. OK, the film-maker is entitled to emphasis his point, and these things were true in many aspects of everyday life, and this would be a fair enough take, except for one important thing. The average viewer would come away thinking that racial segregation was endemic at NASA, which is actually the opposite of the truth. NASA was a federally-mandated equal opportunity employer (one of the first), and in fact, set up by Johnson that way to provide opportunities for education, employment and advancement for blacks. Yes, there was one \"Colored Women's Bathroom\" (left over from the old NACA days), but it wasn't 1/2 a mile away, and the sign wasn't dramatically knocked down with a tyre iron in front of a breathless audience by the head of NASA (or Kevin Costner). As usual, the truth was more prosaic. Its existence was mostly ignored, and the sign was eventually removed with a memo. Apparently this tyre iron scene in the film had US audiences cheering. Cheering. Did they think it was real? Or even remotely likely? \n The logic wouldn't fool a 12 year old.\n\nWhile this film provides, apparently, many uplifting moments, I found it so contrived and false and wrong (unintentionally in many places) that I was alternating between outraged gasps and laughing out loud. I know that this is a common experience for those of us with an interest in history, but there is one difference here: many of the the people who worked there at the time are still around, and they must love that they're all being painted as misogynistic racists.\nMost people don't read books or even articles. The film is what they will think was the truth. That's sad.\nI could list all the distortions, exaggerations, and stupid scientific/factual errors in this film, but that will have to wait until I have a few hours spare.",

Prior to the installation of their first IBM mainframe (depicted in the film), NASA used human \"computers\" to check and double-check calculations; the film follows a group of three of these African American women from the \"coloured computer\" group.  Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine G. Johnson who assisted with advanced calculations for John Glenn's first orbit around the Earth (and subsequently the Apollo 11 mission and flights in the space shuttle era).  Henson's experiences in the all-white NASA offices and engineering labs shown here are, as expected, sometime unpleasant (as when she is snubbed by white colleagues) but sometimes positive (as when she is supported by white colleagues, such as boss Al Harrison, played by Kevin Costner).  Janelle Mon\u00e1e plays Mary Jackson who successfully became NASA's first African American female engineer (after challenging Virginia's segregated school's policy).  Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who became NASA's first African American female supervisor, running the IBM computer lab.  Although their stories are true, they remained largely unheralded until this film (which Johnson was alive to see at age 98) - so it is worth trumpeting their stereotype-breaking successes.  The movie itself sticks to the feel-good playbook, providing a bit of backstory to each of the characters, a little romance for Johnson, showing their lives outside of work, a few ugly incidents (racism), and, of course, some tension before everything falls into place as a result of the hard work of these women. And it's all set to some rousing music (coordinated by Pharrell Williams).  In the end, NASA benefits, the US moves ahead of the Soviets in the space race, and best of all, these women also experience gratifying personal success.  However, this is the Hollywood version of their story, so don't expect anything edgy or challenging.",

Each of their characters were deep enough, all three of them could've each had their own movie, but I really enjoyed the way they linked all three of these stories together. The movie deals a lot with the U.S Space Program in the 60's and the \"Space Race\" with the Russians, and the tension within NASA during that time is definitely well translated into this movie, from the clothing, to the scenery, even down to the accents, it was all perfect. There were some times in this movie where they tried to introduce some side stories into the main plot, which didn't really contribute much to the big picture of the movie, so I feel as though some of those parts could've either gotten more time, or just been scrapped completely in order to make the important parts even better. All in all though, \"Hidden Figures\" is a great movie about empowerment in the 60's, and is definitely worth watching.",

Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\n\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon.

It is a bit surprising that this had not been told prior to this film and the book it is based upon. Given the current tensions we are living through, Hidden Figures is an important film to watch.",

It's very well acted (especially Kevin Costner, who gives one of his better performances in some time). The film explores a piece of history that many of us didn't even know about. It's shot in a bright, cheery style, even though it deals with some heavy handed issues of race and sexism, I also enjoyed the music a lot, which is courtesy of Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams amongst other. The only thing I didn't like, and which has nothing to do with the film making persei, is that, even after all these years, the social stigma around sex and race still exists, especially in the current sociopolitical climate of the United States of Amerca",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) We re introduced to three African American women stranded on the road in 1960 s Virginia. They are  computers  - women who perform computations for NASA s space program. Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) performs computations for the Mercury program. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon e) works as an engineer in the wind tunnels for the Mercury. And Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) acts as a supervisor for the other computing women, all of whom are Black. Goble has been reassigned to work on the trajectories for the upcoming manned-flights of the Mercury program. She is dismissed by the other mathematicians because she is a woman, and a Black woman at that. Among her many challenges is the fact that the restrooms in the facility are segregated. And the only  colored  rest room for women is across the campus. She frequently has to run a half mile to use the ladies  room - taking her work with her.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Meanwhile, Mary diagnoses a problem in the experimental space capsules heat shields, inspiring her to pursue an engineering degree. She convinces a judge to grant her permission to attend night classes at an all-white school. Dorothy learns that a huge new IBM computer will replace her co-workers. She sneaks into the computer room and successfully operates the machine. At the library she is scolded for visiting the whites-only section on computer programming. She teaches herself Fortran and is promoted to supervise the programming department, arranging for her women co-workers to be transferred there.\n\nGREG: There aren t many movies featuring women in technology, let alone women of color. Most of our images of engineers and scientists are of young men (see The Social Network). What is marvelous about this film is that it features three such women. They not only have to face gender stereotypes, but also battle racial divides. The common trope in films dealing with race is that there is a white benefactor who lifts the African American up to where they belong. We see this in such films as The Blind Side, 42, and Race. But in Hidden Figures we re witness to women who deal with their stereotyped roles head on and fend for themselves. It s a refreshing change. I was moved to tears watching Mary stand before a judge and plead her case to be allowed into an all-white community college. I know people who have had to fight for what they have earned. But they deal with a level playing field. Mary has the deck stacked against her. She not only has to change the mind of the white judge who blocks her way into school, but that of her militant husband who believes that violence is the only answer. Hidden Figures delivers three powerful examples of women overcoming prejudice on their own terms.\n\nSCOTT: You re absolutely right, Greg. Hidden Figures shows the shattering of two barriers, gender and race, in the early 1960s. I had never heard this true story of these three remarkable women, and I m ashamed of either myself, or the system in which I was raised that suppressed this story, or both. These three heroes won my heart and earned my deepest respect. Like Jackie Robinson in 42, they knew that breaking barriers required them to take the high road when encountering inevitable prejudice and pushback. Their lives and careers were complex, difficult, way-paving and inspiring to say the least. There may not have been any overt White helpers per se, but one cannot overlook the open-mindedness of people who assisted or supported these women s efforts. Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) deserves kudos in his supervisory role, helping Katherine Goble adjust to her new position and even taking a sledgehammer to the  whites only  restroom sign. The judge who bends an existing exclusionary rule also helps Mary get the education she seeks. There almost have to be people in the majority race who step up to do the right thing in the service of our heroes. Having said that, I agree that this film more than most others we ve seen emphasizes the independent nature of our heroes  quest to break their barriers.\n\nGREG: We see some good mentoring and leadership in Dorothy s character. She recognizes that the world is changing and that computing machines are the next big thing. So she learns the FORTRAN computing language and teaches it to her staff. So, when the machine finally work, and the management is looking for programmers, Dorothy is ready with 30 women trained to go. I liked Hidden Figures very much. I often look for the  seams  in a movie where the structure shows through. But I was so engrossed in the story that the seams fell away. We have three different and connected hero s journeys - and each got ample screen time. The movie is inspirational to women and people of color, but it also shines a bright light on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Women and minorities are often left behind in the STEM world, and I think Hidden Figures will inspire a new generation of engineers. I give Hidden Figures 5 out of 5 Reels. Scott, we often look for transformation in our heroes, but sometimes the heroes transform others instead. Katherine showed that she could do a job as well as any white man. In so doing she changed the culture of NASA to be more inclusive. Dorothy broke barriers by becoming the first black woman to be a supervisor at NASA. And Mary changed the educational system to allow blacks into their community college. In each case the transformation was on society as a whole, rather than in the heroes. I give these three women 5 out of 5 Heroes. It s hard to find good mentors, and Hidden FIgures is no different. Each of these women had to forge onward using their own skills and intelligence. But they did it essentially alone. When you re the first to arrive in the  special world  there often isn t someone there to act as a mentor. We did witness some good mentoring in Dorothy and her team of  computers.  So I can only muster 2 Mentor points. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: All your praise directed at Hidden Figures is right on the mark, Greg. These brave, remarkable women did what society s best heroes do, namely, set out on a journey that will bring them pain and resistance from others, defying social conventions that need defying. This movie deserves strong consideration for Best Picture in 2016. I also give it 5 Reels out of 5. As with other way-pavers and barrier-breakers, these Hidden Figures are both transformed and transforming. We talk about heroes being both the source and the target of transformation in our latest book, Reel Heroes & Villains. These women grow in their courage and resilience, and they have no doubt (and will no doubt) inspire generations of historically oppressed individuals to reach for the stars, both literally and figuratively. I give our heroes 5 Hero points out of 5. There is mentoring going on in this movie but as we ve pointed out, this film emphasizes the fierce independence of these women. Yes, they got help of course, but their success derived mostly from their own innate talent and indomitable spirit. I ll award 3 mentor points out of 5 for the subtle ways that our Hidden Figures received little nudges of help behind the scenes. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

Unbeknown to them, the expertise they require is working locked in a basement of Nasa specifically sealed off from the rest of the staff due to their race.  Once recognised these women still struggle to do their jobs efficiently due to the barriers they face which again are only there because of their race.  Despite this they continue to fight to do their jobs because there are higher things at stake than their own happiness.

It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",

This film shines a light on the inherent inequality of \"separate but equal\".   It focuses on the small things, the day-today logistics of trying to live equally in an unequal world, and is all the more powerful for it.  The characters are fighting systemic racism rather than overt racism, and that battle is even more daunting a fight.  It'll piss you off, for sure.  The acting is outstanding across the board, the story is very well-written, but the directing for me was just ho-hum.  Yeah, it's an amazing story, and one that it is high time was told, but it could have been told with more pizzazz and originality.  If it weren't for its incredible subject, the film itself is pretty standard movie fare.  The writing is the best thing about it - it's well paced and includes a good deal of humor, which is always welcome with such serious subject matter.  Best of all, it is not emotionally manipulative like I expected it to be.  However, even though there is no mustache-twirling evil racist villain, it does fall back on the \"good white people\" and \"bad white people\" characterizations, and even the \"good\" white people are totally-self serving.  I'm sure not everybody in the 60s fell so neatly into one of those two categories.  Regardless, it's shocking to realize that this stuff happened only 50-off years ago.  That's not very long, and we still have a long way to go.",

And speak it does. \n\nWith strong performances across the board, HIdden Figures helps shed some light on a little known story of the Jim Crow era that helped not only to progress the rights of African American women, but changed the world in a big way at a time when the race to space dominated culture and politics. If I am honest, I feel ashamed to say I was not aware of the four women at the heart this film, which I suppose reflects the sentiment of the film's title. But this is why Hidden Figures was so successful with both audiences and critics. It opened my eyes and entertained me while doing it. \n\nWhile all of the performances stand out in their own right, Taraji P. Henson was especially notable. The way she embodies a set of mannerisms foreign to her natural tendencies is a testament to the way she throws herself into her character. It is almost understated but incredibly effectual. She helps ground the scope of the story, which could have gotten lost in the grand picture of space and the promise of the new frontier, in the human element, which in actuality is where the most compelling parts of the story flow out of. As impressive as it is to consider the groundbreaking efforts that led to the first orbits of the earth (and these moments are intense), it is the subtlety of scenes such as having to run across Nasa headquarters just to use a \"colours only\" bathroom sign, or the intimate family portraits that show a husband and wife, children and parents trying to find their way in a segregated landscape that sticks with me in the end.",

Also, it almost feels like the screenwriters might have taken some creative license here. What are the odds that three best friends who carpool together to work all become ground-breaking figures in their respective disciplines? It's like figuring the odds that three children growing up on the same block all grow up to be senators. It's highly unlikely. Two of the women get their big breaks on the same morning. I wanted the writers to put more realism into the script. I am sure they were all great at their jobs, but I felt like I was missing information about the connection between the three women. Precisely how much intersection was there truly between their lives? When did they meet each other? Were they all innately ambitious, or did they influence each other to become ambitious? Or did they simply work in the same location without necessarily being that close? Did they get hired around the same time? I remember some voiceover description about the beginning of their careers, but it wasn't enough to stick with me. How did the carpooling arrangement start? I needed something extra there that was just missing from the story. I feel like, if one of them were to write a memoir, the true story wouldn't be quite as coincidental.",

Sure, it's about civil rights, and it has good strong moral things to say: but here's a film that knows you get farther by enchanting people than lecturing them.  While all of the lead characters participate a little bit in the Strong Black Woman archetype (because the characters ARE strong black women), they're also rich with individuality and human interest.  Caricatures of white prejudice drift through, but truthfully: most of the whites are not \"hateful,\" they're more neglectful.  They don't think about blacks.... until talent, persistence, class, and charm force them to rely on the main characters.  \n\nLoss of a half-star because the math-scenes and inevitable she-discovered-the-formula scenes are lazy and by-rote, but it's forgivable in a film this good.   Should be watched by every American to remind us of why we need each other so very badly, now more than ever before in my lifetime.",

There was a scene where the lead actress (Taraji P. Henson) literally runs in the rain wearing a skirt and heels & carrying some folders of documents and a white man comes across her with an umbrella and he just moves away (showing a hatred to even help). Gut wrenching to imagine how people lived those days in extreme discrimination.\nAwesome performance by Octavia Spencer as well - carries her head throughout the movie. The lead actresses gracefully move throughout the movie with bold & amazing performances.\nThe movie shows the struggles of these women just to even retain their respective jobs and excel at it compared to their white peers (despite having very salaries compared to their white peers).

Having looked up details of the original story, I can't help but find the true story more inspiring than some elements of the feelgood Hollywood movie. For instance while the running to a \"Colored\" bathroom in another building happened, it happened to one of the other three women, and not Johnson...whereas Johnson apparently just used the white restroom for years, when it was eventually questioned, she said deal with it, and it was dropped.  I like the real story so much better than the boss with a heart of gold who changes the rules for her.  She made the change because she didn't take crap. That's better!  But really, the movie brings their story to light, even if years and details are all wrong (as biopics tend to do), as a movie, it is a bit too Hollywood but it is solid...and how often does a major release like this feature three black female leads?  Pretty much never.  Movie is feelgood entertainment, and it praises hard work, science, intelligence, and working towards your goals no matter the obstacles (whether they be getting a man into space, or just advancing your career while not looking like everyone else)...good message, mostly well told, and a solid picture.",

What he is unaware of is that she was having to run a half an hour to the colored bathroom because there wasn't a bathroom \"for her\" in this building. After realizing how outrageous this was, Al Harrison is seen taking a baseball bat to the colored bathroom sign and exclaims \"Here at NASA, we all pee the same color!\" Katherine's drive and remarkable intelligence made her stand out which in turn showed how ridiculous she was being treated on a daily basis. Al Harrison as a person in power was changed because of how valuable Katherine was. This particular scene was iconic and a turning point in the film. Katherine went from being a \"computer\" to someone who was leading the way for the rest of the program. Despite many failed attempts, the women overcome their struggles and celebrate in succeeding their goal. Hidden Figures uses simple charm and a great story to be a crowd-pleaser for all.\u00a0 \n\nUnlike many Hollywood movies, Hidden Figures did not need expensive sets or special-effects, as the story is enough to capture the audience's attention for two hours all on its own.\u00a0 The story lacks originality, using the same underdog rising to triumph story of many films, but the film makes up for it with it's characters' charms and a well-told true story.",

Johnson and her colleagues were vital to the success of NASA's first space mission, but, as African American women, their achievements have not been untold until now.\n\nHidden Figures takes this criminally overlooked chapter in black history and writes it large following this trio of incredible likeable female scientists, who were the brains behind launching the first American astronaut, John Glenn, into space. This inspiring tale of three black women who defied prejudice is carried by stunning performances from its three leading ladies Taraji P Henson, Janelle Mona\u00e9 and Octavia Spencer.\n\nIt's rare that a biopic about an American triumph doesn't centre on the achievements of white men, but this engaging and entertaining feel good movie, where the visionary thinking of space travel contrasts with the backwards mentality of racial segregation, is a sure fire crowd pleaser. It's an amazing story that deserved to be told.",

            "content": "Warm and witty performances by Spencer, Henson and Monae, the stoic moral stature Costner plays and unlikable-until-they're-reasonable turns by Dunst and Parsons make Hidden Figures a winner, a piece of unknown history rendered flesh and blood funny, uplifting and never less than entertaining. As Melfi proved in his previous film, St Vincent, he's good with actors and is a competent storyteller, but he can't resist underlining things that are already obvious. At a time when calls for diverse media dominate the industry, Hidden Figures hedges its bets with a family-friendly commercial solution: warm and fuzzy storytelling that's both progressive and safe. For all of its current touchstones, Hidden Figures feels far too late, both in the recognition these women deserve and the filmmakers' goodhearted but dull approach to their stories. Hidden Figures is an earnest movie, but not a very exciting one. The screenplay feels as engineered as a Gemini rocket launch, with every scene and line carefully calculated. The film aims for the stars but might have gone stratospheric if it cooled its jets ever so slightly. Hidden Figures is engaging, entertaining and enlightening -- but by playing fast and loose with historical fact, it risks blunting some of the story's eye-opening emotional force.\n\nVERDICT: \"In The Zone\" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)",

            "content": "Perfect films don't exist. They never have, and they never will. Though perfect scores are given out nonetheless.\n\nTrue stories (biographies) are my favourite genre. To me, they can get as close to perfection as possible. A well-made biopic has the power to shake us to our very core.\n\nHidden Figures proves this beyond the shadow of a doubt. The story of three African-American women, fighting racism, who, against all odds believe in themselves and make their country proud.\n\nWhile telling their story, the film also tackles the issues of gender inequality and racism. Inequality between men and women in general and apartheid between the whites and colored. It seemed like being a black woman in 19th Century America was the worst life you could possibly have.\n\nThis disparity was clearly seen in general public as well as within their space organization NASA. The film also understands that it wants to tell the story of these three women and not the story of racism in America at period of time. So, it never gets too preachy or deviates itself from the subject matter. Hitting all the right notes along the way.\n\nTaraji P. Henson (as Katherine Johnson), Janelle Mon\u00e1e (as Mary Jackson) and Octavia Spencer (as Dorothy Vaughn) were outstanding. A special mention to Mahershala Alia (Colonel Jim Johnson) and my boy Jim Parsons (Paul Stafford) for their side roles. And Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) who gets some of the best lines.\n\nThe directing, editing, visuals, cinematography & set pieces were on-point.\n\nAs for issues, I think they should have dumbed it down a bit. It gets far too technical and mathematical, diving into analytical geometry and whatnot. Also the film doesn't have much re-watching value to it. I don't see myself watching it alone all by myself again. There are no action scenes or plot twists. Just a simple story told in a passionate way.\n\nMaybe I'm nitpicking here. Gather round with your family and watch this if you can. It is well worth your time. You won't be disappointed.\n\n5/5 Stars.",

Writer-director Theodore Melfi tells the story in broad strokes with no real surprises and the racial dynamic is presented with minimal tension, but it isn't overly inspirational or sentimental. What makes the movie so pleasurable is watching these smart, sassy, confident women use their intelligence to overcome racial prejudice and sexism during the Civil Rights era. Written by Melfi and Allison Schroeder, based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly. With Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali.",

The overlooked advances from individuals forgotten by history can provide a cutting edge perspective into a historical event. As a piece of entertainment, Hidden Figures is entertaining enough. However, the sentimental uplift of this Hallmark greeting card of a movie doesn't scratch beneath the surface to plumb the depths of their experience. I can imagine that these women faced egregious behavior that undermined their human dignity. One would think Langley Research Center would be a place where analysis and intellectual ability was focused on much more than skin color. Apparently not. The screenplay doesn't examine harder. I wish it had delved deeper and examined why. This cursory study is content to present predictable tropes that are de rigueur for any tale of an underdog. These brave women deserve a powerful story, but Hidden Figures never expands beyond a shallow exploration to get to the heart of their struggle. The screenplay by Allison Schroeder and director Theodore Melfi is an inspirational saga of intellect triumphing over racism in a PG-rated tale. Hidden Figures is a feel-good diversion that will hopefully inspire people to study further.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

The writing is witty and engaging. The direction is masterful. The cinematography is exact and painstaking. The only thing wrong with \"Hidden Figures\" is that it took so long for the story that it tells to go mainstream. As a movie, it is about as perfect as it gets. As a biopic, it is actually a needed story that isn't simply retelling something everyone already knows about. As a social commentary, it is more necessary that ever-- it celebrates minority empowerment, science and innovation, human ingenuity and perseverance, and individual excellence. I can't think of a finer set of traits for a motion picture to display today.",

            "content": "\"I plan on being an engineer at NASA, but I can't do that without taking them classes at that all-white high school, and I can't change the color of my skin. So I have no choice, but to be the first, which I can't do without you, sir. Your honor, out of all the cases you gonna hear today, which one is gonna matter hundred years from now? Which one is gonna make you the first?\"\n\nI have only raves about this movie. I have waited a few days to write a review since I watched it mostly because I knew I would write a book if I didn't. This movie touched me in so many ways, and it made me feel like I could touch the moon. Being a woman in the business world, even today there are struggles we face, I couldn't imagine having been an African American woman in the 60's trying to get to the top. From the cast to the movie itself, everything was stellar, and probably the best movie I will see all year.\n\nThe story centers around Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson; three African American women working at NASA, all with dreams of their own. Katherine is an amazing mathematician, Dorothy has dreams of being a supervisor, and Mary wants to be an engineer. Individually, they face seemingly impossible stepping stones in order to get to where they want to be. One by one, they start to see their dreams unfold before their eyes, all while watching the world change around them.\n\nI found myself relating so much to Taraji P. Henson's character so much. With my profound love for math, I know what it feels like to be a woman in a man's world, the story touched me and made me have a different level of respect for this woman. Janelle Monae's character Mary was a driven woman who would do whatever it took to reach her dream. She went before the court and had the most inspiring quote of the whole movie, which is the quote I used at the beginning of my review. We all know Octavia Simpson only plays characters who are as strong and beautiful as she is, her story touched me mostly because she never gave up, and she never let failure or a hard road dampen her dreams. These women are all someone I think we can aspire to be.\n\nThe rest of the cast included Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Glen Powell, and so many more amazing actors. They all give stellar performances. The entire cast couldn't have been chosen better. The film stuck to the original story and the facts very well, which I appreciated. It's always good to enjoy a film, and learn a little bit about history as well. There's just something about a movie that makes you feel good and knowing that it's all true. It gives you hope that the world isn't as bad as you think it is.\n\nI know I didn't go too deep into the story with this one, but its all facts. You can read the book, you can look it up. Just know that this movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you feel good, and it will give you hope. It's a movie you can take the whole family to. I promise you won't regret seeing this, and even if you have to pat $15, its worth it. If for nothing else, the acting is the best you'll see in a film all year.\n\nhttps://lifeofanavidmoviegoer.wordpress.com",

            "content": "With a distinguished cast, an interesting premise and Academy Award recognition, Hidden Figures sounded like a solid story.\n\nHidden Figures is more or less exactly as good as one might expect. It's a film with an intelligible premise and a talented group of actors who make it accessible and dramatic, yet it is very talkative in the process. This is the exact expectation I had going into the film, though it did surprise me in certain areas. I expected that the film would be more dramatic with its civil rights themes, but it actually presented this element very much as a subplot. There is a feeling that the film may play it too safe with its racial issues at times, but it also allows the film to have a more easygoing light atmosphere. Hidden Figures remains focused predominantly on the scientific achievements of its characters in the groundbreaking discoveries that strove toward many space launches for NASA. Because the material doesn't focus too heavily on the race or gender of the characters, the focus is more on the genuine brilliance of the characters rather than the fact that they made these achievements against everyone's expectations. The central three characters face discrimination for race and gender, but rather than going into melodramatic rants that hit audiences over the head with their political messages they take it all on board and keep going. They aren't one-dimensional figures of victimhood, they are strong characters determined not to be held down by an oppressive system. And as a result, the message is far more powerful.\nHidden Figures is a film with some very strong scripting. The characters \nare well-developed enough for audiences to see their personal lives and their professional ones with a proper balance, and it adds a very personal touch to their achievements. And despite a very scientific narrative, the language is coherent enough for most audiences to understand. The science is explained clearly while the more complicated theories are kept brief enough not to isolate audiences. The issue of civil rights is presented in a more subtle fashion as it simply weaves its way into casual bursts of the plot and dialogue to match the normalization of such a prejudice which was common at the time of the story. One flaw in the story is that with three central characters facing similar struggles as African-American there is a feeling that the material could have gone a bit deeper which can be disappointing. But more disappointingly the story struggles to sufficiently keep up with the stories of all three characters which reduces Dorothy Vaughan to being a simple subplot while Mary Jackson  is left as an afterthought. There is obviously a much bigger story in Hidden Figures than Theodore Melfi ends up exploring, but he is nevertheless brilliant in capturing the story of Katherine Goble Johnson. \nHidden Figures rises on the strength of its protagonist. Set in the early 1960's with brilliant scenery, costumes and production design to capture the nostalgia of the time period, Hidden Figures captures a time when racial segregation had become a naturalized part of workplace life. It wasn't an aggressive subject, it was just the unfortunate social norm. But Katherine Goble Johnson proved herself a humble and noble woman with a brilliant mind and took all for the sake of scientific achievement. It's only when the stress of working in such an intense environment coupled with racial and sexist oppression piles on top of her that she reacts in any way. This plays out in a brilliant sequence in which she is condemned by her boss Al Harrison for failing to be present at her work desk at the proper time. While trying to maintain he sophisticated and professional nature, she progressively breaks down as she goes into an intense monologue outlining her sheer frustration with unfair workplace demands, a tedious uniform policy and a the ridiculous rules of racial segregation. This is the most powerful moment in the film, and after it concludes with her anger over having to survive off a pot of coffee which her Caucasian workmates refuse to consume, she returns to work. A the entire room goes silent, Al Harrison walks across the room and peels the label off the pot which assigns it to people of colour. he does it so silently without any struggle, and the ever so slight gesture of peeling off a sticker immediately ends the ridiculous coffee segregation in the workplace. This scene emphasises just how ludicrous racism is and how sometimes the solution can be through a gesture as minor as simply sharing a pot of coffee; it's a resolution which occurs so easily after a climax which has been so affecting on one of the characters, and one who is so essential to the NASA missions. This is the greatest moment in the film, and while it is a powerful credit to the script and direction of the film it is Taraji P. Henson who deserves the most acclaim for empowering it.\nTaraji P. Henson's performance is undoubtably one of the finest of 2016. At the film's beginning she falls into the crowd of struggling African-American women while struggling to assert herself in the workplace environment. But as the material begins to emphasize the importance of Katherine Goble Johnson more and more, she progressively gains a louder voice. The more this happens, the stronger Taraji P.Henson grows as her charisma erupts. The actress brilliantly feeds audiences scientific jargon with a tenacious understanding for all the concepts, and she shares both that and the bare bones of her soul with everyone. We see the full extent of Katherine Goble Johnson's brilliance and the heart within her, and she captures both the love and admiration of audiences. She commands the screen as a powerful presence and the centre of the story, and she justifies this with the greatest performance of her career to date. Taraji P. Henson delivers. Performance worth nothing short of an Academy Award nomination, and her effort is the definitive reason to watch the film.\nOctavia Spencer is a predictably delightful presence. Widely recognized for her rich warm nature and succinct one delivery, Octavia Spencer brings all that to the same story while adding brilliant scientific expertise to the character. She maintains her humble nature and uses it to work her way through the conflict sequences in the story to add gentle humor and drama to it all. Though her character's story has inconsistent development, Octavia Spencer carries it all with sheer charm.\nJanelle Monae is also a strong presence. Though she only entered the field of live-action cinema in the same year as Hidden Figures, she h such a natural charisma to her that you would think she had years of experience. She speaks with such sophisticated passion and beauty that the audience cannot help but feel tantalized by her, and the fact that she breezes through the drama with such a kind-spirited ambition really warms the audience to Mary Jackson even when the story around her doesn't fully grasp the full extent of her powerful story. Janelle Monae is a remarkable addition to the high standard of talent in Hidden Figures.\nKevin Costner also plays a solid role. In one of the best efforts of his recent career resurgence, Kevin Costner portrays Al Harrison, a man so passionate about his work at NASA that his adherence to conservative social norms loses any sensibility. Though he is not the central hero of the story, he maintains a strong attitude throughout the film where his focus always lies on pushing for greater scientific achievements while racist ideals become pushed to the back of his mind. While this reflects the normalization of such abhorrent social norms, it also points out how arbitrary it is in the face of human progress. Kevin Costner perfectly captures the restrained nature of the character with a gentle yet passionately knowledgable line delivery. While the actor is largely known for his rich patriotic energy and larger-than-life heroism, he is far more subtle in Hidden Figures and evokes a strong positive energy as well as powerful chemistry with Taraji P. Henson. Kevin Costner brings nostalgia to Hidden Figures and adds respectability to his resurgent credibility.\nJim Parsons is an interesting presence. It takes some adjusting to see him in a role outside of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory (2007-present), particularly when he's playing another uptight scientist with a conservative nature. But as he tones down the comedic nature and obsessive elements of that popularized his sitcom career, it becomes easier to accept him as Paul Stafford. The man's restrained line delivery and clear understanding of the language in the script really complements the character and makes him an effective presence. \nKirsten Dunst also brings a strong maturity to her role, and Glen Powell's sheer positive energy makes the experience more enjoyable.\n\nHidden Figures is very talkative and may be a little light with some of its subject matter, but it's a powerful tale of human achievement in science and civil rights supports by a brilliant leading performance from Taraji P. Henson",

It was a good watch to watch but nothing more. The story being a true story did touch an important chord. I wish they would have taken that to the present level also and shown how school segregation and job segregation is still practiced in America, in some cases, even lawfully. A disappointment from that angle, really since the movie seemed like a complaint of the past mixed with the outstanding heroics and belief of three strong women without adding anything to the present learnings for the new generation especially in the wake of a divisive President.",

What he is unaware of is that she was having to run a half an hour to the colored bathroom because there wasn't a bathroom \"for her\" in this building. After realizing how outrageous this was, Al Harrison is seen taking a baseball bat to the colored bathroom sign and exclaims \"Here at NASA, we all pee the same color!\" Katherine's drive and remarkable intelligence made her stand out which in turn showed how ridiculous she was being treated on a daily basis. Al Harrison as a person in power was changed because of how valuable Katherine was. This particular scene was iconic and a turning point in the film. Katherine went from being a \"computer\" to someone who was leading the way for the rest of the program. Despite many failed attempts, the women overcome their struggles and celebrate in succeeding their goal. Hidden Figures uses simple charm and a great story to be a crowd-pleaser for all.\u00a0 \n\nUnlike many Hollywood movies, Hidden Figures did not need expensive sets or special-effects, as the story is enough to capture the audience's attention for two hours all on its own.\u00a0 The story lacks originality, using the same underdog rising to triumph story of many films, but the film makes up for it with it's characters' charms and a well-told true story.",

Not since Man Of Steel and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit has he been so charismatic and fully into a role as that of NASA's Al Harrison.  \n- The three leading ladies as the three real former NASA ladies they portrayed: Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan; Taraji P Henson as Katherine G. Johnson, and Janelle Monae (also seen in Moonlight) as Mary Jackson.  Out of the three, Best Supporting Actress nominee Octavia Spencer had the most nuanced performance that felt real and subdued.  Whereas Taraji P Henson's came across as more comic, wonky, and endless \"hit us over the head\" bathroom sprinter Johnson, and Janelle Monae's seem too overly confrontation and ballsy portraying Jackson.\n- Good to see Jim Parsons in a non-characature role which he is believable in.\n- Nice Happy Ever After, heartfelt movie.   Unlike most of the rest of the other 8 Best Picture nominees\n\nThe Not So Good: \n- Completely mis-casted Glen Powell (Scream Queens) as John Glenn.  Too \"comedy\" actor in his physical presence and responses.\n- Henson's Johnson's outburst unleashed to a room  full of white men came across as a little too staged and \"Hollywood.\"  \n- Shot a little too \"pretty\" and in vivid colours (by director Theodore Melfi) a la The Help.\n\nLasting Remarks:\nNothing extraordinary, but a sweet, heartwarming movie about historical African American women working for NASA in the 60's who have to fight against white, male oppression to prove themselves as \"equals.\"",

With a photo of problems, a good soundtrack - even sometimes playing at the wrong time - showing all the pop of the time and a good edition and excellent rhythm, technically \"Stars Beyond Time\" fulfills its role with many resalvas. We do not have any featured acting in the film, all 3 perform their role and have a dramatic charge and comic reliefs the way they have to have, each protagonist has her personality, and her actresses are good at highlighting this, director Theodore Melfi - Que Does not have great works in its filmography - they do well to adapt this incredible story the screens of the cinema. Finally, finally, \"Stars Beyond Time\" fulfills its role by demonstrating how racism was instituted, but nothing more.",

Each actor plays a key antagonist in a film that needed strong antagonists due to their limited screen time. Dunst simply never rises to the occasion and Parsons, well, is so busy trying to not be Big Bang Theory's Sheldon that he just ends up being nobody. Plus, the choice to cast arguably the most famous fictional nerd since Steve Urkel in the role of a scientist shows phenomenally poor judgement because even when Parsons is in the background, he just looks like Sheldon in a suit in the background and you think, \"Hey!

            "content": "A few critics seem to be slagging off Hidden Figures for a \"paint-by-numbers\" plot, I assume because of the gratifying conclusion and lack of considerable obstacles along the way. But criticizing it for the lack of twists and turns is ludicrous: who doesn't want to see these ladies become heroines?\n\nHidden Figures triumphs due to how successfully the main cast's luxe trifecta immortalizes Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan and Katherine Johnson. There's novice Janelle Mon\u00e1e, brimming with attitude, and Octavia Spencer, unsurprisingly great, even if her portrayal of \"Dor\" isn't quite a career high. At the heart of it all, there's the bravura performance of Taraji Henson, elegant, noble and raw. These women are why Hidden Figures functions so seamlessly, serving consistence and passion. Their stories of perseverance and success in segregated America are worth the two hours of runtime, deservedly bringing their efforts and conquests to the forefront, reasons for the immediate lionization of these characters.\n\nStill, I couldn't help but feel this straightforward glorification does a disservice to its characters. Halfway through Hidden Figures, it's obvious that the focus is on their professional lives and work-related achievements. This is expected, but it comes at the expense of ignoring their emotional side; more problematically, it largely glosses over the sociopolitical havoc that contextualizes the entire story. The characters lack the necessary emotional depth and layering to elevate Hidden Figures to celestial altitude; this is particularly flagrant in Dorothy's case. Unsurprisingly, one of the movie's most memorable scenes is Katherine's monologue on her unjust work conditions as a black woman affected by infrastructural and colleague-perpetrated racism.\n\nThe mathematical precision and technical density to Hidden Figures lend it a credibility that is most welcome. But part of their allotted time could have given way to scenes better detailing the social trappings which conditioned these characters. To see them prosper in an era of social injustice is indicative of Hidden Figures' instigative nature, but the lack of greater humanity robs it of classic status.",

            "content": "I'm not surprised at all that there are still untold stories of the early days of the space race and NASA. I'm also not surprised that one of those stories is of the crucial role played by intelligent African American women. Hidden Figures is the story of three of those women: Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) whose work helped send men into space. The film that tells their inspirational and genuinely interesting story is, unfortunately,\u00a0a conventional one. \n\nIn the early 1960's NASA was based in Langley, Virginia; both Virginia and NASA were segregated. Stress and frustration levels are high at NASA as at this point in the space race, the U.S. was routinely surpassed by the Soviet Union. It is in this climate that our three heroines find career and life changing circumstances. Katherine Johnson, a mathematical prodigy, is assigned to the elite (and all white and all male) Space Task Group to create and compute-Johnson's official title is \"computer\"-the calculations for Alan Shepard's spaceflight and John Glen's historic orbit. Mary Jackson is working with engineers to construct the Mercury capsule but needs to further her knowledge of physics to remain with the project. This means she has to seek the permission of a judge to attend classes at a white college. Dorothy Vaughan is the supervisor of the \"colored\" computer division at NASA, all she lacks is the official title and pay. When she discovers that an IBM computer is being delivered that will make her division obsolete she sets about teaching herself and then her staff computer programming. Each has an overwhelming job to accomplish and they have to do so in the face of institutional racism and sexism. \n\nThough this is an ensemble movie, the focus is Henson's character, Katherine Johnson. Her scenes working with the Space Task Group are what keeps the story moving. Kevin Costner plays Al Harrison, head of the Space Task Group, as a stern man of few words whose main concern is results. Jim Parsons plays the lead member of the group whose main concern having Johnson compute his calculations, write up his reports, and expecting her to stay silent and in the background. She, of course, does not and a big dramatic speech ensues. Did such a moment actually happen? Perhaps. Many scenes in Hidden Figures feel simultaneously true and contrived or embellished for the sensibilities of a 21st century audience. These scenes, however, are still satisfying because the racism and prejudice, both casual and direct, these women experienced is so awful and absurd that it feels good to see it confronted. Did Al Harrison really end segregation at NASA by ripping the steel \"colored bathroom\" sign down with a crowbar? I wouldn't be surprised if this scene was more symbolic than factual, but it's very satisfying to see happen. \n\nHidden Figures is directed by Theodore Melfi in a very straightforward, conventional way. It is most concerned with telling a true and inspirational story and making sure the audience leaves the theater with a warm, happy feeling. It does this quite well. There are good performances from the three leads (Octavia Spencer has picked up a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) and the film moves along at a steady pace. Snappy one-liners and Johnson's romance with a Colonel played by Mahershala Ali (who has a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role in Moonlight), take Hidden Figures to the brink of feeling like a made-for-TV movie, but thankfully the cast and the Oscar nominated screenplay by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi keep the movie on track. As a film, Hidden Figures is nothing out of the ordinary, but its story and cast make it enjoyable.",

The tale itself is interesting enough not to warrant any embellishments, but Hollywood seemingly can't resist pumping up what is already a fascinating series of events. It doesn't matter too much however, because the resulting product is great. Terrific performances, smart writing, an upbeat score and tone and a universal message of tolerance and acceptance. It's shocking to believe that there was a time when people were truly so stupid and blatantly ignorant, and that this mindset could have deprived the world of one of its most significant moments, one which, as the film depicts, would have been near-impossible without our protagonists. It might not be entirely true, and twists the truth to hammer it's point in, but it's clever, fun, informative and celebrates those who work behind the scenes, doing all the graft but getting none of the spoils.",

Mathematicians? Inspiring Mathematicians? Well quite frankly yes in a big way. It's also about women seeking equality too reflected in the superb work from the cast - Octavia Spencer quite rightly getting the OSCAR nod. Kirsten Dunst is great in a very subtle performance. The film makers acknowledge THE definitive astronaut movie (The Right Stuff) paying reference to famous scenes rather than recreating - it's therefore perhaps where 'Hidden Figures' falls down. Ed Harris's performance as John Glenn was so good and so memorable that Glen Powell hasn't got a chance. 'The Right Stuff' (of which 'Hidden Figures' is the most perfect companion piece of many candidates) looms over the proceedings so much so that the score (other than the old blues standards) is too contemporary and takes you out of the setting - a minor criticism but a criticism never the less. 'Hidden figures' also falls into the trap of most other '50s throwback films in having the entire world clean and polished right down to the just cleaned Chevys.

The inspiring true story of how three African-American women fought against gender and race discrimination to assist in arguably the greatest human accomplishment of the time, launching astronaut John Glenn into orbit. An event which turned the tide of the space race and united America in it's desire to reach the moon.\n\nThe three women depicted in Hidden Figures begin as 'computers', someone who performs long and often tedious mathematical calculations prior to the invention of electronic computers. They all aspire for greater things but due to the societal hurdle of skin colour find great difficulty in getting acknowledged, let alone respected. Katherine Johnson's talent (Taraji Henson) has incredible mathematic ability, Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) has natural leadership skills and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) is a fantastic engineer. All three actresses are commanding in their roles, which isn't entirely positive as the weaker performances are more noticeable with the weakest of all being Jim Parsons' portrayal of head engineer Paul Stafford. A character whose only purpose in the film is to reinforce the fact that people of colour face discrimination. Melfi must have doubted the audience's ability to denounce racism on its first appearance so decided to make Stafford repeatedly, and to no additional story benefit, belittle Katherine.\n\nParsons' character is not the only story element that if removed would have made the film less forgettable. Another example of this is the needless romantic subplot involving Katherine and Army Officer Jim Johnson. Romance for the sake of romance is usually for one of two reasons, either the scriptwriters needed an extra 15 minutes runtime and got lazy, or the film needed to be more accessible for the general public (to bring in those box office returns). Maharshala Ali (Moonlight) who plays Johnson is a great actor and it is a shame that his talent is wasted in this role. \n\nWhilst there were many scenes showing discrimination against the women of the West Computing wing, and people of colour as a whole, one particular example was overplayed. After Katherine is assigned to the Space Task Group, a collection of the greatest scientific and engineering minds in America, she is constantly on the receiving end of racial prejudice. This occurs to such an extent that they are made to seem villainous to fit with the generic Hollywood narrative: character faces adversity, almost succumbs as a result but is eventually victorious. There is nothing new or original here. Just another underwhelming 'based on a true story' film that seems to hit the cinema screens every few weeks. \n\nIn years to come it will be the films that took risks that will be remembered and sadly Hidden Figures took none. The outcome is an ordinary film about the extraordinary. One that uses the leads to push an agenda rather than treat them like the pioneers they were. Yet another addition to the pile of potential classics.",

I haven't gone into any great research to determine if it is 'loosely' based (much like A Perfect Storm, or Pocahontus) or accurately based (like Schindler's List, or Apollo 13), but I am leaning towards the latter. Not that it should really matter that much, but we all know that once those words (true story) appear on the screen that is the benchmark they are measured against. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about the cast for a moment. Taraji P. Henson. Octavia Spencer. Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1e. Three SUBLIME casting choices. Each of them absolutely owned their characters, and each of them made me both laugh and cry (sometimes, usually, at the same time). They form this unshakeable triumvirate when they share screen time, and when they are separated to show their own individual stories, they ensured that there was no weak sub-plot. No down time. No wishing for what was off-screen. They cast a long shadow, and yet somehow even Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons & Kirsten Dunst found some rays of sunshine to spotlight their talents (KC a little moreso than the other two). There are some undeniable similarities to Apollo 13 too, and the Imitation Game and even October Sky. None of those comparisons are a bad thing in this writer's humble opinion, and if you liked any of those I can guarantee hands down, you will enjoy this film (at least 'almost') as much as I did. But back to the three ladies. I cannot speak highly enough of them. They may not be suffering the same injustices of the past where the real-life women they portrayed were shamelessly judged by the colour of their skin instead of the content of their character, but like their characters they have probably been undervalued for the same reasons. Until now, anyway. This is a moment in time where they have let their actions speak much louder than their words ever could, and it is telling us loud and clear to forget what those who went before us believed. These are not second class citizens, nor are they the weaker sex. These three ladies, like their real-life counterparts, are true heroes. The story we are told simply could not have happened without them. The challenge that Hollywood must accept as its responsibility, is to provide these and other gifted women, enough strong, sassy, smart fictional characters to allow them to prove that they are every bit the equal or better than the white men who dominate our screens. It is the only inevitable conclusion.",

Less than five seconds later Kevin Costner opens it for her, because this is Hollywood.  As unusual as it is to see three black women at the centre of a film that's being marketed towards general audiences, this is still a film that doesn't just overplay collusion across racial lines, but celebrates an absolute cavalcade of middle-aged white men who have the courage to give people who don't look like them a fair chance to be their immediate subordinates rather than their distant subordinates.  Passing mentions of lunch counter sit-ins aside, the film concentrates on white collar discrimination not in context of the wider civil rights movement, but almost to its exclusion.  Henson and Octavia Spencer are fine and nothing more, Janelle Monae isn't an actor and the subtlety she brought to her small role in Moonlight is completely absent here as she hams up every line to the back row.  In fact the only performer who sticks out here is Kirsten Dunst who, in her role as the embodiment of the casual but constant racism of the time, comes across as pretty much the only real person having a real experience.

            "content": "Theodore Melfi gives a film about the space race back in America's 1960s where a large work force at NASA are tasked with getting someone out to space, and back again in one piece. But this isn't the actual focus of the movie and gladly so. It's a true story about the African-American women who were behind some of the vital mathematics and operations of the space program at a time where racial segregation was still a part of normal everyday life. \n\nThe film based on Margot Lee Shetterly's debut novel Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win The Space Race and is central to Katherine Johnson, an incredible physicist and mathematician who specialised in celestial navigation, basically calculating the numbers for jettisoning someone into space, keeping them there and estimating their point of reentry and landing within a pretty unknown field of variables, maths that had not been written yet. \n\nOther characters and friends are Dorothy Vaughn, the first African-American supervisor to manage a team of staff at NASA Virginia site and Mary Jackson, NASA's first black female engineer. So, as you can see it's very much about a time of change, a change in the right direction for civil liberties in America and you can hear breaths of disappointment and shame rippled across the audience as racist slurs and uncomfortable situations occur. \n\nTaraji P. Henson takes the lead as Katherine Johnson and does what I can only image is a great portrayal of the incredible lady as the lady herself, at 98 watched the film and approved of Hanson's performance but humbly couldn't understand why anyone would want to make a film about her! I believe Henson done her proud, but she actually takes a while to get warmed up before she launches herself into an amazing rant, possibly her defining moment. \n\nOctavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e play Dorothy and Mary equally well providing good story filler that helps illustrate the turbulent time. The rest of the supporting cast too, providing excellent performances, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Big Bang Theory's Sheldon, sorry, I mean Jim Parsons. \n\nI loved Melfi's St. Vincent and he does a grand job of keeping a good balanced story that had a danger of being dragged out. It's surprisingly easy-going considering the controversial subject matter with some laugh-out-moments. You should leave the cinema feeling faith in humanity is restored. \n\nThe production on the whole is superb with fitting locations, costumes and makeup. There's a good score from Hans Zimmer which has hints of his piano from Driving Miss Daisy and the vocals from  Rain Man. \n\nIt's a brilliant education and quite the reminder we're still not quite on the moon when it comes to oppression and segregation, and that all this didn't happen that long ago. I actually remember watching Katherine Johnson being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedoom, presented to her by Barack Obama in 2015 but never fully understanding who she is. Well now I do and I'm glad for this film for telling the story. \n\nAs for the Oscars, it deserves the nominations definitely but sadly I don't feel they deserve the wins. Not to say it's bad, far from it but when looking at the other nominees, I can't place any of these in the winning envelope. Still an important lesson, great story and performances. A worthy watch. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 8\nStory: 9\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 7\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n72% 7/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Costner is in great form, with a well written character who does many great things to help break down barriers, without the film resorting to the \"great white hero\" coming in to save the day, as some films have done in the past. \nThe rest of the cast aren't as well written, with Parsons and Dunst spending their time looking awkward and one dimensional in roles written to simply be unsympathetic. \nA fantastic true story, told at time when we need reminding that good things can happen if you push back against inequality and prejudice.",

Hidden Figures will tell you a great story and do it with a sleek sensibility that exudes confidence, but it doesn't break any new ground. It's a thoroughly enjoyable film and it is thought-provoking, so I do encourage seeing it!",

Ordinary \"good people\" who accept the status quo, or intentionally or unintentionally ignore the inequities that exist around them, make up the real strength of racial caste systems - and it is with these forces that these brave women must contend - and in the end, prevail against.\n\nIncredible acting from the entire ensemble, particularly the three leading ladies.

You can tell when you're in one, because they all laugh at the jokes in the Volkswagen or Bacardi ad that's been running for the last two and a half years. Oh, and they applaud at the end.  (I was half expecting them to stand up expecting the National Anthem, but nobody was quite that old.)  But hey, it's a film about women, and black folks getting things their way for a change, and that happens pretty rarely.  And it kind of suggests that by reaching for great dreams like space travel, we grow in ways we cannot have foreseen , and petty earthbound concerns pale into insignificance.  Or at least, I hope it's trying to say that.  \n\nIt IS a feelgood movie, but it's not nauseating.  It is uplifting, but you don't get vertigo.  The period detail is beautiful.  The symbolic toilet run (to the colored ladies loos) I am reliably informed is a complete fiction - but it works dramatically.  Everyone is very good - including Kevin Costner in a crewcut wig. Nobody on either side is too good or too bad to be true, which for a polemical movie is a pretty fine achievement. And for once, Kirsten Dunst is believably cast.  Though what Sheldon Cooper is doing there, playing a hidebound, habit-entrenched conventionally minded maths geek, remains a mystery.",

Needless to say being an African American female was replete with hardships; every small step forward was on the back of sacrifice and suffering. This uplifting true story is a testimonial to the unwavering efforts of three brave women who, through their genius and determination, forged the first steps towards equality at NASA. Writer-director Theodore Melfi has chosen the crowd-pleasing path, opting for a more light-hearted tone that allows the audience to revel in the brilliance of these women rather than getting bogged down in the difficulties that they faced. The tough topics aren't shied away from entirely though, one particularly heart-wrenching scene places the issue of segregation front and centre when mathematical genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to explain that her bathroom breaks are so lengthy due to the building having no 'coloured toilets'. It's not an overly subtle screenplay, the broad strokes of struggle often boiled down to showcase moments like the aforementioned confrontation, but it's delivered with such passion and pluck that it's utterly affecting. A spot on cast helps with the energy too: Henson shines throughout as a widowed mother of three, Octavia Spencer bustles with resolve as the pragmatic Dorothy, Janelle Mon\u00e1e spices it up as sassy engineer Mary, and Kevin Costner brings his All-American charm to a forward-thinking NASA manager. Insightful, moving and entertaining, Hidden Figures is an inspiring tale of achieving one's dreams despite constant adversity.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures tells the untold and overlooked story of three African-American women who were the brains behind many of NASA's operations including the launching of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The film stars Taraji P. Henson (Katherine), Octavia Spencer (Dorothy), Janelle Monae (Mary) and Kevin Costner (Al) in what is a very interesting, engaging, thought provoking and sometimes emotional story that is elevated by each of their performances. The story itself is paced mostly excellently, it takes a little while to get going but once it does it has very well placed uplifting and emotional moments to keep you invested and some good light humour injected throughout. There is also a pretty decent original soundtrack in here produced mainly by Pharrell Williams that gives the film some more character and allows for some math/engineering montage scenes. \n\nThe biggest highlight of this film is undoubtedly the performances, the main trio of Henson, Spencer, and Monae play off each other so well and have so much positive chemistry that you cannot help but love their characters. They deliver in terms of the very subtle humour, and they each perform the dramatic scenes really well. Also what is really cool is that all three of them have that moment, that 'Oscar' moment, that one scene where they dig deep and really show off the strength of their performance still staying strong to their character. The supporting cast here also was surprisingly pretty damn good and contributed to various sections of the film in different ways. Mahershala Ali has a role in this film and although it was a very minimal one his presence on screen is one of class and professionalism and he just elevates every scene. Kevin Costner plays a very interesting love/hate character who develops interestingly over the course of the film. And that's what this film does very well, character development, from start to finish you see how peoples attitudes and opinions have altered and it's a very fulfilling element that is executed greatly here. \n\nOne of my minor concerns (if you want to call it that) going into the film was that Jim Parsons' character was going to come off silly as he's essentially being typecast in this film as a character who has a similar occupation to the one he is most notably known for in 'The Big Bang Theory'. But he was handled really well, and although his character was a bit of a dick, i liked that by half way through the film i forgot that was Sheldon Cooper so very well done. As i mentioned earlier it is a little slow-going leading up to more of the core dramatic NASA operation material. The setting up of characters, and the world building was partly interesting especially when stuff pays off later but overall i would say the last 2/3 of the film is where the majority of the intrigue and enjoyment lies. \n\nSo in the end Hidden Figures is a very thoroughly enjoyable film with entertaining characters, strong performances, a highly engaging story, and a decent soundtrack as a nice little added touch. Theodore Melfi does a good job directing this film and the writing is pretty on point throughout which helped the film a lot. The film is nominated for Best Picture, although it doesn't have the slightest chance of taking home the award, but seeing it up there is very good for women in cinema. \n\n7.6/10",

            "content": "If there is something this year has taught us is that discrimination is sadly, very much alive. We live in an era where discrimination, an issue we thought was a thing of the past and long forgotten, is an every day reality. It is not about paying more attention to one race or ethnicity, but about having exactly the same opportunities. We are all people, and we are all equal. Hidden Figures reminds us of this very basic and obvious principle, while also delivering one of the most women empowering stories to date. \n\nKatherine Goble, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughen work for the West Area Computers, a segregated division at the NASA Langley Research Center. As a brilliant mathematician, an aspiring engineer, and a visionary supervisor, they achieve the impossible and become the hidden brains behind the launch of the first U.S. astronaut into orbit. However, there is much more to their untold story. As three African-American women in the 1960s, they have to do more than use their brilliant minds, they have to fight against the nonstop discrimination and huge gender gaps from the time.\n\nHidden Figures is not a ground-breaking movie, it has a story we have seen multiple times before. However, beautiful acting by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae, transform this movie into more than just a story, a statement. Their amazing portrayal of such complex characters, along with the light touch of director Theodore Melfi, makes the story much more meaningful. The drama does not get out of control and the movie slowly builds up to every single one of the great scenes that it offers. \n\nToday's society is in urgent need of more films like this. It is a story we have seen before, told from a different point of view, with the sole purpose of telling a good story. It will hopefully serve as inspiration to everyone that sees it, that there is nothing unusual or wrong about the gender or the color of the skin. Hidden Figures is more than your usual history lesson, it is a reminder to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes as our ancestors.",

Even though he's a fantastic actor, his bit felt unneeded). The story was not handled that expertly because all the time it felt as if the director, the music person, the screenwriter wanted to tell you how to feel and react at certain points (e.g. this is the LOVE STORY PART, this is the TENSION BETWEEN WORKERS PART, this is the UPLIFTING PART, this is the CUTESY COMICAL PART, etc.). This heavy handed approach to tone and mood robbed its excellent actors from having more dramatic impact. It needed a serious dose of subtly and ambiguity",

            "content": "Watching Hidden Figures through the first twenty-five minutes will tell you all you need to know about why it won Strongest Cast at the SAG Awards. The film is filled with extremely powerful moments that carried the movie at times. You can't pull that off or come close without a quality cast.\n\nOne scene in particular occurs between Taraji P. Henson (playing the role of math genius Katherine Johnson) and Kevin Costner (as Al Harrison). Without ruining the film for future viewers, it's a scene where Katherine has had enough of EVERYTHING and she finally decides to let the world have it. Henson's emotion behind her strong performance really has a way of stirring something up in the audience. That scene was a pivotal moment in the film and it wouldn't have been nearly as effective without the acting of Henson and Costner.\n\nKatherine is one of the three women powering this film along with Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer) and the smart and sassy Mary Jackson played by Janelle Monae. Unbeknownst to me before viewing the movie, these three women were crucial to the launching of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. Hidden Figures is the story of these three womens' struggle to make a difference during an era where being black and being a woman meant two strikes in the at-bat of life.\n\nWho are we kidding, though? Fifty-five years later and that's still the case.\n\nWhile I didn't live in the '60's (nor would I have wanted to), I feel like Hidden Figures excelled at capturing the essence of the era. I'm not just referring to the style of dress, the cars, and the buildings although all of that set the stage as well. Rather I'm speaking to all of the issues that were going on at the time with race and segregation. In one scene, Dorothy is walking down the street with her children while a segregation protest is happening right across that same street. It's a race for equality and unity and everyone is doing their part. While the three main characters aren't on the front lines of the protests, they are fighting in their own way for blacks and women by not only doing their jobs to the best of their ability, but doing them better than everyone else.\n\nWhile the movie brings the serious issues of race and inequality to the forefront, there are plenty of funny moments that enhance its entertainment value. My one minute gripe that I have with all movies that are based on a true story: You know how the story ends. The lack of mystery does little to detract from the overall effectiveness of the film, though.\n\nOn a final note, I was really impressed by the performance of Janelle Monae. I love her music, but we all know that being an incredible singer doesn't always translate to acting on the big screen. I definitely hope to see her in more roles in the future.\n\nHidden Figures is a must-see movie for 2017. I give it an 86.",

Which is untrue and unfair, when you look at their overall contribution to the space race.\n\nThough it has to be said some more naive viewers of this film may be led to believe that three black women single-handedly  were responsible for America sending the first man to the moon. When in reality hundreds of men and women of all races in NASA were crucial to that achievement. The fact that the black women involved got no recognition at all at the time, makes the movie's skewed emphasis understandable.\n\nWell worth watching and not preachy in any way.",

Taking place at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia (Tidewater VA! The 757! Woot woot!!!), Figures takes its time in telling the story of each woman - their experiences, the discrimination they faced, and what they contributed to the program.  I don't know if it's as good of a performance-based smash as many claim, but it's a damn good movie and it covers a topic that more people need to learn.  Taraji P. Henson plays the protagonist, Katherine Goble Johnson with enough subtlety and quiet intellect that it's hard not to see why the film is built around her.  She has great interplay with her coworkers, billed by Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer, her boss (an underplayed Kevin Costner), and her snarky nemesis (Jim Parsons).  I have to confess I'm often irritated with Spencer's roles as they usually end up being the same stereotype in every movie she's shoved in, but this was not the case in Hidden Figures and she adds as much to the picture as her real life counterpart added to the Space program.  It's a straightforward drama, light on melodramatics, and with a good dose of humor to make it enjoyable.  I recommend it alright.  People under 50 barely know the Mercury Program existed, let alone that three African-American female mathematicians/physicists/engineers helped get it off the ground and back home safe.  Watch it with a friend and help get NASA back in space afterwards, because umm...we kind of need it right now.",

Dorthy Vaughn is depicted as being passed over for a supervisory position until 1961 whereas in reality she became the first black supervisor at NASA in 1948.

The entire time they dealt with racism inside NASA, until the boss decides enough is enough and changes the course of history at NASA and the world. All the while the pressure is on to get John Glenn into orbit safely or lose out to the Russians. A good combination of history mixed with suspense to keep you glued to the screen.

What I loved about it, was that it showed not only racism in its subtle ways, but also those who were white and moved against racism and discrimination. It's often overlooked those who have supported others to obtain equality whether by race, religion or sex and I believe this movie touched on it very well. Taraji Henson and Octavia Spencer were fantastic in their portrayal of real life game changers and I was very please with Kevin Costner's role.

Their incredible story deserves to be told as an inspirational message of intuitiveness and perseverance, one that will touch women, minorities & anyone else with a soul. If only the filmmakers were as courageous and smart as these trailblazing women. Hidden Figures gets by solely on its being based in reality; otherwise, it's predictable biopic filmmaking with no faith in its story or audience to connect without pandering.\nIt's far from a complete disaster. It presents some interesting parallels between science and racial inequality, specifically how progress in each can look one way in the numbers & facts but then a completely different way in action. The performances are good, with Monae and Ali specifically standing out, continuing their breakout years after their gentle turns in (the much superior) Moonlight. Individual scenes work in a vacuum, specifically a particularly sweet engagement dinner. Unfortunately, it's all covered in unbearably corny, Blindside-like dialogue and on-the-nose emotional beats.\nAbove all, the music is incessant and awful. A manipulative hodge-podge of modern pop, classic soul, and generically emotional scoring, it's begging us to find the film charming. At times it is, like a late 20th-century Oscar nominee. Mostly though, its pandering emotions and generic filmmaking can't allow it to soar to the heights it should.  Hidden Figures isn't a \"bad\" film; it's just a blas\u00e9 film about a decidedly un-blas\u00e9 story.",

            "content": "\"Here at NASA we all pee the same color.\"- Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This film although quite light hearted with a comical touch here and there, has mainly emphasized on the reality of the black community during the 1960's. Especially the segregated toilets for colored and white people. The film showed only few of the many racism and discrimination to black people back then. As well as showing the constant fight for freedom and equality during those years. And amidst the struggle, three strong and highly intelligent black women have come not only to work at NASA at the \"colored computer\" department. But to help America make history on space exploration. These women were the best mathematicians of their time and were even more accurate than the newly introduced IBM computers then. They calculated by hand and used different methods including the ancient math theories in solving the formula to help get the astronauts into space and back to Earth safely.\n\nThe film has an amazing story telling, well directed and flowed quite naturally with three great subplots. The beginning scene where Johnson (Taraji Henson) was first introduced as a child prodigy with advanced mathematical skills then grew up to be a NASA employee who then became friends with Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). I liked how director, Theodore Melfi introduced the three women when their car broke down on their way to work one day. It seemed like right there and then their distinct personalities were already established even just at the start of the film. And from there you can see how the three of them evolved and how their stories unfold. You will see how they managed to make themselves who they are now despite the discrimination and the limitations they had to go through every day as a black woman then.\n\nFor Vaughan who was the leader and the strongest among them three, she made history by becoming the first African-American Supervisor who is proficient in coding languages such as FORTRAN. She was an epitome of outstanding leadership, leading a team of black women in the computing department as well as other departments in NASA during those times. Her story is truly inspiring and encouraging to all women of color. Johnson, being the most intelligent but timid among them was the main person who made ground breaking calculations for the first space flight, launch window for Mercury Mission and trajectory for Apollo 11 and more. She is still alive and has received Medal of Freedom last 2015. Lastly, Jackson who was portrayed as the funniest and spunkiest of them was the first black female engineer. During her time as an engineer at NASA, she worked in several divisions: the Compressibility Research Division, Full-Scale Research Division, High-Speed Aerodynamics Division, and the Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division. Talk about beating the odds, right? \n\nThe casting was spot on with Kevin Costner's great comeback role as Al Harrison, Johnson's boss at NASA. He played the role very well as a tough on the outside but soft on the inside kind of guy. The rest of the cast like,  Kirsten Dunst who played as Mrs. Mitchell, was such an amazing supporting actress. She played such an important role in the story as someone who was initially seen as a bad person but then turns out to have goodness inside and becomes a symbol for change. Dunst was outstanding as a supporting actress in this film.\n\nThis movie is definitely for everyone and most especially to the African-American community for this story is everything to them. It is part of their history and not many films like this have made such great impact on the current generation until now. An awe inspiring and remarkable stories of women of color making history not only to their country but to the world.\n\nNot to mention the film's technical achievements such as the cinematography, which was stunning. The costume and makeup was brilliant with all the retro colors and styles, it was as if I was in 1960. The production was incredible, as well as the nice perky soundtracks written mainly by Pharell Williams. This film is definitely another contender for one of the best films this 2017. Not to be missed!",

Not something they delve too much into in our history books. I can personally attest to this like many others. So it is truly a tale worth being told. It has been a regular go-to for Hollywood in recent years. More so than the years prior. Hollywood producers look to the history books and pan the pages in hopes of finding some of the also \"hidden\" gems of our past to push off and hope they get their due as legitimate silver-screen portrayals. In this recent pull from the past, \"Hidden Figures\" focuses on a trio of African American women who played apparent central roles in the doings of NASA as the United States was tirelessly competing with Russia to be the first to get a human being into space. Doubly screwed being that they were not only women in 1961, but black on top of it, these women had the ultimate of uphill battles trying to gain ground in a establishment of such prestige during it's ultimate heyday. Pure irony in its own way that they spent endless time trying to put mankind onto a whole new plain while they were also the ones fighting to be simply accepted on the one they were already on. . .\n\nI see that this film is getting a lot of love from critics and crowd alike. And I remain a fan of films celebrating the untold stories, the tales of the underdogs, and bringing forth the legacy of a place in time that needed to be told. That being said, I will still hold true to how I grade a film overall without being swayed by sentiment or current political trend. Black lives do matter, yes. . . Women's rights are a thing to uphold, yes. . .This was a remarkable untold tale of American history regarding our first days of space exploration, yes. . . The film was properly casted and correctly portrayed to the due of their abilities, yes. . . But was this a remarkable film??? The answer is no. . . \n\nIt was sincere and enjoyable, due right. Nothing short of textbook. Characters were top to bottom stereo typed. The initial trio being composed of by primary role Tarij B. Henson (Hustle and Flow) as the mousy hero with a lioness hiding inside ready to prove everyone wrong, musician Janelle Monae filling in for the apparently too expensive Alicia Keys but still pulling off the militant and sassy type Keys would have portrayed, and Oscar winner Octavia Spencer who conveniently resurrects the empowered motherly figure from \"The Help\" that won her the honor in the first place. The comedic relief is in place, the purposefully placed romantic persuasion is inserted for feel good measures, the type-cast white oppressors as well as the do-gooders all play their parts as strategically conspired. The problem with Hidden Figures isn't that it isn't endearing or hinting at levels of entertainment, but it is laid out in a play by play format that lacks artistic integrity. It doesn't take a Spielberg, a Kubrick, or even the efforts of a Ben Affleck of late with an Argo-fuck-yourself kind of script to wow the audiences. The filmmaker and the writer simply have the choice to sit down with something and lay out it like something we have seen before time and again, or put a spin on it. Not to pervert, alter, or change the memory. But to elevate it with imagination and honor it by giving it a lasting impression that audiences will take away and say \"damn\". . . I look for that in a true biopic, and I sadly think that once the nostalgia of \"Hidden Figures\" where's off, it too will sink back into a hiding place where films of its kind go that didn't make that lasting impression to truly stand out as more than just the tale it was trying to tell.\n\nGRADE: B-",

They faced incredible odds, and instead of wallowing in self-pity or claiming victim status, they pressedon't on diligently to achieve. They instilled their work ethic and passion in their children. They were scientists, wives and mothers: the ultimate expression of emancipated feminism. They didn't sacrifice family for career or vice versa; they handled both with dignity, balance and grace. \n\nToday's feminists would do well to take a page from these pioneering sisters. They broke a REAL glass ceiling. They were counter-cultural without being anti-male, anti-family, or hateful in general. These women had to deal with bigotry that made them have to run a half mile to use the restroom. Today's feminist whine that someone else won't pay for their birth control and want tax exemptions for their feminine hygiene products. Sad! \n\nI say this to those women: I'm a single female engineer that attended a university in 1998 that had only been integrated for women less than 10 years before I got there. Stop whining, put your big girl panties on and realize that the world has changed. The only glass ceiling you have to break is the one in your mind. The patriarchy isn't holding you back. You are. And this film showcases the victory in the real battle that was won over 50 years ago.",

            "content": "The story of Hidden Figures maybe a standard level biopic with a predictable outcome but it is a story worth telling. Three women Katherine Johnson, Dorthy Vaughn and Mary Jackson all black women who worked at NASA and were responsible for major events in the 60's for the program. The movie looks at how those women had to not only fight certain bits of segregation at NASA but also the fact that many didn't believe in the capabilities of a woman in the engineering, computing and mathematic departments of the building. In the end they're names have become famous enough that we have a biopic on them today\nThe movie's adapted script is nothing to special but it is well made and shot. Its interesting with all the girls because they knew of the harsh reality they lived in but they still wanted to find a way to perservere and be something. Fantastic lighting and cinematography. Also a great score from Hans zimmer as well as a dope soundtrack from Pharrell. They all capture the spirit and passion that these women had.\nGreat performance from taraji p Henson. she did a fine job of portraying this woman who had massive nerves like anyone getting bumped to the big leagues but in the end she believed in herself and showed NASA what a negro woman could really do in 1961.Janelle monae's  did an excellent job in only her second film role. she got lucky in having the more comedic moments of the film but she also had her share of impactful moments.. an equally great performance from Octavia spencer as well. She plays the ring leader of the trio but just like them she's fighting the same fight and trying to prove what kind of smart black woman she is. Kevin costner's performance is about what you would expect but still very exceptional from one of the more consistant actors of today. \nA decent film Hidden Figures. if you enjoy inspirational stories like these on the big screen this will be the movie for you.",

Played wonderfully by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae, respectively, the film highlights the previously under reported mathematic and engineering accomplishments of the three in a state that still abided by segregation laws (despite Brown vs Board of Education occurring in 1954, the State of Virginia steadfastly remained resistant to integration in the early 1960's when most of this film takes place).\n\nI'm not just saying this because it's politically correct. Hidden Figures is nothing short of DELIGHTFUL and it's been a long time since I liked a non-animated PG movie this much.   Apollo 13 meets Remember The Titans.  As lazy as that interpretation is, it doesn't make it inaccurate.  There were even control center props from Apollo 13 repurposed for the film.   Costarring Mahershala Ali (Moonlight), Glenn Powell (Everybody Wants Some) as hip John Glenn, and the old 60's movie staple of Kevin Costner's buzzcut.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a movie in desperate need of focus. What it's clearly trying to do is recapture the magic of The Help, but it doesn't live up to the standard of that film. I was definitely on board with the premise, and I am glad someone finally tells the story of these women who tore down walls to make a difference in America. The performances of the 3 ladies were wonderful, but Taraji P. Henson gets the bulk of the screen-time. When I say it needed focus I simply mean that the writers seemed to be attempting to make so many different types of film that they struggled to make one great film. If they wanted to do a straight biopic, with personal life details, work details, and all the other stuff that goes into how this woman overcame adversity, then they should have eliminated most of the stuff with Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae. The 3 stories are so isolated from each other that you can't tell all of their full life stories in two hours so instead they concentrate on one, but try to shove in snippets of the others awkwardly.\n\nNow, despite the fact that they go into all those nitty-gritty details with Henson's character, it doesn't feel like they wanted it to be about this one woman's struggle. Instead, this film wanted to be about multiple brilliant African-American women who changed the face of NASA. Because of that they needed to spend more time at NASA, more time with Spencer and Monae, and more time showing how all their contributions affected history. Virtually every scene that isn't at NASA was needless excess that adds nothing to the primary story. We don't need to see their family life, because it did little to impact their work life (and this is all about what they did at NASA, right?) My other struggle was with the mathematical mumbo-jumbo. It was odd because the movie seemed like it couldn't make up its mind how to handle these complex ideas. Sometimes they over-explained what the numbers meant (to the point where they used some back-to-back scenes to reiterate dialogue we already heard.) Then there were other times when they didn't tell us what any of it really meant, because they just wanted us to bask in awe at the fact that it came from this woman no one in that day and age would expect.\n\nHidden Figures is not a bad film, and I don't want to give the impression that I'm ripping it to shreds. I laughed a number of times, I had a few moments that gave me chills, and I cared about the ordeal of the main characters. Of the Best Picture Oscar contenders this is possibly the one that will most appeal to general audiences. It has authentic characters, they face real discrimination that most of us see as wrong, and they rise up high above the expectations of those around them to the point where they are treated as equals. That's the kind of stuff that warms the hearts of viewers. I simply found it lacking in the way it was executed. That's even more disheartening because I see the potential for something truly marvelous. I'd still recommend people check out Hidden Figures because it is telling a story that people need nowadays about rising above prejudice and aspiring to be something greater than society says we can be. Plus these are real women who did amazing things, and they deserve the kind of attention that this film will put on them. Just don't expect a masterwork of cinema, or even something as good as The Help.",

We have had a serious run of these types of movies and this one pretty much fits right in.  This is totally a worthwhile story that needs to be told.  What these very smart women did to break through both the color and gender barriers is unbelievably impressive and I really enjoyed hearing about it.  However, does that make this a really good movie?  I did enjoy the film, but there really isn't much new here or groundbreaking.  This film really reminded me of a film last year McFarland USA (also had Kevin Costner in it  as well).  The two films are put together much the same way, and you feel pretty darn good after watching them.  Hidden Figures is a little better because the quality of acting is better as well.  While I consider this a good and not great film, doesn't make it any less important.  Why hasn't this story been told in our history books along with the rest of the race to get to the moon?  I did feel the movie got repetitive.  All the going back and forth to the bathroom I thought was beating us over the head to drive home the segregation point, especially since that actually didn't happen to that actual  person.  I mean we even got that same type of event at the end of the film too.  I know the film took many liberties with the storyline to drive home the racial inequality of the day, unfortunately it does take away a little of the accomplishments of these three women and those around them who did so much.  Nevertheless, history classes all across America should take a break from school and plan a field trip to go see this film, as they will learn about the space race, racial tensions of the  time, segregation and most importantly what women of all races and color can do.",

The film shows that these women didn't brag or show in a way as to draw attention to themselves and thus their stories have not often been told. Hidden Figures is charming, funny and crowd-pleasing and if it doesn't always dig deep enough in showing racial issues, it at least brings these important women to the forefront. Taraji P. Henson owns the movie with a delightfully quirky underdog performance, while Octavia Spencer is amusing but perhaps playing a bit too close to her typical The Help type to truly stand out, and Janelle Monae is solid in a smaller part. Overall Hidden Figures is necessary, is safe cinema and provides a feel-good experience 2016/17 needed in this tumultuous time. Rating: 79",

It's a little conventional in that sense, and adheres to pretty familiar contours, but the end result is a very satisfying time at the movies.  Across the board, the acting is fantastic.  The central trio of Henson, Mon\u00e1e, and Spencer are a truly winning combo, funny and charming, certainly, but also effortlessly able to impart the keen intelligence their real life counterparts surely had.  They're bolstered (not that they require bolstering) by Costner's very strong supporting performance, which hammers home both the passions and the pressures of putting an American in space.  The movie imparts a vivd picture of the climate of the early 1960s, and tackles not only gender, but race; it does this in ways which hit home but are never preachy or needlessly provocative, and it's ultimately in the service of an inspiring and uplifting story about the space program.  There have been so few movies about the subject, but HIDDEN FIGURES takes its place with APOLLO 13 and THE RIGHT STUFF (and I'd even toss OCTOBER SKY in there to expand the subgenre a bit) as a high quality examination of the ingenuity required to pull off what many thought was impossible.  The film is a celebration of intellect and problem solving, but more than anything else, it's just a tremendously entertaining snapshot of one of the most pivotal eras in American spaceflight and the unheralded women who helped make it possible.",

Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae along with the rest of the supporting cast also do a great job. Attributed to that is also the direction, which is very good by Ted Melfi.

Taraji P. Henson (Empire TV series) stars as Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician who ran numbers for space travel. Henson is joined by Octavia Spencer (The Help, Fruitvale Station) as computer supervisor Dorothy Vaughan and Janelle Monae as engineer Mary Jackson.\n\nFirst of all, Hidden Figures is a very inspiring story about overcoming multiple forms of adversity, and the entirety of the movie has a feel-good vibe. All three leading ladies deliver great performances, especially Octavia Spencer. While tamed to a PG rating, the movie doesn't shy away from tackling the segregation of the times, showing the watered-down harsh realities black women went through in those times. Octavia Spencer summed it all up very well in a bathroom scene. When a woman told her she had no negative feelings about black people, Octavia responded, saying \"I know you probably believe that.\" Powerful stuff throughout.\n\nHidden Figures is great, but I feel like a few things got the Hollywood treatment a little too harshly. I can understand that, as a PG movie, the dialogue had to be tame, but some characters were just so campy that it took away from the experience. Jim Parsons (Big Bang Theory) was typecast HARD here, playing a know-it-all scientist. Over 3/4 of the way through the movie, they were still beating the themes of racial equality over the audience's heads as if we didn't get it yet. Finally, there were a few too many sequences of people running from room to room that could have been cut out entirely to shorted the 2 hour run.\n\nI'm glad I watched Hidden Figures, and I did enjoy the heartwarming tone, but I wish it had just a little bit more of something. If you enjoy movies based on real events, go watch Hidden Figures. The themes can ring true no matter who you are.\n\nFinal grade: B+\n\n-Ben",

The story centers around three remarkable women who directly contributed to the success of John Glenn's orbit around the earth & safe re-entry. Set in the 60's, amidst a culture rife with sexism, racism & segregation, Hidden Figures stars Tarji P. Henson of TV's Empire as Katherine Goble Johnson, an extremely gifted mathematician who works at NASA with her fellow co-workers & friends, Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), an aspiring engineer & Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), a fellow mathematician & acting supervisor of a group of African-American women know as \"computers.\". The three women work out of  West Area Computers division of Langley Research Center. Each woman is keenly aware that her skills are being underused & aspires for the same recognition & opportunities as their white counterparts. When Kathrine is brought into the Space Task Group headed by STG director Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) as new \"computer\", she is assigned to check the numbers of her white male colleagues including head engineer supervisor Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory) who doesn't feel that a woman, much less a colored woman should be there. Hidden Figures is based on the novel of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly. Director Theodore Melfi & co-screenwriter Allison Schroeder have presented inspiring, moving & light-hearted story of race, equity & empowerment during a time period where it was difficult for people of color & women of all color to have the same rights as white males. The cast also features Kirsten Dunst as head supervisor Vivian Mitchell & Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. The performances from the cast were splendid. Taraji P. Henson gives one of her best performances since Hustle & Flow which also featured her Empire costar Terrence Howard. Even though Hidden Figures is the story of three women, it is more about Katherine Goble Johnson & how she was able to solve the equation that would change history forever. Hidden Figures is the first MUST-SEE FILM of 2017.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" explores three themes that resonate well with modern audiences: Racial equality, women's rights, and gender equality in the workplace.  It is no surprise that this film has received rave reviews but I like to think that its warm reception is a result of the solid execution of a true story, not just because of its statements on race and gender.  The story of Katherine Goble Johnson is nothing less than miraculous and is sure to inspire you.  The film sets the scene with the prodigious math skills of a young elementary student.  Her hopeful future is quickly blended with the challenges of racism and gender discrimination in 1960's Virginia.  The trio of leading ladies, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e have the perfect combination of spunk and poise to take on these challenges and each win their own individual battle.  It is easy to see an Oscar nomination coming to one or more of them during tomorrow morning's announcement.  The underrated performance in this film comes from Kevin Costner as the director of the Space Task Group.  His role in breaking down the barriers of segregation drives the plot just as much as the female leads.  The cast also includes Kirsten Dunst (who I barely even recognized after several years since her last role in a blockbuster), Jim Parsons (who provides the necessary levity in this otherwise harsh environment), and Mahershala Ali (who I love in \"House of Cards\" but left me unimpressed, especially in an Oscar season that has him as a frontrunner for Best Supporting Actor in \"Moonlight\").  While the film is dominated by the aforementioned themes, I was quite taken by its portrayal of technology replacing human jobs.  I'm sure that everyone else had the same epiphany when they realized that \"computers\" were initially referencing the human workers who compute numbers and then later referred to the machines that can now do that work.  \"Hidden Figures\" successfully tackles several issues related to racism and gender equality, but I love it for its impressive acting, well-written script, and success in transporting us back to this often untold moment in US history.  Oh yeah, and of course for the incredibly clever double meaning of its title!",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a much needed telling of a little known story with a fantastic cast and toe tappin' music. It's so different and so much fun you can walk out with a great feeling despite all the oh-so-cheesy script and dialogue. \n\nFirst good things:\n- Acting is really great, every is wonderfully cast\n- Music is the best, Pharell knocked it outta the park\n- Some scenes give you that warm feeling\n- The story is just plain awesome\n\nNow. I need to say that I really like this movie and please keep that in mind when reading the criticism below.\n\nBad things:\n- Dialogus is corny\n- Too much spectacle\n- Men are idiots\n- White characters become very humble if you insult/confront them\n\nDialogue is corny:\nYes, the basic story is good (it's decently faithful to what happened) but the dialogue is just plain awful. Every scene with children or husbands are hard to take seriously. Black women in 1962 in a white male dominated industry can apparently say anything with no repercussions. It felt like the three leads where modern women from 2017 that were transported back to the early sixties to teach people not to be racist or sexist and by the end of the movie everyone is living in 2017 again. Mahershala Ali plays a colonel in this movie and after being admonished for a sexist comment becomes \"woke\" and spends the rest of the movie catering to the woman he's trying to woo.  \n\nToo much spectacle:\n I understand that every oscar-bait film needs to have a few oscar moments but this film had around 35 attempts at show stoppers. I think that's because the writers knew they were writing an important film but they wanted to make sure we knew it was an IMPORTANT film. For example, Katherine, the main lead, gives an impassioned speech about her struggles but of course it had to be in front of her boss and 30 white engineers and she definitely had to be soaking wet from rain and of course she had to slip in a \"...so excuuuuuuse me...\" in her speech right before storming out. And if that wasn't enough, this is followed by her boss being so moved he smashed the \"colored\" washroom sign with a sledge hammer. Yes, Keven Costner ending racism with a sledge hammer was another hidden fact of history they didn't teach in schools.\n\nMen are Idiots:\nExcept for Kevin Costner, all the men in this film are useless. From the \"woke\" colonel to the bumbling IBM guys. This is lazy writing. You don't need to make the best and brightest at NASA and IBM look like a bunch of idiots in order to make the protagonists look awesome. the real women were awesome and in interviews you can see how grounded and humble they were. In the movie they said again and again, \"you're smarter than all of them\". Well duh, they are idiots apparently.\n\nConfrontation = Humility\nOver and over again in this film, black characters have confrontations with white characters. Some of those confrontations are very challenging or insulting (rightly so) for unfair treatment. the problem is that all the white characters respond with humility and grace. In fact there is one character that is seems irredeemable throughout the whole film until the very end when they are suddenly not racist anymore off screen.\n\n\nSo the film has lots of script and dialogue problems, but it is definitely worth a watch just to see some awesome women kicking ass.",

Being both black and women, these three brilliant scientists feel less threatened by Russian rocket attacks than by a white male-dominated society.\n\nGiven the current throwbacks we are facing in the domain of social justice, \"Hidden Figures\" could have become an important part of an ongoing conversation. However, its shallow and all-to-predictable realization lacks any serious critical stance.\n\nBeyond a beautiful mise-en-scene with great love for detail as far as costumes and decor are concerned, esthetics play such a role that it disrupts the story's authenticity. The characters are often filmed in shallow focus, as if Melfi wanted us to forget the unpleasant aspects of their livelihoods. Every emotional moment of the film is drowned in its overly dramatic orchestra music, thus depriving the spectators of moments of true empathy.\n \nTaraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer incarnate Johnson and Vaughan as tame, well-composed ladies who endure their suffering silently most of the time. Contrarily, Janelle Monae's Mary Jackson is a girl who has all it takes - the looks, the brains, and the attitude - to win over everyone standing between her and her career. It is all too smooth, too light to be taken seriously: even Katherine's humiliating daily race to the restroom for colored ladies nearest to her workplace - half a mile away at the other end of the precinct - turns into a humorous slapstick piece accompanied by a cheery Pharrell Williams-song.\n\nBut not the actresses are to blame; it is the screenplay that leaves the characters no room for rebellion: whatever frustration they air, they are almost immediately rewarded with a solution - in the end, \"Hidden Figures\" is a seemingly endless encounter with helpful policemen, bosses (Kevin Kostner), judges and husbands.\n\nIn the end, we are happily untouched. If you want an entertaining way of informing yourselves on the lives of these three remarkable women, \"Hidden Figures\" is right for you. If you are out for an eye-opener in the realms of feminist and anti-discriminatory debate - keep on looking.",

Yes it has Oscar bait written all over it, and yes some of the issues being discussed here may at times feel like yes we have heard or seen it before, but despite all that, director Theodore Melfi manages to deliver an inspiring movie. Its about three African-American women who helped NASA with their first successful space mission, while simultaneously fighting the racism that gets pit in front of them every time they are about to achieve something. And how they overcome it is where the movie wins. It is a predictable, yet compelling story that is told well. And the seriously complicated math they are doing in this movie just went whop - over my head, but it didn't affect the impact it is trying to create. Of the three ladies Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer stand out and deliver performances that could end up getting them both supporting actress nominations.\u00a0",

Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e (who is also stunningly beautiful), and Octavia Spencer are standouts as the compelling leads in this story about smart black women working at NASA during the early years of America's space program, centered around the Mercury program and especially the flight of John Glenn's Friendship 7. Kevin Costner is also good as a composite character but then, nobody is better at playing Kevin Costner than Kevin Costner. In terms of films about the American space program, Hidden Figures is the equal of Apollo 13 (1995), which did not receive enough awards at the time IMO. I'm eagerly looking forward to reading the book upon which this film is based. I fully expect Hollywood to overlook Hidden Figures when it comes to handing out Oscars, which tells you everything you need to know about Hollywood. Mark's Grade: A",

It's held down by that innate darkness, but it's a film about overcoming those odds and difficulties in order to prove your self-worth. There are a couple moments where it does feel like it's hammering in its messages too hard, but for the most part, Hidden Figures allows the reality of what it's telling to send its own message, rather than forcing a message down the audience's throat. And that absolutely works best for this movie. Director Theodore Melfi does a great job making this film, and balancing all those different elements of the story. It works to elevate characters, while at the same time understanding the bigger picture of not just what these events meant for African Americans and the Glass Ceiling, but also for space research and exploration. It's an incredibly balanced film at Melfi's hands...\n\nYou can read our full review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2017/01/hidden-figures-spoiler-free-review.html",

            "content": "Come together.  Based on true events, this focuses on a trio of African-American women who work for NASA in the 1960's.  This was in the thick of Jim Crow segregation laws, and this is about how these overqualified women put in hard work in the face of adversity to achieve something monumental.  Now there are many movies that are similar to this film that tackle race issues, and I don't always go for them; I famously think The Help is overrated with all of the praise it received, and The Butler was okay, but mostly forgettable.  Hidden Figures is something much better, and this movie is something I can all but guarantee that you will walk away feeling positive about.  Now I don't think that this has all that much directorial flair to it, but I don't think that it would be appropriate if it did feature that.  The focus is always 100% on the story and on the ladies, and if it had been anything but just standard direction, it would have detracted from the narratives being told.  Besides, what is lost in style is more than made up for in pacing; this movie is over two hours long, and you do not feel the length at all, and you're always excited to see what happens next.  It is all tied together with some original music from Pharrell; it's not 60's music, but it appropriately matches the tone of the film and it never feels out of place.  It's also never obtrusive, but it did make me want to add all of the music to a Spotify playlist.  All of these stories are engaging, and all the lead actresses turn in good work, but it is Taraji P. Henson that is the standout, which is appropriate, because she has the biggest focus.  You get small glimpses into all of their personal lives, but you really want to see the next thing that is going to happen in what is NASA's equivalent to a war room.  In addition to that, Kevin Costner does really well as the no nonsense boss; I don't always like him in everything (see: Criminal, a movie that will be scrubbed off of everybody's brain by the end of next year), but I usually like him when he is turning in performances like this one.  Hidden Figures is uplifting and sentimental, and if I am being honest with myself, I ended up liking it more than I thought that I would.  In fact, the only criticism that I have for this is small: I feel that the characters that Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons are playing are a bit one-dimensional.  They are really only here to serve as obstacles, and while they are certainly just that, they ended up coming off as slightly cartoonish when compared to the much more fleshed out lead characters.  Hidden Figures tackles a serious subject matter, but it still manages to keep a sense of humor about itself so that it never gets dreary.  It raises its points, but never at the sacrifice of the narrative, and you will walk away from this movie feeling great.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" is the movie that deserves to win that Best Picture Oscar, just because it says such an amazing story. Yes, everything is amazing about the story of these three characters! They are women, women of color, and they are the greatest minds their country had to offer. Not only that, they are working in NASA in a time-period when Black was equal with the lesser, and the fact is that if they were white they would have been recognized sooner. \"Hidden Figures\" is a really heartfelt movie, a very important movie,a very exciting movie and a very gripping movie. I was hooked and I really couldn't get enough of this. It moved me and it made me sympathise and feel. But what I love most about this movie is the way it cherished the fact that being different is beautiful, if all of us come together with all our qualities, we achieve greatness. This lies in the core of this movie, and it's all done so realistically, so truthfully, it doesn't try to teach you this, it just shows you how it's really true. The performances were all delightful and the cast is just perfect for this. The only drawback for me is the use of music in the movie. At times it managed to pull me out when I was really sunk into it. But it's really nothing compared to the greatness of the storytelling. Sure some scenes had that phenomenon as well, but in the end it never relly matters. \"Hidden Figures\" is best summed up with the quote \" In NASA we all pee the same color\" and honestly that's what all this movie is about. Not just finding talent where we wouldn't ever think of, nor about how it takes so much effort for us to recognise someone, for me it's a movie about how we need all of us, in all our differences, to achieve greatness! And it does this beautifully! In a parallel universe where the Academy is not that biased about the artistry of \" La La Land\", \"Hidden Figures\" would have won the Best Picture!",

So, for example, the background of how white characters in the film talk about race, how they feel about race, how they teach their children about it - none of this is in the movie, but in the end it doesn't need to be. Far more compelling than \"The Help\" because it shows these African American women, and their community, rising far beyond the limitations, not just dealing with them. It is most gratifying to see that \"Hidden Figures\" has become so popular across the country.",

They're played by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae.\n\tAl Harrison: He's the head of a computing division of NASA.  He's played by Kevin Costner.\n\nPlot Summary\n\tIt is the early 1060s and America is falling behind in the space race to Russia.  There's fear that the Soviets will attack from space.\n\tSo, there's a lot of pressure against NASA to catch up with the Soviets and pass them.  However, the US space program has problems with its equipment and plotting a safe course for the astronauts.\n\tSo NASA gets all the help they can get - even if it is from several black women.  These ladies can do just about anything the guys can do in science.\n\tAnd they can lead very interesting lives indeed.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tI like them a lot.  The ladies are played as almost real life characters with aspirations, family, humor and the work skills to get the job done.  \n\tAnd I really like Al because he's not your typical racist jerk.  He knows he needs these ladies help for him to do his job.  SCORE: 9\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe rest of the cast is good with Jim Parsons giving a more tepid performance as a fellow computer worker at NASA.  SCORE: 8\n\nPlot\n\tThis film was a joy to watch because they toned down the racial tension and showed a lot of good things about the black and white people in NASA dealing with a huge problem.  SCORE: 8\n\nOriginality\n\tThere may have been other films about racial tension back in the 1960s, but this one takes more care in handling the issues than some of those other films.  SCORE: 8\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's not a lot going on here - except for maybe a few harsh words and a few rockets blowing up (Ouch, that's going to cost them.)  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film shows us that men and women of all races can work together to achieve a common goal.  SCORE: 9\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 50\t\t% Score: 83.33%\nThis year is off to a great start.",

Then, when finally offered a position with the IBM, she refuses to go unless all her girls can come with her because they are well-versed in the machine.\nThat is what feminism looks like. The uplifting of women together, not, as white women, taking what we can get for ourselves at the expense of others.\nI would argue too there are minimal white saviour moments in the film, save for Kevin Costner hammering down a sign, which is great. The movie focuses on the characters and lives it should be centred around.\nThis is a great depcition of the seemingly banal microaggressions Black people and specifically Black women endured during that time (and cough still today cough) and what they went through just to get education, get a job, or do more.\nThe films errs on the family friendly/feel-good side of things, which is not necessary bad, just a choice and, since I have not read the book, or been these women at that time, could have been 100% true. It was nice to see a film about Black women that wasn't  coated in a revenge-porn style like so many others. It was like about how much pain and suffering they could endure and more about pushing harder and farther up against discrimination and barriers.\nAll the actors are wonderful, Janelle Monae is fantastic -- another great movie under her belt!",

The history of America is nothing without the recognition of those who made it possible and in \"Hidden Figures\" this same idea is honored with those people that history has left behind and whose importance must be recognized and acclaimed. The story that claims to be real presents a group of three friends and colleagues who, by using their supernal skills in math and physics, they must face the harsh, racist and misogynist reality of the time. These resources are the key bases for making a series of such remarkable messages, but finally they construct a story argued by a so repeated equality speech and aimed at attracting and moving masses. Theodore Melfi manages to approach the time with such a good cast and so precise photography. His work speaks of the struggle of people in equality but falls dramatically into classic Hollywood clich\u00e9s through the use of characters made up of highly standardized characteristics. Even so the film is very well achieved and reaches to embrace the hearts of the audience, and this is so because the story itself is spectacular and too incredible to be true, so no doubt this is what points to that the structure of heroes and heroines is reached due to the well forged path that is plotted in the film and the susceptibilities in the time that border to the empathy and the sentimentality that is intended to relate and that well manages to convey.\nThe story becomes predictable many times but this does not detract from quality because it is possible to enjoy everything that happens on screen and strongly encourages reflection. Patriotism, collective joy and the inherent triumph that the characters obtain, showing even a certain ego in some scenes may discredit the work of Melfi, but at the end, almost everything makes us fall in love with the film, and this is well achieved although it is necessary to recognize what is really happening. Although Octavia Spencer's characters usually insist on creating figures filled with stereotypes, I did not perceive it at this time; in fact her performance is more than satisfactory. Actors in general are outstanding although the script presents severe inconcistencies, but this never affects the closeness of the characters with their roles and the realism that they end up consolidating cleanly. The film may be a drama, but it owns some laughing scenes and dialogues which quickens and harmonizes the plot. Perhaps a documentary about these anecdotes would have better specified the intention of Melfi, the genre to which this story was submitted is still not a mistake in spite of the testimonies which have been modified in multiple occasions to keep the film focused to the goal of entertaining. The work done here was ambitious and although the proposal could have been much better developed, the great effort that was conferred in its realization stands out remarkably. 84/100",

This culminates in Kevin Costner smashing the \"colored restroom\" sign in something so over the top that I couldn't stop myself give an eye roll.  Subtle this film is not.  I also have to wonder how much of this is accurate history and how much is Hollywood changes to increase the celebration of these black women, Katherine Johnson especially.  Hidden Figures would have us think that she got John Glenn up to space single handedly!  And got Glenn to trust her and her alone to run the numbers to get him back to Earth!\n\nStill the film was entertaining enough that I can ignore the flaws and watch the effort to get a man into space with the help of those fighting against the ignorance of their time.

            "content": "History is recounted often by men who have already gained notoriety in their time. Thanks to Margot Lee Shetterly, an almost forgotten footnote in American racial relations set in the Cold War space race has been brought to print and film. While we as a nation continue to struggle with basic tolerance of minorities, it is important to be reminded that human rights were being denied to Blacks to the detriment of our progress as a society and in this case technologically. Much like Kristen Dunst's character in \"Hidden Figures\" many are still oblivious to their own prejudice and privilege. So the importance of the intention of this film cannot and should not be understated. Unfortunately, that is the point at which my praise ends. It's not a bad film and the performances are all fine (except for the Bazinga guy from \"The Big Bang Theory\"). The problem is that for a movie that is predicated on the struggles of Black Americans (and, to a lesser degree, women in general) amidst a society that refuses to desegregate, those struggles are portrayed as inconveniences just so that you don't absolutely detest all of the white characters by the end. There is also the condescending manner in which racism is dealt with in the film. The moral of the story is that if you work harder, follow the rules, and appeal to the empathic side of your oppressors, you can find your worth in a world that treats you as a second class citizen. I'm here to tell you that that is bullshit. Racism is alive and well 70 years later, and regardless of the amazing accomplishments that Katharine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson played integral roles in, their children and grandchildren are still putting up with the same hatred that they did. It just has a different face. So, for all of the feel good moments, kind hearted characters, and uplifting soundtrack swells, one can't help but feel that the movie is only a fantasy. It's an idealistic and inspiring fantasy but nonetheless one that sells the real struggles of these women a bit short.",

So I thought this was good but once again I'm against the majority in thinking this was amazing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this. I love true story movies and learning more History. I thought the actors were all great. Love Kirsten Dunst forever! I first was introduced to Glen Powell in Scream Queens and then he was a part of 1 of my favorite movies of 2016, Everybody Wants Some!! So I'm glad to see he is getting more and more roles. Mahershala Ali was good in here as well. More of a memorable role for me of 2016. But really it was Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae that made this movie. Loved Octavia but I thought Taraji had a wonderful performance and would have liked to see her nominated out of the 3. She really carried the movie. Janelle is one of those rare artist who transitioned beautifully from singer to actor. She was a scene stealer. Loved her so much in the movie. The things that I didn't like were I felt the script was all over the place. Was it trying to be a comedy or a drama? A lot of the dialogue was corny as well. But I did get a couple laughs and some moments were touching. The cinematography was blah. It even did that blurry background thing for no reason that I hate. The score was lovely but when Pharrell would start singing, it would ruin the tone of the scene for me. Sometimes it just wouldn't fit so would pull me out. While I do understand that true story movies are never truly faithful to the real stories they are based on, the changes they made for this I didn't really like. But understand why they did. This was a great idea for a story, I just wish the telling of the story was handled better. I do recommend this, just so people are aware of these women. I might get digitally but I can see this being a movie I won't watch many times over.",

            "content": "Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama \"Hidden Figures\" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority - and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) - in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie - and might be too much for many - but \"Hidden Figures\" is up to the challenge.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers - THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room - and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA - talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand. \n\nDorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture - and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.\n\nAll three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay - and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.\n\nBut most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled \"Colored\" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers - and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart - and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses. \n\n\"Hidden Figures\" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women - until now. Don't let \"Hidden Figures\" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's... out of this world. \"A+\"",

The latter is shown in small and large ways, each effective, whether it is a woman having to run a half a mile to go to the 'colored women's bathroom\" even though she is capable and does help NASA solve many problems to get men in orbit around the world and get them back safely.\n\nTaraji P. Henson is real life Katherine Goble Johnson, a mathematical genius, who knows 'her place' and is insulted not only by words but by actions. She is only one woman of two in an office of a dozen men and she is Black having to put up with some indignities to do a job she loves, wants to keep, but when she reaches a point that she has had enough she is not afraid to open her mouth.\n\nThe other woman in the office, the group's executive assistant played by Kimberly is not welcoming and the head engineer, played by Jim Parsons, first has no respect for Katherine and then disdain only to question the knowledge she gives that is more accurate than his. The only one who doesn't care about her sex or color but her much needed knowledge is her boss Al Harrison, played believably by Kevin Costner.\n\nThere are other people in Katherine's life aside from her 3 children whose husband/father is dead, her mother and, about half way through, a very romantic army officer Mahershala Ali but two others, her best friends, also faces racism because of being Black, though very smart accomplished women. Dorothy Vaughan, played by a strong Octavia Spencer, is in charge of the West Computing Group, as they are referred to, made up of Black women which segregates them from the White women in the East Computing Group. She does the work and puts in the time that a supervisor does but she isn't given the title and certainly not the pay. She delivers a put down with a smile that hides her pain but tells the truth.\n\nThe third woman is Mary Jackson, played by a saucy, smart Janelle Monae, who wants to be an engineer but, due to Virginia laws, is not allowed to attend the classes she needs to get the degree. (Ah Virginia, the State that is also the basis for the movie \"Loving\" and tells  another true story about that State's laws.) She has a husband, played by Aldis Hodge, who hesitates in backing her but has a Polish-Jewish refugee, played by Olek Krupa, from the concentration camps, who is all for her going for her dream.\n\nBased on the nonfiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly one doesn't know how much of the script by Schroeder and Melfi was \"Hollywoodized\" but a lot of it rings true and the production designs by Wynn Thomas and the costumes designed by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus certainly reflect the era.\n\nThe acting by all is first rate but Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae give powerful performances showing how strong and accomplished Katherine, Dorothy and Mary were, the indignities they suffered and how just by being themselves they are role models for all of us.\n\n\"Hidden Figures\" has two story lines intertwined and as exciting as the race to the moon became the true story of what these three smart women had to go through because of their color was more interesting as the former was familiar to me while the latter was a learning experience about these women I knew nothing about and everyone should.",

A ballsy yet successful balance between the wonder and beauty of Hans Zimmer and the hope and lightness of Pharrell Williams is exactly what this is; an inspirational drama filled with bags of emotion and well-developed characters that also has a lot of fun in its sensible shoes. As a result, it doesn't feel too heavy (almost like an American-ised 'Made in Dagenham'), but at the same time it takes you on a heart-breaking ride through the eyes of 3 hugely empowering women who I really, really want to hang out with. Yes seeing these likeable characters tested in this way brought me to tears, but that's the beauty of film, and it shines damn brightly here.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Because the themes it explores have a social-standard now, there's no attempt to take a step back. That might not neccessarily be a bad thing though, as it does enhance the power of the whole experience.\nVERDICT: This is one of the warmest and most charming films I've seen so far this year. When you consider I've only seen one other, that means this is better than Underworld: Blood Wars. Wow.",

The three leading ladies deserve a round of applause, along with the supporting cast that truly do their jobs by supporting and boasting the lead preformers. The actors play and bounce off each other in realisct friendly or sometimes unfriendly tones, that feel familiar in our time even though this story takes placed in 1961. The story, if not all true, was pieced together finely with a script  to gives you this cozy but uneasy tension that almost resonates through the entirety of the film. I left the theater feeling the same way I felt after watching films like The Help and even Star Wars the Force Awakens. Happy, a true wondrous joy to see a multitude of people, from all walks of life, coming together to deliver a truly positive and quality piece of film making. Which I can imagine will be played out for decades to come. Diversity in film is blasting into Hollywood at this moment in time and I for one am proud to say it's so far been a success. Now if only we could delete  Gods of Egypt and get a $80 million budgetted Egyptian Gods of Horus film with a cast that realistically represents the indigionous area.

            "content": "It seems like now, more than ever, cinema is producing the most films based on true racial stories of the past. Hidden Figures does this as well, but in a way that nobody has seen on screen yet, which is saying something. From not knowing this film was coming out, to watching a couple trailers that peaked my interest, to hearing that it's being considered for many categories at the #Oscars, it was a film that very quickly became a priority to see. After seeing Hidden Figures, I can't recommend this film enough. Not just to people who can relate with particular situations presented throughout this film, but it's a reminder of how far we've come as a society, as well as an important story about Nasa that many people (including myself) may not have known. \n\nThere are very few people out there today that are aware of the story that Hidden Figures presents. I could be wrong, but so many people talk about the first moon landing and the discovery and loss of new planets, stories like these easily become forgotten. That is a very sad notion, because this is one of the most powerful films of 2016 in my opinion. The first three African-American women to work for Nasa, also end up becoming the biggest need in putting the first man into space. That is essentially the basic premise of Hidden Figures, and while that may seem like a story better told in a classroom, this may just be the most important film that has been displayed on the big screen in quite some time. \n\nWhen it comes to telling a story like this, you don't want to come off preachy, offending some viewers along the way. It is impeccable that the direction is handled with care and casting the right people to relay the important messages is just as key. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson, and Octavia Spencer are all superb in their respective roles here, along with some surprisingly good scenes with Jim Parsons and Kevin Costner. In my opinion, Taraji P. Henson stole the show in setting the diminish of the border between races in motion. All three of them have their moments to shine, but there is something about Henson's performance that stood out the most to me. \n\nAll in all, I didn't find myself complaining about too much when the film concluded, but I did look back and think that a few scenes could have been cut or trimmed down to shave off about 10-15 minutes. The first act is just as enjoyable as the rest of the film, but it admittedly takes its time to get moving. That being said, once it gets moving, it doesn't let up until the credits roll. The direction by Theodore Melfi was very sincere, hitting every right beat for the story at hand. I found myself applauding inside, each and every time a character was able to further their dreams. St. Vincent was a fantastic first feature film from Melfi and after seeing Hidden Figures, I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. He truly makes any dull moment bearable in this otherwise superb picture. \n\nIn the end, Hidden Figures makes more than one powerful statement throughout its 127 minute duration, each as impactful as the last. This film is all about making a statement, but the editing, pacing, performances, and dialogue written impeccably by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi was riveting. The first act is slightly too slow, but I was on the edge of my seat during the second and third. When you tell a true story, without making anything seem farfetched or stretched (which I am sure this film did in some capacity), you know you have made a quality film. You should be expecting this film to get quite a few awards nods and deservedly so. Hidden Figures may have a few minor issues here and there, but it's still one of my favourites from 2016.",

The performances outside of the three women mentioned before are hit and miss where some are very good (Mahershala Ali and Glen Powell), and some don't fit as well as we would hope (Kevin Costner and Jim Parsons). The film does a good job of making you believe you're in the 1960's and it's not too heavy handed with it's message. As a side note it's a tad odd that a black woman empowerment film is directed by a white guy, but at least this story is being told as it's long overdue. Director and co-writer Ted Melfi follows up his first feature film \"St. Vincent\" with an arguably even better movie, but a lot of the same issues people had with his first feature are still apparent here in \"Hidden Figures\".

Based on the true story of African-American women scientists and mathematicians working for NASA during the Space Race in early 60s in segregated America and the invaluable but unacknowledged contribution they made, the film tackles both racism and sexism in one narrative swoop while trying to make maths look exciting and sexy, but the result leans towards the conventional and predictable: holding back the worst bits of zealous gung-ho-ism but slipping into an oversentimentalized version of 60s America from time to time. Which means it is left to the performances of the main trio of actresses to sell the worthy narrative and save the film from cringing over-earnestness - and this they certainly do in ample style. Taraji P. Henson shows her range and watchability but Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae also have their moments in their respective supporting roles; leaving the non-African American cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Kevin Costner (looking very comfortable as another bespectacled JFK era public servant with a similar sounding name to his previous Jim Garrison), in lesser and more understated roles, almost to the point of being plot devices and caricatures.",

Directed by Theodore Melfi who directed the excellent and underrated St Vincent (2014) comes the story of three women pivotal in helping NASA during the mission that launched John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit. We follow Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) a brilliant mathematician and numbers cruncher who helps Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and his team calculate the correct math in order to safely land Glenn back onto Earth. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) is the oldest of the trio and begins working ahead of the others in order to understand how computers work. Lastly is Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) the youngest of the three who is working day and night to become an engineer. All three face a ton of adversary in their jobs. Katherine is constantly dogged by her co-workers at every opportunity. They won't drink from the same coffee maker, she has to run half a mile to go to the colored bathroom and her supervisor Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) is quite frankly a dick. Dorothy is constantly passed up for becoming a supervisor even though she's already doing the work, but her manager Vivian (Kirsten Dunst) won't give her any chances. And Mary is faced by segregation and not being qualified because of her race to get into the engineer program. It's a good tale about how all three women were behind the scenes making one of the most historical moments in US history happen. The gripe here is that it is overly saturated with Hollywood shine. What do I mean? It easily passes over a ton of historical inaccuracies that I can only amount to the movie being PG and the film maker not trying to get too controversial. Yes the ladies are smart and break through barriers to get some recognition, but the film blows it up...just a little too much. Overall, still a good story that I enjoyed overall. Give it a look!",

            "content": "Theodore Melfi's \"Hidden Figures\" (2017) is an inspiring account of overlooked superheroism that never underestimates the power of the uplift.  Set in 1961, it stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, respectively, as Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, African-American women working under the employ of NASA.  Best friends made separate by age and professional duty, they nonetheless line up in their determination to overcome the limitations placed on them by a decidedly unequal society and in their working together to help launch astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit.  Over the course of the movie do all climb over the mountains placed in front of them by flagrant unbelievers.\n\tAnd the film is as straightforward as that: \"Hidden Figures,\" sweet without being saccharine, is a story that takes pride in its many real-life triumphs, in its startling ability to tug the heartstrings and its offhanded way of eliciting grins without a drop of manipulation.  Standing as Melfi's second feature, preceded by 2014's likable \"St. Vincent,\" \"Hidden Figures\" takes the easy-going crowd-pleasing elements of its predecessor and brings a newfound weight to them.  Here, every victory sings; every tell-off soars.  This is the kind of popcorn entertainment that makes you cheer.\nBut unlike, say, \"The Help\" (2011), \"Hidden Figures\" is sensitive toward its culturally asymmetrical setting and refrains from overtly romanticizing the major issues faced by its characters.  Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson are luminous, perceptive women, but in the face of the society in which they live are they intellectually undermined, perpetually having to prove themselves in a man's (specifically, a white man's) world.  \nJohnson, shy but stormy when need be, is a gifted mathematician working under the Space Task Group, forever the smartest person in the room but always treated as an inferior facet as a result of her skin color and her gender.  Vaughan, head of NASA's segregated West Area Computers sector, is so used to explaining her vocational role to disbelieving ears that she might as well deliver an automated message when the time comes.  And Jackson, a gutsy crackerjack, readily excels at work but is pushed back by undervalue that comes to a head when employers demand she take local night courses to \"enhance\" the vast knowledge she can already proudly call hers.\nAnd because the story behind them is inexorably heartwarming, the basic joys of \"Hidden Figures\" simply lie in watching these lovable women get ahead.  The actresses playing them make compassion easy to feel.  Henson is profoundly moving, especially because she's forced to abandon her passivity for the sake of advocating for herself.  (A scene where she vents in frustration to her employer, played by a terrific Kevin Spacey, is enough to ensure Academy attention.)  Spencer, despite the fact that her Vaughan remains more simplistically supporting in comparison to the more fully formed Henson, carries an aura of otherworldly sensibility that makes her continuously primed to steal scenes.  And Mon\u00e1e, better known for her innovative musical career, is a revelation (also in last year's critically acclaimed \"Moonlight\") with a knack for the one-liner and the impassioned monologue. \t\n\"Hidden Figures\" is one of the more enlivening movies of the year, and there's a certain comfort to be had in a smartly made feature that's unapologetically genial.  Chance of award sweeping come Oscar time is questionable - voters recurringly tend to pick favorites with a tragic air - but with the sum of its parts so appealing, inevitable is its future positioning as a classic.",

The cinematography and the lighting made me feel like I was watching a film taking place in the 60's. Overall, a very powerful film. My only \"complaint\" I would say I have with the performance of Jim Parsons made me feel like I was watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory. While it isn't a bad performance, I would like to see something else come from him.",

The primary villain is the system within which they strive. An almost secondary obstacle is the hurdle of science and physics that must be overcome to put an American (no color qualifier) in space.  The best thing about Hidden Figures is that it is bringing an awareness of the contribution of these NASA black female human computers to a wide awareness. Taraji P Henson spouts the mathematical babble with the best of them and gives her character warmth and heart so that we feel the injustice of her victimhood. Octavia Spencer  portrays Dorothy Vaughn as an example of initiative that everyone can emulate. With her 2nd huge supporting role of the year (the other is in Moonlight), Janelle Monae is solidly establishing herself as a very credible actress. There are solid supporting characters including those played Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst. There is an accessible modernity to the music, largely due contributions by Pharrell in the songs department  and as one of  the many producers  involved. I particularly like how the theme \"Running\" gets turned around between Act 1 and Act 3.",

So many great stories are lost to us as time marches on and through film and television we are able to rediscover hidden gems that made our country what it is today. This story was dramatic, heartfelt, and intelligent. So far it's the best film I've seen this season and the best film I've seen since Spotlight and Brooklyn. Taraji P. Henson headlines the cast as a bookish, vulnerable mathematician. Her character struggles to make it in a man's world, more specifically a white man's world. Octavia Spencer might be the best supporting actress of all time. In everything she does she makes the cast around her shine, while delivering her own biting, hilarious lines. What makes this movie so encouraging are the true heroines that actually lived this truth and paved the way for women and people of color in a segregated state and workplace. Go see this film, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll have faith in what made this country the greatest place to call home.",

Henson, Keven Costner), the audience at my crowded matinee break into spontaneous applause as the credits came up. It reveals the crucial roles three African-American women played at NASA in the early '60s, and it expertly blends humor, music, story and great acting to show their struggle against the era's Jim Crow laws and petty bureaucratic rules. I have minor quibbles with a couple of scenes that amped up the drama just a bit too much to be believable. For example, there's a scene (and it's in the trailer) where Kevin Costner uses a sledgehammer on a sign related to integration--and his whole staff if there, which makes little sense (it's half a mile from their actual office), but having the crowd makes the action seem more dramatic. Despite that and a couple of similar instances of the same offense, it's a really good movie. It's also one of those exceedingly rare PG films that you could enjoy watching with your kids and your parents.",

            "content": "This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  I believe this will be in strong contention if not the winner of best picture.  What a refreshing change from the usual angry black messages in so many recent movies that several times a year try to drag everyone back 100-150 years and act like slavery still exists and race relations were still at the low point they were at one time. I refer to movies like \"Loving:\" (\"remember when it was a big deal for mixed races to date or marry- well that was terrible.\") Or \"12 years a slave:\" (\"remember when white people owned black people and kept them as slaves and abused them?  Well that was terrible\"). Or \"The Butler:\" (\"remember when black people were treated like second class citizens and were only fit to be the white man's servants?  Well that was terrible\"). \nWere blacks mistreated, abused, marginalized, invalidated? Certainly. Are we now perfect? Of course not.  As a white person I am embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted about how blacks were treated in my own lifetime as this movie illustrates, as well as the recent past. There is no excuse for it and I am glad we are getting past it.  That said, I give this movie the highest praise for,  while not glossing over the indecency and unfair and inhuman treatment by which we treated blacks in our own \"modern\" society, it also did not assume a victim mentality or an angry militant response against the \"white man.\" Instead, it just portrayed the simple human truths of these fine and courageous and incredibly gifted women and how much their contribution meant to our society as a whole no matter what color.  It portrayed them as who they are along with who we were as an unenlightened society and how by just being who they were and doing what they are gifted to do they succeeded, and race issues faded into the background while their humanity and achievements were recognized and honored as they should be. \nIf this movie teaches us anything, as did \"42\" about the struggles and life of Jackie Robinson, it is this: why does a black person have to be the absolute most super-gifted, super-talented, super-smart, superhuman person, who excels in their area of expertise far above literally every last white person on earth, before they will be accorded any recognition, status, equality, to say nothing of just basic acceptance, respect and acknowledgment as a human being? It is a condemnation on us as white people for this to be so, such as having these women be able to do what none of us could do, or to have Jackie Robinson do on the baseball field what most white people could not do, before we will even let them use our own bathrooms or become one of us.  \nIn every age there were always visionaries who were far ahead of their times, such as Frank Sinatra who saw beyond the stupidity of bigotry and racism and allowed Sammy Davis Jr. to be an equal friend with full acceptance into his group.  It is a sad commentary on us as a society particularly white society that we have never even heard of these women before this, given their so significant of a role in one of our greatest achievements in our history.  Hopefully we can start looking around us now, and looking toward the future rather than continually looking to the past so much and trying to live in it rather than learn from it, and move forward and evolve as human beings. \nAnother message of this movie might be that unless we all do this thing called life together, and everyone contributes and is allowed to contribute their piece of the puzzle, then we are going to crash and burn rather than fly and a soar. \nWhat a great movie, and thank you so much ladies! You are truly heroes.",

            "content": "This is a good solid movie and earned every bit of its 4.5 Icees (out of 5). This is about an event in history and many contributors to it that I was not aware of.  This is based on the true story of three African-American ladies who made memorable impacts to the space program in the early 1960's.  I didn't know that at the time NASA ran out of Langley (as in Langley, Virginia). Now Virginia isn't exactly known as one of the most progressive states of that era, and that is touched on throughout the film.  But the movie does that without clubbing you over the head with it.  You get the idea; the injustice; the stupidity that went on during that period, but without it being the primary focus of the film.  There was no violence in the film, although it was alluded to in news reports.  I think the way the bigotry of the period was done was good.\n\nThe performances were spot on. Taraji P. Henson (playing Katherine) received most of the focus, but an appropriate amount of time was also devoted to Octavia Spencer's character (Dorothy). One thing that I don't think was done quite as well was the character Mary, played exceptionally by Janelle Monae. I thought the film could have been even better with more scenes of her.  The best scenes to me were the ones where the three of them were together.\n\nThe bigotry in the movie was a sad but true state of affairs in 1961, so the portrayal here was well-deserved. I almost didn't recognize Kirsten Dunst, who I thought did a good job playing what I am guessing was an HR supervisor.  Kevin Costner was his normal excellent self playing a man that didn't care about gender or race, but instead was just focused on getting a job done. Jim Parsons on the other hand played a character that was very stereotypical of white males during that period.\n\nWhat these women had to overcome is an absolute shame and just plain wrong. That's why this story is important.  Plus, you throw in the fact that this is actually a true story about a significant event in American history, well... that just make is all the more vital to see.\n\nIf you want to see a good movie about a sad period of history and more specifically the lives of 3 women who changed history at NASA, this is a movie you should see.  During the credits, they show pictures of the 3 main characters, but there is nothing after the credits.\n\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "First Hit:  A very touching and wonderful film about strong smart women overcoming prejudicial perceptions about their capabilities.\n\nThis film is based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, which tells the story of how smart intelligent black women persevered and overcame the challenges of 1960's discrimination in Virginia to help the United States come from behind and beat the Russians in the space race. This movie chronicles their journey along with the journey of the early space program.\n\nHaving grown up in this era, but in Southern California where the overt and obvious signs of segregation didn't exist, I was shocked knowing that Virginia had segregated lunch rooms, bathrooms, and bus seating. This issue drives this film's story.\n\nKatherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are three friends who work for NASA in Langley Virginia. The Russians have successfully launched manned orbital space flight with Yuri Gagarin. Because we were in a cold war with the Russians, it was a societal imperative of the time, that we beat them in the space race.\n\nUnder the guidance Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) NASA was struggling to develop rockets, space capsules, and the ability to calculate orbital exit and entry points of these space vehicles. To assist with the more mundane calculations, NASA used a unit called \"Colored Calculators\" of which Katherine, Dorothy and Mary were a part.\n\nThere are three major stories about these women in this film, plus other side stories. This is both the strength and weakness of this film. We didn't need every story, however the main story about the three finding their rightful paths was divine. Katherine was a mathematical genius graduating high school at age 14 and college at age 18. She is a single mother raising three daughters, while working long hours calculating numbers. When she is discovered as the only one who knows analytical geometry, she gets assigned to Harrison's group to figure out how the United States will launch a man into orbit and bring him back alive. This is the main theme of the film.\n\nHowever, it also documents how Mary, had to find a way to become a certified engineer with NASA. As she assisted Research Engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki he asks her why she didn't become a certified engineer, she tells him, \"I wouldn't have too. I would already be one.\". Dorothy, managed the Colored Calculators but they refused to give her the title of Supervisor because she was black. When NASA attempted to install a IBM computer, she learned Fortran and ended up Supervisor of the computer programmers. However, when there were calculation discrepancies by the IBM computer and the orbital launch was in jeopardy, John Glenn (Glen Powell) says; \"Get the girl (Johnson) to check the numbers... if she says the numbers are good, I'm ready to go.\"\n\nThe mixture of using old original film footage tying together the major events of the day with events in the film was very well done. Emotionally and at a feeling level, this film is very well done. From the moment Katherine's daughters talk about diving underneath their desks at school to protect themselves from bomb fallout to the hurdles of racism that were being jumped over; tears of joy and sorrow fell down my cheeks.\n\nHenson was amazingly wonderful as a brilliant mathematician and woman who finds her way into a very elite world. Spencer was very good as a woman that wouldn't let herself be slighted any longer and took matter into her own hands and learned computer programming. Monae was fantastic as the sassy woman who outwardly challenged the status quo. One of the best scenes in film is when she went before the Judge to challenge getting into an all-white school. Costner was good as the head of the space program and one of my favorite scenes with him was when he ripped the \"Colored Only Women's Room\" signs off the wall. Mahershala Ali as Colonel Jim Johnson, Johnson's beau, was very good. His strength and sensitivity were perfect. Kirsten Dunst, as Johnson's boss, was strong. She had an appropriate level of aloofness. Powell as Glenn was excellent. His open welcoming personality made everyone's life better. Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford the lead analyst heading up the development team was very good. Allison Schroder and Theodore Melfi wrote a very good screenplay but it had more side stories than needed. Melfi did a wonderful job of directing this cast, however it felt more complicated and longer than it needed to be.\n\nOverall:  This film documents a changing and glorious time in our country and these women led the way.",

            "content": "Grade:  A\n\nRating:  PG, 127 minutes\n\nIn a Nutshell: Based on true events, this uplifting film with a fantastic title shines the spotlight on some overlooked figures in history.   \n\nWhile the movie features new math that was invented in order to get the first man to the moon, it was really about these African-American women who struggled as second-class citizens during the Civil Rights movement and who were pivotal to the success of NASA's space program.\n\nThe film sheds inspiring light on the space race and Jim Crow laws of the 1960's, one that lifted mankind to new heights and one that pushed them down.  This story was long overdue.\n\nUplifting theme: \n\"You know what's dangerous?  Inaction and indecision.\" - Jim Webb (Ken Strunk)\n\"Discovery is not just for the sake of discovery, but survival.\" - Al Harrison (Kevin Costner)\n\"I looked beyond.\" - Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae)\n\"We set sail on this new sea because there is knowledge to be gained.\" - Al Harrison\n\"We all get to the peak together or we don't' get there at all.\" - Al Harrison\n\nThings I liked:\nOscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, and Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer truly light up the screen. All of their performances were stellar (pun intended, and true.)\nJanelle Monae is absolutely fantastic as Mary Jackson and is a true stand-out.  From the minute you first see her on the screen, she radiates intelligence and determination.  Mary's speech to the judge was outstanding. She has been in a few small movies since 2014, but I'm sure her career is going to really take off after this movie (yep, another intentional space pun.)\nPharell Williams does a great job blending the sound of the 60's with music that sounds current to today's audience. Click here if you'd like to relive the music: Hidden Figures: The Album\nThere is a lot of humor and heart.\nYou get to see real footage from historical NASA events during the film, as well as pictures of these three important women at the end of the movie.\nWhen I was little, my father held a top position at Lockheed.  I remember going to visit the company at a special event for families.  They proudly showed off their computer room, which was filled with gigantic computers that stood from floor to ceiling.  It's hard to believe that we can now fit a computer on our cell phones and in even smaller spaces.  How wonderful it is to live in the Information Age when knowledge is so easily obtainable.\nThey did a great job setting the 1960's environment with rotary phones, typewriters, etc.  Some of you young ones out there may have never seen those things before!\nWritten and directed by Ted Melfi, who is more than welcome to bring more inspring stories like this to the Big Screen.\nJohn Glenn was considered a hottie of his day, appropriately played by Glen Powell.\n\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nI love award-winning Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory: Season 1, but his character pretty much just gave the stank face the entire time, not providing any big growth arc or allowing Jim to use his full talents.\nEven if you were really good at math, you're probably going to realize you're not as smart as you thought you were.\nRed tape and bureaucracy make me crazy.  Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons' characters epitomize all that is wrong with companies and organizations that have no vision or flexibility.  That close-minded librarian just about made me want to scream when she said, \"Well, that's just the way it is.\"  I completely understand rules are designed for the benefit of all, but when they make no sense any more, they need to be changed.\nDorothy Vaughan steals a book from a library and gives a compelling speech to her kids about why it was ok.  While you feel the sense of injustice that the \"colored\" section of the library didn't contain as many good books to choose from, it certainly doesn't mean stealing is ok.\nThere is a bit of reverse racism showing how all the white people are stupid and racist, while all the black people are brilliant and morally superior.\n\n \n\nInteresting lines:\n\"Let me ask you: if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?\" - Senator Patrick (Wilbur Fitzgerald)\n\"I wouldn't have to.  I'd already be one.\" - Mary Jackson\n\"There's no protocol for women attending.\" - Paul Stafford\n\"There's no protocol for a man circling the earth either.\" - Katherine Johnson\n\"Who makes the rules?\" - Al Harrison\n\"You, Sir.  You are the buss.  You just have to act like one...Sir.\" - Katherine\n\"The kids need to see this.  Everybody needs to see this.\" - Levi Jackson (Aldis Hodge)\n\"This IBM is gonna put us all out of work.\" - Dorothy Vaughan\n\"Every time we get close to winning, they move the finish line.\" - Mary Jackson\n\"Separate and equal are two different things.\" - Dorothy Vaughan\n\nFunny lines:\n\"Yes, they let women work at NASA, Mr. Johnson.  And it's not because we wear skirts.  It's because we wear glasses.\" - Dorothy Vaughan\n\"How can you be ogling these white men?\" - Dorothy Vaughan\n\"It's equal rights.  I can see fine in any color.\" - Mary Jackson\n\"Here at NASA, we all pee the same color.\" - Al Harrison (Kevin Costner)\n\nTips for parents:   \n\nYay math!  This movie will make your case to your kids that math IS important and they should do their homework.\nThe film highlights racism in the United States in the 1960's and uses terms like \"Negro\" and \"colored.\"  They'll see images of colored-only bathrooms and drinking fountains, as well as see how whites and blacks were separated on busses and in the court room.\nWant to see more?

So its no surprise that NASA had to find help in the most unlikely of places.\nAfter being hired to NASA in 1961, African American mathematics genius Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), is recruited to help jump start the failing space program. Aided by close friends Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) who also want better treatment for the work they do, these women discover that racism and sexism doesn't just take place in the outside world, but even at a male dominant NASA.\nWhat Hidden Figures does that separates itself from most in the genre of Civil Rights movies, is that all of the subplots have payoff and you care about these characters. These woman arent sitting around and complaining, they are going out to make change and to give themselves a better life. You are rooting for them and what their cause to be a success.\nThe women know that the odds are stacked against them for one being black and two being a woman. This film really is an empowering piece of cinema that shows that women can be just as, if not more efficient than their male counter parts. The strive for equality among the sexes is something the Hidden Figures balances extremely well, without crossing the line and becoming a male shaming piece of propaganda.\nBut like most films in this genre, even through Hidden Figures does rise above most, it cannot separate from by-the-numbers plot and the cliche riddled script. There are no twists or turns and you know how the movie is going to play out beat-by-beat, with little attempt at doing something different.\nDespite being by-the-numbers, that wont take away from an incredible true story of triumph in a time where opportunity was extremely limited for women and even more so for Black women. Audiences will walk out with smile, as hard work, dedication and never giving up can help many accomplish the impossible and these women lived the impossible.\nAs John Glenn would say \"Zero G and I feel fine\" and these women soar above the clouds.\n8/10",

Good movie all around. And when you go, take your kids (maybe over aged 10)...let them see some things that they haven't experienced.",

It is also fine set of character studies on three women involved in some of the monumental achievements in the history of mankind. The film shows in mature writing and excellent performances those who right away saw the absurdity of the prejudices black employees of NASA had to deal with, as well as the slow but compassionate/reasonable changes others go through to see the inherent obstacles and obstructions caused by this prejudice in achieving NASA's goals. I see multiple award nominations for this film, but mostly for the stunning performance of Taraji P. Henson.",

'Hidden Figures' does a brilliant job of compressing the story of the historic breaking of barriers by these three impressive, capable, brilliant and brave ladies of color. They deserved a 10-episode miniseries on HBO or Netflix but you still get the spirit of what they accomplished. The lead actresses were excellent, especially Taraji P. Henson as the math prodigy, Katherine G. Johnson. \n\nThis movie is not a documentary and should not be viewed as such. This film is a vehicle to tell the story of Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson. In just over two hours, 'Hidden Figures' hits all of the emotional notes perfectly without becoming maudlin or preachy. It is important to learn the personal stories of those who overcame the racism and sexism that dominated our society in the 1950s and early 60s. These women had to fight every step of the way to achieve what they were fully capable of doing and this film honors their legacy. Thankfully, the film doesn't fail to entertain and enlighten the audience. \n\nThe side of me that is a historian of the space program was constantly jarred by the technical errors in showing the NASA side of the Mercury Program. The temporal jumps also brought me out of the narrative. The clip of President Kennedy speaking about going to the moon were from his speech at Rice University in September of 1962 rather than from his address before a special joint session of Congress on May 25th, 1961. This is a key distinction because Shepard's suborbital Mercury flight was on May 5th which provided the basis of Kennedy's challenge, There were plenty of liberties taken with the facts and timeline to give due diligence to the personal journey of these trailblazing African-American women.  I estimate that 99% of the audience (or more) won't be bothered by the artistic license taken by the writers. So please see and enjoy this film.",

            "content": "While Hidden Figures suffers a bit from a run-of-the-mill biopic structure, the astounding acting across the board is enough to keep the casual movie fan pleased.\n\nI always love checking out stories that I have never heard of.  I've seen The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, and I know a little bit about the background of NASA.  But I knew nothing of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson.  Going into a film with little previous knowledge can be immensely rewarding experience.  And although Hidden Figures isn't the best movie, it's most certainly a film worth seeing.\n\nPlaying the three \"hidden figures\" are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae respectively.  Aside from quite a few supporting performances from Spencer, I'm not overly familiar with these actresses' work.  And perhaps unexpectedly, all three of them are terrific.  Spencer gets the least to do out of the three, and still has a memorable banter with Kirsten Dunst, a racist co-worker.  Monae brings a fresh and lighthearted character into the fold and complements the two of them well.  \n\nTaraji P. Henson on the other-hand, is on a completely different level.  If it wasn't for Portman, Adams, and Stone giving such acclaimed turns this year, Henson would have likely been a frontrunner.  Considering she's playing someone without much wiggle room to show emotion, it's impressive that I felt as though I could understand exactly what she was feeling in every scene.  She only gets a few scenes to express herself in a grand way emotionally, and she makes the best out of them.  It was easily one of the best performances of the year.\n\nEven though this story is very interesting on paper (three African American females working for NASA significantly helping America's chances of winning the Space Race), I feel like the film could have taken advantage of the story even more.  I love the relationships these women have together and I instantly bought into their chemistry, as I did the material with each of the women's personal lives and families.  But I don't think it came all together as neatly as I would have hoped.  I wish we would have gotten a little more time with the three women together, instead of hammering home the underlying message involving racism.  There's no question this story needed to be told, but at times the execution felt more formulaic than natural.\n\n+Henson is extraordinary\n\n+Incredible story\n\n+Emotion hits a few times\n\n-Directing and editing felt a little choppy\n\n-Needed more time spent with just the three of them\n\n7.0/10",

Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer are equally good. Kirsten Dunst, Glen Powell, Mahershala Ali, and Jim Parsons all give great supporting parts. To me, Henson and Costner are the real standouts of the movie. All the NASA stuff was compelling, especially the actual launch of Glenn's rocket. I actually wanted more story on Katherine considering she was the main focus. This was hard because the film was telling 4 separate stories at once. I understand that it was of a certain time, but not only black women were underappreciated. Women in general were looked down on and the film only hints at that. The PG rating suggests that the film plays it safe, which it does. But overall, it doesn't really hurt the film in the end. It is still inspiring to see the real unsung heroes get recognition. The performances are what makes this film a joy to watch and it leaves a good message that anyone, whatever race or gender, can do the impossible.\n\nGrade: A-",

The one that popped out at me was \"Hidden Figures\", so I bought my ticket, got me some popcorn and went inside. Hidden Figures is the true story of the three African-American women, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson who despite racism, segregation and sexism for that matter became the unsung heroes of the early Mercury space program helping America get into the space race by being smart. I found myself feeling the struggles they faced and the tugs of my heartstrings at the joy they found through dedication and family. It is a story of believing in yourself even in the most difficult of situations to know you are better than anything that comes at you and that you will rise above it to succeed if you just put your mind to it. The old adage among the early test pilots was that nobody knew their names. History eventually recorded their achievements and we did come to know them. For these brave women their story is long overdue and am glad it is now out for the world to see. One of the immortal  speeches in history in the movie is President Kennedy speaking at Rice University, on the day I was born September 12, 1962, where he said, \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things. Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\" I never quite put the context of Kennedy's speech to my life until now. It is so easy to sit back and question yourself and go down a dark well of despair feeling that hope is just outside your grasp. If these women kept trying and succeeded so can I and so can us all. At that moment I realized that I also choose to go to the moon and do the other things...not because they are easy, but BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD! Never underestimate yourself because you too can shoot for the moon and the stars and whatever else YOU want to do in this world. All you need to do is \"light the candle\".",

            "content": "Names like John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell, and Buzz Aldrin are household names thanks to their bravery and willingness to go into space. What about all of those behind the scenes unsung heroes that made it all possible? That's the idea behind Hidden Figures as it looks at three African-American women who were pioneers at NASA, and yet, no one knows their story. In an aptly used flashback moment that opens the movie, we're told that even at a young age Katherine Johnson (Henson) was a math prodigy. That year was 1926 and she was offered a full scholarship to an academy thanks to her genius ways with numbers. Her math skills would later be put to good use at NASA. It's 1961 and the Russians are gaining momentum with Sputnik, and the U.S. is desperately trying to mark their place in space history. Katherine, along with her friends Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e) all work for NASA but have been allocated to the basement offices due to their race.\n\nAll three women have the tenacity and will power to move ahead in the company despite the opposition they face. Dorothy would love to become a supervisor for her \"girls\" as she's already doing the work without the title. Mary is poised to become an engineer, yet NASA makes it all the more problematic when new guidelines are put in place in terms of the educational requirements, which Mary doesn't have. It's only Katherine who seems to be able to make some momentum at advancing her career when she's given a new position in the analytics team. As you can imagine, this ruffles the feathers of her white male colleagues. The clock is ticking at NASA and John Glenn's mission on the Friendship 7 is quickly approaching. All three women set out to make their voices heard and put themselves forward to help the launch and recovery of the Friendship 7.\n\nAs you've probably already surmised, Hidden Figures tells a full story and doesn't cut corners on honoring the lives of these three women. This is Theodore Melfi's second full-length film following St. Vincent. He co-wrote the screenplay and opens the story up to what's going on in the world around them to remind audiences that this was a racially charged time. There are discussions of what happened during the Civil Rights Movement and how segregation played a part of these women's lives. Melfi makes the opposition they faced apparent whether it's subtly in smaller moments or in larger pivotal scenes. There's a repeated bit involving Katherine having to sprint to the other side of the NASA campus to use the colored women's bathroom. Part of Mary's plight is fighting to take night classes at an all-white school.\n\nMelfi and co-writer Allison Schroeder inject the film with enough sass and humor to find an appropriate balance against the more serious elements of the time period. It's another attempt at showing how these women are not to be messed with or taken advantage of despite their race and gender. They have written great banter between the three women showing off the playful side to their friendship. This definitely comes into play with a side plot of Katherine's as she starts dating an extremely good-looking vet (Ali) whom they meet at a church potluck.\n\nMelfi has a great ensemble on his hands and his film works well due to the chemistry they all have and the teamwork that's set in place to get John Glenn into space. He's given his three leads enough material to work with instead of keeping it all focused on Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson. It's a smart role for her to take on to counter her work as Cookie Lyon on Empire. Octavia Spencer plays into her strengths as the funny but no-nonsense Dorothy. I also found myself drawn to Janelle Mon\u00e1e as she's the newcomer of the group. She's proving to be a natural on screen with her role as Mary and as part of the ensemble cast in Moonlight. There are a few antagonists in the film played by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst. Both work at NASA and try to reduce the trio down by making it a point to remind the women of their roles. I'm wondering if and when Parsons will get sick of playing the smart science guy.\n\nHidden Figures is a feel good kind of movie that's sandwiched into theaters between a crop of heavier films. Theodore Melfi covers a lot of ground to give a complete picture, but it feels a tad longer than it needs to be. It's great to see a film showcase the power these three women had to take chances, defy expectations, and take matters into their own hands. It's an inspiring film to show to young girls or boys who feel like their voices aren't heard or need a true life example of someone like them making a difference in the world. It also provides an accessible history lesson for younger generations who don't remember a time when bathrooms, restaurants, and marriage were separated due to the color of your skin.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Bring the whole family to see an uplifting film about three women whose contributions to NASA and space travel should not be ignored.\n\nRATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

One of those women played by Taraji P. Henson (Katherine) was especially picked because of her skills in math, particularly analytic geometry. Struggling to gain confidence in her skills at NASA working with a group of white men looking down on her she soon gets the respect as well as the shade that comes from doing your job better than others.\nThis was a very inspiring movie about black women striving to move up in the world and taking their rightful place in the positions they qualify for. Though this was focused on the three women, the hardships and goals can apply to virtually anyone. All the actors did an immaculate job. Special shout out to Birmingham's own Ashton Tyler as he played the son of Octavia Spencer's character, Dorothy Vaughan. Congratulations kid! There is many more for you so keep up the faith. The main cast Taraji, Janelle, Octavia and of course Kevin Costner deliver an excellent performance. It's also good to see Mahershala Ali doing consistently good acting work as well. It's been awhile since I've seen Kirsten Dunst. I've never seen her play a role older than a 20 something so it was a little different seeing her aged. However, she did a spot on job playing the hard nosed supervisor. Jim Parson's as the shady, stiff, hard case added that necessary element needed for the right amount of success blockage as well providing the character who eats humble pie.\nFor all who are looking to reach for something that seems unlikely to obtain and are going through challenges and unsurety as they press for their mark, this movie is one to see. It teaches you not to be weary in your well doing because your gifting will make room for you. I truly loved Octavia's role because her character was always pushing and looking out for the girls working under her. When information was not given for her to use due to the ignorance of segregation, she thought outside the box to stay ahead and bring others with her. Man she was good. This was a very smart movie and enjoyable all the way through. It had its share of laughs, drama and had great pacing to keep your attention. As far as movies go that deal with equal rights for women, I put this up there with \"A League of Their Own\". A must see!",

I liked how they easily they transitioned and went from one to the other. I did not feel beaten to death by race issues. It felt like a equal mix of both. \n\nI liked how this film incorporated church and family into the film. It was an unexpected pleasure seeing that into this film.  \n\nKristen Dunst\nKevin Costner\nJim Parsons\n\nHans Zimmer and three others did the music for this film. \n\nI think there was a good balance looking at the lives of three African Americans \n\nThis film is a good film for those interested in NASA, African American race, Women's rights, the Cold War history, history, Mathematics and more.  This was unlike any race or Space Race film I have ever seen before. It was about not underestimating someone based upon sex, gender, race what they look like. I liked how quickly and easily the film could go from transitioning from NASA, race, gender, mathematics, family, church, work life, all within minutes or seconds into a scene. It made the film feel so believable and realistic. \n\nThis film hit several important message that are applicable or relatable to several groups.\n\nI really enjoyed this film and is one worth buying. A great movie for a January film. I am really surprised how little this film was advertised. \n\n\nI liked the cineophotography choices on some things like using reflections in the walks or reflections of the mirrors in the bathroom to show faces and figures. \n\nI wish that some of the original footage was better enhanced in the film. It was obvious when real footage was used. Also It almost took you out of the film when you went from new footage with better quality to short segments of obvious real footage of the day where the quality was not up to modern standards. \n\nLooking at Jim Parsons role I had trouble seeing his character for anything besides Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. \n\nI had trouble figuring out who the actress Kristen Dunst was at first while watching this film. It was not until I saw her on the screen for her second or third time that I recognized who she was. I was not used to her with a southern ascent and blond hair instead of red hair playing Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man.",

            "content": "Frontrunner for my favorite film of the awards season, Hidden Figures contains heavy doses of irony that may not have been intentional at the time of production. Set during the transition to the 1960s, with skinny ties and Jim Crow laws, the zeitgeist of the cold war, and the pressure cooker of the U.S. space program after Sputnik, it was a time before electronic computing was commonplace. Unimaginably, the math for the orbital mechanics of the Mercury missions was being performed on slide rules, pencil, and paper. The revelation of this film is that some of the human \"computers\" that did this vital work were African American women, who despite their brilliant contributions, were segregated and marginalized because of their color and gender.\nChalk up one for amazing timing... One cannot ignore that for these past few months, making America \"great again\" has, for an outspoken intolerant minority, meant reverting back to this white male-dominated social structure with all of its overt sexism and racism. In this light, seeing the inhumane treatment visited upon the hardworking heroes of this film moves beyond sepia-toned history and elicits real, contemporary rage.\nThe superb cast is lead by Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who are exceptional and nomination worthy as real-life mathematician Katherine G. Johnson and supervisor Dorothy Vaughan. Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) is terrific as the socially awkward love interest Colonel Jim Johnson. Kirsten Dunst turns in a surprisingly solid performance as a hardened by-the-book supervisor, and Kevin Costner thankfully melts believably into his role as chief of the space program. Jim Parsons' portrayal of an openly racist engineer is sadly wooden, and is the only weak spot in an otherwise strong ensemble.\nTheodore Melfi's film is definitely a glossy Hollywood telling, and effectively pulls at the heart strings with every element, but the work does not descend too frequently into unnecessary sentimentality. Scenes of the heroines' home lives feel sweet but not overly romanticized, and scenes of their hardships are more matter-of-course than melodramatic. The film is beautifully lensed by Mandy Walker, and has a wonderful kinetic energy. This is robust, big studio filmmaking certainly, but it has at its center memorable real heroes, an inspiring story, and great heart.\nHighly recommended! Go, and take the kids.",

As a lover of history pursuing a PhD in the subject, I watched this film with attentive eyes as I had already previously knew the story of these 3 women. I was not disappointed as it's historical accuracy is near perfect and is a fantastic medium for one to enjoy and absorb this knowledge if you are not fond of books and articles on the subject. Everything works in the film from the acting, the chemistry the characters have with each other, even some of the tiny romance segments can strike a cord with the audience. You really feel for these women and their struggles not only as women in the 60's but as black women still dealing with the struggle of segregation right down to the water and coffee they drank. A beautiful and inspiring film that takes place in such an important and climactic era in American History, Hidden Figures is sure to become a must see for Historical films of all shades and is definitely an early contender for the Oscars.",

It's an inherently engrossing story that the public knows precious little about, and the biggest problem with director/co-writer Theodore Melfi's (St. Vincent) film is that is rarely breaks free from its formula for feel-good mass appeal. Rather than allowing us to absorb the complexities of the three women featured (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae) the movie wants us to just know about their struggles over injustice and inequality. That's a fine starting point but rarely do these women become fully fleshed out. They're kept as symbols, put-upon figures, and less as people. That allows them to have their Big Acting Moments where they uncork a snappy retort to institutional prejudice that is the kind of stuff meant for Oscar clip packages. Henson is given the most significant part but even her math genius feels like a crude Hollywood extrapolation of a stereotypical movie nerd. Monae was the one who left me most impressed with her feisty attitude and swagger. It's all a pleasing and moderately entertaining package but the presentation and artistically stilted character development hinder the movie's message. I would have preferred a documentary on the same subject, something that would allow further depth as well as the direct testimony of those women involved. I believe Henson's character is still alive and in her 90s, so there's no time to waste. Hidden Figures is a safe yet still appealing biopic that hits some of the right notes but lacks greater ambition. Not all films have to try and redefine their genre, but when you're giving the titular hidden figures of history their much-deserved spotlight, maybe a little more effort is deserving and necessitated.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

Henson is a great lead, while Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are great in their supporting roles. Kevin Costner was also very good in his role. The story this film tells is an important one and an interesting one. While the beginning was slow, I was eventually captivated by the story of sending a man in space. The parts about Henson's character's love life were necessary for her character but not as entertaining as the rest of the film. There are some parts that feel like a TV movie, but a well made one. Also, the film is not as dramatic as I would've liked it to be. It is very predictable, but as a family film I understand it. Overall, the story in this film had to be told. Coupled with excellent performances, this is a rousing and entertaining film.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures could have easily been one of those films that plays things right down the middle. Mainstream to the max. A standard structure with a likeable cast delivering an uplifting and equally heartwarming story that inspires us all to live our lives in something of a better fashion and to many ends-it is exactly that. That may sound as if I'm coming out the gate reducing the film to clich\u00e9 via expectation, but it is how Hidden Figures both uses such identifiers to its advantage without reducing itself to those overused thoughts that make it charming while still routine. Exciting while ultimately a little obvious. It is a film with just the right amount of sass and just the right amount of authenticity to meet somewhere in the middle between a made for TV movie and that of a larger budget biopic, but this time with three central characters rather than just one formerly famous person. What Hidden Figures does so deftly is suggest how well-known its three protagonists should be rather than playing off how well known they clearly aren't. That their accomplishments are far greater than anything any musician or actor might be able to contribute to society, but due to the fact their profession is much less attractive (and their circumstances even less so) than performing on stage they seem fated to go down in history with little to no recognition. As these things tend to go though, Hollywood can't ignore a good underdog story, but when this is true in terms of something as large as the legacy of both the three individuals whose lives this film chronicles as well as all the women and women of color that these three stand to represent, such Hollywood reliabilities aren't always such a bad thing. From the director of the safe, but pleasing St. Vincent comes another competently made piece of cinema that exercises its big heart and sentimental streak in ways that are familiar, but that are executed so well and with such strong characters that it's impossible not to find yourself drawn to the satisfying journey Hidden Figures takes us on. Juggling three individual arcs with multiple facets within each and a scope that deals in the space race of the 1960's Hidden Figures is certainly a much more ambitious project than that of director Theodore Melfi's previous film, but one that he handles with assured grace as in only his second feature Melfi has proven he has the rare talent of crafting movies that are unabashedly feel-good while not allowing the saccharine aspects to overstep their boundaries forcing the story and the characters that craft that story to be as authentic as the beats are familiar.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

This is a crowd-pleasing and well-acted biographical tale that, predictabilities aside, is entertaining as it is important as we witness the hard work, perseverance and talent these women possess despite dealing with workplace segregation and the general attitude that women are unable to accomplish anything in a white man's field. Seeing the trio, mainly mathematician genius Katherine Johnson, help NASA turn the tide in the Space Race and proving everyone who were initially in opposition of them wrong were definitely clap-worthy moments, and trust me there were a lot of them. With Theodore Melfi's breezy, yet impactful direction and Pharell Williams' lively and decade-appropriate original music, Hidden Figures is a fascinating, empowering and feel-good look at NASA's true heroes that will evoke laughs, \"awws\" and a round of applause.",

            "content": "SPACE RACISM - My Review of HIDDEN FIGURES (3 Stars)\n\nGood intentions do not always make for a great movie, and HIDDEN FIGURES has a true tale well worth telling, but unfortunately the writing and directing get in the way.  Director Theodore Melfi (the way-too-mushy for its own good ST. VINCENT) and his co-screenwriter Allison Schroeder obviously mean well. The world is a better place because they've shined a light on the unsung black women who made essential contributions for NASA, especially during the early 60s space race with Russia. I'm just not convinced they were the right people to do said shining.\n\nThat central trio, Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson, a math prodigy, Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan, a computer expert and leader, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e as Mary Jackson, who aspired to become an engineer, battled segregation, sexism, and racism in their quest to take their place at the table and help such people as John Glenn rocket into space and return home safely.  Of course, they did so during a time where black people had to sit in the back of the bus and use separate bathrooms.  These are women everyone should know and celebrate, and for that I'm extremely grateful to have seen the movie.\n\nIf only it didn't have that 80s sheen to it.  Take, for example, the movie CRY FREEDOM from 1987, in which we witnessed the plight of Steven Biko (Denzel Washington) through the eyes of a white journalist played by Kevin Kline.  I wouldn't go so far as to say HIDDEN FIGURES has been whitewashed to that extent.  After all, the story has been told firmly from the three central figures.  The white supporting characters, however, are played by name actors (Kevin Costner, Kristen Dunst, and Jim Parsons), and they represent a spectrum of white attitudes towards their black co-workers.  While Dunst and Parsons exhibit subtle levels of racism, Costner treats everyone the same, with a gruff indifference and expectations of extreme professionalism.  Progress!\n\nEach woman gets her chance to take on the institutionalized racism of the time with big splashy scenes.  One moment, however, caused me to roll my eyes ever so slightly, when Costner gets his big scene to take a stand against it.  Yes, it's nice to see a white guy defend his black co-workers, especially in such a hugely symbolic way, but I think the women handled things just fine on their own.  It almost felt like the filmmakers didn't trust the audience enough to hate racism unless a white guy had his own statement. I was waiting for Henson to pull a colleague aside in that scene and say, \"We need to talk about Kevin!\"  \n\nLet me be clear.  The above-mentioned are minor quibbles compared to the general aesthetic of the film itself.  HIDDEN FIGURES is pristine, old school filmmaking.  Mandy Walker's cinematography and Wynn Thomas' production design amply demonstrate their big, glossy studio resumes.  In other words, this film lacks grit.  The wardrobe and the cars look like they've never met a speck of dirt.  Every pleat in Henson's skirts are ironed within an inch of their lives.  There was no reason to think that the characters wouldn't break out into song at any given moment or that our protagonists would band together and hogtie Parsons ala 9 TO 5. It's all just a little too pretty and safe for its own good.   \n\nRegardless, the performances are wonderful, in a surface-level way.  While we never dive too deeply, Henson makes cat eye glasses and chalk sexy again!  Spencer knows how to throw shade with her direct eye contact and subtle half smile.  Mon\u00e1e, who made a fantastic debut in MOONLIGHT, again proves her exceptional acting skills here, but her flawless beauty can be a little distracting at times.  Luckily, she infuses her character with enough raw spunk, she gets away with it  \n\nI'm not saying that this film should have been made by black filmmakers.  Denzel Washington recently gave an interview for FENCES in which he said that he was a good match for the culture portrayed in the film, and not just because he's black.  He said he knew that a guy like Troy would spill a little of his alcohol on the ground before drinking it himself as a way to pay respects to black men in prison. That's just something you either know or you don't.  HIDDEN FIGURES, while really vivd and expressive when it comes to showing us math equations, doesn't give us that level of personal detail.  Sure, Ava DuVernay would have been an obvious choice, but I would have also liked to have seen what Todd Haynes or Sean S. Baker would have done with the source material.  Instead, we're left with a populist film.  It's easily digestible for the masses, and that may be why it has been made the way it has.  It's essential viewing, but not essential filmmaking.",

Johnson (Taraji P Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) who work at NASA in the 1960s and served as the brains of behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn. The three main actresses do an excellent job with their roles however in my opinion Tarajai P. Hensons performance was the most shocking to me and I say that because this was such a different role for her and the fact that she did such an amazing job in the role was great, I hope to see her do more biography films in the future. Other actors in the film aside from the three main actresses include Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodges, and Glenn Powell do a great jib in the film as well as the three leading actresses. What makes Hidden Figures a great film is not only is it just a feel good film but its also smartly crafted, and has a very good message to it. Another great aspect of the film was the fact that it was about the engineers at NASA as opposed to it just being about the astronauts. Hidden Figures has everything you want in a film its funny, its touching, and the three main characters create an excellent chemistry together, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the film brings home couple of oscars. I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of period pieces, i guarantee you won't be disappointed.",

Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and Kevin Costner in a biographical film about three woman that work in NASA, and they were having a hard time getting the job that they wanted to get as one is very smart, another wants to be a supervisor, and the third girl wants to be an engineer for rockets, whether it be a racial issue during the 1960s as their skins are black, and also a gender problem that they had to go through. I was pretty excited to see this movie as the trailers for the film seem like it'll be a very classy one to watch, also for the fact that it was nominated for Best Picture from the Oscars, even if it didn't win it, and that I have never heard of this true story before, which I wasn't quite sure about why we haven't heard about it from history books in school. When I finished the film, I was looking through YouTube in terms of things that are related to the film, and I come across a comment that I completely agree with, which was that there's finally a film that students can watch in math class alongside October Sky that's appropriate, and they can enjoy themselves greatly. The three main leads are fantastic, and the stories that have the three of them are interesting as they can hold on their own, which the movie shows more of Taraji P. Henson's character. Kevin Costner is great as a supporting cast that he has some great moments in the film, and Jim Parsons is pretty good at being a complete jerk to the main character, which reminded me of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, but he's way more likable here as I'm not a fan of the show. The writing by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi is well-written that seem to understand about the issues that the main characters have to go through whether it be racial or gender, while still creating character development and humor from the main leads. The score by Han Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, and Benjamin Wallfisch is outstanding as it has great songs that were sang by Pharrell Williams, which I find them very catchy, different, and it fits to the time period that the movie takes place in. The movie is definitely a feel-good one as when the characters find some resolutions to their problems, I felt very satisfied at it as they come so far to get where they're at, and I'm sure the audience would feel the same thing. I was watching the reviewers who I trust that reviewed the film, and they have a common complaint that the relationship that the characters have is not quite fully developed and is there to show that the main characters have someone they love. While I somewhat agree with that, I also think that the film is pretty short on that aspect, and it goes back to the NASA story pretty quickly that the audience and I were interested in. Hidden Figures is an amazing film that has a lot of heart, effort into it, and a flowing narrative that we'll learn something out of the three main characters.",

The actual critics have already touched on why this is objectively a great film, but I'd like to add that it is also a necessary one. As a black woman in STEM, seeing these women on the screen was empowering, inspiring, and incredibly motivating. The lack of representation - of both women and people of color - in STEM fields can be discouraging, and only perpetuates stereotypes of who can survive and succeed in these professions (read: white men). Hidden Figures will not only inspire young women of color to pursue STEM fields, or whatever area, but will also help non-POC realize where our anger and resentment stems from - the outright unfair treatment we've faced for years, even in the times when we were literally needed the most.",

Nasa was at a fast pace to get a space shuttle launched. One thing I felt like it was unheard, was the person that made this possible, mathematician Katherine (Taraji P. Henson). Gifted at an early age in elementary school and ahead of everyone in her class. The teachers recommended scholarships and plans for college. Many years later, Katherine, engineer Mary (Janelle Monae) and Mathematician and supervisor Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) all work together in a subdivision for computers in Langley. After the Russians launched their first satellite into space. The pressure for the Americans was high, when Nasa was in a hurry to get their first astronaut into space. Al (Kevin Cosnter) director on trying to get an space craft engineered, asks for Katherine to join his group on trying to solve these algorithm equations. Unwelcomed by many of his staff since she was an African American. Katherine faces the challenges of trying to solve a difficult equation and being mistreated by her coworkers. She is not allowed to get a cup of coffee from the same coffee pot or use the same bathroom. Making her run out of the building and to the colored bathroom in a different division building. \n\nHidden Figures is a crowd pleasing drama film that shows the hardship these characters went through. Like a moment when Dorothy was not allowed to check out a book with her son in a library and has to go to the color section. Moments like seeing her son, wondering why they are treated that way. While her mother responds about only doing the right thing, and not letting anyone take an advantage. As she discusses about taking a book without permission from the library but she replies that she paid her taxes, so she has her rights like anyone else does.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe film does convey a great story on what was going on behind the scenes with the space launch and showing the mathematician perspective on making this happen. Taraji P. Henson gave a great performance and will have to say is one of her better films. Octavia Spencer did great. Janelle Monae was also good, about how she is inspired to be an engineer. Kevin Costner was also good. The rest of the cast ensemble was great with their brief small roles. \n\nThe one thing we can all predict from this, is we know what the outcome is. That's usually what falls with most based on true events biographical stories. I felt like the film dragged on at parts and could have been trimmed like 15 mins. Cause there were moments, were it did get kind of boring. Also, felt like the music score could have been more inspirational with the direction. Which is sad, cause music composer Hans Zimmer is brilliant in his other work. But being partnered with Benjamin Wallfisch, there score in the film did not add to the movie. On the bonus side, Pharrell Williams did have an okay song adapted for the movie. \n\nOverall, Hidden Figures is a fairly well drama film, I do recommend that you should watch. Just to see these characters that went through a lot, facing against racism and sexism. All while trying to work for Nasa and making the space launch successful. Plus the cast ensemble performances were all great.",

            "content": "\"It maybe a straightforward and by-the-numbers biopic but \"Hidden Figures\" is an entertaining and dazzling movie that honors the accomplishments these women achieved without being too coy and genuine\"\nMovie Review: Hidden Figures\nDate Viewed: January 14 2017\nDirected By Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent)\nScreenplay By Theodore Melfi and Alison Schroeder, Based on the non-fiction novel by Margot Lee Shetterly\nStarring: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae, Kirsten Dunst, Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali, Glen Powell, Donna Biscoe, Rhoda Griffis, Maria Howell, Aldis Hodge, Paige Nicollette, Gary Weeks and Kimberly Quinn.\n\nThis untold story about the visionary trio from NASA is all fine and sunny side by best. It is well-acted and occasionally corny historical drama about the three African-American women who helped and calculated the space flight trajectories for NASA. \"Hidden Figures\" is clearly a school field trip movie and it succeeds in that front. The untold story about three black women geniuses at NASA is nothing new but it doesn't matter, just put the minor problems and skeptics aside and enjoy \"Hidden Figures\" for what it is.\n\nSet in the early 1960s, the story is about three African-American women, mathematician Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), informal supervisor Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and aspiring engineer Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) who overcame an unfair and repressive work-place system and became inspiring trailblazers for NASA. These talented women work for the Space Task Group which is headed by director Al Harrison (Kevin Costner).\n\nWith Russia just launching a successful satellite into space, it puts the U.S. behind and Harrison receives enormous pressure from his superiors to double their work efforts and put American astronauts into space. NASA supervisor Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) assigns Katherine to become the first African-American woman in the team but she gets dismissed by her colleagues and is forced to work under tyrant head engineer, Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons).\n\nKatherine is front and center of this story, she helped coordinated the space trajectories for the Mercury 7 which launched astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit and other future NASA missions. Not only is she a mathematician at heart, she's also a widowed mother of three daughters and she even pursues a relationship with an Army officer (nicely played by Mahershala Ali).\n\nMary Jackson wants to be NASA's main engineer but she can't pursue that job unless she has a engineering degree so she takes evening classes in the hopes of getting that position. Dorothy Vaughn who serves as group supervisor hopes to get the position of main supervisior but the condescending Vivian Mitchell won't allow it because she believes that an African-American woman should not be required to get the same equal and pay status as white women.\n\n\"Hidden Figures\" launches successfully as an uplifting and compelling movie thanks to strong performances from Henson, Spencer and Monae and Theodore Melfi's potent direction. Melfi who previously directed the sentimentally gooey Bill Murray comedy \"St. Vincent\" provides a fierce iron hand and self-determination in his three leads and the screenplay by Melfi and Alison Schroeder is just as feel-good and inspiring as Ron Howard's \"Apollo 13\".\n\nIt maybe a straightforward and by-the-numbers biopic but \"Hidden Figures\" is an entertaining and dazzling movie that honors the accomplishments these women achieved without being too coy and genuine.",

It's hopeful and inspiring, of course, with these brilliant women succeeding despite all kinds of resistance, but it's tragic too, showing how much tougher and smarter and more hard-working they had to be than their colleagues to get even a fraction of the pay or respect, how they were often forced to make themselves smaller than they really were just to survive, how it took decades for them to get the recognition they deserved. And the whole time I was watching, I couldn't stop wondering how many people would leave the theater patting themselves on the back for how far we've come in dismantling institutional racism instead of seeing the truth that things haven't changed much at all. Racism is just as damaging, just as entrenched; the only thing is it's subtler now, so we get to pretend it's a problem we've already solved.",

I wish I was as determined and as ingenious as these ladies. You can never have too many positive role models in life, and Hidden Figures gives me 3 more to learn about.

I wasn't expecting Hidden Figures to do anything for me based on it's trailer. I'm happy to say that this is a feel-good crowd-pleaser that generally succeeds, even if its success isn't out of this world (no pun intended). It hits all of the beats that you'd expect from a movie like this and wears out its welcome a tad being over two hours, but the three lead performances are nothing short of charming and the script is noticeably less manipulative than similar films. The movie tells the true story of Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), three black female mathematicians working for NASA in segregation-heavy 1961 in an attempt to assist the United States with the Space Race against Russia and send John Glenn (Glen Powell) on an orbit around the earth. Refreshingly, the movie doesn't play the racism of their colleagues to excessive lengths, a fitting choice given how systematic and accepted such discrimination was. These women are, in addition to be brilliant, are aware of the workings of society and the barriers that they face as black women in a time of plentiful sexism and racism, and they respond to it with their determination and maturity--they know that success is the best revenge, and it helps make for very likable protagonists. As said before, melodrama and emotional manipulation are generally absent, allowing for the three leads to work their presence and general amiability. Spencer and Henson do typically strong work, but Mon\u00e1e makes the strongest impression, and between this and Moonlight, she's one of my breakout stars of 2016. She's funny, emotionally effective, and realistic. (Speaking of Moonlight, Mahershala Ali also has a supporting role, which is nice to see him in.) Where Hidden Figures stops short of being great is pretty much where one would expect. It's more than serviceable, which is more than I can say about most similar movies, but other than its necessary and progressive story, it is more or less the same thing that inspirational dramas cover. The character arcs and progression from the beginning to act three to the climax to the denouement don't have that much new to offer in terms of execution. Theodore Melfi, whose previous directorial effort was 2014's mediocre St. Vincent, doesn't lend much of a unique eye and generally leaves the actors to carry the movie. However, he does keep a decent pace, although the movie could have been less than two hours. Hidden Figures exceeded my (admittedly timid) expectations, and for that I'm grateful. It's an important story that's also an interesting story, and it's an interesting story told in an engaging manner. Spencer, Henson, and Mon\u00e1e once again prove their talents, and while Melfi may not offer a ton in the way of a director, he crafts a movie that's accessible, and one that's for families. It isn't mind-blowing, but take your kids to this one--girls and boys. 7.5/10, pretty good, B, above average, etc.",

This is one of those films. Everything from the screenwriting to the casting to the historical recreation of a true and untold gem makes this film a deserved and worthy Best Picture nominee. Being the only nominee to take over the US box office doesn't hurt either. While it may not take home any Oscars (...and it definitely could have been nominated for more), this film is - in some ways - a bigger than any trophy one could throw at it. Above all, it goes to show how impactful unity can be when all parties work together for the common good.",

I wasn't sure how successfully it managed to achieve a balance between all three of these elements, and how accurate the depictions and sentiments were. Nonetheless this is an entertaining and informative film, and I especially enjoyed its retro feel. \nAAN",

Watching these women persevere as mathematicians at NASA warms your heart, but many in today's political/sociological climate would recognize the societal problems of racism and sexism are still an issue. It is even more disheartening that our nation is no longer making the effort it once was to explore the stars let alone our own solar system in the way we were then. Anyway, the story in Hidden Figures hits all the points you'd expect from a prestige picture. The well-defined characters and ensemble cast led by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are strong. Of course the film takes some dramatic license to amp up the thrills at key moments, but overall is excellently put together with respect.",
