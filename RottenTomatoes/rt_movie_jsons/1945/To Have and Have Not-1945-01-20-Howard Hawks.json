    "summary": "In Vichy France, fishing boat captain Harry (Humphrey Bogart) avoids getting involved in politics, refusing to smuggle French Resistance fighters into Martinique. But when a Resistance client is shot before he can pay, Harry agrees to help hotel owner Gerard (Marcel Dalio) smuggle two fighters to the island. Harry is further swayed by Slim (Lauren Bacall), a wandering American girl, and when the police take his friend Eddie (Walter Brennan) hostage, he is forced to fight for the Resistance.",

Bogie appears genuinely smote in his scenes with Bacall. They end in real life getting married, though he was decades older, and by her account, they were incredibly happy.",

At the heart of the film is the scathingly witty and elusive repartee between Bogart and Bacall, ever scintillating with a barely concealed smoldering passion between the illustrious pair. In truth, Faulkner's sharp and calculating dialogue is as effective and appropriate here as in any other Bogart film, quickly enamoring us to the playfully adversarial nature of Bogart and Bacall's relationship. Walter Brennan provides welcome comic relief, although the story never smothers us with the heaviness of its underlying, wartime themes. Lounge music and smokey barroom atmospheres envelop us in a story that proceeds slowly but surely, allowing us to savor every atmospheric moment. While not up to par with the behemoth which is \"Casablanca,\" \"To Have and Have Not\" offers us a virtually flawless example of cinema nearing its peak during the cherished golden years of Hollywood.",

Somehow her traits stop being amusing when she follows Humphrey Bogart's character around antagonizing him by reacting overly jealous anytime he talks to another woman. That to me made their relationship less likeable. Otherwise it was a good film I would recommend but it still can't measure up to the star level of Casablanca.",

In some parts, the parallels are less favorable with respect to Hawks' film than others, particularly the somewhat light story and the atmosphere, which never delivers the grim hopelessness (or at least bittersweetness) that made Bogart and Bergman's tragic romance shine so brightly. Where the film compensates is Bogart and Bacall's chemistry and characters, which sizzle with easy charm that is reinforced by the actors' real-life affection for one another. The movie sustains itself predominantly based off their exchanges, from moments of aloof appraisal to searing jealousy. The ending is surprisingly neatly wrapped-up and cheery in tone, as Bogart's literal Captain Morgan single-handedly holds off the local party collaborators, including a relatively unheralded but pleasingly greasy Dan Seymour, so they can all leave with just a couple sexy scars. Imagine how much you had to drink for people in a 40s film (where 50% of the runtime traditionally takes place in smoke-filled bars) to point out that you have a problem. (3.5/5)",

The style of the story, and many of the themes contained in it were similar. It wasnÂ’t a remake by any means, but it had a familiarity that was kind of nice. The performance of Humphrey Bogart is exactly what I want from him. He has that strong and suave nature which gives you assurance that he is always in control. But almost outshining him is Lauren Bacall. She is stunning, and IÂ’m not just talking about her looks. She has a gorgeous singing voice, and massive amounts of charisma. Bogart and Bacall are a great pair and give you something to root for throughout the film. The story doesnÂ’t have the best flow to it, because I often feel like things are going around in circles. They donÂ’t build as much tension as they could. There are a number of scenes where I feel like the risk of discovery should be high, but they kind of shrug it off like itÂ’s no big deal and thereÂ’s no danger. It was just a bit odd because I expected more drama in some of those scenes. However, it didnÂ’t really matter for me. To Have and Have Not almost could have been random rambling nonsense as long as they kept that romance between Bogart and Bacall intact. They made this movie a winner for me despite any flaws I saw in its plotting.",

It's derivative of Casablanca from two years earlier, includes a character who quickly becomes annoying (Walter Brennan, who plays a toper), is implausible in places, and has little to do with the novel by Ernest Hemingway.  On the other hand, it was 19-year-old Lauren Bacall's first film, and she displays a sultriness and presence not often seen in someone so young.  Bogart is also strong as the fishing boat skipper in Martinique who wants nothing to do with politics or the French resistance, but finds himself drawn into events as they unfold.  He's gritty, tough, and real, and has a couple of fantastic scenes with Bacall, where their chemistry is apparent despite him being 25 years older, including the one where she so famously says to him \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow.\"  I also liked musical performances led by Hoagy Carmichael, though Bacall's singing in the numbers she was in was pretty awkward.  Like I said, it's not perfect, but it is solid and entertaining, and as the start of 'Bogie and Bacall', has a place in film history.",

The duo's exchanges rise above the mediocre melodrama which characterises the rest of Hawk's film: a not-so-fine-tuned fairytale torn between capitalising on the likes of Casablanca and introducing and exploring wistful subplots.\nBogie's bone-dry wit and Bacall's devilish glare are a recipe for some of the best sexual tension in 1940s cinema - and producers quickly latched onto this following the film's release. Both actors have made better pictures since, but will always be best remembered for that iconic 'whistle' scene.

To Have and Have Not has all of Howard Hawks' signature flourishes and character archetypes to the point that it might be his most quintessential work. The script (penned partially by William Faulkner) is sharp, the performances are solid, and - it's impossible to discuss this film without bringing up this final point - the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall (their first of four screen performances together) is just incredible.

On top of that, the screenplay is very intelligent - it's no wonder considering names such as William Faulkner and Jules Furthman billed as screenwriters. The film moves at a very entertaining and enjoyable pace and despite the story rich of twists and turns, it never stutters or tangles. But what truly elevates this film is the chemistry shared by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, which is nothing short of incendiary. This was, after all, the film where they met and fell in love. For all the chemistry shared by other on-screen couples before this film and after it, there is a genuineness to the one exhibited here that is unprecedented and impossible to replicate.",

Morgan's right-hand man is Eddie (Walter Brennan), a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" While in port, Harry is approached by Free French activist Gerard (Marcel Dalio), who wants to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an important underground leader. Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms. He uses his boat to bring resistance fighter De Bursac (Walter Molnar) and De Bursac's wife Helene (Dolores Moran) into Martinique. The Vichy police, suspecting that something's amiss, hold Morgan's pal Eddie hostage, tormenting the poor rummy by denying him liquor. Predictably, Morgan comes to Eddie's rescue and manages to escape Martinique, with the delectable Marie as cozy company. In the hands of director Howard Hawks and screenwriters Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, the end result bore only a passing relation to the original story by Ernest Hemingway: instead, it was a virtual rehash (but a good one!) of the recently released Casablanca, replete with several of that film's cast members. The film's enduring popularity is primarily -- if not solely -- due to the sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, especially in the legendary \"You know how to whistle, don't you?\" scene. The most salutary result of To Have & Have Not was the subsequent Bogart-Bacall marriage, which endured until his death in 1957. It's widely believed that Lauren Bacall's singing voice was dubbed in by a pre-puberty Andy Williams; this is not true. For the record, a more faithful-to-the-source cinemadaptation of the Hemingway original was filmed in 1950 as The Breaking Point.\nMy Review\nA great black and white classic from Warners Bros To Have and have not revolves around Harry a captain boat owner played by the great Humprhery Bogart in wartime Martinque. Morgan's right hand man Eddie played by Walter Bernnan a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" which to me is a funny one liner in this film. While in port Harry is approached by free French activist Gerard who want's to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an an important underground. Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket.

There are many others equally as good, however, including an exchange about strings that has Bacall walking around Bogart, and a great line from Bacall about \"walking home if it weren't for all that water.\"  The banter between the two was probably the best part of the film since it the film relies on a what had become a well worn plot and was based on what Hemingway considered his worst novel. This movie is not as good as Bogie's classics: Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon, and the subsequent Bogart-Bacall pairing in Key Largo has far more suspense & tension within it. However, few films in history  can equal To Have and Have Not for its on-screen chemistry.",

Morgan's right-hand man is Eddie (Walter Brennan), a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" While in port, Harry is approached by Free French activist Gerard (Marcel Dalio), who wants to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an important underground leader. Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms. He uses his boat to bring resistance fighter De Bursac (Walter Molnar) and De Bursac's wife Helene (Dolores Moran) into Martinique. The Vichy police, suspecting that something's amiss, hold Morgan's pal Eddie hostage, tormenting the poor rummy by denying him liquor. Predictably, Morgan comes to Eddie's rescue and manages to escape Martinique, with the delectable Marie as cozy company. In the hands of director Howard Hawks and screenwriters Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, the end result bore only a passing relation to the original story by Ernest Hemingway: instead, it was a virtual rehash (but a good one!) of the recently released Casablanca, replete with several of that film's cast members. The film's enduring popularity is primarily -- if not solely -- due to the sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, especially in the legendary \"You know how to whistle, don't you?\" scene. The most salutary result of To Have & Have Not was the subsequent Bogart-Bacall marriage, which endured until his death in 1957. It's widely believed that Lauren Bacall's singing voice was dubbed in by a pre-puberty Andy Williams; this is not true. For the record, a more faithful-to-the-source cinemadaptation of the Hemingway original was filmed in 1950 as The Breaking Point. \nMy Review\nA great black and white classic from Warners Bros To Have and have not revolves around Harry a captain boat owner played by the great Humprhery Bogart in wartime Martinque. Morgan's right hand man Eddie played by Walter Bernnan a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" which to me is a funny one liner in this film. While in port Harry is approached by free French activist Gerard who want's to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an an important underground.   Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms.

Sure, the real love story behind the film of Bogey and \"Betsy\" (her real first name) Lauren Bacall is now days what people love to see, but as a story/movie its pretty mundane.\r\n\r\nTo Have and Have Not is a 1944 romance-war-adventure film. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks and stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan, and Lauren Bacall in her first film.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is nominally based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Hemingway, the story was extensively altered for the film.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Lauren_Bacall_with_Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_Trailer.jpg/275px-Lauren_Bacall_with_Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_Trailer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action scenes where Bogey displays his former tough guy image are of course, fantastic.  Tired of being questioned by authorities, he soon lets the audience and his actor foes what real threats on stage mean.  Terrifying, fast talking Bogart soon lets us all know who's in charge.\r\n\r\nThe actors have several of the cast from Casablanca and Key Largo.  Walter Brennan, the drunken sailer Bogart defends to the end, has a limp that he immortalized in a much later sixties television show The Real McCoys.\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_trailer.jpg/150px-Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_trailer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1     William Faulkner, \"out of print and broke\", was on the payroll, helping with the script.\r\n\r\n2     This was Lauren Bacall's first film, at the age of 19. Hawks' wife \"Slim\" (whose nickname would be applied to Bacall's character, Marie) noticed Bacall on the cover of Harper's Bazaar and showed the photo to her husband, who soon sought out Bacall and signed her for the role.\r\n\r\n3     Although Hawks had a high regard for Hemingway's works in general, he considered To Have and Have Not his worst book, a \"bunch of junk,\" and told Hemingway so; Hawks and Hemingway worked on the story together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\n1    The movie is basically a rip-off of \"Casablanca,\" but it's got some marvelous dialogue and great intrigue.\r\n\r\n2    80% \r\n     This movie is not in the league of Casablanca, which it resembles in more ways than one, but is still highly enjoyable....\r\n\r\n\r\n3    90% \r\n     The first of two classic films Howard Hawks did with Bogart and Bacall contains great dialogue and great performances. \r\n\r\n\r\n4     70% \r\nâ˜…â˜…â˜… (out of four) \r\n\r\nThe legendary couple of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is born in this intriguing and stylish thriller....\r\n\r\n\r\n5      ...an intriguing, romantic, sometimes exciting, predictable but entertaining motion picture.\r\n\r\n6    The film was Bacall's first movie and the project on which she and Bogart met.

This is the first film I'd seen Bacall in, and her stunning beauty is only exceeded by her excellent performance (which is even more amazing, when you consider her age at the time).  And, when you see her and Bogart sharing scenes you can't help but feel the electricity between them.  Add to this Walter Brennan in the comedy-relief sidekick role, and that alone makes this a classic.  But that's not all (as a famous TV spokesperson might say):  Hoagy Carmichael is merely icing on the cake (filling the Dooley Wilson cabaret piano player role).  As for the story itself, well it's not hard to see the comparisons with \"Casablanca\", though in this outing Bogart seems to exhibit more attitude, not even trying to hide his disdain for the occupying forces.  The only thing missing from this is a Claude Rains-ally in the local police force.  I'd probably rank this third among my favorite Bogart flicks (behind \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca\"), and though not quite in my top-10 list, I think it'd deserve a place somewhere in the top-20.",

            "content": "Howard Hawks' TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT [1944]:  Stories of love and romance are definitely not an uncommon subject to cinema, regardless of what genre a romantic subplot seems an almost mandatory thing especially with a lot of classic films. When the iconic Humphrey Bogart had achieved super stardom in the wake of starring in films like THE MALTESE FALCON [1941] and CASABLANCA [1942], audiences just loved seeing the rugged and charming Bogart being a conquering silver screen hero with a romantic conquest attached. In the wake of the now infamous romantic war time drama CASABLANCA in 1942 Bogart proved to audiences that even he could be a romantic hero. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1944 when the legendary Movie producer and director Howard Hawks wanted to adapt one of the novels by one of the most Celebrated  writer of the 20th century Ernest Hemingway . Hawks boldly proclaimed he could successfully adapt what he believed was the worst thing Hemingway had written, the novel TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT having the story changed   and eventually ending up with a script that later bore next-to-nothing in common with the novel. The decision to place the middle Aged Bogart in this wartime star vehicle along side with a young new comer called Lauren Bacall sparked one of Hollywood's most iconic romances of the classic era. So in this instalment of this review series I now take look at the film that gave birth to the romance between Bogart and Bacall.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMPHREY BOGART FORTNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Two: TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT [1944] before and during the production of this film, Bogart's third marriage to Mayo Methot was already on shaky ground when Bogie met Bacall upon the set of this film. The romance ended Bogart's relationship marriage to Methot and not long after the completion of this film the pair ended up becoming married, which was to last until the death of Bogart in 1957. As a result of the real onscreen passion between Bogart and Bacall the film became a huge box-office success and gave rise to Bacall's stardom. Despite the legendary romance that this film sparked, the film's plot draws heavily upon that classic earlier Bogart film CASABLANCA rather than Hemingway's Novel. Despite all of this the film itself today holds up as a simple piece of entrainment from the Wartime era.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nSet in 1940 upon the French Colony of Martinique shortly after the fall of France and the establishment of the German friendly Vichy-France regime of the Caribbean Island.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT sees Bogart's character a world -weary American Fishing Boat Captain called Harry \"Steve\" Morgan, his pal the Alcoholic Eddie, his crew on a fishing charter that seems to be going with a stubborn Client who won't pay up for the charter.  Back at the Hotel were Harry and the Client are living, Harry meets an American Drifter called Helene (Bacall) who reviles that she stole his client's wallet. When Harry examines the wallet he discovers that his client was planning to leave the Island without paying him. Upon trying to question his client in the bar, the client gets killed amidst a shootout between Vichy Police and Free-French Resistance members. After the Vichy Police pulls in Harry, Helene and the Hotel owner Frenchy for integration, Harry's passport and money are taken from him.\r\n \r\nWith his client dead and wanting to get Helene off the Island, Harry in need of some money takes up a job to help the remaining Free-French associates of Frenchy. The mission is to get an important member of the Resistance off Devil's Island and take them to Martinique. When Harry makes the pickup with the drunken Eddie, the pair's situation ends up in a lot of danger when they shot up a search light of a Vichy Patrol boat and having the important figure wounded in the chaos. Upon arriving backing in Martinique Harry, Helene and the resistance struggle to nurse back to health and keep the wounded figure hidden from the Vichy Regime. Unfortunately it isn't all clear sailing ahead for the main cast when the lead Vichy Police Chief figures out the culprits responsible for the destruction of the Patrol boat's searchlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, DIRECTION, SCRIPTING AND CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n \r\nFor starters the performances by Bogart and Bacall are very good but their onscreen chemistry can't be criticised at all for the simple fact the pair were falling in love with each other on the set. With the legendary dialogue with a fair degree of sexual innuendo like Bacall uttering her infamous line \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... Blow\" it's no wonder why this film became a box office hit for Warner Bother Studios due to the romance between Bogart and Bacall. The rest of the cast give fairly decent performances around this, as for the direction by Hawks it's very good to say the least as the same can be said with the cinema-photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Script it's almost impossible not to see the similarities between CASABLANCA for its Vichy controlled setting, the main hero (an American) who is reluctant to fight at all, a bar were the workers are involved with the resistance and so on and so forth. Despite it being a hybrid adaptation of Hemingway's Novel and the screenplay to CASABLANCA, the story to this World War Two era romantic-thriller is never the less highly entertaining film overall  , but the real focus of the film regardless of everything is of course Bogart and Bacall  while everything takes a backseat. My rating is a solid 80% for this classic Bogart gem of the wartime Bogart films.",

In the hands of someone else this would have been a dull, forgettable film.

Bacall is unbelievably gorgeous and sexy as hell, equal in poise and pulchritude to any actress of the day, and it's almost impossible to accept she was only 19 at the time. Bogart fits well in this one -- something that can't always be said -- and it's obvious the cast is comfortable working with each other as well as director Howard Hawks.

            "content": "Bogart and Bacall sizzle together on screen  because they took to an actual affair three weeks into shooting. It's always better when no one's faking, right? \n\nBogart was 45; Bacall 19. According to a \"Vanity Fair\" piece, just a year earlier, before she ever saw Hollywood, she watched Bogie onscreen in \"Casablanca\" and thought to herself: \"yuck.\"  Yet a year later she had screen-tested, taken the leading role and found herself falling hard for Bogie's extramarital wooing. Another year later, they were wed - and remained together until he passed away 12 years later.She said they were the best years of her life.  Most people have long forgotten, but it was during those years that Bogie & Bacall became charter members of \"The Rat Pack.\"\n\nThe feel of the film and the setting is certainly reminiscent of \"Casablanca.\" It's Vichy/Nazi controlled Martinque instead of Morocco ... and it's a dive bar/hotel instead of a casino. Big diff. And the intrigue revolves around similar plotline, how shady people get in and out of town under the nose of the local, less-than-respectable law.\n\n\"Casablanca\" is more for romance, I suppose, this one more about lust. Still, this film makes a great double-bill, with Bacall shooting steamy looks and fast talk all over Bogart, who at times almost looks dumbfounded for it. \n\nEspecially when she hits him with the now-iconic lines ... \"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together ... and blow.\"\n\nHoagy Carmichael, in cameo as the dive's resident piano player, deals out the  tunes. Walter Brennan, in the role of Bogie's alcoholic, limping wingman, looks pretty much exactly as old and as drunk as he did in \"Rio Bravo\" playing the same part fifteen years later. Yep, he's the \"Real McCoy,\" all right.\n\nTRIVIA: Based on a Hemmingway novel that was remade first in 1950 as \"The Breaking Point\" starring John Garfield & Patricia Neal, then again in 1958 as \"The Gun Runners\" starring Audie Murphy.\n \nRECOMMENDATION: Bogie & Bacall ... are you kidding?

You don't realize how time just flies by because your so wrapped up in the characters and the adventures they are getting themselves into. The script is great, full of snappy dialogue. The exchanges between Bogart and Bacall are especially fun. One of the most memorable parts of the film is the friendship between Bogart and the character of Eddie. Eddie is an alcoholic who relies on Bogart for everything. While, Bogart's character is similar to his character in \"Casablanca\", here his character  at least tries to keep some human relationship intact instead of completely closing himself off to friends and love. It's a softer character and also just as tough. And ofcourse Bogart plays it perfectly. Overall, It's the kindof film you can't get tired of...you just want to watch atleast twice a year so you can forget everything and get swept up in this wonderful adventure of a film.\n\nFun Quotes:\n\n\"You know Steve, you're not very hard to figure, only at times.

            "content": "\"To Have and Have Not\" grew out of a conversation between Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks. Hawks had tried to persuade Hemingway to write screenplays, but Hemingway refused. Hawks told Hemingway, \"I can make a picture out of your worst story.\" Hemingway asked, \"What's my worst story?\" Hawks replied \"a bunch of junk\" called \"To Have and Have Not.\" \"You can't make anything out of that,\" Hemingway argued. Hawks retorted, \"Yes, I can.\" The novel \"To Have and Have Not\" concerned a charter boat captain, Harry Morgan, who loses the money owed to him by a client who leaves him in the lurch without paying his bill. Reluctantly, Morgan accepts money from rumrunners to ship their contraband merchandise. He gets shot-up, loses an arm, and his boat. Later, Morgan dies after he contends with bank robbers who force him to take them to safety using his boat. Hawks sold the story for a quarter interest in the movie to Warner Brothers, and in 1943 the studio cast Humphrey Bogart as the lead.\n\nInitially, when Howard Hawks began work on the film, the U.S. Government objected to the use of Cuba as the setting. They worried that audiences might confuse the political regime in the Hemingway novel with America's current ally, the Batista government running Cuba. Hawks and his good friend William Faulkner changed the setting to the French territory of Martinique. Furthermore, Faulkner advised Hawks to rewrite the politics of the movie so that it dealt with the clashing aims of Vichy France and Free France.\n\nLike Hemingway's novel, the film \"To Have and Have Not\" opens with professional skipper Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) taking his client, Mr. Johnson (Walter Sande), fishing off the coast of Fort de France, Martinique. After sixteen days of bad luck, Johnson quits, lies about having no money, and tries to leave Morgan without paying his bill. When Harry discovers Johnson's lies, he confronts him and Johnson is about to sign over $825 worth of traveler's checks. During a shoot out between Vichy police and suspected Free French resistance agents, Johnson is caught in the crossfire and dies. Earlier, the Free French had tried to hire Harry to smuggle one of their members onto the island. Reluctantly, since the police have confiscated his cash and the money owed him by Johnson, Harry accepts the Free French offer. By this time, Harry has gotten involved with a beautiful but mysterious woman, Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall), only recently arrived in Martinique and short of finances herself. She had tried to steal Johnson's wallet, but Harry caught her and discovered Johnson's financial solvency.\n\nHarry and his longtime alcoholic sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) pick up Helene De Bursac (Dolores Moran) and her husband Paul (Walter Szurovy) but encounter a Vichy patrol boat. Harry shoots out its search light and loses the patrol boat in the fog. Unfortunately, Paul De Bursac catches a slug in his chest. Predictably, Vichy Police Captain Renard (Dan Seymour) questions our heroes at their hotel about their trip. Harry and Eddie lie that they were fishing for marlin when a German U-boat frightened them. Later, Harry digs the spent bullet out of De Bursac's chest with Marie's help. Captain Renard renews his suspicions and arrests Eddie. Later, Renard and his agents corner Harry at the hotel where he lives when he is not taking customers on fishing trips. Harry catches the dastardly Renard with his guard down, kills one of his henchmen, and then claps Renard and company in handcuffs. After slugging the police captain on the head, Harry convinces Renard to turn Eddie loose. Eddie, Marie, and Harry get De Bursac off the island to safety.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\" deals with the usual themes that obsessed Hawks. All good Hawksian characters are professionals in the strictest sense and a later scene between Harry and Paul De Bursac establishes the quintessential characteristics of the Hawks hero. De Bursac describes the chief characteristic, \"When you meet danger, you never think of anything except how you will circumvent it. The word failure does not even exist for you . . .\" \"To Have and Have Not\" boasts some memorable dialogue, especially between Bogart and Bacall. The \"whistle\" scene is now the stuff of legends, like the horse race dialogue in their next movie \"The Big Sleep.\" Interestingly, Bogart and Bacall fell in love during filming while Bogart was still married to his alcoholic wife actress Mayo Methot. Eventually, Bogart divorced Methot and married Bacall. Walter Brennan's shtick about \"was you ever bit by a dead bee?\" is hilarious.\n\nEnough similarities exist between \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Casablanca\" to make comparisons inevitable. Like the Bogart hero in \"Casablanca,\" necessity compels Harry to abandon his isolationist attitude and aid the Free French. Unlike \"Casablanca,\" no actual Nazi German characters appear in \"To Have and Have Not,\" but Madame De Bursac does mention them in passing. Furthermore, World War II does not play a major role in the story apart from the street shoot-out between Vichy authorities and the Free French as well as Renard's search for De Bursac. Unlike the doomed \"Casablanca\" romance between Rick and Ilsa, Marie and Harry have never met, and nobody comes between Harry and Marie. Unlike Rick, Harry owns a charter fishing boat rather than a tavern. Indeed, Paul De Bursac and his wife do resemble fugitive Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo, but De Bursac has come to Martinique to rescue a Free Frenchman imprisoned on Devil's Island.",

I always feel I need to mention Walter Brennan when he shows up in Howard Hawks' movies, he's just so funny and brings all the charm in the world along with his performance.

Business isn't doing so good, and the owner of the hotel that Steve stays at, \"Frenchy\" Gerard (Marcel Dalio) has been asking him to smuggle some French freedom fighters onto the island.\n\nHe also meets up with Marie \"Slim\" Browning (Bacall) who is basically stuck on the island until she can get up enough money to make passage for home.  Every man in the piano bar has his eyes on her, but somehow she falls for old Steve, who seems most impressed that she can take a slap by Lieutenant Coyo (Sheldon Leonard) of the Veechy Gestapo.\n\nOf course the movie is most famous for the \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?
