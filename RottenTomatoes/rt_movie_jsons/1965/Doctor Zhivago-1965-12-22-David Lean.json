Acters and acting seems to be something that these folks (wish) that they had been involved in and so in a distorted way, they try to tell us what constitutes \"greatness' or the opposite of greatness.  I am 70 years of age and saw Zhivago when I was fourteen when it was released to overseas theaters in Japan.  I thought then, as I do now, that the film was the greatest work of art that had ever been or ever will be!  Julie Criste, Rod Steiger, Omar Sharif and the supporting cast were/are flawless!  Everything about David Lean's work is superb and stands the test of time!  Academy awards are given away like nickel candy these days but in the days of this work of art---such awards had to be EARNED!",

The final 5-10 minutes does a very good job at bringing everything together and made me feel for everyone stronger than I expected. This is worth making the investment once for sure. Omar Sharif did a excellent job in this and I slowly but surely liked his character. Everything in this slowly builds along with sweeping visuals and detailed intimate shots. It's not flawless (I would have liked a faster pacing early on) but it still is a All Time Classic.",

            "content": "At 200 minutes, Doctor Zhivago is a commitment that would be distressing to most movie-watchers. This is really a cinephiles film, as it lacks in action and even as a historical accounting of the Russian Revolution. That being said, if a grand, elegant, brooding Russian epic films sounds fitting for the winter, it might be the film for you. There are gorgeous shots (the funeral scene, the protests in the streets, the fancy parties, the cavalry charge) that are a joy to see on screen. The plot unravels largely over the course of 10 years. During this time, we follow Yuri Andreyevich (Omar Sharif), who loses his parents in the Urals and is taken in by a family friend, who moves him to Moscow. He becomes a doctor, and throughout the mayhem of revolution and civil war, Yuri's possessions and influence as a medical professional wains as his love for Lara (Julie Christie) grows. It's a romantic story of repressed passions and the burning ardor of love even in the face of compounding evil. The \"Reds\" become more authoritarian and less sympathetic as the movie rages on. What I appreciated is that Yuri isn't a perfect character either \u2014 he continues an affair with Lara even after his wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), is pregnant. I did have pretty high expectations for this movie and am disappointed it didn't possess the gravitas I expect with a film of its stature. I think it belongs in that category of recommends that isn't for mass appeal, but for a viewer who wants to absorb portrait shots of protest and barrenness, for someone who wants to watch a man stripped of his property and dignity, but never letting it get the better of him, somehow. The best scene comes at the end, when Yuri is rushing through the house that is covered in snow even on the inside, like something out of a fairytale, so he could get one final glimpse of Lara before she disappears over the horizon.",

Doctor Zhivago is a beautiful tale of one mans journey through life centered around the Russian Revolution and his struggle to retain his humanity and innocence in spite of the world he once knew becoming increasingly more hostile and violent. Everything from the musical score to the camera work and scale is beautiful and fantastic, and nearly every performance is great, except for what seemed to be some awkward dubbing for a child actor during the end of the first half of the film.

There are a few moments I have come to appreciate. For example, the scene when the viewer is hovering outside a frosted window watching Pasha read a letter Lara had written to him before they begin to argue over its content. In the scene, a candle is placed near the windowsill. It begins to warm the pane of glass, thawing away the condensation and ice as their argument reaches an emotional pinnacle.

While the history lesson still has much to say about the madness in following ideologues, it's the romance that makes us care. Unfortunately, it doesn't kick in till you've sat through two hours of film, plus their carnal heat never rises above two star-crossed lovers in a magical ice palace. The richest rewards come from Pasternak's story, full of blood-thirsty villains who end up saving your life and downy innocents who leave a trail of destruction. Full of holes as it is, still, \"Zhivago\" is a must-see. Who can resist those astonishing sets, that stirring theme music or the beauty of Julie Christie in the prime of her prime?",

Moreover, I felt that there weren't enough characters or enough plot developments to justify their recurring appearances and overlap.

Omar Sharif gives what I would call his best performance as the titular Zhivago, delivering a nuanced portrayal of a compassionate man caught up in the confusing, morally gray times of the Russian Revolution. The film has a stellar series of sweeping sets, made even more impressive by the fact that they were not allowed to film in the USSR due to fact that the original novel by Boris Pasternak was still banned, and a great supporting cast, especially Rod Steiger as Komarovsky, Gerldine Chaplin as Tonya, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha. While the length is a necessity to convey the sweeping nature of the circumstances that Zhivago finds himself in, it can be a bit of a grind, and is probably going to get shelved for a while before my next rewatch.

            "content": "David Lean is a director who would have made a better cinematographer or art director as his films can feel like a series of beautiful photographs interrupted by a plot and the need for decent dialogue. Unlike A Passage to India (1984) which is held up by a fantastic Judy Davis performance and a source material so dense and full of subtext that it would be impossible to ruin it this movie lacks the supposedly gripping qualities of Boris Pasternak's novel. You feel completely disconnected from these characters as while the scenery is beautiful and all of the technical aspects of the production are top notch the acting is cold and distant and the story seems lacking.\n\nThe wealthy poet and physician Yuri Zhivago, Omar Sharif, marries his childhood sweetheart and adopted sister Tonya Gromeko, Geraldine Chaplin, against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Meanwhile, Lara, Julie Christie, enters into an affair with her abusive stepfather Victor Komarovsky, Rod Steiger, and is romantically pursued by revolutionary Pasha Antipov, Tom Courtenay. Lara attempts to kill Komarovsky by shooting him but Zhivago nurses him back to health and Lara marries Antipov. Zhivago and Lara fall in love when they both work at a field hospital but both want to remain faithful to their spouses. Zhivago and his family are placed at risk when his poems are deemed dangerous by the government but they are able to escape to the Ural mountains. Lara lives in a nearby town and Zhivago consummates his affair with her. Zhivago is forced into leaving his loved ones and has to serve as a doctor on the battlefields. He is able to break off from the army at one point and makes his way back to Yuriatin where he reunites with Lara. Her life is at risk because her husband has been executed and she leaves for Moscow with Komarovsky but Zhivago remains behind and later witnesses Lara while riding a train in Moscow but dies behind her without her recognizing him.\n\nThe beauty of the film cannot be understated as when people say \"They just don't make \u2018em like this anymore\" they are referring to this sort of film. When you see thousands of extras lying on the ground at a train station with bright, terrifying posters of political figures behind them and realize that all of this was real it is staggering. Lean sweeps his camera across the landscapes of \u2018Russia', the film was actually made in Spain, and it is hard not to gasp at the well composed shots and how much Lean packs into every frame. Maurice Jarre's iconic score also enhances the film as \"Lara's Theme\" was stuck in the head of many audience members for a long time after seeing the film. Sadly, Lean does not devote quite as much attention to the characters and the story which fall flat and at three and a half hours it is difficult to continue caring.\n\nBeyond the weak writing which glosses over the supposedly \u2018important' issues in the background the performances are all over the place. Only Steiger really seems to have a handle on his character as he is brilliant as the charming monster we initially view him as but is equally convincing as the man who tries to do the right thing by his stepdaughter. Christie fails horribly as a romantic lead with her simpering and doe eyes seeming pathetic. We can see that she is beautiful but is hard to understand how her character goes from attempting to shoot her stepfather and ex-lover to shivering in the presence of the mild Zhivago. Sharif himself struggles in the lead role as he never quite seems to know who his character is, an idealist swept up in a movement he does not support or a weak, simple man who uses the women around him? We never quite find out and that means that we are never really emotionally moved by all of the suffering he goes through.\n\nAt the end of the day the film is meant to be a big, melodramatic romance and the fact that there is no chemistry between Christie and Sharif prevents us from being drawn into their passion. There are also several other issues with the presentation of this relationship as Zhivago and Lara only seem to be in love because they are both attractive and we never get Gromeko's perspective on the relationship which should have been important. We don't feel the dramatic tension in the relationship and we ultimately don't care and that is why the film never comes to life for all it's technical virtues.",

Little did I know, however, that one of the other woes involved would be this film's running time. Sitting at a weighty three hours and twenty minutes, this at times searing indictment of 20th century Russian politics certainly got its point across. It was a rough time, man. And no one seemed to realize that more than Boris Pasternak (author of the eponymous novel the film is based on). What the film seems to suffer from, however, is a genuine lack of development when it comes to the relationship between the two leads (i.e. what the movie's kind of actually about). We have this running time for a reason, nay, many reasons. And I'd expected one of those reasons to be setting up the underpinnings of this central romance beyond simply stating \"oh, well, this one time they were the only two people standing in this one room for a good amount of time and that's how they fell in love.\" We're given a montage of the two lead characters working together over a longer period of time, yes, but that development is only implied at best. It's a film with a rather shallow and predictable main plot, yet a fairly outstanding look and feel, featuring some typically brilliant cinematography and music throughout. I only wish I'd cared a bit more overall.",

            "content": "A cold romance during a revolutionary period in Russian history.\n\nDoctor Zhivago (1965) is another epic film from master director David Lean. Lean's own direction is impeccable utilizing Lean's famous far wide shots, perspective obscured by glass windows, clever edits, and massive scope. I do think Lean could have edited Doctor Zhivago down, but I cannot hate on an epic film for having a longer length, however. As long as it is, Doctor Zhivago is directed wonderfully by David Lean.\n\nThe pace is set at a slow burn, easing out all the emotional damage and depression from each scene. You feel increasingly depressed watching it as each character is more evil and cruel than the last. You witness horrible atrocities such as rape, incest, war, and mass death during the Communist revolution in Russia. Russia has never looked so harsh and cold. The freezing landscape, starving people, murdered protesters, stolen property, oppressed citizens, and ghoulish aristocracy all make Doctor Zhivago feel like you are watching some frozen Hell.\n\nDue to The Soviet Union remaining Communist during the filming of Doctor Zhivago, David Lean had to enlist many English actors and film the whole movie in Spain practically. This leads to the average Russian characters all having a distinctly British accent unfortunately, like the hopelessly out of place Ralph Richardson with his upper class British accent. You should probably just look past this inconvenience as the accents are not that distracting. This also explains why a very German Klaus Kinski makes a neat cameo as a prisoner on a train. His little performance is very fun and crazy as you would expect from Kinski. Lean still captures the cold heartbroken Russian aesthetic with his chilling weather and frozen characters despite the out of place accents.\n\nThe film takes on a historical perspective for much of the run time, going from The Czar era of Russia into The Bolshevik Revolution. You see from Zhivago's more privileged lifestyle to his impoverished one how the revolution effected the Russian populace. Richard Bolt wrote Doctor Zhivago by simplifying Boris Pasternak's novel into a bare bones romantic tale set during a tumultuous time in Russian history. Bolt's dialogue is fantastic, but story ends up feeling too simplistic a build up for how long the film takes to establish such feelings.\n\nOddly, the historical aspects take most of the focus of the narrative, leading the audience away from the love story. I honestly felt that Zhivago and Antipova's romance felt contrived and sudden compared to the host of other subplots within the film. They are sweet together and start to feel genuine eventually, but the film takes too long to get there.\n\nI love the acting in Doctor Zhivago. Omar Sharif gives an outstanding performance as the long suffering Dr. Yuri Zhivago. His pained struggle is something to behold as you constantly wonder whether he will find his family or love again. The moral dubiousness of Zhivago is fascinating unto itself. Zhivago is adulterous and unfaithful, while having lived a life of relative comfort in the bourgeoisie class. Doctor Zhivago is filled with all selfish, unlikable characters that are no moral example with one exception.\n\nThat is, Geraldine Chapline's character Tonya. Her character is a sweet innocent victim to Zhivago's envious lust over Lara. He leaves his wife and is separated from her due to no fault of her own. I felt so sorry for Tonya as Chaplin plays her with such a loving kindness and endearing charm. Geraldine Chaplin is certainly the highlight of Doctor Zhivago for me.\n\nThen, Julie Christie is a complicated performance as she acts the part of Lara Antipova perfectly. Her uncertainly is evident and her arousal by the taboo is clear. I just think her character is so easy to hate. She has an affair with a married man, but she is raped, but she also enjoys the sex, but she hates him, but she goes back to him. It's all so awkward, especially when Rod Steiger;s loathsome rapist politician Komarovsky exclaims it's not rape because you liked it! It just feels gross and reactionary. At least, Tara redeems herself by being loyal to Zhivago, but the film takes awhile to get to such tenderness towards the end when they only have each other.\n\nSo the romantic elements feel either genuinely tender to strangely contrived and force themselves upon the audience like Komarovsky does to Lara. Doctor Zhivago should have focused in on either the revolution or the romance, as it skips too much to the other to endear both upon us.\n\nOn the other hand, the various supporting roles in Doctor Zhivago are excellently acted. Rod Steiger is completely reprehensible as Komarovsky. Alec Guinness is quite likable and out of place as the Communist Lieutenant with another British accent. Tom Courtenay makes for a fiery protester and a fearsome Communist leader.\n\nLastly, Maurice Jarre delivers one of cinema's finest romantic scores. The music is hypnotic and mesmerizing with every note. Jarre perfectly fit the tone and atmosphere to each scene of longing, lust, or lavish style. His score remains timeless.\n\nOverall, Doctor Zhivago is a classic film that has a few faults. None ruin the film, but I cannot say this is a flawless masterpiece. Doctor Zhivago is still an excellent epic romance film from the peerless director David Lean.",

            "content": "Falling back to the theme of \"impossible love\" that he examined in Brief Encounter (1945), director David Lean tries to situate his investigation within the epic drama that was the Russian Revolution.  But in doing so, he doesn't quite manage to capture the political or philosophical dynamics at play in the context; instead, the communists are evil ideologues (or pragmatically partisan) and the deposed rich are sympathetic victims of the sweeping changes.  Omar Sharif's Zhivago stakes out a detached middle ground, avoiding involvement - until he can't.  He feels like the moral center of the film, using his medical skills to assist wherever he can, especially in contrast to the evil Komarovsky (played by Rod Steiger) who uses people whenever he can.  But then even Zhivago takes a wrong turn, falling for nurse volunteer Lara (Julie Christie) during a six month stay in an army hospital despite the fact that he is married (to Tonya played by Geraldine Chaplin) and has a young son.  Lara had been previously exploited by Komarovsky and then married to revolutionary Pasha (Tom Courtenay) who is reportedly killed in the war.  She also has a child.  After everyone is exiled to the Urals, the impossible love blooms again, for a short while. Zhivago writes poetry about it (which we never hear). All of this is told years later in flashback by Alec Guinness's General Yevgraf (somehow the half-brother of Zhivago).  So, should the audience identify with Zhivago? Or with Lara? Is their love pure? I didn't see it.  But the larger sweep of the staged historical events (many extras) and Freddie Young's cinematography (gorgeous mountains) did capture my attention from time to time; I wanted badly for the style of the film to counteract the schematic nature of the script, but alas.  Yet, there is something about a 197 minute movie that demands respect and who can deny the film's popularity at the time (boffo box office)? It struck a romantic chord as hearts broke when dashing Omar Sharif and winsome Julie Christie sacrificed their love (but to what end?).",

An Epic love story set against the backdrop of World War One, the Russian Revolution, and subsequent Civil War. At a hydro-electric dam in modern (1965) Soviet Russia, General Yevgref Zhivago (Alec Guinnes) relates the story of his half brother poet/physician Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and the love of his life Lara (Julie Christie). The two star-crossed lovers lives are intertwined in pre-revolutionary and prewar Imperial Russia, in World War One, and in the postwar period of Civil War between the White Russians and the Bolsheviks. Yuri is married to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and Lara is married to the mysterious revenge-seeking Pasha/Stelnikoff (Tom Courtenay). Yuri and Lara's lives also intersect with the unscrupulous businessman Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). They couldn't film this movie in the Soviet Union due to the Cold War so Lean chose locations in Canada, Spain, and Finland for many of the epic sweeping vistas we see in this film, this is a rugged landscape that seeks to overwhelm our protagonists, But Lean does not let the visuals get in the way of a good, character-driven story. Sharif and Christie have great screen chemistry, Courtney starts out as an idealistic revolutionary and becomes an obsessed warrior, Steiger is absolutely riveting as the corrupt, leering businessman/politician who you know will switch sides at the drop of a hat, Chaplin makes an potentially forgettable role memorable as she watches her family lose everything in the wake of the revolution and then watches her husband drift into an affair with another woman, she still holds it together, and Guiness is good as always as the narrator looking for his brother's daughter and his niece in modern (1965) Soviet Russia.",

It kinda got better as it went on, but not really and for all its epic qualities it really didn't pack an emotional punch; like epics usually do. The acting, scenery (wonderful Ice land), music, outfits were great, but no depth. I didn't care for the love story or main characters. Why doesn't he even try to find his family again/what happened to Laura's child/why did Lara's mom try to kill herself? So many unanswered questions with this film. I feel there is a much better story to be told about that time and Russian ppl and this film just doesn't do justice by a long shot. How do u make a movie about the soviet revolution boring, idk but this movie accomplishes it. Movies like this frustrate the crap out of me- all the ingredients and no substance And so overrated.",

            "content": "Serving as one of David Lean's most critically acclaimed epics, Doctor Zhivago sounded like an absolute classic.\n\nDoctor Zhivago clearly has a very important story at heart, but the fact that the historical relevance and large scale of the film largely play second fiddle to the melodramatic romance between the main characters proves to weigh down the narrative. Though a large tale of suffering and war is going on in the historical context of Doctor Zhivago, the film is far more interested in being a love story. I'll admit that I'm a person who struggles to find much appeal in romantic films, but it is more so when I know there is a better story to be told beneath them which is not showing. For the first hour of Doctor Zhivago, the feature is focused on encapsulating the love story between the titular Dr. Yuri Zhivago and Lara Antipov before the story takes off. Yet even when it does, the focus is still so heavily on romantic melodrama. The romance in the film is not as melodramatic or overbearing as it was in David Lean's later epic Ryan's Daughter, but the difference is that this time around there is clearly more of a story than just the romance in the film and I wanted to see more of that. For a film to be epic, its focus has to be widespread. I find parallels between Doctor Zhivago and Reds as they are both notable epic films which deal with Russian history while there is a love story at the heart. Yet Reds dealt with its historical subject matter better and treated its characters with more relevance while Doctor Zhivago lightly touched upon all the concepts within the subject matter while keeping the passion of the romance alive. And as much as Doctor Zhivago has the best intentions, I feel that the abundance of romance is not sufficient for a large scale film which has room to be so much more. Frankly, Doctor Zhivago has a screenplay which is good at what it does, but what it does proves to be largely tedious when the feature is an extremely slow 192 minute feature. As I was not enthralled by the romance in the film, I was not enthralled by so much of it and instead attempted to find solace in the other assets. Unfortunately, the value of everything else was limited by the confines of the story.\nThere is no denying the powerful sense of style behind Doctor Zhivago. It is to be expected that as a David Lean film, Doctor Zhivago is going to be a spectacle. When he delivers on that, it is no surprise and is most welcome. For one thing, the scenery in Doctor Zhivago is just beautiful. I didn't expect anything less from David Lean because he always manages to illuminate the beautiful locations he works in, no matter the subject matter of the film. Be it as great as Lawrence of Arabia or lacklustre as Ryan's Daughter, David Lean knows what it takes to truly make a film epic and he starts with effective on-location scenery as his base. Even though much of the scenery has a monochromatic feel to it with a distinctive feeling of grey, Freddie Young's cinematography is able to find life in every little shade of grey thanks to the strong lighting. Even though Doctor Zhivago was filmed mainly in Spain, the scenery feels all too convincingly Russian thanks to dedication to detail as well as extensive work with the production design and scenery. Everything is captured with a strong large-scale feeling, and so Doctor Zhivago certainly is an experience with imagery to boast about. Maurice Jarre's musical score is also a beautifully atmospheric touch that highlights the emotional themes of the film and the scale of the story very nicely.\nAnd the cast of Doctor Zhivago certainly make a powerful effort.\nOmar Shariff is a powerful lead as the titular Dr. Yuri Zhivago. With such an instinctively friendly appeal about him, Omar Shariff's natural charm easily captivates the viewers from the get go. And as a result of that, making him the led in a romantic tale seem easily appropriate. Starting from the base and building up as he develops a strong chemistry with Julie Christie, Omar Shariff's progression in developing Dr.Yuri Zhivago follows the pace of the story very well. He gently adds more and more to the character by becoming more passionate with his interactions with the surrounding cast. His physical involvement is thoroughly impressive because Omar Shariff successfully conveys a sense that he is being challenged by the harsh environment of the tale, proving his dedication to the feature really well. He never steps out of the role, delivering every single line with gentle passion and deep involvement in the subject matter without a moment of fault. Omar Shariff works brilliantly with David Lean once again, proving this time just how effectively he can carry a film as the lead with instinctive charms and strong dramatic flair, standing out as the best cast member.\nJulie Christie is also a charming presence. Dedicating herself to the romantic themes of the story, Julie Christie works hard to make a stand in such a high profile story. The best thing about her performance is the quality of her chemistry with Omar Shariff as the most predominant reason her character exists is to be the woman of the relationship at the heart of the film. Julie Christie makes for an appealing romantic lead in Doctor Zhivago as her genuine spirit for the melodrama really brings the life out of the screenplay. Julie Christie makes for a charming lead in Doctor Zhivago.\nGeraldine Chaplin and Alec Guiness also supply strong supporting efforts.\n\nSo Doctor Zhivago is another solidly cast and stylish spectacle from David Lean, but the extensive length and slow pace is weighed down by a tale excessive in melodramatic romance and not much more.",

            "content": "Epic films were a standout aspect of 1960's cinema. Filmmakers took bold risks in telling a great story with their films; hence the decade had some truly unique films. Lawrence of Arabia was one such film, another one was Doctor Zhivago, both films were directed by filmmaker David Lean, who seemed more at ease with himself directing big,, ambitious movies, therefore his work Has been some of the finest in the cinematic medium. His work would only be matched by other filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick and Sergio Leone, and the way he made a film elevated the medium to new possibilities. My favorite film of Lean's will always be Lawrence of Arabia, but with Doctor Zhivago, he crafts another grand epic that is brilliantly directed and acted. The story is set amidst the First World War as well as the Russian revolution, and it's a love story, but the way it's crafted is superb. This is a long film, and I do feel that it could have been shortened slightly.  I would say that because of this, David Lean might be an acquired taste, but to those who want n epic picture to watch, Doctor Zhivago is one of the classics in the genre, but personally, I don't think it's Lean's best, like I said, I think Lawrence of Arabia is his finest film, and he delivers something great with that one, but here he nonetheless does some good work, and he manages to craft another worthwhile epic. I loved the film, but like I said, maybe Lean could have cut his film down a bit, as three plus hours of storytelling is a bit much. Doctor Zhivago is a great accomplishment, but it's not a film that demands repeat viewers due to its length, in other words it's hard to get into, and it's not a film that has much action, because it focuses more on its performances, storytelling and it's one of those movies that takes its time for the story to unfold. I would recommend this movie to viewers that enjoy a long, ambitious film, and if you don't mind a long picture, this is worth seeing. With a great story at hand and phenomenal cast of talented actors, David Lean's crafts a great picture that reigns as one of cinema's finest works.",

It's what epic movie making is all about.\n\nI also think that you should see this on the big screen back to back with Warren Beatty's Reds. Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution, one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.\n\nThe title character, played by Omar Sharif, is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter, Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves, but naturally like a sister. \n\nThe real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy, with shall we say, some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. \n\nChristie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.\n\nZhivago knows change was inevitable, the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed, in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.\n\nI still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film, I think he would have approved.\n\nFrom the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia, David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created, you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie, you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.\n\nOther performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago, a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.\n\nDoctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories, strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory, I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.",

            "content": "The movies visual style is excellent and director David Lean's ambitions are admirable, but Doctor Zhivago falls short of Lean's more polished epic, \"Laurence of Arabia\".  The film just feels too bloated and overstretched for it's own good. While it has a few great scene's here and there, it's just too inconsistent to elevate itself to the level of a classic. Another problem with the film is Omar Shariff who although is a very talented actor, is terribly miscast for the role and sticks out like a sore thumb on the screen. I enjoyed the film overall, but I think with a stronger script, better pacing and a new lead, the film could have been far better than it was.",

Lean and his crew do their best to replicate the magic they created with LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and they almost pull it off.  I only have two problems with it.  One is I don't care for Lara, and therefore I don't see why Zhivago would throw his beautiful loving wife and mother of his children for her.  This is somewhat like saying, \"I love JAWS except for the part about the shark.\" The second problem is the ending, which implies that the Communist slaughter, persecution, death camps, and cannibalism is all worth it because Russia can now build big dams.  I am also puzzled by the time frame.  It seems that the movie is told in flashback from the vantage point of some time after Stalin, yet the 20-year-old daughter who would have been born in the early 1920s  would have to be in her 30s.  So three problems. But other than that, outstanding. Spectacle goes a long way with me, I guess.",

            "content": "The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago, and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party, he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful & mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites & the Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt, Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the worst of sufferers also'. The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm, loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's infidelity. Julie Christie plays the gorgeous & enigmatic Lara, a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile & contemptible character, who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fianc\u00c3 (C) & then wife to the misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara entrusts her own & Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely, haunting Lara's Theme.\nSupporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic & gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events, and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them, create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.",
