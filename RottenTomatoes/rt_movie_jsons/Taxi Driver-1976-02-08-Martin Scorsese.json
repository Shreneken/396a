When Travis meets pretty campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the world, first plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, then directing his attentions toward rescuing 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).",

            "content": "\"Taxi Driver\" is a movie that focuses on the disturbing and dark dilemma of a pathological, lonely isolated man, Travis Bickle ( Robert De Niro ) and his hatred for the area he lives and works in. Due to his inability to sleep at night Travis takes a job driving a yellow cab around the squalor and underbelly of 1970's New York. It's here, particularly in the evenings, he experiences the crime, drugs and prostitution that are everyday life in and around the Big Apple. It's these experiences that intensifies Travis's unhinged thoughts as he begins to deteriorate mentally.\u00a0\n\nIn all this squaller and degradation Travis sees the angelic vision of a woman wearing a white dress. Drawn to the woman, Betsy ( Cybill Shepherd ) , who works as a campaigner for the Senator running for President, Travis makes contact and they end up going on a number of dates. However his mental state frightens her somewhat and she refuses to have anything more to do with him. After taking a fare ( Martin Scorsese himself ) who describes his desire to murder his wife and her lover, Travis is somewhat inspired to purchases a number of guns and embark on a strict training regime. One evening a young prostitute, Iris ( Jodie Foster ) tries to enter Travis's cab, unfortunately she is quickly stopped and forcibly removed by her pimp. Travis repeatedly sees the young girl and eventually pays the pimp to meet up with her. Travis, convinced that Iris is trying to escape her pimp, \u00a0tries to talk her into leaving the life of prostitution and either return to her parents or just get away to somewhere safe.\n\nThe final act sees the unstable Travis attempt to assassinate the Presidential candidate only to be foiled. As Travis makes his getaway he focuses on the young prostitute and after a violent bloodbath is heralded as a hero rather than a nut for saving the young girl and shooting a pimp and mafioso. Once Travis has recovered from the injuries sustained in the gun battle, he returns to his work as a cabbie. It's now we see the return of Betsy, unaware of Travis's attempt at assassination, she is in awe of his heroism and local celebrity status. \"Taxi Driver\" concludes with Travis driving away from Betsy and glaring maniacly at some unseen event. Unnervingly this final act shows that Travis's nightmare is not over but is destined to be repeated at some time later.\n\nBernard Herman's soundtrack , Scorsese's direction, Paul Schrader's script and the outstanding performances makes for a wonderful movie experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll.",

            "content": "\"Taxi Driver\" - riskily watched for not knowing which time - turned out to be unexpectedly topical, fresh, still with the feeling that it is superbly realized and quite enjoyable - without being boring - to watch. Mainly due to the universal message: things are going wrong in the state, a disease is rolling over it, like a cancer, engulfing wider and wider circles of society, and it is the duty of the citizen to stand on the side of law, justice and other established values and express his opposition through vigorous action. The hero of the painting - a former Vietnam War veteran - opposes in a peculiar way. He takes a gun in his hands and intends to use it against - as it seems to him - the source of evil and decay, that is, the presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. A timely assassination thwarted by security causes Travis Bickle (the timeless Robert DeNiro!) to change the object of his \"interest.\" He turns to his newfound acquaintances: the Hispanic pimp Sport (good ol' Harvey Keitel) and the place and people associated with the pimps. With one exception: not against the juvenile prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster's screen debut), whom he sympathized with and tried to help, including by drawing her away from her friends organizing the procedure and away from practicing \"the world's oldest profession.\" \nThe controversy is that in order to fix the world, the protagonist himself inflicts pain and suffering on others, and it makes little difference that his subjects are themselves caught up in evil and lawlessness and are actually guilty of it themselves. \nAs Chicago Reader reviewer Jonathan Rosenbaum described the picture in January 2000 : \"Perhaps the most formally thrilling - as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic - film in Martin Scorsese's career.\" It's hard to disagree with that opinion. _Witek Rusin",

Martin Scorsese's disturbing look at the life of a troubled, disenfranchised, unreliable narrator is engaging and visceral and powerful.   The use of New York City as a secondary character in the movie is palpable and enhances the story and the viewing.   Almost 50 years later the performances of DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster really still resonate.   The film was so impactful that it created its own subgenera, of sorts.   While we can't help but be disgusted but what DeNiro's Travis Bickel has become we understand that the foundation upon which his dysfunctional responses are based are not misguided.   This character is often parodied and copied, but for his mannerisms and his classic lines; however, there is a depth and sympathetic quality to this character that only this Director and this actor could have brought out.   I love Jeff Bridges, the original choice for the film, but he would have been a very different Travis Bickel.  Watch this one, or watch it again.",

In the case of Taxi Driver, the subject is Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a New York cabbie who descends into madness as the result of his perceived reality of the city.  Filled with solid performances (De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, etc.), an ominous score from Bernard Herrmann, a remarkable script from Paul Schrader and Scorsese's distinct direction, Taxi Driver is a true classic.",

He began using his skills and his yearning to become a change in the world for the good of an innocent person. The rapists and prostitutes, how he views the city as filthy, as well as how Travis reacts to this situation. He is seen so suddenly wanting to help the young prostitute and save her at all costs. After being in the war, he felt impotent as if he had nothing to look forward to in life, though he began to view this opportunity of saving young Iris as a mission to make the world a lot less dirty in his mentality. I found it very intense how he resorted to violence very quickly, and even though his actions were very dark, he planned to do it all for a good cause. Even though he chose to save that young girl, his mindset was still set in a very dark and twisted way killing any who were in his way. You can see that his insatiable mentality was present the whole movie however it began shifting into a more heroic aspect. \nOverall, this movie was not a movie that I would further recommend. I think it had to do with the dark and unexpected plot of the movie, how it was also very oddly timed. Even though this movie was produced in 1976, a long time ago compared to 2022, the plot is not something that would be unbelievable in today's world, I do think that it is something that many would consider as relevant in today's time. However as a young viewer I think that the movie seems slow paced and personally I would get uninterested in many parts of the film. I would rate this movie a 5/10 stars because the idea that he starts using his twisted and dark skills for the better of a young girl is a very deep aspect of the movie, it is almost as if Travis begins to portray characteristics of a hero.",

Showing up to the same hotel that he saw Iris not too long ago, he goes rampant, killing everyone that is involved in this, being the person that rents out the room and Matthew, the person that keeps her locked up in this job and is supposedly her lover. He also kills the person Matthew reports too, and a huge amount of bloodshed, whilst he also manages to take many gunshots himself. Once the bloodshed is done Travis immediately tries to shoot himself by sticking a gun below his jaw, and pulls the trigger to find that he used all the cartridges in his revolver. This part stuck to me because it makes it look like he wants no part in this world anymore, and after doing what he thinks is just he wants to leave it all with no hesitation. Then the police show up finding all the dead bodies, and finding Travis bleeding out, but smiling and pointing at his own head with a hand soaked in blood, signaling that he pulls the trigger on the imaginary gun multiple times. This stuck with me because the whole scene is kind of haunting, that a man smiles in the face of mass bloodshed, and smiles as he signals how badly he wants to take his own life.\nMy overall reaction to this movie is that it is enjoyable to a certain demographic. The production quality is pretty high and the plot is not completely bonkers, meaning it is understandable why Travis thinks the way he does and why he does the things he did. My issue is that this movie is now romanticized and I'm not sure how to feel about that.",

Then instead of Travis dying in the shootout, we see him alive and labeled a local hero in the news clippings and the letter from Iris's parents. Labeling Travis a hero this makes him believe that they agree with his ideology of New York and how it needs to be cleaned up. Doing so this glorifies his aggressive/ violent behavior in his attempt to save Iris.\n\nMy overall reaction to the film was that it was an interesting topic and it is something I wouldn't have picked to watch on my own. I believe it is a good quality film that mentions many serious issues like veterans' mental health, prostitution, and drugs.

Travis was prompted to acquire a gun from a passenger who intended to murder his cheating wife. Travis isn't the kind of person who exhibits a violent trait, as was made clear at the beginning of the film. He will exert all of his effort and energy to get what he wants, with a good intention, such as going after a woman. But after being turned down by Betsy, he revealed his true colors. For most individuals, having a gun implies being able to defend oneself from harm, but Travis had other aims, such as plotting to assassinate presidential candidate Palestine. Then, when he saw a child being used for prostitution, his behavior abruptly changed once more, this time with a new goal in mind.\n\nI wouldn't suggest the movie Taxi Driver to anyone who doesn't enjoy dark, twisted drama because it has a lot of sexual and violent content. Despite the fact that the movie seems to be popular, I believe it drifted too close to comedy. The movie's plot appears to be chaotic, cutting between many issues such as assassinating presidential candidate to rescuing a child prostitute. Despite being fairly nicely done, I found it difficult to follow. Instead of providing a different pathway that takes the audience down a different road, I would have preferred for the film to concentrate on one scene and expand from there.",

            "content": "What enthralls me the most about Taxi Driver is Robert DeNiro's portrayal of Travis, a man whose way of thinking is contingent on a worldview of shallowness. Travis suffers from a distinct mental cotton; he's been forgotten by wider society, an outcast with no meaningful connections. The tragedy of Travis as a character is his incapableness of recognizing his source of pain, which ultimately leads him to exercise his cowboy power fantasy. Throughout the film, it's clear how Travis perceives the citizens of New York: \"Scum\" \"Venal\" and \"junkies\". However, Travis is a man of contradictions, he recognizes the \"poisons\" within his life yet falters towards them time-and-time-again. Travis is depraved, sick, and just as lowly as those he lambasts and comes into conflict with during the film. Watching Travis regress into a culmination of hyper-masculine attributes and claim a sense of duty to wipe clean the \"scum of new york\" is peak poetic emotional torture. \n\nAll in all, Taxi Driver is a cinematic classic and a must-watch for everyone who wants to get into films. Travis Bickle is a terrific character study of how a character struggles with mental illness, whose only means of exercising this sickness is through a hyper-masculine mission to reclaim a semblance of control. Taxi driver has solidified itself as one of my all-time favorite movies and one of the most influential films I've consumed. To avoid sounding like a broken record, I'll end this review by recommending you watch Taxi driver right now, I promise you won't regret it.",

The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

After signing up for the job, we soon perceive Travis's growing urge for violence. Travis suffers from an existential crisis that presents for us this troubled and displeased figure. My sensation for this movie exhibits with the brilliant dialogue, beautiful camera shots, and the flow of the story. Foremost of the movie's dialogue comes from Travis, narrating his thoughts that attribute to his disgust towards the urban decay of the city. The colorful cinematography that I think the movie nailed the best is spectacular. Especially when Travis is in the taxi. The camera's still, slow motion shots of the deranged streets put us into the vision of Travis. Lastly, the way the story moved was great. Every bad thing that has happened to Travis leads to his rampage at the end of the movie. Travis meets Betsy, but is left by her repulsion, which makes him angry. Travis witnesses countless acts of prostitution all over the city, making him a little more unhinged throughout the story. When Travis encounters Iris, a child prostitute, he's aware at how heinous that is, and he acts about it. I cannot stress this enough, Taxi Driver is a work of art that depicts the nuisances with modern society.",

Has the medium of film ever offered us a more stunningly ironic ending in conjunction with such a horrifyingly ominous and yet captivating buildup? In truth, many of these qualities emerge onto the screen as though projected directly through the filter of Travis Bickle's troubled and vulnerable soul, staining us all with queasy anticipation of his looming transgressions and rendering us strangely complicit in the process. As far as exercises in alienation go, \"Taxi Driver\" easily measures up among the most shocking and memorable of them, leaving an indelible impression on the viewer which is inevitably alluring and disturbing.",

The only thing I struggle with is the sad reality of the Travis Bickel character. I fear we see too many like him in the news, committing horrific crimes that they may not always receive proper punishment for. Sadly, the message has not changed very drastically from '76 until now. \nDe Niro is wonderful, he played the characters wild imaginations and dark fantasy/actions to a tee.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's masterpiece shrouded in smoke and sympathy for the deluded.\n\nMartin Scorsese's psychological crime drama Taxi Driver (1976) remains one of my favorite films of all time as it perfectly captures disillusioned youth getting radicalized into violent vigilantes due to their PTSD, depression, boredom, isolation, loneliness, rejection, social awkwardness, poverty, rage, and frustrations.\n\nTaxi Driver will disturb you with Scorsese's direction of a vicious and unforgiving world, while Robert De Niro will amaze you with his subtle and empathetic portrayal of emotionally volatile taxi driver Travis Bickle. De Niro finds Travis' frustrations and quiet thoughts as well as his bursts of violence and sudden misunderstandings. You completely buy De Niro being this insecure and odd young man turning into a murder happy vigilante. Taxi Driver is Martin Scorsese's greatest film with his captivating direction and Robert De Niro's best acting performance with a multitude of emotions being conveyed by De Niro.\n\nJodie Foster is outstanding in an early child actress supporting role as the child escort Iris Steensma. She's full of life and playfulness, while also conveying how hurt and uncomfortable Iris is with her life as a young lady of the night. Foster already displays her effortless charm, intense stares, adorable personality, nuanced understanding of her character, and deft versatility as the eager and traumatized Iris. Albert Brooks is unrecognizable as political campaign stooge and total square Tom. He's quite funny in Taxi Driver actually. Harvey Keitel is unsettling and fearsome as Iris' sleazy pimp Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins. Keitel's creepy words of endearment when he's trying to seduce and keep Iris under his power is truly revolting and effective acting.\n\nCybill Shepherd is quite lovely as the political rallying girl Betsy, who is too nice and normal for Travis' demented mind. She is perfectly aloof and intrigued by Travis' advances, which at first seem sweet and unorthodox, then perverse, unaware, and disgusting when Travis takes her to a porno theater for a movie. Peter Boyle's snarky and ignorant Wizard thinks he's so clever, which is why he comes across all too sleazy and uninformed. He gives Travis honest advice though that life is pointless so try to have fun and enjoy your lot in life.\n\nLeonard Harris' too neat and tidy Senator Charles Palantine is omnipresent in Taxi Driver and when Travis meets him he's totally phony and disinterested until Travis' mad raving about New York's repugnant smells and filth horrify Palantine. I like how he never gives any real policies, just catchy slogans and empty promises like you'd expect from Paul Schrader's nihilistic script. You can see Robert De Niro's real wife at the time, Diahnne Abbott, cameo as the blunt adult film theater concession girl. I adore Martin Scorsese's cameo as the raving husband cab fare that makes Robert De Niro listen to his ramblings about his cheating wife he wants to kill. It's hilarious, but also gripping as Scorsese feels genuinely unhinged and sinister. \n\nFurthermore, Murray Moston is so eerie as Iris' \"Time Keeper.\" Steven Prince's charismatic gun salesman is a riot to watch sell De Niro's Travis Bickle a briefcase full of arms. Martin Scorsese's real parents Catherine Scorsese and Charles Scorsese's even cameo as the voice of Iris' parents reading their letter to Travis at the end of Taxi Driver.\n\nScorsese's dreamy direction leaves me breathless as I feel doused in the smoky nights and neon lights of Scorsese's 1970's New York underbelly. Charles Rosen's art direction has characters glaring at nothing and New York's gritty look soaks into everything. Scorsese focuses on characters staring at each other for long pauses and holding on unnerving shots all over the city. Composer Bernard Herrmann's final film score is majestic, romantic, and forlorn with his moody jazz music to accompany Martin Scorsese's shadowy film noir directorial style.\n\nScorsese's direction is so striking and creative. He plays with characters appearing and disappearing out of shadows like demons or scenes fading in and out like Taxi Driver is just one big dream sequence. From cinematographer Michael Chapman's stunning shots that constantly focus on Travis leering at a girl or staring off into space, you are compelled by Scorsese's innovative direction in each mysterious scene. I love how Chapman has the camera on the side mirrors of the taxi cab or in the rearview mirror for all these neat perspectives of Travis. You never stop looking at New York, Travis, the girls, or this cruel, bleak world depicted in Taxi Driver.\n\nFor example, Scorsese's ambiguous ending leaves you to wonder what becomes of Travis Bickle the troubled taxi driver as his ideal life is realized or did he die or perhaps get arrested? Taxi Driver constantly fills my head with possible endings and lets you in on Travis' bad thoughts, so that you never let yourself wander your mind into dangerous or hurtful worlds. Taxi Driver wants people to connect and be decent to one another because Travis feels more like a cautionary tale and character study all in one brilliant picture.\n\nWriter Paul Schrader's script brings out his social outcast tendencies, cynical view of society at large, and a tender empathy for his lead character Travis Bickle, who clearly suffers from PTSD from Vietnam, loneliness with no friends or girlfriend, rejection from every girl he knows, inability to express himself, poor wages with no mobility as a taxi driver that he only does to occupy himself away from his darker thoughts, and general sexual frustration with only attending porno theaters for movies. \n\nTravis Bickle's psychosis eventually leads to an attempted political assassination and street justice for a pimp and his cronies, but Schrader's beautiful script is intense, thoughtful, funny, scary, and shocking with every new dark corner he chooses for Travis to explore in his mind. Paul Schrader's story for Taxi Driver is excellent, but it is his pensive and escalating writing that engrosses you with Travis' inner monologues to himself in particular.\n\nEditors Tom Rolf and Melvin Shapiro trick you with their sharp hard cuts and gentle dreamy editing style to lull you into a sense of security and strict narrative. I think you really get lost in Travis' mind as much as your own thoughts while watching Taxi Driver. It's an absorbing 114 minutes that feels like a brief moment. Taxi Driver really stays with you and I cannot stop thinking about it no matter how many times I revisit Scorsese's enigmatic film.\n\nHerbert F. Mulligan's set decoration makes everywhere in New York look disgusting, dirty, and disturbing. Rick Alexander, Gordon Davidson, James Fritch, Sam Gemette, David M. Horton, Frank E. Warner, and Tex Rudloff's sound design is neat with screeching taxi cab tire wheels and shouting in the distance all around New York. You get loud gunshots piercing your head to quiet conversations being had in still moments around the city. \n\nIn short, you get the noise of New York City as well as the painful isolation of a lonesome apartment or political crowd that is all too impersonal. Ruth Morley's costumes are phenomenal from Robert De Niro's mohawk and army jacket iconic aesthetic to Jodie Foster's playful child prostitute outfits and Cybill Shepherd's ladylike suits with style. Dick Smith's make-up gives De Niro a sleepless and unhinged look throughout Taxi Driver.\n\nIn conclusion, Taxi Driver is so genius because every direction, actor, actress, and crew member gave it their all with sterling decisions and cool choices. Taxi Driver will never leave you.",

I had a more positive perception. it's an obvious critique of the USA, particularly in the conversation between the driver and the candidate. how can the US export its way of life and fight other countries, when inside it is corrupt and filthy? the drama of PTSD is also an important feature as is De Niro's brilliant performance. the ending is once again Scorcese bowing to the master Antonioni and was the part I was most thrilled with. But overall, I feel it did not age well and it is a bit overrated. or maybe it is just an American thing that I, a foreigner, will never understand. don't feel I wasted my time but enjoyed other Scorcese films better.",

It's one of cinema's outstanding character studies, led by a monumental performance by Robert De Niro.\n\nThe film shines in its dark themes of isolation and alienation. It shows how the mind can spiral in negative ways when faced with nothing. In this case, De Niro's character suffers with PTSD after being in Vietnam. His performance is just perfect in every way, he embodies the struggles he is going through and he takes us into the mind of Travis Bickle. It's his show.\n\nThe writing from Paul Schrader equally with De Niro's performance is the films biggest strength. His writing paints Travis as a stable guy in some aspects but he is of course far from that, but the writing is so well done in many ways. Kudos too Schrader for his script. \n\nIf there was any slight complaints for me, the pacing was slightly slow in places and I don't know how I feel about the ending (although that may change upon a second viewing) \n\nAll in all, a great film. \n\nQuote - \u2018Your only as healthy as you feel' - Travis",

Travis  enters a corrupt world that is full of: prostitutes, pimps, scumbags, and shady people which is ironic considering that he's living and working in the Big Apple  and not sin city. The environment is filled with violence including violence that Travis enforces and sex in brothels and pornographic films. There is a moment in the film where Travis talks to a presidential candidate named Charles Palatine about how dirty the city is and how it should be cleaned up. \n\tThe occasion where the cinematography is most radiantly used is at the opening of the film. New York City is seen through Travis's window and the lights and people look blurry. Travis is going to arrive in a very vague and suspicious world. There is another occasion where the cinematography is appropriately used for a very dramatic moment.   Travis is in a brothel laying on a couch after he's been shot in the neck. The cops arrive and there's a pan with the camera that shows a bird's eye view of Travis, the cops, and everyone else frozen.\n\tThe actors in Taxi Driver give plenty of depth  with the characters they play  , particularly Robert Deniro as Travis Bickle. Robert Deniro gives depth to Travis, especially with his eyes. There are many shots of just Travis's eyes throughout the film and his eyes look suspicious and as if they don't know what to expect or who to trust. Iris is a character that you know has a ton of guilt, but Jodie Foster makes her have plenty of innocence as well once she gets into Travis's cab. \n\tTaxi Driver has significant meaning with its: script, cinematography and acting.",

After all he suffers from insomnia.\nThat's not all though as he slowly works his way to arming himself to particularly dangerous levels.\nLongtime collaborators Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro in one of their first entries from the 1970s.\nTravis is a former marine now working as a taxi driver in the big city. He then sees a beautiful woman Betsy as a campaign associate. Inspired by her cause Travis then sets out to \"clean\" the world so to speak even so much as befriending and attempting to rescue a young prostitute on the streets. This is a nihilistic tale of isolation and reaction. \nHe's cabbie by night but also secretly a vigilante. \nTravis begins to lose his touch with reality as he self-destructs.\nSomeone should become a person like other people. Maybe a huge rain should come down and clean up the streets full of scum. Loneliness is perhaps inevitable for some, it's what inhabits their whole world giving a messy look at the people surrounding them. \nScorsese portrays a perfect example of an outsider that's unstable, introverted, socially inept, and psychologically imbalanced. Plus he lets us inhabit the hideousness of the filth of New York City setting. \nMany theories about how the film can range from a paranoid hallucination of a lonely man, a feminist work about the unstable ideals of masculinity, or an existential exploration of modernity. It's not 100% clear but that's how brilliant Scorsese is with his storytelling.\nWe see the perspective from inside the taxi as Travis himself sees the 'animals' of the world.\nIt's sort of like an extension of a drug induced dream or vision.\nDeNiro is top of the line here in his early years, the smooth jazz score is fitting, there's some good philosophical and political commentary, and still holds one of the most iconic lines in cinema history.\nPerhaps it's the lack of dogmatism that has the movie endure a continuing legacy for so long; there's always going to be judgement through eyes reflecting back like a taxi's rearview mirrors. One will always place themself behind the wheel and make their own view of Travis's mindset.\nGritty, disturbing, well-shot, and pays off tremendously digging into someone's urban indifference.\nA must-see for cinephiles!",

I don't know if it is the excellent acting, the smart story, the characters or just everything together, but this movie has some sort of a special charm... it is a magnificient experience, really. I loved the plot, something that I absolutely loved was the main character, Travis Bickle's evolution. Throughout the movie we get to se his descent into a darker path and his mental problems (which begin to be very evident at some point). I love that justice element that the movie has, a dark, more brutal justice that the main character wants to apply. It has this urban and in some way familiar environment while also featuring new, darker and more violent tones. The movie is entertaining from start to finish and it is thought provoking as well. I won't even talk about Robert DeNiro's performance because we all know that it's simply marvelous. It is one of the best performances that I have seen from DeNiro so far. 10/10.

First off I would like to acknowledge that Robert de Niro played the shit out of this character and it was great seeing his evolution but that being said, I do have some critical points to make. The movie showcases Travis, a young taxi driver with not much of a purpose in the 70s in New York. He's sour rounded by scum bags who just care about money and sex and he feels like he has a purpose in this world. Travis meets up with Besty, a girl working at a campaign office. He goes out with her for awhile but eventually after taking her to lets say- the wrong place she dumps him. Travis begins to see the world as disgusting and full of irony, however the main plot doesn't arrive until an hour and a half later which is the real problem I have with this movie. Travis meets a minor prostotute and spoiler alert, eventually takes down the people abusing her for cash. Keep in mind that the main plot didn't come until an hour and a half almost. Regardless, it builds Travis character arc very well and the ending was good. Again, the movie just seemed to run way to long and it could have been cut shorter and parts of the ending felt rushed at times. I was also left confused as to why he wanted to kill the senator. Parts like that tried to convey a message that just didn't seem to reach me on a metaphorical level.  Overall, the movie was a good movie, maybe not one I would watch again unless I reached the peak of boredom, but it wasn't a bad movie at all.",

He was weird, socially stunted, creepy, and unlikable. The film was a series of porn theater scenes, awkward conversations full of dialogue that sounded like it was written by someone with a single digit IQ, and a violent, bloody conclusion. The music was grating, the cinematography cheesy, and the plot impossible to determine.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this movie is that Jodie Foster's acting at such a young age was commendable.",

I think he may have been insane when he took the city, but as the movie unfolds he falls in love with a Presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd).  Travis eventually works up the nerve to ask her for coffee and then on a date.  On the date, he takes her to a movie in one of the city's many porno theaters back in the mid-70s.  Of course, that ends that romance before it even got off the ground.  \n\nIn the meantime, Travis has run into an underage prostitute (Jodie Foster) and works to help her leave the business, which she does not seem to want to quit.  She seems to have turned her pimp (Harvey Keitel) into a father figure although he is nothing like a father.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but the violent (and I mean violent \u2013 it even shocked me how graphic this was) way the movie ends and what happens next shocked me.  I did not see that coming and for a movie that is this old I was surprised I had never heard how it ended.  It is quite a controversial ending and, if you watch it, you will learn why.\n\nDeNiro, Shepherd and Foster are incredible and their acting is first rate in \"Taxi Driver.\"  DeNiro plays the sad, lonely taxi driver so well that you believe he is that character.  It is crazy that he did not win a Best Actor Oscar for the performance.  Even the city of New York City plays a role in all this \u2013 a gritty, tough one.  I am so glad I finally watched this one.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" is a bold, hard-hitting and unsettling masterpiece that sheds light on pertinent issues facing society today. With his fifth feature, legendary director Martin Scorsese crafted a mesmerizing film about vigilantism that holds up today as a classic. Using captivating cinematography, Scorsese draws viewers into the world of an alienated taxi driver in New York City. From intimate close-ups to anxiety-inducing panning shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the film an ominous and foreboding atmosphere that captures the dark side of the city. In terms of writing, the film is elevated to another level by a superb screenplay. Paul Schrader's screenplay is sensational, and expertly uses voice-over narration to put viewers into the deranged mindset of the main character. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances of his career as Travis Bickle. With haunting expressions, he conveys the anger, loneliness and pent-up frustrations of a taxi driver that descends into insanity. The supporting cast, which includes the fantastic Jodi Foster, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"Taxi Driver\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a movie that is meant for everyone. The film tackles controversial topics such as vigilantism, gun violence and child prostitution that may upset some viewers. Nevertheless, fans of Martin Scorsese will definitely enjoy \"Taxi Driver\" and so will lovers of Cinema. Nearly 45 years after its release, the film remains ahead of its time with a powerful message that is relevant today. At a time when gun violence remains a pertinent issue in the world, it's a cautionary reminder of the dangers that vigilantes like Travis Bickle pose to society till this day.",

All those neon lights and sidewalks were ominously colourful, deflcting a certain aesthetic commonly seen in Martin's work. The character of Travis is also one of the most worth-studying in film history. He was, indeed, a walking contradiction, partly true and mostly non-fiction. As unpredictable and morally gray as he was, Travis somehow managed to let himself went far out of social borderline and still be relatable, he was a determined idealist without a purpose, a dreamer drenched from all the sleep and a tickling bomb constantly waiting to blow up. Taxi Driver as a film didn't give him a real solution or character growth, at the end, it simply puts him back into the old routine again, which is also understandable and realistic. There are few movies that can both show a disturbing fact and make it look beautiful, a perfect mess and a late night come-back. All the respect to Martin Scorsese & De Niro.",

Side note, I am definitely looking at Todd Phillip's The Joker differently now as the similarities were hard to ignore. (And a mea culpa for watching The Joker before I had ever seen Taxi Driver)",

I believe this movie is a character study of masculinity and him wanting to be like everyone one else and wanting him to be a hero. I loved the cinematography in the movie and the colors in the movie and the tints they used and in the end, there is a tint of light orange and it, in my opinion, means that he has become what he wanted to be a hero. I thought the acting was pretty good even from Jodie Foster was pretty good for a kid. My only critique is that at the very end there is a shoot-off scene, I feel like they could have done it better, after all, they build it up the whole time and I feel it could have had more weight on the story. There are a few weird shots but it has been 40 years since the movie came out and film has changed so I don't think that is a problem. Overall I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone.",

The acting in this film is tremendous on all parties involved, the music is intense and fits perfectly with the story and setting of the film using kind of a jazz feel to it. The film's climax is one of the best scenes in cinema which will definitely be implanted into the viewer's mind. The film also has a great ending which leaves the viewer wondering what really happened. As I mentioned earlier the acting in this film is great from all parties involved. Jodie Foster does a great job as Iris. I was very impressed with her performance throughout the film, usually, kid actors don't pull off a convincing character but every once in a while they really do. This is one of those instances. Harvey Keitel also does a great job as Sport, he delivers a great performance. Even though he has very little screentime he still leaves a great impression on the audience and creates a despicable, yet memorable character. The film also has many great scenes throughout such as the all-time classic \"You talkin' to me?\" scene, the opening scene where that taxi is emerging from the cloud and steam which covers it, the ending scene, especially the climax of the film, and even the dates that De Niro takes Cybill Shepherd's character Betsy on (Shepherd also does a tremendous job).

Schrader's script, which was inspired by such diverse works as Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground and Harry Chapin's song, \"Taxi,\" is a masterful psychological study, the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings. Even though more than 4 decades have passed since the film's release there is nothing dated about Taxi Driver. The message still rings as true as ever, and the characters are as shockingly believable as in the mid-seventies. The ending is a shocker to the psyche- Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Travis into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen.",

            "content": "I had my reservations going into this film because despite all off the glowing reviews that this film has received and the wide cultural impact it has had Mean Streets (1973) was held in equal esteem and I was terribly disappointed by that. All of my expectations were shattered however as I was completely engrossed in Taxi Driver throughout and it deserves to be considered one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe film is about a mentally unstable young man, Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro in a career-defining role, who projects his pent-up rage on the world around him in various forms. His hatred for New York City is deepened when Betsy, Cybill Shepherd, a woman whom he has had a brief affair with who works for a political campaign, breaks up with him cruelly. In response he directs his anger at her employee, political candidate Charles Palantine, planning to murder him in an expression of his rage. Jodie Foster's young prostitute, Iris, in a complicated relation with her pimp, Harvey Keitel, becomes a major character surprisingly late in the film but she too becomes a figure for Bickle to project his rage through.\n\nAs with every great Scorsese film, of which there are many, he is a able to capture an environment and a mood so accurately that you understand how Bickle feels about this \u00e2~dirty, stinking' city that he lives in. The beauty of Michael Chapman's cinematography shines through even as he captures the grime of the streets, the overly bright lights and the darkness of the world that Bickle inhabits. New York City is often a focus of Scorsese's work but unlike the later Gangs of New York (2002) this film feels very present in it's time period instead of looking hermetically sealed and heavily staged this film's design feels more natural and authentic linking to the dark, nihilistic tone of the film itself.\n\nBickle as a character is written as a complex and relatable figure by Paul Schrader but the story around him allows us to be horrified by his actions and the world around him as the film ends with his actions being glorified. We understand almost immediately that Bickle is mental and simmering with rage that he is willing to direct anywhere. One of the more heartbreaking scenes of the film features Bickle's voiceover as he complains of his disappointment with Betsy, \"She's just like all the others.\" Bickle and Betsy are obviously not a good match and yet we want them to be together if only to see the lonely and obviously troubled Bickle, he can't sleep, experience some happiness. The loss of this anchoring figure causes Bickle to release his rage and although we understand by the end that Bickle would still have given into his violent tendencies at one point or another at this point in the film Schrader's screenplay causes us to believe that Betsy is a viable option for Bickle.\n\nDe Niro is fantastic as a crazed maniac hiding his inner psycho under a thin fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of neuroses and awkward interactions punctuated by occasional moments of extreme confidence such as when he asks Betsy out. He appears perfectly cast here as he is able to appear innocent whilst also having murderous tendencies and he delivers his dialogue in a naturalistic but dramatic style and we feel for him and fear him at once. Foster is of course wonderful playing her role with precocious grace and is both a projection of Travis' fantasies and a fully realized character, largely due to Foster's brilliance. Cybill Shepherd, an actress whose abilities I doubt when playing \u00e2~serious' roles like The Lady Vanishes (1979), is well-cast in a role that requires her to look good and be shallow. The performances have all been written about ad nauseam but they are deserving of this honor.\n\nThis film should watched in full, multiple times and enjoyed and analyzed so as to fully appreciate this truly great film. Rocky (1976) won Best Picture in 1977 but this film and Network (1976), I am not a huge fan of All the President's Men (1976), are the more intelligent, complex films and were more deserving of recognition. This is his sixth greatest film because it is a far more involving film that Mean Streets and is a prime example of Scorsese's technical abilities and Schrader's fantastic screenwriting.",

Like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver features Robert De Niro in top form. From his first scene in Taxi Driver, De Niro is Travis Bickle, a 26-year old ex-Marine searching for work that will keep him up all night as a means of combating insomnia. At the outset, Travis is a lonely, disillusioned man who can still function within the \"normal\" constraints of society. As time passes, however, Travis becomes increasingly alienated from the world around him, spiraling into a state of dissociated delusion. He sees New York City as a place of urban decay populated by \"animals\" and \"scum\" that need to be swept away. De Niro's performance is so perfectly-tuned that we in the audience don't have a moment's doubt or disbelief about what's taking place in Travis' troubled mind. 9/10 (One of the finest character sketches in cinema history).",

Martin Scorsese is my altogether FAVORITE film director. Scorsese has made numerous outstanding films and Taxi Driver is no exception. This film is terrific! While not a movie for everyone's individual tastes, this film still is one of the greatest cinematic achievements to ever be accomplished! \"Taxi Driver\" has such an original screenplay, an amazing score, & yes an all star cast! Robert De Niro is a phenomenal actor and he brings his A game for this role. This is also by far Jodie Foster's most iconic role as well and she is an amazing cast choice, a controversial choice at the time but still she delivers a great performance! Every character in this movie is a blast to watch! Cybill Shepard is charming & very welcoming to see in a movie such as this. Albert Brooks is fun to watch & has some actually funny lines! Also Harvey Keitel shows up in this movie & he is amazing & entertaining as hell! The director Martin Scorsese makes a cameo in the film & it is by far one of his most memorable moments ever! The cinematography is brilliant plus the utter atmosphere & weight of this film is legendary. This is a must see movie if you are into film watching and/or film making. Go see this movie and see what all the buzz is about! \"Taxi Driver\" gets better & better with every viewing!",

Robert De Niro (Travis Bickle) gives a performance that isn't just among his best ever, but among the best in cinema history. It's that good. Travis is a portrait of the ugliest side of humanity and the acting is hauntingly great. Watching the character's evolution throughout the film is an experience that has rarely been matched. Though the movie doesn't have some big budget, it is shot in a way that makes the most of everything. It's gritty, just like the New York setting. Though Jodie Foster (Iris) isn't in the movie for long, she makes a lasting impression as the young prostitute. There are so many standout scenes. From the tense moments of wondering if Travis will go through with the shooting of the candidate to the bloodbath battle in the final minutes, it's intense and it all works. I appreciated how it told a story about PTSD without beating viewers over the head with it.\n\nWeaknesses: I do think that the film is put over the top by De Niro's performance. Without it, the story would lend itself to being a very good movie, but not a great one. There are several scenes that feel long and somewhat unneeded. There are a handful of moments that seem a bit over the top. I also didn't really care for Cybill Shepherd (Betsy) and her performance.\n\nOverall: It is a classic and it is a must see film because Robert De Niro gives an all-time great performance. Check it out purely to see some incredible acting, but the script is great and it's one of Scorsese's best.",

There isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't been said already. We're all familiar with the mohawk, the climactic bloodbath, and the famous quote, but there's more to the film than that. Taxi Driver isn't so much a movie but as an experience. Watching it is like experiencing a nightmare. It is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen and the most disturbing aspect comes from just how relatable it is. \n\nWe see the character of Travis Bickle in ourselves at our worst: when we are suffering, lonely, or pissed off. De Niro and Scorsese created not only one of the most iconic characters, but a living, breathing portrait of humanity that slowly crumbles under isolation and detachment in the neon hell of New York City. Travis Bickle is a modern day Sisyphus, doomed to wander the streets of hell as his life goes on over and over and over again. We watch as he slowly turns from a lost and traumatized veteran to a machine-like mass killer, and we are with him throughout the whole journey.\n\nIt doesn't have the high budget like most of Scorsese's later films, but Taxi Driver still succeeds on a technical level as well as a story level. Scorsese's direction and camerawork are on point; De Niro gives a raw, unflinching performance (not to mention the great supporting cast); Paul Schrader wrote one of the greatest screenplays of all time; the cinematography by Michael Chapman is hallucinogenic; and Bernard Herrmann delivered a fantastic jazz score which alternates between romantic and ominous. All these elements make for an engaging character study like no other.\n\nTaxi Driver takes a lot of the last third of its plot from John Ford's masterpiece The Searchers and its nice to see Scorsese pay tribute to his idol without blatantly plagiarizing (I'm talking to you Tarantino).\n\nAlthough this was made in the 70s, it is a film which doesn't age. It remains just as relevant now as it was then, if not more so.",

For a guy who spends easily half his day alone, confined within the four walls of my room, I can say I am really impressed by the way how Paul Schrader has explained him (Travis Bickle) on the paper, the director Martin Scorsese has executed him on the screen and Robert De Niro has played him in that room.\n\nYou can see the entire cast and crew excited to explore the darker side of the streets, giving it justice to what has led this here. And it is not just the present form of these scenarios that Scorsese wants to focus on. There is a road ahead (the future), De Niro present in the driver's seat and the mirror (the past) that he gazes upon every now and then.\n\nWhat I love the most about this film is how spontaneous it is. The second half, the last hour of the film feels like a one big climax ready to roll its credit any minute now. De Niro has no endgame in his mind and he is taking big life changing decisions, every day, leaving us at the brisk of our emotions, teasing us to scream out loud. The actual plot, the so-called evidence of a thread of narration that Taxi Driver offers us as a compensation, is something I don't even need. The film had won me over far before all the redemption, salvation, sacrifice and nobility theme, the conversation between his fellow drivers is a circle I happily merry-go-round around.",

            "content": "Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film, writer Paul Schrader's best screenplay, and actor Robert De Niro's best performance. De Niro plays unstable Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who the film follows down his rabbit hole of isolation, obsession, and eventual violent rage. The plot, as it is, has Bickle working nights as a NYC cab driver, becoming infatuated with pretty campaign worker, Cybill Shepherd, but when he sours that relationship due to his weird behavior, he becomes obsessed with saving pre-teen hooker Jodie Foster from her slimy pimp, Harvey Keitel. The plot could easily have become a simple Charles Bronson/grindhouse tale of urban vigilantism, but it's much more than that. Much has been written about \"Taxi Driver\" in terms of urban decay, isolation, desire, sex, misogyny, and as a critique of the media, all by others more eloquent than me, so I won't even try, but I will say that on a visceral level, the film is a ferociously disturbing piece of filmmaking. The audience is slowly drawn closer and closer to Bickle's madness, in a similar way to \"Replusion\" or \"Peeping Tom.\". The audience almost understands and sympathizes with his where his thinking is coming from and are found rooting for him against the even more despicable of characters during the film's disturbing finale. Scorsese has presented a New York City that truly is a brutal urban nightmare, but at the same time has created surreal hallucinatory vision of NYC that may only be Bickles perception of reality. Also of note, the film features memorable performances by Victor Argo, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. Additionally, this was the final film scored by Bernard Herrmann and he delivers a memorably unrelenting and oppressive score that ranks among his finest. Overall, \"Taxi Driver\" is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid, though due to it's profoundly disturbing nature will likely deny the film wide appeal.",

All of these films have something similar, as they delve into the deepest recesses of the human mind, and explore what makes people who they are and why they do what they do.  In Taxi Driver, we learn that the main character, Travis Bickle, is a Vietnam veteran who served in the marine corps during the war.  The movie starts off with him getting a job as a nighttime taxi driver in New York city, and his reasoning is that he drives around aimlessly at night anyways due to insomnia.  Travis lives a lonely life, interacting with no one except himself.  It's quickly learned that he has strong opinions about other people, mainly due to his job.  He sees the worst parts of New York, and drives around some disturbing people.  He constantly monologues how much he hates the \"scum\" of the city.  After a failed romantic attempt with his seemingly only hope to get something new, his mind begins deteriorating more and more due to isolation and the lowlifes that come out at night.  He then gets it into his mind that he has to save a twelve year old girl who's part of a prostitute ring, as he'd be doing something good while getting rid of the scum, and hopefully himself in the process.  This movie really goes into the problems of society, and how it can affect people that are already mentally unstable.  It brings you on a journey that leaves you feeling just as lonely and disturbed as Travis Bickle was during the film.",

He believes that kids should be in school, and has lost such attachment to reality that he enters adult theaters just for fun. He wants to save people. But who is he?\n\nHe is Travis Bickle, and he is the center of an intense character study. Don't come looking for an intense action thriller-come for an intelligent look into a crumbling mind, one which thinks it is the moral authority, fantasizing of being a savior through murder. Only an insane person could think this way, and Travis is, no doubt, insane. But why? Because his environment, a crime riddled New York, made him this way. After coming back from a tour of duty, to a \"filthy\" New York, no wonder he had serious issues. Practicing over and over how to kill people, how to kill a politician, how to kill pimps. But in the end, it all comes to naught, as seen in the ending. Nothing can prepare him for what awaits in the hotel.\n\nThe acting is some of the best. Just, best ever. Robert de Niro gives a phenomenal portrayal of a man who's falling apart, and regardless of the bad things he plans to do, he earns an amazing amount of sympathy with his little tics and overall good ideals. The cinematography is vibrant and beautiful, with colors popping out and staying on shots just long enough to keep attention. Some shots would drag in other, less capable films, but Martin Scorsese and Michael Chapman know when and when not to cut a shot. The sound design is eerily off-putting, with unexpected jazz throughout making the film feel like it's going one direction, then veering off in another. The music during the hotel shootout is just perfect. And finally, the writing is AMAZING. Never before have I seen such seemingly cliche dialogue been made so organic and flowing by talented actors and actresses.\n\nI entered this movie the wrong way. I was expecting an action thriller, but that's not the point. The point is to sympathize with a morally middling person who might shift from good to bad very quickly, and maybe even understand them. The closest comparison I can make is Drive, a film about a man who wants to change his life, sees an opportunity, and is nearly killed-but(debatably) lives. The simularities are loose enough to not ruin either film, but close enough to appreciate them. I don't understand the ending, and I don't want to just look it up. I want to decipher it, until I can truly understand the real genius of Taxi Driver.",

            "content": "When Howard Beale in Network urged us all to put our heads out the window and scream \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore\" in 1976, Travis Bickle pre-empted the call. Travis is one of cinema's most interesting characters, and one of its angriest, but he didn't have the eloquence of a Paddy Chayefsky script to help him voice his emotions, all he had was his violence. Of course outside of this anger, Network and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver have little in common. Taxi Driver, like so many wonderful films of its era (including Sidney Lumet's Network), got inside America's disillusioned mind, but it's no satire. Rather it's one of the most entirely disturbing and bleak portraits of a filthy society to have ever been posited.\n\nTravis is America's sullen zeitgeist come to life. He's a disturbed man, an unstable ex marine suffering from insomnia who fills his long nights making money as a cab driver in New York's seediest streets. Scorsese keeps us in a state of constant unease with his New York, a city that is at once sweltering and chilly. You can sense its grime blackening your skin as we see Travis loathingly look out his car window to the walking and talking sewerage that has snuck out from under the streets. Travis sits atop that cinematic canon of disaffected young Americans that came out of the early New Hollywood era. Like Bonnie and Clyde before him, Travis's only discernible skill is his capacity for violence, a capacity which isn't truly unveiled until late in the film, but which presides over his thoughts and lingers in the back of our minds as we listen to his narration, installing the film with a constant dread. He's increasingly sickened by the filth that lines New York, disillusioned with what the world has become, and he's obsessed with cleansing it. This anger and unceasing dirtiness of Taxi Driver's world is noticeably enclosing. To see a city so unknowably filthy, through eyes so unknowably unstable and pained, holds us at a slight emotional distance, but makes for a nightmarish visceral plunge. \n\nWhat surprises most about Martin Scorsese's much admired psychodrama is how sad it is. For all his danger and anger, Travis Bickle's story is a tragedy. There's a goodness in him, but he doesn't know how to let it out. He's too isolated, too awkward and dumb to ever find the right words. There's a moment when Travis is writing a letter to his parents to wish them a happy trio of events. There's a sincerity in his intent, an affection, but he's unsure of the specifics and his handwriting is childish. His execution fails him as it does in his social life.\n\nIt's his relationship with the angelic campaign volunteer Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) that best highlights Travis's social ineptitude. He grows infatuated, he wants to be good to Betsy, but we never give them a chance because we know Travis is just too far removed. There's a much discussed shot in the film that augments the sadness of Travis's lonely story. As Travis is caught awkwardly on the phone trying to justify an embarrassment from one of their earlier dates, Scorsese slowly pans across to a long and empty hallway as if to shy away from Travis's pain. This is the moment that Scorsese felt he should turn away from; telling, given how unflinching the film is in its gruesome final act. When an opportunity for redemption offers itself up then, in the form of teenage prostitute Iris (a terrific Jodie Foster), we sense everything is at stake for Travis. His self assigned liberation mission is as much for him as it is for the young girl with her whole life ahead of her. He has an opportunity to make worth of himself and sweep away part of that filth that teases him so relentlessly.  \n\nRobert De Niro's performance is tremendous, rendering that duplicity of sadness and scariness. He's at once vulnerable and threatening, but also brings a great enigma to Travis. Travis's mind mystifies, and it seems to hold us captive as we're aligned to his filters, seeing New York with the same contempt that he does. For all his instability, we can't help but feel Travis is right when says someone needs to clean this city up. \n\nScorsese's classic may not involve us in the action as a film like Goodfellas does, but it is a world which owns us, which haunts us with its grime and dread. It's difficult to recall such a feeling of inundation watching a film, but that's what Scorsese does. He doesn't merely show us a world; he forces us to live in it.    \n\nIf you enjoyed reading this, please head over https://filmfracas.wordpress.com for more.",

Taxi Driver was Martin Scorsese's fifth feature film but became the one that profoundly elevated the then-33-year-old director to the top rank of American filmmakers. In May of 1976, the movie won the highest prize award Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 29th Cannes Film Festival. Nominated for 4 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Robert De Niro) and received another 21 wins & 15 nominations.",

            "content": "What can be said about this film that hasn't been said already? As with all great films, Taxi Driver, arguably Scorsese's best work, is a multifaceted masterpiece, stuffed to the brim with philosophical concepts despite a minimalist plot and relatively short run-time. It's a gutsy piece too, both in terms of casting and topic, areas where the film veers into uncomfortable and challenging territory. The movie clearly has something to say about Vietnam, albeit in a more nuanced fashion than such a clear commentary as Apocalypse Now, which came three years later. Taxi Driver seems to be an urban representation of the chaos and moral upheaval after America's defeat and ideological failure in that war. Scorsese beautifully creates and narrates this disorder onto New York City, even as he clearly lays out an allusion to the state of the nation. Taxi Driver is also about a man, a veteran, struggling to come to terms with a city and country whose morality seems integrally compromised and illogical. There's a narrative here both for the man representing the tradition of the nation while also serving as a representative for a whole generation of traumatized young men who returned to a nation that had changed since they left, a nation that had become hostile to the very thing they fought for. At the same time, it's also a movie about the fundamental contrast really beginning to emerge in the 60's and 70's, that of the traditional white Christian background butting up against an increasingly diverse counterculture of ethnicity, religion and philosophical beliefs, all of which constitute the \"ghetto\" so often the target of white crusaders even today. DeNiro's character is at the crossroads here, a man who reviles this counterculture while also struggling to escape his own demons and understand Iris's (Jodie Foster) involvement in the very thing he despises. There's also an aspect of male fantasy here. DeNiro is a traditional white privileged male, in certain senses of the term. He often expects attention and understanding, despite his own neurotic and often delusional actions. He places expectations on Cybill Shepherd's Betsy, around whom he constructs a fantasy that becomes a point of obsession for him. He dreams of being a vigilante hero, endlessly toying with his weapons as a means of propping up his fragile masculinity. The entire sequence detailing his weapons is an acknowledgment of the American obsession with guns, both at home and in our wars abroad, with Scorsese not even needing to fire the weapons to show the absurdity of the whole act. DeNiro's character hopes to find purpose in violence and aggression while also struggling to find meaning in the traditional male 40 hour capitalist work week and daily grind. He considers himself to be a good guy and believes that his good nature entitles him to certain things. Scorsese is famous for his violence but Taxi Driver may be his most thoughtful film on the process. DeNiro spends an incredible amount of time imagining his role, daydreaming essentially and then crafting a swaggering persona built around his fantasy. Taxi Driver is also a deeply economic film, one of the early films to poke and prod at the supposed success of capitalistic, urban ideals. The films presents people who society expects to be happy and well adjusted. DeNiro's Travis, Betsy and Iris are all people who seem to have social roles laid out for them. Betsy adheres, DeNiro bounces back and forth while Iris bucks the system entirely. None of the characters are truly happy and Scorsese is one of the first in film to call attention to the decay of the \"American Dream\" and its subsequent promises. He also presents the desperation of people who clearly are at the end of their rope economically. For a film that took top prize at Cannes, Taxi Driver spends precious little time lingering on the lives of the white upper class, choosing instead to acknowledge that large sectors of the country simply were not able to advance socially or economically, a trend which continues to exasperate itself today. There's clearly a strong, prescient and complex examination of the increasing sexualization both of the female form and the increasingly young ages at which it occurs. This critical breakdown was eerily predictive, as we see younger and younger women featured in the fashion and movie industry as men demand more nubile objects of desire. Finally, there's a discussion here on mental illness, not in the more obvious sense detailed in later films more focused on the subject but in broader terms, the general insanity that results from urban crowding and decay, an issue that reflects itself statistically in the increased cases of mental illness in packed city environments. All of this exceptional undertones are tied together in a technically perfect film, where Scorsese uses a number of techniques to brilliant effect. There are the semi-single take shots, a sort of ancestor of the complex long takes filmmakers such as the modern visionary, Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, have used to great critical acclaim. There is the incredible top down final action shot, which is a magnificent portrayal of the carnage DeNiro unleashes. Scorsese uses a diverse and groundbreaking toolbox here and he only helps himself with a truly exceptional cast. DeNiro sets the precedent for later method actors (Bale, Leto, McConaughey and others), completely transforming himself, losing weight and changing hairstyles while adapting seamlessly into the delusional gun carrier his character becomes. DeNiro perfectly portrays the obsession, the neurotic behavior and the social awkwardness without even uttering a single word. It's an incredible performance filled with world class gravitas. Almost equally impressive is Foster, a fantastically bold casting that also served as inspiration for other films (notably, The Professional and Natalie Portman's character). And Foster delivers despite limited screentime (not unlike a later film of hers where Anthony Hopkins pulled the same trick), transforming into a street savvy but ultimately beguiled young preteen stuck in a life she can't walk away from. It's moving and her brief moments show a poise few child actors have ever been able to bring to the table. Scorsese's brilliance in casting her cannot be overstated. Shepherd and an unrecognizable Keitel round out the primary cast and each shines in their limited roles. DeNiro's arc as the Taxi Driver is so perfect here. He wallows in his delusion until the very end but eventually comes to a semblance of peace, with Scorsese making the wise choice to have DeNiro part ways for good with Sybill's Betsy in a powerful closer to a powerful film. In the end, DeNiro opts (albeit reluctantly) for a last act of sacrifice on behalf of the young female Iris, choosing the relatively inglorious act of killing street gangsters as opposed to the public political and/or romantic killing he had in mind (Scorsese opts to leave much of that to the imagination of the viewer). This results not in DeNiro getting the girl or gaining a heroes reward from Iris's estranged parents but instead puts him right back in a cab with friends who barely seem to remember his act, choosing to leave DeNiro's ultimate fate somewhat unknown. In fact, Iris's story doesn't get a true conclusion either, another piece of artful ambiguity that young directors would do well to heed. Add in a soft jazz soundtrack (a musical style famous for its lack of resolution) and an ending that is part ambiguous, part curtain closer and you have yourself one of the greatest films of all time. In a world where minimalist film-making has become so trendy and neo-noir has become so common, it is impossible not to recognize Taxi Driver for its importance as an original inspiration to film, art and culture. A short list of great movies that directly utilized aspects of the film includes incredible works such as The Mechanic, LA Confidential, Fight Club, The Dark Knight, Blade Runner, The Guest, God Bless America, Something About Mary, The Professional and even literary works such as Watchmen, Sin City and V For Vendetta, with Watchmen's Rorschach in particular bearing eerie resemblance to DeNiro's Travis Bickle. It's an incredible list and those are just a few highlights. Taxi Driver deserves its place in the hall of incredible film and it deserves your viewing time again and time again.",

            "content": "Upon revisiting this film for a college course I realized a few things; One being that Robert De Niro may have never given a better performance than Travis Bickle, two being that this film was way more ahead of its time than many 70's noir thrillers, and three being Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time.  Sure all things many people knew already, but for some reason didn't resonate with me the first time.\n\nTaxi Driver tells the unfortunate story of Travis Bickle, an ex-marine just returning from his time in Vietnam who struggles to cope with paranoid psychosis in 1970's New York.  Beginning and ending with trippy colors and stylish music from Bernard Hermann, Taxi Driver gets under your skin only when it wants to and in the most in opportune times.  It succeeds in giving you the uncomfortable feeling and anguish most associated with noir and it does so in fashion.\n\nBickle's skepticism and cynical view of New York City is perfectly portrayed by De Niro as we root for him the entire length of the movie.  All of this tends to get him into trouble, but we don't care, because we are so sucked into Bickle's every move and every word that we don't tend to notice just how insane he has become.  Of course, the film is iconic for its famous \"You talkin to me?\" line and its brutally violent climax, but its Scorsese's direction of De Niro's performance I will remember most.\n\nWith this film comes plenty of questions as to whether or not any of it is actually real or not, which in most cases is valid.  But I don't really care one way or another.  No matter what, this is a tragic tale of a man lost in a world that he doesn't understand and a world that doesn't understand him.  Whether or not the engaging narration is misleading is up to interpretation, but I just know that it's a wonderfully intricate story of a troubled Taxi Driver.  If De Niro's encapsulating performance isn't enough for you than perhaps Scorsese's brilliant direction and Bernard Hermann's hauntingly beautiful and stylish score will be.  Taxi Driver is a masterpiece.\n\n+De Niro is an all-time best\n\n+Scorsese's meticulous direction\n\n+Engaging in an unfortunately tragic way\n\n+Score\n\n+Noir way ahead of its time\n\n9.5/10",

Those familiar with it do their best tough-guy Robert De Niro impression whenever the film is brought up, only to laugh along with their listening companions as they go back to small chatter seconds later.  But few remember the improbably sadness that comes with the line.  The scene in which it appears spotlights a shirtless De Niro, gun in hand, facing the mirror like a narcissistic gangster, exceptionally vulnerable.  He is asking no one and will probably never have the chance to ask anyone; a socially stunted outcast his entire life, he has never been important enough to be talked to.  He always has to start the conversation, with the other party often walking away to converse with someone more ... normal.\n\t\"Taxi Driver\" is a tremendously melancholy film, one of loneliness, despair, and the unforgettable consideration as to if simply being alive is enough of a reason to live if no one wants you.  The movies, too often, surround themselves with attractive people speaking attractively, doing attractive things in attractive places.  But here, those parties are looked at from afar, glamorized but untouchable.  It is, instead, about the loners who want to be part of that in-crowd but don't have the social skills, the looks, the personalities, to be included in anything resembling high culture.  \n\tThe man mirroring the emptiness we can often times feel in this difficult game of life is the iconic Travis Bickle (De Niro), an insomniac taxi driver who works twelve hour shifts and who cannot seem to function living in a post-Vietnam world.  He is suffering from the aftermaths of fighting, yet it seems he has always been a persnickety wallflower - his gloom has increased in result to his past traumas.  He is passive, mannered, and unable to form real relationships; but the more a situation aggravates him, the more dangerously hot-headed he becomes.  His only stability comes from writing letters to his parents, whose existence we question.\n\tTwo women provide the heart of the film and change Travis's life for the better or for the worse, depending on how you look at them.  The first is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a cool, blonde campaign worker who becomes the target of Travis's romantic obsessions.  He sees her as the perfect woman, and, unwilling to let her slip into the arms of a co-worker (Albert Brooks) he suspects has sensual interest in her, he asks her out.  His slight good looks prompt her to push past his eccentricities, but when a date leads to a pornographic theater, a place Travis has no idea is insulting to take the time to visit, she immediately loses interest.  In one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, she rejects him over the phone, the camera panning to an empty hallway to distort the pain Travis so deeply feels.  No one is crying with you, the shot says.  It's chilling.\n\tHis misanthropy toward the world is soon amplified, and, with violence in his heart growing, he stumbles upon twelve-year-old hooker Iris (Jodie Foster), who has run away from home and works under the watchful eye of her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel).  She doesn't want to be saved - she likes sex work - but Travis sees the tragedy and reacts excessively.\n\tIn \"Taxi Driver,\" the supporting actors, though important, are white noise.  We see through Travis's eyes so vividly that it is as if everyone is behind a sheet of bulletproof glass.  Consider the way Scorsese takes the time to act as voyeur to Betsy and her work friend's conversations, which are so obnoxiously witty that they only heighten Travis's simultaneous dislike and envy of those successful and accepted in life.  Consider how Iris does not want to leave the ghetto streets of New York, and how Scorsese photographs the intense shootout that leads to her \"freedom\" in a subtle red that magnifies just how unjustified Travis's gunning is.  The latter tells himself that it's an act of good, but he, deep down, knows that all he really wants is an excuse to inflict violence on the \"scum\" he so outrightly hates.\n\tTravis Bickle was voted as one of the American Film Institute's most seminal villains, but I don't see him as one - he is neither a hero nor a foe, rather an embodiment of a detached party of humanity.  He was not bred to be homicidal; he was made that way, through tireless rejection and an array of relentless cold shoulders.  He has grown to despise the world because of what he perceives it has done to him, and what we witness throughout \"Taxi Driver\" is his eventual inability to keep his anger, his sadness, hidden anymore.  \n\tScorsese brilliantly elevates his disconnection by keeping scenes of conversation flat and in-the-moment, with interludes that depict Travis in his taxi accompanied by lonely jazz music and a floating aesthetic that further disengages him with the life that is buzzing about around him.  Friends, family, lovers, roam the streets.  To Travis, they are alien - he only knows what it's like to be alone with his thoughts, stewing and stewing until they're overcooked, delusional.\n\tDe Niro's untouchable performance is a masterwork in understatement - he is often silent, quiet in the presence of others, alive when by himself.  Even when in the public eye, he still can't help but remain to be his own best friend.  Would-be friends are a fog.  De Niro does so much with expression, with vocal delivery; little things expand Travis's standing as a man alone on Earth - he is almost a higher being, looking down at the world and unsure what to think of it.  As Travis, De Niro is as sympathetic as he is frightening.  We pity his despair, but we also are unsure of when he's going to snap.  This is one of the greatest performances in the history of film.  Foster, a teenage heavyweight, is equally remarkable as an impressionable youth whose life goes in a completely different direction than she would have thought thanks to the film's titular taxi driver.\n\tAlmost forty years later, \"Taxi Driver\" still stands as the exemplary Scorsese movie - in-control, unpredictable, observant, and slightly savage.  It is very much a New York film, though it doesn't romanticize its \"big city\" tropes; it accentuates the idea that someone, in the blink of an eye, can get lost in this world, and that living in the shadows of society is no home.  Here is one of the finest depictions of alienation in cinema, next to \"Red Desert\" and to \"Blue.\" Whether we like it or not, we have all experienced what Travis has.  Just maybe not so violently.",

Not that it is the greatest movie ever made or the greatest story ever told on the big screen.  But the simple but layered portrait of a man on the brink of losing his mind is something stunning and to behold.  Everyone knows or has known of a person that just seems to be a little bit \"off\" for lack of a better work.  Maybe the guy you see on the street and you stay clear of them, not knowing what exactly is going on in their mind, that's Travis Bickle (played by Robert Deniro)  This is a mean and nasty movie.  These characters are not nice people because the streets of the city have made them so.  One of these characters is sick of it all, and wants to take it upon himself to clean things up.  What transpires is the slow decay of a mans sanity in front of us and it is downright brilliant.",

And maybe you have heard that it is a rather strange movie as well.  Well it is, but in a good way if that makes any sense.  Mostly everybody at some point has said to themselves \"You know what, I'm sick of this, I'm sick of everything\"  This movie still holds true today, as you look around society and ask yourself truly \" What the hell are some people thinking about\"  Whether its the way they act, talk or dress you are bound to be annoyed and disgusted by someone you cross paths with.  Well, Travis Bickel (played by Robert Deniro) is truly sick of what he see's around him, and he takes it upon himself to, lets say, change things.  Taxi Driver has some of the best narration of any movie I have ever seen.  It is a very angry movie and you feel yourself sympathizing with the character to a certain extent.  Maybe thinking \" Yeah, actually that pisses me off too\"  Where you probably differ from the character is how far you are willing to go to change it.  One of the most infamous endings in movie history that leave you wondering if what you saw just really happened.  But in reality, you had a good idea it was going to happen just the way it played out anyway.  The entire film is a build up to the end.  One of Scorsese and Deniro's best right here.",

Maybe it's the action scenes, Scorsese does shoot a good action scene, and Spielberg should hire him to put a little zest into the transformers series. The other reason might be because..have you ever noticed how some of the stars in a current film remind you of ones from long ago? Whenever I see De Niro I think of Humphrey Bogart. Not just the physical resemblance but acting style, or lack of it, and general persona. The honchos in Hollywood obviously believe that people won't change over the years and the actors the audience were told to love in the past they must love in the present, though reincarnated in slightly different bodies. So why didn't they introduce violence and gore as found in Taxi driver from the start? Some things they like to keep the same, others they like to change over a long period of time, apparently.\nOne thing can be said, Scorsese's film is striking but it isn't that way because of him it's because he completely ripped off the director Michael Winner's work to get it to look that way. Scorsese does everything he can to make the lead character, a Taxi Driver as Scorsese so helpfully reminds us in the title, seem as weird as possible. It's almost like a bad dream, not the intense nightmares Winner created, especially seeing the implausibility of De Niro even having a chance to date Cybill Shepard's character.\nIt's like the Bogart movies again, since it's a b movie ripoff that's hype has ballooned it to mythic status.",

The movie perfectly encapsulates the night life of new york city, and it probably has one of the best movie scores by Bernard Hermann. An incredible and beautiful jazz score that perfectly accompanies the night life of new york. But where the movie really shines is the performances. Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel both deliver fantastic performances, but the real star is Robert De Niro. This guy is an absolute wonder. One of the best performances of all time.

But \"Taxi Driver\" has to be the best paranoid of all.\nTaxi Driver tells the story of insomniac Taxi driver Travis Bickle who tries to clean up New York by trying to assassinate a Presidential candidate and rescue a young girl from prostitution. That's the plot but what that doesn't convey is the dark almost haunting mood of this movie, day or night time.\n\nIt is almost most shot through the distorted lens of Travis Bickle's insomnia induced diminishing sanity, like when for a fleeting moment raindrops on the windscreen glow with the changing colors of the traffic lights, or was that just my imagination?\n\nTravis is a lonely guy so right out of trap I'm going to like him anyway and he's doing his best to make ends meet in a lousy job, which everyone I'm sure can relate to. And he's got his values and we hear him writing in his diary about how he hates the rubbish in the streets, while seeing him looking at in the streets, as he drives.\n\nIf it wasn't so highly and brilliantly stylised it could almost be considered naturalistic because it has that honest feel of a documentary. I love it because Travis Bickles is a kind of working class hero to me. A man of few words who seemed to sum it all up. And in the greatest improvisation of all time, you just can't get better paranoid than drawing a gun from your sleeve at yourself in the mirror and crying, \"You talkin' to me\"!\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time",

It would be a number of years later at Cambridge's Historic Brattle cinema that I would see it agin in a fading print. \n\nMartin Scorsese and Paul Schrader capture a Manhattan long since gone. It is like a \"time capsule\" piece of it's day. It also might be the first film that truly presented audiences with what full fits the definition of \"Anti-Hero.\" \n\nThis film firmly cemented Robert Di Niro as the actor of his generation. As well as permanently imprinting Jodi Foster into American Pop Culture. Michael Chapman's breathtaking cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's musical score are both essential to this iconic film's success. But for the most part, this is Di Niro's film. \n\nOnly within context of NYC's perversity of 42nd Street and surrounding drug/sex culture, along with 1970's confused ideas around \"Sexual Liberation\" and the political paranoia of this time would we be able to actually view \"Travis Bickle\" as a \"hero.\" \n\nWe know that he is walking a very thin line between sanity and sociopathic danger, but it is impossible not to feel for him. His insanity often feels like the only sane aspect of the world in which he drives and navigates. Attempts at connections are tainted by his inability to form a clear understanding of anything going on around him. \n\nThis is mid-1970's film is an incredibly insightful depiction of dystopia and insanity. \n\nWhile the once shockingly brutal special effects have aged poorly, there can be no denying the power and importance of this cinematic dark vision. The fact that we have now become far too sophisticated when it comes to \"realistic\" gore is only a further example of wether we have moved \"forward\" or interestingly \"backward\" in the passing of time. The dated special effects have taken on an almost unintended idea of surrealism and allegory. \n\nThe final minute of this film remains one of the most surprising and disturbing in cinematic history. You have to watch closely just before the credits begin to roll. If you blink, you might miss it. \n\nBut the reality of Travis Bickle remains firmly in place for tragic implications that the people within his world can grasp. He is not just a misfit or loner. Travis Bickle is insane. And most disturbing, this film is even more relevant in the 21st Century than it was 40 years ago. \n\nEssential, a Cinematic Masterpiece and a director's thus far Master Work. If you've not seen it, make the effort. It was re-released to cinemas in 2011 via restored prints. I was a true revelation to see in on the big screen. It works so much better in a cinema than on our huge flat screen home entertainment systems. \n\nBy the way, Sony has released this film to Blu-Ray and HD twice. The second release was promoted as a 4K restoration. I could only notice minor improvements. This film is still in need of an appropriate transfer. Sony is a media giant, so this is doubtful --- but we can still hope.",

The man feels dead inside because he sees everything as dead, so to feel something real, to feel alive, he goes to extreme measures. He does it because he feels no escape from his torment. The romance with Cybill Sheppard represents that he's so broken he doesn't even know how to escape through love. The political scenes shows that he can't escape by putting his faith in anyone to save the city. The movie says in an angry world anger is the only way out.

He is known for his fantastic gangster mob films, and continues to inspire films made today. \"Taxi Driver\" is the fifth film directed by Scorsese. It stars Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster.\n\nTravis Bickle (De Niro) s a New York taxi driver. Fed up with his low life, he applies  to work as a taxi driver. Travis drives anyone and everyone where they need to go. Anyone from the man running for president to a violent criminal. Travis , like many New Yorker's during that time, is sick of his stinky corrupt city. The police won't get the job done, and politicians pretend to care when they don't. After being rejected by a beautiful girl, Travis finally snaps. He takes matters into his own hands. If the police won't handle the corruption, he will.\n\nRobert De Niro is an extraordinary actor. Some might call him legendary. He has worked a few times with Scorsese, and he is really good in this film. His character is very off hinged. He doesn't seem quite right, and De Niro plays him in a very unsettling way. I suppose he could b considered a bit of a vigilante. He sees the horrible condition of his city and wants to put an end to corruption. His character is very well written and interesting. Jodie Foster is and always has been a great actress. She has a very small role in the film, but she dos a good job with it.\n\nAs a film, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The direction is very strong, but what stands out to me the most is the brilliant script and jaw dropping cinematography. The script was written by Paul Schrader, and it's perfect. A great writer listens to other people's conversations so they can create natural dialogue. This film has elegant natural dialogue. It's so natural and it flows off the screen as if you were breathing in the air of New York. The camera work was done by DP Michael Chapman, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg on Jaws. He's worked with Scorsese multiple times, but his work here is just astounding. The nighttime shots and framing are beautiful.\n\n\"Taxi Driver\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Aside from it's interesting political context, it's more of an art film than anything. The smooth Jazz music mixed with the sound of drums give the film a classy yet unsettling feeling. Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster give good performances, the characters are interesting, the script is flawless, and the camera work is some of the best I've ever seen.",

So saying that, I finally got around to seeing it and I think it is a really good movie, probably not as great as everybody thinks it is, but overall I liked it a lot. De Niro does an excellent job as Travis Bickle, you really get the feeling of isolation while being in the middle of everyone, and the score and city itself really helps with that. If I was judging this movie on acting alone I would give it 5 stars, but due to the amount of swearing, the fact that Bickles idea of a nice date is to go to a pornographic movie and the child prostitution kinda makes it lose some stars, but I do understand some of that is necessary for the story. The cast for Taxi Driver was really good too, and I don't think I have ever seen Harvey Keitel look that young before. So overall Taxi Driver was pretty darn amazing, although I doubt Bickle would have survived with that many wounds, and if he did, I am pretty sure he would have been thrown in to jail for what he did, but what do you want, its a movie.\n4.5 Beards Out Of 5",

Taxi Driver is an absolutely fantastic character piece about a sick and mentally disturbed person. Everyone says Robert De Niro was great in the film and yeah he is so good I didn't see Robert De Niro I saw a fucked up, psychopathic lunatic. The film has a great sense of atmosphere, all the scenes at night are expertly well filmed and the lighting and city life is amazing. The film is utterly chilling, we get lots of shots of Travis's eyes and I feel we learn so much through this guys cold expressions. All of the acting is great, Jodie Foster was around 12 when the film was made and she is surprisingly amazing, all the other acting is great, Harvey Keitel in particular makes for a great bad guy. The scene with Travis talking to the man in the taxi about what a .44 magnum can do to a woman is utterly chilling and creepy. You can't talk about Taxi Driver without talking about the famous 'you talking to me' scene is so well acted and proof there is something not right with this cabby. One of the great things about the film is the way at the start you route for Travis Bickle however by the end he's a completely different person. The end shoot out between Travis and the pimps is a brilliant and very violent sequence that is fairly ambiguous and satisfying to see him kill the bad people. The scene with Travis pretending to shoot himself while covered in blood is a haunting image. This film is so good I can't even describe it. Martin Scorsese is probably one of my favourite directors of all time. This movie is probably my favourite movie of all time. To call this movie iconic is an under statement. A+",

Robert DeNiro was amazing in this movie. His performance pulled this movie to greatness. I loved how he was a genuinely nice guy but his depression gets the best of him, causing him to do crazy things which is very realistic and scary. Jodie Foster also gave a good performance. She was good at playing the 12 year old prostitute who was easily manipulated and a sad runaway. The conversation between Travis and Iris was very touching the way he was able to get through to her because in a way they are very alike and because of that, was able to relate to her and help himself in a way. The conversations he has with the riders of his cab were really interesting to listen to because every time he talked to someone about himself I was able to figure out more about him. The ending perfectly portrays that he wants to help Iris but is also going insane at the same time. The ending was a bit bittersweet but I kinda liked it, it was gutsy but also a bit heartfelt. Taxi Driver had me invested in the story and Robert DeNiro's performance but at times got kind of lost in the story's details. A classic for sure. B+",

These similarities make Nightcrawler a more updated version, which is more scarier, darker and questionable in many ways - but Taxi Driver is a classic; if I'd seen this movie before Nightcrawler, I'd probably assume Taxi Driver is a movie achievement that's unbeatable, but Nightcrawler is a more favourable option, as well. I believe comparing these movies to the eventual decision of which is the more preferable option is 50/50, as it's not an easy enough decision.\nThis is one of Scorsese's finest works of his career, and the teaming up with Robert De Niro to be cast as the lead, Travis Bickle, wasn't, subsequently, despicable, as his performance was, uniquely, compelling and unforgettable. De Niro definitely suits this movie, perfectly, as he fits in well with the, fantastically, written screenplay, by Paul Schrader, who wrote it with some fine dark tone - and the direction of Scorsese. De Niro convinces the audience that Bickle is a guy worth avoiding or taking an interest in, which is 50/50 choice, which I found, thoroughly, interesting, as a part is never portrayed so, amazingly, in many movies I've seen. It's understandable why this movie joined the classic agenda. De Niro also leaves Travis to be a debatable character, due to his dark and mental personality, but he still has care in the world, but is surrounded and outmaneuvered in the midst of the gangsters, chaos and oversuse of prostitution in New York's 'mean streets.' The audience are with De Niro all the way.\nThe cinematography of New York's mean streets is also superb, and, totally, develops something new about the the cinematic graphics of the streets of New York. \nThis movie helped push the career of Jodie Foster, who plays teen prostitude, Iris, and delivers a brief supporting, but brilliant performance. \nTaxi Driver is definitely a classic and debatable movie that pushed the careers of De Niro, Foster, Scorsese and the rest of the cast and crew, as well, I believe.",

The cinematography works good in the movie. The score in this movie I personally love because when there moments the score gets dramatic and the a moments that it get nice a sweet to listen to. Finally, the effects are fine. \"I'm raving that \"Taxi Driver\" is a must-see film for movie lovers. It's a masterpiece that hard-hitting as well as it's compelling.\"",

            "content": "Ya hab\u00eda visto este filme antes pero hace mucho y no recordaba muchas cosas, aprovechando que la volv\u00ed a ver, es el momento oportuno para redactar mi review sobre el filme. Hoy en d\u00eda, tanto el director Martin Scorsese, como el actor Robert de Niro, son instituciones del cine, pero hay que tomar en cuenta que para cuando hicieron juntos \"Taxi Driver\", Scorsese apenas hab\u00eda dirigido unos tres filmes donde solo \"Mean Streets\" realmente hab\u00eda logrado \u00e9xito comercial y de cr\u00edtica, por ende, era todav\u00eda un director desconocido; y de Niro, con un poco m\u00e1s de experiencia, y a\u00fan habiendo ya salido en \"The Godfather, Part II\" e incluso ganado el oscar a Mejor Actor, era un actor relativamente muy desconocido por las masas, al punto que pudo \"trabajar\" como taxista por un mes en New York para prepararse para su papel en este filme y solo una vez fue reconocido por uno de los pasajeros. Scorsese y de Niro hab\u00edan colaborado junto en \"Mean Streets\" pero es en \"Taxi Driver\" donde ambos compartieron su \"bautizo de fuego\", ya que incluso de Niro habiendo interpretado al joven \"Vito Corleone\" en \"The Godfather, Part II\" es su personaje de \"Travis Bickle\" el cual lo defini\u00f3 para toda una generaci\u00f3n y su ahora ic\u00f3nica escena frente al espejo donde \u00e9l mismo improvis\u00f3 su di\u00e1logo empezando con \"A qui\u00e9n est\u00e1s mirando?\". La pel\u00edcula de \"Taxi Driver\" es considerada como Film Neo Noir, b\u00e1sicamente por ser filmada en color, lo cual siempre he pensado que es sub-sub-g\u00e9nero innecesario o redundante, ya aunque ahora el est\u00e1ndar es filmar a color, todav\u00eda existen ejemplos de filmes que fueron filmados en blanco y negro intencionalmente como \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Schindler's List\" \u00f3 \"The Artist\". Muchos puristas del g\u00e9nero Film Noir califican como clave el uso de blanco y negro como algo no negociable y si se agrega color, bam! Pasan a Film Neo Noir, lo cual yo no comparto, aunque sea un gran fan de este sub-g\u00e9nero de suspenso. Curiosamente, \"Taxi Driver\" si se hubiera filmado en blanco y negro, Scorsese se hubiera ahorrado muchas discusiones y amenazas de subir el nivel de censura del filme de \"R\" a \"X\" por \"alto grado de violencia\", solo por el hecho de que la sangre se ve\u00eda de color normal y que logr\u00f3 mantenerse en \"R\" bajando el tono de la sangre a algo entre naranja y rosa. En cuanto al elenco, Robert de Niro fue una elecci\u00f3n id\u00f3nea, pero no creo que hubiera sido el \u00fanico en encarnar el papel en el momento. Con respecto al pol\u00e9mico personaje de Jodie Foster, ella ya ten\u00eda una amplia experiencia en televisi\u00f3n, y aunque hab\u00eda hecho algo de cine, realmente fue \"Taxi Driver\" la que la puso en el mapa, pero incluso otras j\u00f3venes actrices del momento como Linda Blair (\"The Exorcist\") y Kristy McNichol (\"Little Darlings\") pudieron haber afrontado el reto sin problemas. Donde no creo que hubiera posibilidad de cambios es el casteo de Cybill Shepherd que fue realmente el punto alto de suerte, ya que aunque era una actriz todav\u00eda desconocida con roles previos poco memorables y todav\u00eda estaba a varios a\u00f1os de lograr su rol en la ic\u00f3nica serie de TV \"Moonlightning\" es realmente el factor clave (e incluso no explotado al m\u00e1ximo) del filme, ya que si los puristas discuten por el color en los Film Noirs, creo que el verdadero factor no negociable es una s\u00f3lida \"femme fatale\" y Cybill Shepherd como el personaje de \"Betsy\" es una majestuosa \"femme fatale\", que si Scorsese se quejaba de que ella olvidaba sus di\u00e1logos, debi\u00f3 ver que ella solo con su mirada depredadora, su sonrisa enigm\u00e1tica, su imperdible presencia, y sus perfectos vestuarios, es la musa perfecta no aprovechada al m\u00e1ximo dentro de este complejo thriller sicol\u00f3gico. Un elemento clave para el impacto del filme es sin duda su fotograf\u00eda, la cual es algo impresionante de la mano de Michael Chapman (\"Raging Bull\", \"The Fugitive\") donde la c\u00e1mara siempre te muestra lo que debes ver e incluso en algunas escenas incluso se aparta inc\u00f3moda protegiendo la integridad del personaje. Y sin duda, el \u00faltimo, pero no menos importante invitado a este filme es el compositor Bernard Herrmann, donde fue su \u00faltimo trabajo antes de morir y que su legado musical al cine fue tan invaluable como en cintas como \"Citizen Kane\", \"Psycho\" (as\u00ed como otros filmes de Hitchcock) y que realmente la m\u00fasica en la trama se vuelve otro \"personaje\" m\u00e1s o bien, el factor definidor del estado de \u00e1nimo en cada escena. Un par de elementos que la gente muchas veces no aprecia del filme es su uso de fectos especiales y maquillaje, ya que el impactante aspecto de \"Travis Bickle\" hacia el final del filme es una aplicaci\u00f3n brillantemente concebida que para cualquiera parecer\u00eda que de Niro realmente adopt\u00f3 ese corte de cabello. Y el climax final posee un nivel de perfecci\u00f3n dentro de la compleja violencia presentada que casi cuesta creer que la escena no est\u00e9 ocurriendo realmente. Entonces, la cinta es perfecta? Bueno, para m\u00ed no, pero obvio, eso est\u00e1 en el ojo de cada expectador. Humildemente creo que pudo tener una mejor edici\u00f3n ya que presenta cortes en escenas que parecen clave, pero al no darle un seguimiento, queda entredicho el porqu\u00e9 de las escenas. Tambi\u00e9n considero que el gui\u00f3n no es l\u00f3gico en su escena m\u00e1s pol\u00e9mica (no el climax, si no la cual provoc\u00f3 un atentado en la vida real posteriormente) ya que aunque es evidente que \"Travis Bickle\" es un sic\u00f3pata, incluso los locos tienen motivos para hacer lo que hacen, y el hecho de que llegara \"Travis\" a dicho momento no tiene ninguna motivaci\u00f3n o fundamento, y como uno tiene \"acceso\" a los pensamientos del personaje, no hay un momento \"disparador\" para justificar su \"plan\", incluso lo mal que sale tampoco es l\u00f3gico si usted presta atenci\u00f3n a como lo practica. Creo que si uno llega realmente a comprender a \"Travis Bickle\", un sorpresivo giro en la escena pol\u00edticamente pol\u00e9mica hubiera generado algo m\u00e1s memorable y l\u00f3gico. Igualmente, creo il\u00f3gico la decisici\u00f3n de \"cambiar\" a anglosajones a los criminales del climax final, simplemente por evitar una imagen negativa racial, ya que honestamente, durante todo el filme, es clara la opini\u00f3n racial del personaje principal que evidentemente es un \"anti-h\u00e9roe\", por lo que no veo el porqu\u00e9 preocuparse por el efecto que provoque un personaje que la intenci\u00f3n no deber\u00eda ser para nada emularlo. Hay todo un movimiento dentro de expectadores y cr\u00edticos que afirman que el \"ep\u00edlogo\", luego del climax final, es un sue\u00f1o, un producto de la desquiciada imaginaci\u00f3n de \"Travis Bickle\" pero yo no comparto ese pensar. Primero, \"Travis\" es mentalmente inestable y socialmente inadaptado pero nunca mostr\u00f3 alucinaciones, y aunque tend\u00eda a mentir, eran mentiras \"inocentes\" y pobremente concebidas de la oportunidad y no algo elaborado. Aparte, el director (Scorsese) y el guionista (Paul Schrader) abiertamente explicaron que el \"ep\u00edlogo\" es real, que s\u00ed ocurri\u00f3 y que no es imaginario, y no s\u00e9 ustedes pero en este caso, creo l\u00f3gico creerle a quienes hicieron el filme. Y como ciertos filmes, el \u00faltimo segundo de la cinta es definidor del verdadero estado mental del personaje que como bien los describen sus creadores \"es una bomba de tiempo\", que realmente solo el caprichoso destino es quien define el camino que tomar\u00e1 el personaje. Y para cerrar este review que estoy consciente que ha sido largo, me parece curioso que los an\u00e1lisis en Wikipedia y en IMDB, no tomen un momento para comentar sobre el factor del dormir de \"Travis Bickle\" el cual repetidamente menciona que al principio del filme le cuesta poder conciliar el sue\u00f1o, pero en un momento se le muestra dormido, lo cual para m\u00ed es un claro definidor de que el personaje empieza sin un prop\u00f3sito en su vida, pero en cierto momento encuentra algo en qu\u00e9 ocupar su mente, brind\u00e1ndole la \"paz interna\" para poder dormir, pero nuevamente insisto que su plan carece de justificaci\u00f3n y l\u00f3gica, y no, que sea loco no es una excusa.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is consider by many to be one of the best directors of all time and the greatest director currently working (at the time this review as written), with such reputation, one question will always emerged: Which film is his greatest contribution to cinema? Having multiple possible answers like \"Raging Bull\", \"Goodfellas\" or \"The Departed\" , I will definitely argue that the correct answer would be his breakthrough film: \"Taxi Driver\".\nTravis Bickle is a lonely man, former U.S. Marine, who suffers from depression and insomnia. Wanting to get some sleep, he gets a job as a taxi driver but by driving around New York City he starts to witness how society is filled with \"parasites\", wanting to do something in his life in order to \"clean hi city\", Travis starts to descend towards madness.\nFew films have achieved the level of praise that Martin Scorsese\u00b4s big breakthrough film \"Taxi Driver\" has earned since its release, so let's examine the reasons of said universal praise. \"Taxi Driver\" has everything that a masterpiece requires: Amazing acting with the best being, obviously, Robert De Niro giving the best performance of his entire career and one of the greatest performances I\u00b4ve ever seen, with this subtle facial expressions and expertly used method acting; an iconic, complex, sympathetic and unforgettable protagonist/villain in the form of Travis Bickle; Bernard Herrmann\u00b4s score fits perfectly with Scorsese\u00b4s vision of NYC and is one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing scores that I\u00b4ve ever heard, high entertainment value, a pacing that never drags and gives us the perfect amount of scenes, Scorsese managed to made NY a big character with his gorgeous cinematography, a smartly written script, strong and even disturbing ideas on paper that were masterfully executed on their translation to the silver screen, impressive and quotable dialog, greatly executed themes, a powerful story with some social commentary that, despite the fact this film is more than 35 years old, still retain its power; a perfect dose of subtle ambiguity and Scorsese\u00b4s ambitious directing is the cherry on top of this perfect film: His camera movements are use with precise timing and the execution of every single shot is done so splendidly that it remains Scorsese\u00b4s best directing job to this very day. I honestly can believe that a film like \"Rocky\" could steal the Academy Award for Best Picture from this timeless classic and I will never understand how it got only 5 nominations and didn't win any of them when it deserved to.\n\"Taxi Driver\" is not only one of the best character studies and Scorsese\u00b4s ultimate masterpiece but it is also one of the best films ever made and one of my all time favorite films; it has everything that a timeless classic requires. This is filmmaking at its finest and an absolute must see for anyone who calls himself a lover of the seventh art.",

He want's to do something in his life and he wants to change it.   In short, this film is all about the character itself. It focuses more on the hardships and the struggles of a certain character who wants to attain something and this film is that example. The dialogue was just great. Scorsese did a good job with it. It's like guys having cool yet clever conversations. Has really  a violent theme with disturbing images. And that jazz background perfectly fits with it.

            "content": "Today I am reviewing Taxi Driver (1976), directed by Martin Scorsese, and starring Robert De Niro.    Most movies have a protagonist and one or more antagonists.  This movie is unique in that the protagonist is also the primary antagonist.\n\nI like most of De Niro's films but there are a few that I am not fond of.  Unfortunately Taxi Driver is one of the latter.  It is not De Niro's performance that I have a problem with. It is the character in general.  He is simultaneously insightful and not, caring and not honorable and not, homicidal and not.  De Niro gave an interesting performance but could not save a doomed character.  It is like getting a professional Nascar driver to drive a clunker taxi cab with only 3 wheels, no brakes and a broken steering column.  He might be able to do better than most in that scenario but the taxi is still going to crash.    \n\nTechnical errors distracted me heavily from the movie.  Things such as De Niro's character saying he is a former marine yet holding a handgun in one hand while aiming with the opposite eye (e.g. Left hand/right eye dominant).  In the Army, they train this kind of cross dominant problem out in basic training to improve accuracy.  He also stocks his whole finger into the trigger guard instead of just the first part of his finger.  This is something else that would be trained out of recruits.  Considering Army basic training was considerably kinder and gentler in 2000 when I enlisted than in the 70s, it is safe to assume that the Marine Corps  would have beat this behavior out of him.\n\nI'm not sure if this was typical Hollywood ignorance, Scorsese playing on anti-Vietnam sentiment to insinuate that veterans are dangerous, or a plot point indicating evidence that even that aspect of Bickle's history was fabricated like his claims of being a government agent.\n\nThe final fight sequence was very predictable thanks to typical movie foreshadowing when Bickle first tried on all his weapons.  The acting of the supporting characters was mediocre.  The cinematography was fine but nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall, I did not enjoy the movie.  I could not relate to any of the characters or get excited at the story line.  I give the film 3 / 5 (wait for rental/Netflix).",

We are invited to enter the life of Travis Bickle, who is a certifiably insane cab driver in NYC. I get what they were trying to do with this story. Travis sees all the darkness and depravity in the city and desires to clean it up, and his mind comes up with really off-the-wall ways of doing that. I assume this is some hold-over from his time in Vietnam, because his solutions generally involve murder. I struggled with this film, though, because it took an extremely long time to get anywhere with the story. It seems to be all about mood and tone and atmosphere, so we go long stretches of film without anything new or interesting happening. This might work if I was invested in the lead character, but since he was so damaged I had trouble connecting with Travis in any way. De Niro obviously does excellent work in the lead role, and I think the rest of the cast was solid as well. I just couldn't get into the film, so it failed to impact me in any way. In fact, I could see myself completely forgetting Taxi Driver in no time and wondering what it was even about. I know it is a pinnacle of cinema for a lot of people, but apparently I don't have the right mentality for it.",

He falls in love with a women but loses her after taking her to one of his explicit films, and after that slowly loses it.  He buys four handguns, straps them all over himself and goes about his job, planing his final day.  He decides to try and save the ruined life of a 12 year old hooker who once got in his cab, and in coming to free her shoots three of her employers and his shot twice himself.  It's a great final scene, but to our suprise we,re told that he survived and continued his job as a hopefully more sane taxi driver.   It's a great movie, something very different and tells a great story.  It's interesting, keeps you unsure of what his intentions are, the acting is fantastic and it brought to use two very famous things: the \"Are u talking to me?\" quote and the awesome hidden pistol on the sliding rail under the sleeve device.",

E embora o protagonista mostre-se inconformado com o que o rodeia nas ruas, seu ressentimento igualmente se deve \u00e0 sua incapacidade de relacionar-se com esse admir\u00e1vel mundo novo. Dessa amarga solid\u00e3o, resta a figura do ve\u00edculo que, ao longo de seu trajeto mec\u00e2nico, rumina e armazena um crescente rancor enquanto espreita um mundo que lhe oferece apenas a incompreens\u00e3o, a sujeira e o apodrecimento.\nMas n\u00e3o se atreva a conversar com esse sujeito. Com a mesma intensidade com que potencializa seus anseios, ele deseja, na primeira oportunidade, descontar a raiva inquietante que lhe tira at\u00e9 o sono - e certamente, suas \"valorosas convic\u00e7\u00f5es\" n\u00e3o limitar\u00e3o o grau de suas atitudes. Afinal, porque a cautela se j\u00e1 se vive em tamanha corrup\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo?

            "content": "How would I describe this movie in only a few words? Well, if 2001 is a symphony of space travel, then Taxi Driver is what I would call a \u00e2Symphony of Madness.\u00e2? \n\nRight at the beginning, we as the audience are transported into the mind of Travis Bickle: A Vietnam vet with major PTSD who takes a job driving a taxi through the streets of New York. We see the world through his eyes, and to him, the world is a rotten shithole (no argument here). As the movie goes on, we learn that Mr. Bickle is an insane nobody who (by the end) will stop at nothing to prove that he's a somebody, even if it's only in his own twisted mind. That's part of this movie's brilliance: On the outside looking in, Travis is an insane, miserable creep with no people skills. But in his mind, it's everyone else who's trash. He can do no wrong. \n\nThis film can be relatable to many people in that regard. Do you know anyone like Travis? Someone who means well, but doesn't realize that what he does is a little fucked up? Someone who's idea of a date is taking a nice girl out to a porno movie? Someone who (after you and your friends are telling jokes and talking about the women they're banging) chimes in to your conversation to tell you about the latest murder cases going on? Someone who pulls you aside to talk about their \"dark thoughts\" and expect you to give them words of wisdom (And you're thinking \"WTF\")? I'm sure you know someone like that... If you don't, well... you're it, buddy!\n\nAlright, so I've gone on about the film's main character... What about the story itself? Well, it's a character study, so the story basically covers the life and times of Travis Bickle. From his interview at the taxi company, to his bloody demise. In between, we see his mind slowly deteriorate into a pool of loneliness, desperation, and pure rage. He drives the streets of New York every day, and sees nothing but scum. He sees it on the sidewalks, the crosswalks, and even in his own cab. The more fares he takes, the crazier and sicker he gets. He's forced to clean cum and blood off his back seat every night, he sees pimps snag hookers out of his car, he speeds away from hooligans in Harlem, and Martin Scorsese himself forces him to stake out an apartment while Scorsese's wife is getting rammed in there. Yeah, stuff like that can disillusion someone pretty damn quick.\n\nIt doesn't help that Bickle himself is out of his mind. He spends his spare time frequenting porno theatres, hitting on the cashiers in said theatres, following 12 year-old prostitutes, and stalking a beautiful campaign worker named Betsy that he's convinced he's in love with (the ladder part is where this movie is at it's most awkward). Seriously, he stakes out the Palantine campaign building and watches this chick work. He eventually walks in and asks her out, and for some reason she agrees (blondes... amirite?). They have pie together, he creepily tells her about some \"connection\" he feels with her, she awkwardly acknowledges it... and then she agrees to go out with him again??? Thankfully, for Betsy's sake, Travis takes her out to a porn theatre on the next date. She's unimpressed and wises up pretty quickly, ditching Travis and focusing her attention on Hank Scorpio. \n\nAs awkward as those moments with Betsy were (and by \"awkward\" I mean \"piss your pants uncomfortable\"), it's probably the best part of the movie. We get a great sense of how mal-adjusted Travis is, and how he's so engulfed in his own world that anyone who comes into contact with him must be part of that world. And who the fuck would want to be there? Fuck, not even a 12 year-old prostitute (played wonderfully by Jodie Foster) wants any part of that shit. \n\nEventually, Bickle becomes so fed up with everything that he buys a bunch of guns and begins acting tough to a mirror.\n\nTravis's descent into madness results in a climax for the ages, and the film concludes with an ambiguous ending that's still being interpreted to this day.  Don't worry, I won't spoil that for you... I'm not that much of a dick.\n\nAs said before, this film is a character study. The tone of the film matches Bickle's traits beautifully. It has very eerie, haunting, and chaotic feel to it, and with the unpredictability and creepiness of Travis, everything falls into place tone-wise. You get a sense of just how disgusting the world is through Travis's eyes, and Robert DeNiro plays the character perfectly.\n\nNow there's a segue into the acting if I've ever seen one. Everyone in this movie puts on a terrific performance. Cybill Shepherd and Jodie Foster are both amazing in this movie as the \"love interests\" Betsy and Iris, and emphasis needs to be put on Jodie Foster's performance as playing a 12 year-old prostitute was the easiest thing to do. Hank Scorpio does a great job as Betsy's pseudo bodyguard Tom, and even Martin Scorsese himself does a wonderful job as a passenger and a random observer watching Betsy... I'm still wondering if those two are the same character or not. All of these acting jobs really bring the whole movie together to create the masterpiece that Taxi Driver truly is. \n\nThis movie is a one-of-a-kind classic. It lives up to its legendary status as one of the greatest movie ever made. It genially portrays the brutality of a dog-eat-dog city like New York, all through the eyes of a tremendously flawed man. Taxi Driver is without a doubt the greatest character study of all time. While I do consider Goodfellas to be the best Scorsese film, Taxi Driver is a very, very, VERY close second.

Deniro isn't afraid of making others uncomfortable or how he is perceived and he has charisma which shows his great natural acting ability. I also really liked some aspects of the directing like the ending shots being from up above. The ending is left up to interpretation. Personally I think he died and is imagining in his head how he is this great hero n how he would've liked things to happen. To me those shots up above are his soul leaving and then obvi I don't think the prostitute just went back home n became normal and that girl likes him again. Get real he was shot in the neck,  sorry but this is how I feel. The director made this guy almost like able in how he kills/tries to kill ppl nobody really likes such as the phony politician and pimps and pedafiles. My complaint is that the movie moves slow and up until the end you're waiting for something more to happen or more of an explanation to his craziness or meaning-feels like a void. A weird and dark movie for sure and a bit overrated in my opinion.",

Characters are well written and are perfectly cast. Robert De Niro makes the lead character memorable and brings to screen one of film's most iconic quotes. A young Jodie Foster also shows off her talents at such a young age that proves why she had such success as she aged. There is also a surprising cameo appearance from Martin Scorsese in a scene you would have never seen from him before.\nThe film doesn't jump straight into the main story. Whilst you do get a short scene involving Foster near the beginning, you still have to go through a number of subplots before her storyline really got good. This is what I had an issue with. When the conclusion to this storyline arrived, i felt that there was not enough time spent on it. I wanted to know more about the characters that was involved, which is something that could have been focused on earlier in the film.\nI'm not saying Taxi Driver is a bad film and I know many people out there would love it. I just feel that the movie should have either been made longer or the main point of the plot should have been brought forward earlier into the movie.",

            "content": "\"I have learned more about America from riding in taxi cabs than from all the limos in all the country,\" declares presidential candidate Sen. Charles Palantine, eschewing sincerity for an ironically condescending tone he uses to convince low-income voters of his populist, every-man platform. In the conversation that follows, Palantine attempts to empathize with Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), the eponymous anti-hero of Martin Scorsese's 1976 film, Taxi Driver. He asks Bickle what he thinks is the biggest problem with America, to which he responds, \"The filth... The president should just flush this whole mess right down the fucking toilet.\" Palantine, in a falsified gesture befitting of a politician, politely ends the conversation before turning to his associates to laugh about Bickle's nonsensical response. Cut to the next scene, and a twelve-year-old prostitute hops into the very same seat in which Palantine sat, and she screams at Bickle to drive off immediately to help her escape her pimp.\nThe juxtaposition of these two scenes underscores a political message that frequently recurs throughout the film's two-hour duration: the idealism of politics and mainstream culture versus America's darker actualities, embodied by the streets which Bickle observes nightly through the tint of his taxi's windows. Palantine remains convinced that he understands the state of America and its \"normal\" people (the wage-earners, the laborers, the cab drivers, etc.), while an entirely darker reality exists under the one he conjures. The American people presented in the film cling to the hopeful rhetoric of false prophets such as Palantine, choosing to believe that the worst issues facing America lie in poor foreign policy and unfair income distribution. They turn a blind eye to the individuals deeply affected by systematic flaws, thus choosing to ignore the disturbed nature of men such as Travis Bickle. The negative effects of the public's forcible disillusionment are compounded by their fetishizing of violence, shown by the ultimate tabloid glorification of Travis's massacre. These dangerous misconceptions about the American Dream and about what is important in society result in Travis's circular character arc.\nThe audience's perception of Palantine proves itself largely underdeveloped, as Scorsese never gives us an overt opinion on him. As the narrator and the viewers' only real frame of reference, Travis Bickle proves useless in forming a stance on Palantine. Travis repeatedly says, \"Well, you know I don't follow political issues that closely,\" leaving the audience to assume that he formed his initially supportive view of Palantine merely to get closer to the woman of his dreams, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). That being said, Palantine clearly works hard to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of the average Joe's politician, a unifying figure who can re-instill hope in the American Dream and service people of all ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds (not unlike Bobby Kennedy). His main conceit, of course, is that he himself leads a privileged life and cannot possibly count himself among those included in his campaign slogan, \"We Are the People.\" Even the volunteers working in his office clearly come from privileged backgrounds, judging by their appearances and by the fact that they can afford to work full-time without pay. And yet, Charles Palantine claims to be a part of the people's \"struggle,\" and ensures widespread reform across issues involving the military, poverty and race relations. \nScorsese and writer Paul Schrader never let us forget how absurd it is that this amount of idealism exists within a film narrated by a neurotic war veteran who likely suffers from PTSD. This contradiction never really lets the audience find ay truth in Palantine's inspiring rhetoric. For example, a tracking shot through the audience at the Columbus Circle rally focuses on the torsos of individual supporters, finally settling on the instantly recognizable Army surplus jacket of one Travis Bickle. From this angle, he looks like just another body in the crowd, until he pops open his pill bottle and knocks another couple back as the camera tilts upward to show his face, an act that immediately sets him apart from the crowd, but is further emphasized by his radically altered appearance. De Niro sports a devilish grin and a Mohican-style Mohawk, a hairstyle change that he and Scorsese decided upon after learning that the Special Forces in Vietnam adopted it for dangerous missions. His freakish appearance and casual pill-popping distinguish Bickle as one who does not fit within Palantine's vision of the American people. Scorsese could have opted to portray Travis as just another face in the crowd, but instead he chooses to visually set him apart from the rest. It is a stark juxtaposition between the candidate's self-assured speech and the would-be assassin's psychotic mannerisms, but one that Scorsese repeatedly emphasizes to show the disconnect between mainstream America's political idealism and the uglier realities of life. \nThe public's self-imposed ignorance to the existence of men such as Bickle proves dangerous on its own, but it immediately becomes a ticking time bomb when coupled with their fetishizing of violence. The Americans presented in the film believe in the heroism of John Wayne and of other lone wolf gunslingers (as evidenced by the hero worship Bickle receives after the massacre), yet they have no conception of how this reverence impacts a man like Travis. Taxi Driver's sultry, jazzy score at times echoes the backing music of the porn films Travis sits through, and at times invokes horror film-esque insanity, but it also obscures the Western narrative intrinsic to Bickle's character arc. Travis is undoubtedly a loner, a man incapable of human connection and one perceived as a complete freak by \"normal\" people. While he establishes some sort of relationship with Iris (Jodie Foster), he completely sabotages his chances with Betsy by taking her to a dirty movie on their first date. I would argue that Travis's subconscious drives Betsy away on purpose, because he wants to believe in his vision of the world, that he alone stands above the mess (In an interview, Scorsese said Travis envisions himself as an \"avenging angel.\"). \"I see now that she is just like the others,\" he narrates. \nHis failure with Betsy-intentional or otherwise\u00ac-allows Travis to condemn the world in its entirety and assign himself the deadly purpose of killing off the \"scum\" in one final, Western shootout-style scene. The film's tagline reads, \"On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody.\" The concept of the American Dream and the public's negative perception of outsiders force Travis to find his own means of becoming \"somebody,\" and he does so by capitalizing on the public's violent fetishes. First, though, he convinces himself that he must transform himself into the killing machine that will most captivate the public's eye. He begins this process by purchasing guns.\n\"You should see what a .44 Magnum can do to a woman's pussy,\" declares a deranged taxi passenger (portrayed by Martin Scorsese himself) early on in the film. From that point on, Bickle comes to associate the weapon with the masculine hero he intends to embody. When he meets with the sleazy gun salesman, he immediately asks, \"You have a .44 Magnum?\". At this point in time, the gun itself had already made its way into pop culture and taken its position as the weapon of choice for the Western hero. In the original Dirty Harry film, Clint Eastwood (a man whose masculinity has, on multiple occasions, been the subject of academic literature) calls the .44 Magnum, \"The most powerful gun in the world, and it will blow your head clean off.\" Again, it is no accident that Travis chooses this particular gun out of all the possibilities. To him, the .44 Magnum is a vital ingredient in his recipe for creating a violent persona that will make him somebody by captivating the public's deranged sense of heroics. On a visual level, this obsession with the gun presents itself almost immediately following the interaction with the gun salesman, as the audience finds themselves alone with Travis in his run-down apartment. With his newly muscled body on full display, De Niro stands facing the mirror, which happens also to be where the camera rests. He repeatedly draws and pretends to fire the .44 out of an ancient leather holster right out of a Sergio Leone film. Add in the Bowie knife he eventually uses to stab the timekeeper's hand, and not a single person could doubt Bickle's intense, heroic masculinity. Imagery of the .44 Magnum also pops up in the tracking shot of the massacre's aftermath (one rests at Travis' feet, and a bloodied one lies in Sport's hand), further likening the scene to a Western shootout via visual contextualization. \nAn alternate reading of the film explains Travis' need for violent behavior as his form of release, something he finds himself unable to attain through sexual means. At one point, the Wizard (Peter Boyle) suggests Travis let out some of his anxiety by \"getting laid or getting drunk,\" a suggestion that Travis barely seems to register. Soon after the audience meets Travis, we find him in a porn theatre, half-heartedly hitting on the lady working the concessions stand and then disinterestedly viewing the action onscreen, as the voiceover narration rambles on about his insomnia. Travis only seems to find arousal in the porn theatre once he has purchased his guns, when Scorsese interjects a shot of De Niro pretending to shoot at the actors onscreen. This theory of Travis finding some sort of orgasmic release through violence provides an interesting insight into the narrative of the film. It leaves open the possibility that, if he could let off anxiety through sexual means, perhaps he would have ended up just \"making it\" with Iris instead of feeling the need to violently save the damsel in distress by killing her captors. \nHowever, the possibility remains that the idea of Travis utilizing violence to capture the public's attention and make himself \"somebody\" can work hand-in-hand with the theory of him using it for release. If Travis ultimately wanted to find identity or meaning through attention and notoriety, then he achieved his goal. The public, as one could have expected, glorified Travis's actions. The tabloid headlines on his apartment wall read, \"Taxi Driver Battles Gangsters\" and \"Taxi Driver Hero to Recover,\" instead of \"Psychotic Loner Murders Three People.\" However, if he wanted release, then that means his character arc is caught in a cycle (repression, anxiety, then release) implying that he will have a violent outburst again. Paul Schrader once said that he thinks if you attached the end of the film to its beginning, it would still make sense in terms of character arc. \"Travis is not going to be a hero next time,\" Schrader said. Visually, this is supported by the film's first and last shots of Travis Bickle. In each of them, the audience sees only his eyes as framed by the rearview mirror of his taxi, a slight red hue imbuing the image with a sense of doom.\nWhether Travis wants release or glorification almost does not matter, as it does not change the film's underlying political messages. The public forcibly disillusions itself into believing the false of idealism of insincere politicians, effectively ignoring both the darker realities of street life and the twisted minds of social outcasts. This blindness coupled with the American people's obsession with violent, masculine heroics creates a pressure cooker in the minds of men like Travis Bickle, and on a broader level reflects the inequities inherent in American society.",

Ultimately, he chooses good over bad after his attempt at assassinating Senator Palantine goes kaput thus causing him to save Iris. While this theory can easily be argued--i've heard other theories that argue the ending might not even be real but a figment of Travis's imagination--it's the music which sells this theory. Throughout the film, there's a constant clash between light and dark while listening to the soft jazz in comparison to the menacing operatic piece.

That being it said, this movie is pretty fantastic and near perfect. The cinematography is beautiful for how low budget it is, the feel of the movie is fantastic, the sense of danger is awesome, and almost everything clicks. Now, if your a person that just likes a lot of action and doesn't like slow moving movies, then this isn't  for you. It starts off slow and is almost like an awkward romance movie in the beginning. It starts to pick up during the second half and the ending climax is fantastic. If you want to see a movie that gives you a sense of how real filmmaking is suppose to look like, feel, and be presented, then doesn't no further than the taxi driver. It is truly a spectacular movie for those with a tension span for someone who's older than fifteen. Those who don't should stay away. You'll be missing out on a treat though. The one thing I have to say that I wish there was a little more action. For a Martin Scorsese film, it's a lacking on action, but nether-less its fantastic. Must see. Overall I'm satisfied with this movie, but wouldn't say its one of my favorites. 8.9/10\r\n\r\nAlso this is by far Robert De Niros best acting job. He was the hit of the show as the vigilante/antihero and actually completely made the movie.",

            "content": "Now regarded as a cinematic classic, I have to admit that Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" was always a film that left me as isolated as it's lead character. The first time I saw it, I thought it vastly overrated. Admittedly, I was in my teens at this point and never managed to fully grasp it's themes. With each viewing it, admittedly, grew in stature but I could never really get over my initial judgement. It's not often that I'll backtrack on my opinion but I have now come full circle and can appreciate just how good a film it is and why it's regarded as one of the true greats of American cinema.\n\nTravis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a lonely, mentally unstable taxi driver who scours New York City every night where he becomes increasingly disgusted with the seedy cesspool around him. He attempts to strike up a connection with local presidential campaign worker, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) but when that falls flat, he takes it upon himself to change things and fails again in an assassination attempt on the Senator himself (Leonard Harris). Determined to make a difference, he turns his mind to rescuing Iris (Jodie Foster), a preadolescent prostitute from the clutches of her pimp and lover, Sport (Harvey Keitel).\n\nOpening with Bernard Herrmann's distinctive and sleazy score, we are thrust into the nightlife of New York City where there's a blaze of neon light reflected on the streets and rainswept windscreens. The grim debauchery of the city's nightlife is captured to perfection by Michael Chapman's striking cinematography. As much as Herrmann and Chapman play a major part in the proceedings, though, so too does the unsettling delivery of DeNiro in a bravura show of restraint and suggestion. The film wastes no time in introducing us to his iconic Travis Bickle: a 26 year old, Vietnam veteran and insomniac who struggles to socially connect. This truly is one of DeNiro's finest moments onscreen. He would receive, a well deserved, Oscar nomination and to actually win the award would not have been out of place either. It's a captivating performance and it's hard to avert your eyes from his intensity. Speaking of eyes, it's easy to lose count of the amount of times that DeNiro acts with them alone. At times, he doesn't even need to speak as his eyes, either directly or indirectly, speak volumes. We often get a glimpse of them as he observes the city's inhabitants through his rear view mirror and there's a lot going on. Behind them, a simmering menace and desperation are so expressively captured and Scorsese is wise to focus on them. Essentially Travis' eyes are our own in this debauched and immoral world of degenerates. Even DeNiro's (now infamous) \"You talkin' to me?\" ad-lib stems from him observing himself in the mirror and playing out his deranged fantasies. Whether intentional or not, Scorsese's use of mirrors play quite a significant part in reflecting Travis' alienation and paranoid psychosis.\n\nAs for the Big Apple itself, Scorsese has regularly been known for his ability to capture it in the minutest detail but \"Taxi Driver\" has to be the most descriptive he's ever been. Through Travis' perspective, he depicts it as a nightmarish, hell on earth; the steam rising from the street vents and crime and prostitution at every corner. This is a city that's depicted with dark and repugnant depths as the dirt and grime oozes from it's pores. Our troubled protagonist struggles to come to term with it as we observe his increasing frustration and distance. We feel his alienation and through his diary entries we are allowed to hear his innermost thoughts. It's unnerving to see Travis' decent and the dangerous fragility of his mental health. When he finally attests to having \"... some bad ideas in my head\", we realise that the depravity of this environment is dangerously permeating this man's psyche.\n\nAt one point Travis is compared the lyrics of Kris Kristofferson's song He's a Pilgrim: \"... a walking contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction.\nTaking every wrong direction on his lonley way back home\" which is cleverly dropped in at an early point in the film but only makes complete sense when his odyssey is over. It's moments like this that only serve as a reminder of the layers in Paul Schrader's script. This isn't simply about one man's struggle with society but an astute, psychological character study that ambiguously treads a fine line between redemption and damnation while leaving us to question our interpretation of events. The denouement is particularly interesting and although Schrader himself has stated that the closing \"could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again\" suggesting that what we've witnessed falls more into the damnation element of Travis, there also exists a sequence that could arguably be claimed as redemptive which would leave Travis Bickle as on of cinema's most intriguing (and contradictory) anti-hero's.\n\nAlmost 40 years on and now firmly part of American film culture, this still has as much staying power as it had upon its release. It's just a shame that it's taken me all of 20 years to fully appreciate it. A reappraisal of this film was always a major requirement of mine but by going into it with a more open mind, I can honestly say that I feel I have experienced \"Taxi Driver\" as if it was my first time and that experience was, simply, magnificent.\n\nMark Walker",

Instead it looks at a troubled and desperate man that just wants to live in a pure and civilised society, and ends up trying to do something about it. This aspect of the film I like, it makes points about society and the victims of its cruelty that are relevant even today, but there are also things I don't like. The biggest problem is the storytelling, it seems like it was made up as it went along, the film finds itself mid way through; its as if when it started being written there wasn't really much of an idea for a story, it all just seemed a bit improvised. There are also a lot pf things that arent explored in enough detail, like his unclear relationship with Betsy and the seemingly important but barely mentioned fact that he is a war veteran. This is an overall well acted movie with some good points on urban society, but would of been a lot stronger if there was more direction; if it actually knew what it wanted to be. This seems like one of the films you need to watch twice, maybe I'll come back to it at some point...",

            "content": "\"You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.\"\n\nIf you look up the word 'masterpiece' in the dictionary, Taxi Driver is its definition. Not only does it appeal subjectively to audiences but it is a complete film in all the technical aspects as well. It has a stunning cinematography capturing the dark and dirty streets of New York City, a gorgeous and eerie score that accompanies the action perfectly, some amazing camera angles and shots, perfect editing, and some of the greatest ever performances you will see in a film. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a visually stunning film that happens to be one of the greatest character studies of all time. There have been hundreds of films focusing on characters suffering from some sort of traumatic experience from war, but none have captured that complex mental breakdown as well as De Niro's Travis Bickle. Much of the credit has to be given to screenwriter Paul Schrader who suffered a similar mental breakdown and dealt with it by writing this amazing and somewhat autobiographical script, but De Niro and Scorsese took it even further by doing the best work of their careers. There isn't a single scene in this film that feels out of place and De Niro plays every note perfectly. There isn't a better character study about a Vietnam war veteran than Travis Bickle who slowly descends into psychotic behavior as he isolates himself from the rest of society and decides he has to try to do something to clean the filthy streets of New York. \n\nImagine a man who has served as a Marine in the Vietnam war only to come home and find that not only does the country he has served not appreciate him, but it has become a filthy and dirty place. That is such the case with Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) who is mentally unstable and suffering from insomnia. He decides that he might as well work as a taxi driver since he spends all night driving around anyway. We don't get any flashbacks about his experience in the war, but he is clearly disturbed by the deteriorated society he lives in. He finds it incredibly difficult to interact with anyone, but in the midst of all the filth and darkness there is one person who shines a ray of hope for him. The only redemptive quality for Travis in this city is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who works for the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). He invites Betsy out for a cup of coffee and she accepts. They share some sort of bond, but he messes up when he invites her to the cinema and takes her to a porno movie (he's so disconnected with society that he thinks it's what normal couples do). That is where their relationship ends and he completely breaks down. He becomes fascinated with guns and decides he has to clean the streets of New York. One of the first steps he takes is trying to save a twelve year old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp and lover, Sport (Harvey Keitel), but his mind is clearly troubled and there seems to be nothing that will put it at ease.\n\nTaxi Driver is my favorite Scorsese film so far and I can't believe it took me so long to watch it. I can see how this film clearly resonated at a time where American society was clearly disturbed after the events of Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, but the film has transcended the test of time and it continues to be a disturbing portrait of a mentally ill man dealing with isolation. It's a wonderful film that somehow speaks to audiences differently. It has all the qualities of an art house film but somehow it has found a mainstream audience (probably thanks to Robert De Niro's stunning performance). After having seen several clips of this film I always imagined it focused on this taxi driver following around Iris, but that was actually only a small part of the film. Jodie Foster is so great in those short but memorable scenes that she is in almost every highlight of Taxi Driver. The real star however is Robert De Niro who gives such a believable and natural performance of a troubled and complex man. Taxi Driver is one of the most powerful and groundbreaking films that I've seen and so much has been written about it already. It's a unique experience and one that everyone should go through!",

Taxi Driver is a film that represents one of the most important rules for cinema: characters. It follows an ex-marine called Travis Bickle, a lonely young man that wants to  help to change his city; his journey is presented by showing us his daily routine and expressing his feelings and life philosophy via a diary. This aspect of the movie maybe not the most overwhelming, but it's crucial to understand the changes on Travis' life and the situations that he encounters. It's a neo-noir film filled with social satire and the human behavior. Scorsese's shots talk by themselves and help to develop the character, along with a really precise cinematography that captures New York's filthiness and dangerous alleys. The score composed by Bernard Herrmann captures the greedy tone of the film with jazz that captures a mob feeling on Taxi Driver. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made, Taxi Driver will always be remembered as the movie that made you question your own sense of morality and made vigilantes look cool.",

And while the first and last 30 minutes were entertaining, there was a big schlop in the middle of the film that was - to some extent - boring. \n\nNow the positives, that do outweigh the negatives. DeNiro was never as appealing as an actor as he was in Taxi Driver. Scorsese's style and artistic choices were very unique and inspiring. Great cinematography, and while the climax was not as suspenseful as I would've liked, how the tension builds throughout the film is really amazing. Great supporting performances as well, specifically Shepherd and Foster (though DeNiro steals the show).",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him.\n\nThe plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination.\n\nThis film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind.\n\nMichael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way.\n\n\nBernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York.\n\nThe film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting.\n\nIt contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "I think my generation has become ridiculously desensitized.  It's clear in this movie that when the killings occur you are supposed to be in utter shock.  However,  having seen movies like the Rambo series and \"Old Boy\" I found myself barley affected by the event.  Still, \"Taxi Driver\" was an excellent movie.  Robert De Niro is fantastic.  It was interesting to watch him when he was much younger, and to see just how skinny he is.  Also, while many critics have described his character as crazy or even insane, I disagree.  Sure, De Niro certainly plays a strange character.  But, everything that he does in the film makes sense.  There is no irrational behavior.  Every action is logical.  With that being said he certainly becomes attached to a darker side of life.  The music plays a wonderful role in the film and I enjoyed the running theme throughout, however, as I stated early, the killing scene did not have as much effect as intended.  The music played during the scene was brutal and loud, but it lasted much longer than needed and just wasn't effective to me.  The camera shots on the other had were wonderful.  The rolling shot of the killing scene was fantastic.  Some of the shots of the cab and of the city were just as appealing.  With all of these things, however,  it is clear that Martin Scorsese was still developing his style for movies and was not as crisp as some of his future works.  All in all, though, \"Taxi Driver\" still packs a good punch for the viewer today.",

He travels through any street of any burrough, and witnesses the scum of the Earth committing the most dastardly actions ever possible by man. Bickle has had enough of it. He is ready to take action himself, and fight the scum. Based on this description, what would you think Taxi Driver plays out like: an underground detective drama, a morally challenging action flick? Not even close. Martin Scorsese may do his best to depict this world with the same blurry, disoriented vision that Bickle must see New York City, but don't be fooled. Scorsese knows what story is really being told. The message is that people like Bickle are so dangerously sociopathic that they are willing to take actions based solely on their short-sighted perspective of the world. Our central character is despicable, even pathetic, but De Niro somehow plays Bickle with such discomforting charm. My attachment towards the character felt plagued by his extremely unstable nature, to the very last shot of him sharply turning his eyes to his rear view mirror. I could never quite predict what De Niro would do next, not even in scenes where I had a vague idea of what would happen.\n\nAs an avid movie watcher, there's always the possibility that my personal opinion of the character is skewing what the movie was trying to tell. I have yet to justify my claim that Scorsese was depicting Bickle as a dangerous man. There were other characters, in their own scenes. We had campaign managers Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and Tom (Albert Brooks), a 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), and her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel).  Everyone was so young. Anyway, it may not be much of a shock to recognize Betsy and Tom as stable, rational people who were comfortable in their environments, despite what Travis Bickle firmly believed and told Betsy on one of their dates. What was more shocking was a scene between Iris and Sport, after Travis ate breakfast with Iris and encouraged Iris to break out of the prostitution ring and return to her parents. Iris tells Sport that she has thought of leaving the business. Sport's response? A warm embrace, followed by a slow dance to the smooth jazz that is the theme to Taxi Driver. That's right, Bickle was wrong about her too. It's too late for him to recognize that, however, because by the climax of the movie, Iris doesn't have a choice but to leave. Subconsciously, Bickle does not give a damn about how other people actually feel. He is a purely selfish man who believes that everyone should be grateful for his deeds, up to and including his most psychotic ones. And as the camera cascades above the climactic scene, past the bullet-riddled bodies and blood-stained walls of the whore house, the scariest horror is that Travis Bickle is seen as a hero in his world. He is still out there. Taxi Driver is such a unique experience, and this was only the beginning for most of the people involved in the production. Absolutely flawless.",

This film takes you through his daily life and you see almost the entire film (with the exception of one scene) through his point of view. You understand him at first but as the film goes on and as he transcends into further madness, he becomes less understandable and you know it cannot end well.. The ending made this film for me. When Travis shoots up the entire whorehouse due to his hatred and his every growing craziness. He's then hailed as hero to the city. Since we have gotten to know him throughout the film, we know he's dangerous but since he's so called cleaned up an eye soar in the city, he's hailed a hero and allowed back on the streets even though he is completely insane and will continue to commit the same actions.. such a brilliant film, My second favorite Scorsese movie behind goodfellas and one of the best films ever",

            "content": "I have a Top 5 Movies of All Time list. It goes Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Drive, Brick, and Psycho. Or at least it used to go like that. Taxi Driver has now taken the number one spot.\r\n\r\nTaxi Driver is directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle an introverted taxi driver who is slowly driven insane by urban decay in New York. This film is often lauded as a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't agree more.\r\n\r\nThe acting from De Niro is mesmerizing. When I watched this movie I didn't see De Niro, I saw Travis Bickle. He's scary good. It makes me really sad to see him giving powerhouse performances in this, Raging Bull, and The King of Comedy and now starring in Little Fockers, and New Year's Eve. Jodie Foster is great in the film and also feels very natural and real. Cybill Shepherd is great as well, a bit robotic, but that's the point. The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle, does a great job as well. Hell, even the extras feel realistic. There is not a single flaw in the casting or acting, it's tremendous. \r\n\r\nThe direction by Martin Scorsese is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. The film has a very bleak and scary tone throughout and Travis' mental deterioration is clear, but doesn't feel spoon-fed. To elaborate, Travis' progression throughout the film is clear in some of his actions, but alot of it requires alot of thought as to why exactly he's going mad. The screenplay is great, it says many interesting things about society and also gives us a scary look inside the mind of this man. The cinematography is great. There are many incredible shots that will stick with you for a while. The editing is fantastic, very slick. Not too many cuts, but shots don't hold for too long, perfect. The visuals are excellent especially during the opening sequence and the last shot. Technically this film is masterful on every level. \r\n\r\n***Heavy Spoilers:\r\n\r\nThis film impacted me alot. Not only was it incredible from a filmmaking standpoint, but it says alot about society. It might be almost 40 years old, but it still holds up remarkably well today. It's a story about isolation, destiny, and what's right and what's wrong. Travis feels disconnected from the rest of the world and feels like he'll never be able to fit in with society. When he does make an attempt to, it fails. He feels as if he was meant to be alone and anytime he tries to make a decision on his own it backfires. He is sick of all the bad things he sees on the streets, so he takes matters into his own hands and kills 3 people in the process, but also saves a young girl. The film ends on a very surprising note, having Travis being regarded as a hero. The movie ends with him taking his past love interest to here house and she seems to accept him. This scene is handled very well as it is neither sentimental or sad, it leaves it to the audience to decide. The final shot is of Travis adjusting his mirror symbolizing that he may not be completely insane anymore, but back to the way he was in the very beginning of the film. Paul Schrader (screenwriter) saying that it \"could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again\". So he has not changed really at all. He's a time-bomb ready to go off.\r\n\r\nOverall: A cinematic masterpiece with phenomenal acting, great direction, pretty much everything is great.\r\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 10/10 CERTIFIED KICK-ASH!",

Or maybe they're reviewing a different movie? Did I get a bad copy, because something doesn't add up here!\n\nI have met at least 10 people who have called Taxi Driver one of their favorite movies. I have read reviews that make it seem like the creme de la creme of 70's film-making. They've thrown around words like \"master piece\" when describing this film. It's directed by Scorsese and stars Robert De Nero for God's sake, that should make it a sure thing.... right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nThis movie is a piece of horse dung wrapped in elephant droppings. It's a complete dud. It could quite possibly be the most boring film ever.\n\nIt's a character study, yes I know, but what the hell people? It just sits there, farting movie images and story that goes in circles and does nothing. NOTHING! Nothing happens. \n\nThe worst part in all of this? It took forever to just to get to its point, which is NOTHING again!!! This movie must be at least a week long. At least that's how long it felt. It took almost 90 minutes for SOMETHING to happen God dang it! Is this Scorsese's idea of suspense? If so, kindly reevaluate your meaning of life and why we exist.\n\nThis is that type of movie, that you start thinking it's gonna blow your socks off, and ends up being just a disaster. DISASTER! My brain hurt, I started hallucinating, thinking about lightning strikes destroying my TV so we wouldn't have to suffer any longer. I love films, why did this one have to exist?\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: There is no reason this movie should have been made in the first place. It's a movie where nothing happens. And we see a man doing nothing. Then interacting with other people who do nothing. Then they do nothing together, until, yeah nothing.\n\nAt the end of the movie granted there is a little action. A little. Very minuscule amount. Almost negligible. Nobody tell me that that justifies the 2 hours of torture that precede it!\n\nDe Nero is a good actor, and he performs well. But it's still not enough to make this movie entertaining to anyone but the most patient of movie-goers.\n\nTry to avoid this movie at all costs. I thinking forcing someone to sit through this boring film is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment and is subject to the Geneva Convention.",

            "content": "WHYYYYYY DID MARTIN SCORSESE MAKE HUGO? HE WAS SO GREAT! WHYYYYYYYYYYY??? Anyway, let's get down to business-- Taxi Driver is, in a word, a religious experience. Now, you might say \"No, that's three words.\" Well, fuck it, because I can't cram how good this movie is into one. Featuring an absolutely legendary performance from Robert De Niro, Scorsese's stylish direction, and a story that takes the viewer deep into the underbelly of humanity, this is a cinematic feat in every sense of the phrase. More modern films have clearly taken cues from Taxi Driver's stylish direction, but even they feel too polished to fully reproduce it. The movie was made in the 70s, but feels almost like a period piece set in that time. It captures the essence of the era so well, it's absolutely absorbing.\r\n\r\nTaxi Driver stars Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a down-and-out New Yorker who gets a job driving a taxi and soon succumbs to a mind-warping breed of insanity that starts to consume him. He first becomes enthralled with an attractive woman (Cybill Shepherd) who works for a presidential campaign, and he starts to push himself on her somewhat, taking her out to coffee after much coaxing and bringing her along to see pornos without her consent. Eventually, of course, she gets too frustrated with him and refuses to return his calls, leaving him even deeper into his depraved mental state. Now, from that description, you would think that De Niro's character is basically an antihero, and that the audience is supposed to root for his comeuppance. Quite the opposite-- De Niro is somehow able to turn his character into a lovable and sweet (although sociopathic) person who just happened to fall head-over-heels for a woman who now won't even speak to him. It's legitimately heartbreaking to watch. A phone conversation between them is particularly memorable, in which only De Niro's end is heard. \"I sent you flowers... did you get those...?\" Even when delivered by a completely agoraphobic psychopath, that line just makes you feel for the guy.\r\n\r\nAs his descent into madness continues, De Niro decides to arm himself... for reasons undisclosed to the audience. He purchases four handguns (including a Colt 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, that can blow your head CLEAN OFF... do you feel lucky, punk?) and gets fucking ripped. He then proceeds to get a mohawk and a shady-looking army jacket and shadow the presidential candidate's speeches while armed to the teeth. This is where the plot gets downright creepy. The viewer begins to wonder where Scorsese is going with this, and if he's actually going to have this legitimately likable hero become a Lee Harvey Oswald. But fortunately, no... and that's all I'll say, as I don't want to include any spoilers here.\r\n\r\nTaxi Driver also features Jodie Foster in her starmaking role as a twelve-year-old child prostitute named Iris. After just seeing Elysium, it's jarring to watch a performance of hers that is actually good. But really, there's something innately depressing about Taxi Driver here. It showcases everyone involved in peak performance, and they all just went downhill from there. Jodie Foster gave her flat performance in Elysium, De Niro starred in Little Fockers and The Big Wedding, and Scorsese himself made... *shudder*... HUGO. That fucking turd of a movie... what a piece of shit. Oh right, I was talking about Taxi Driver.\r\n\r\nThis movie did, in my opinion, somewhat act as the precursor to David Fincher's career. It features the grit, the atmospherics, and the overall feel that presides in films like Se7en and Fight Club. Scorsese's imaginative and powerful visuals contribute to making Taxi Driver truly great, featuring clever camera angles and unforgettable neon lights against rainy backdrops. It will either make you fall in love with New York or make you think that it's a festering shithole for the dregs of humanity. Both opinions are definitely backed up in some way in this film. Also, Taxi Driver has a lot of humor (black as it may be), ranging from simply clever dialogue to seriously biting social commentary. The way the film portrays the 1970s almost parodies the decade, showcasing over-the-top outfits (fucking bell-bottoms), deliberately retro dialogue, and a vibe that makes it feel dated and fresh at the same time. Even though it was made 40 years ago, a lot of the commentary it gives on politics, society, and day-to-day life remains relevant today. So who cares if they use rotary phones?\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Taxi Driver: 9/10 stars. It's one of my favorite films from the 1970s, and definitely deserves its place as the best vigilante film of all time. De Niro gives one of his best performances ever in what is quite possibly the peak of his career, and the rest of the supporting cast charms as well (including Harvey Keitel in Tommy Wiseau look-alike mode). Altogether an absolute masterpiece of cinema that displays some of the most classic dialogue and acting ever put to film. This is a must-see for film buffs everywhere.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him.\n\nThe plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination.\n\nThis film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind.\n\nMichael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way.\n\n\nBernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York.\n\nThe film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting.\n\nIt contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch.",

He has a deep yearning and loneliness that I believe all viewers will understand, but it's the way he betrays the viewer's trust that sets him apart from the psyche of the average moviegoer. He has the chance to do something meaningful that he wasn't given the chance to truly do in Vietnam yet he chooses the path of violence and death.\n\nMartin Scorsese's direction is light and jazzy, similar to his masterpiece \"Mean Streets\", and different from the rigidity in structure found in films like \"GoodFellas\" and \"The Departed\". It's a film with dark and probing themes dealing with a man's search for intimacy and purpose, but is crafted with an airy sensitivity that is matched by the authenticity of De Niro's earth-shattering performance.\n\nAlso, the musical contribution by the great Bernard Hermann can't at all be understated. His scoring in this film IS New York City. The difference is that this music doesn't carry the optimism we hear in other New York films. Hermann's music is the seedy, dicey, ugly underbelly of New York that Scorsese wants you to see.\n\nI could gush about this masterwork of cinematic ingenuity and invention all day, but sadly I must find a way to sum things up. In a word, \"Taxi Driver\" is magic. It's trickery and illusion; it meshes the real with the unreal; the spiritual with the physical. It touches on so many things from true love versus faux intimacy to justice versus violence. This is my favorite of all time, and, in my opinion, a perfectly directed film. If you haven't, stop what you're doing and watch this movie.",

What I love about the film is the character of Travis Bickle, a lonely taxi driver, whom we feel sorry for at first, but as the film progresses, we watch him slowly go down the road of insanity. I think the acting is great. I think Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster should how won the Oscars that they were nominated for. Along with the amazing scores by late Bernard Herrmann. As I've said, \"Taxi Driver\" is my second favorite film of all-time!",

I think what is most important is Travis' disgust at the way the city is, and his inability to effectively communicate or try to solve the problem. Seeing that the problem can't be fixed by a simple politician or activism, he resorts to the only method he can picture as being effective. Of course, his hatred for the scum of the city is a reflection of his disgust in himself. The same way he feels about New York can be applied to the way he feels about his life. Which is why at the end he wants to commit suicide, to purge not only the evil surrounding the Jodie Foster character, but his own evil. But he is unable to do so, which I think is a sort of symbol for the fact that it's impossible to rid the world of evil. Even when you get the guts to try, you're out of ammo. The fact that he wants to save Jodie Foster but can't is very important as well. It's essentially a failed attempt at being Jean Valjean, gaining redemption by saving somebody else from their living hell. The problem is, she's content to stay in her hell. She is surrounded by people who don't actually care for her and treat her horribly, but she's willing to stay. We don't even know why she got there in the first place. Travis' failed attempt at saving her is just another example of the impossibility he faces of fighting against the city's corrupt and vile ways.",

It's a hard-hitting, smooth, and truthful film on the dark streets of the world. \n\nPLOT:Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) has just gotten a job as a taxi driver in the streets of New York. He's smooth, quiet, and hates most of the rabble of the streets. However, he meets a beautiful blonde working in office named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and falls in love. It doesn't last long, though, until he makes a big mistake and scares her way. No matter how much he tries to re-kindle things with her, she always turns him away, which forces him to snap. He then comes up with an idea to kill the candidate in office this girl is working for. Meanwhile, he's trying to help a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) escape from her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), and go back to her parents. It's a good plot executed greatly. \n\nACTING:The acting in here was very great. Robert De Niro did an excellent job of playing our lead, Travis Bickle. I think it was a very memorable performance, Another performance worthy of note is the young Jodie Foster as 12-year-old hooker, Iris. Even at this young age, she was a very talented actress. The other shiners would be Harvey Keitel as Sport, Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, Peter Boyle as Wizard and Martin Scorsese himself in a cameo as the weird, vengeful passenger. \n\nSCORE:The score in here is very smooth and smoky sounding, like a crime mystery in a bar. It fits the mood of the film very well. \n\nEFFECTS:The blood in here flows pretty freely for an action flick. There are a lot of kills, and blood to accompany. The blood effects in here look pretty realistic and detailed as gunshots are fired and knifes are used. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film is a very interesting look at the decline of society today. The exaggerated realism of it all shocks you and puts the urban world into what I believe to be its place. The performances lead the plot through with great direction by the beloved Martin Scorsese. However, this film had a plot issue for me. Though the plot was very well thought-out, it wasn't completely solid. You couldn't sit down and tell me the plot without telling me all the twists in it first, like Dazed and Confused.

He is a psycho, but he's driven by loneliness, giving many viewers a strong connection and feeling of empathy to him.

It's probably the best De Niro performance I've seen so far although Jodie Foster is even better (considering her age, it's actually remarkable what she's able to do).\n\nThe film focusses on De Niro's Travis Bickle though. Not a bad choice either. I have a new interpretation for the character (at least, I've never read my version before).\n\nTravis is a poet. Apparently, when we listen to his monologues and diary entries we realize that there's a lot of potential and desire for beauty in his soul. Vietnam, and the streets of NY can't let him see this beauty he desires so badly though. He only sees the dark sides of life, and within all the darkness, one bright spot that is Iris. So he turns into a vigilante with the same attitude as Watchmen's Rorschach. There is black and there is white, and Travis decides to eliminate the black from the street, or at least, free Iris from the clutch of evil. Tragically, he can't escape the darkness himself (SPOILER ALERT), his suicide attempt fails, and as we see in the epilogue, he'll fight on until his time will come. According to his plans, it should have ended with the liberation of Iris (SPOILER END).\n\nIt has great images, artistic violence, and a main character so multi-faceted and complicated that I can't fully understand him. This is also a bit of a problem, as his motives and his breakdown seemed a bit forced to me. I liked the version of Travis at the beginning of the film better anyways.\n\nTravis Bickle is the ultimate anti-hero. The ailing soul on the verge of a breakdown who goes all the way, to fight evil. He's a character similar to Batman, Rorschach or The Punisher. Just that his distinction between good and bad is somewhat questionable, and his means of fighting are on par with the brutality of the latter two superheroes.",

Taxi Driver is the definition of an anti-hero, his philosophy on life is spectacular but at the same time his mental state is one which does not seem stable.\nThe cinematography is a realistic and well put together depiction of New York. The subjective point of view from Travis is the world from his point of view, the poetic voice-over telling us his every thought, it allows the audience to connect to Travis' isolation and loneliness.\nTravis is a Vietnam war veteran who becomes mentally unstable his primary goal is to save just one person from this mess of a place, he trys to fall in love but is unable because he doesn't love himself, he then finds a salvation in a young Prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster), he wants to save her from the Pimps which he calls 'the lowest' and succeeds, whether he feels he has succeeded or not we don't know as the film ends but we know he survives the Pimp killing scene the climax as it was.\nTo conclude Taxi Driver is another Scorsese film which dosen't appeal for everybody but a majority of people at one time or another will feel the thoughts he has and will live long in film history, not only for the ground breaking performance from De Niro but also the Sublime directing from Scorsese and the Creative script from Shrader but as a whole including a memorable score and distinct visuals, this film is a masterpiece.",

From the opening scene, Bickle (Robert DeNero) displays an edgy loner who, in the end, is more lonely than he is psychotic.  He needs to save someone in order to be saved himself.  The striking element in this film is the amount of \"watching\" taking place.  From Bickle himself, watching Cybill Shepherd through the window of Senator Palatine's campaign office, to one of the most captivating scenes of the movie, Scorsese himself, forcing Bickle to watch through the window at his cheating wife, as he describes how is going to murder her.  This movie brings about a sense of bitter hostility to the \"regular\" world around us.  A world where everyone seems to fit in but you.  Bickle becomes so embittered against this world, where average and cheap seems acceptable to everyone.  The streets of New York, a cesspool for pimps, lowlife's, junkies and prostitute's, capture the moral disintegration of society as a whole to Bickle, who becomes more and more plagued by the hostility of being misunderstood.  In the end, he finds his salvation through one of the best scenes of the entire movie, a thrilling gunfight that sees Bickle shoot his way to Iris (Jodie Foster) a young runaway prostitute, who is pimped out by Sport (Harvey Keitel).  The bloody mess that ensues gives Bickle the cleansing he desired while freeing Iris from the streets that have made him snap.  Taxi Driver is still effective today and DeNero's performance as Bickle still deserves to be considered one of the greatest of all time.",

The colors, the lighting, the music, it's all just...cool. For those of us too young to have lived through the 1970s, the film offers a glimpse into the style and atmosphere of the decade. From the girl next door beauty of Betsy (Cybill Sheperd), to the punk rock evolution of Travis Bickle, the 70s live and breathe in this film. \r\n  The dirt and grime of New York City are as big of a character in this film as any actor, and Martin Scorsese does an outstanding job of allowing time in introducing the city through long scenes highlighting the streets lights, the traffic, and the people who roam the Big Apple.\r\n  Above all, this movie succeeds because Travis, with all of his demons, is a person one hopes will make it out all right. He is a lonely man, a man looking for someone to connect with in a world that he views with disgust and anger. He tries to find some redemtion, something to give him hope. The most hearbreaking moments of the film occur this search for hope is dashed. He ruins his chances with lovely Betsy, thus diminishing any chance of immediate redemtion, and allowing the real demons of his mind to rise to the surface. \r\n  Need I even mention the work put in by the young and extremly talented Jodi Foster? No. So I won't, but she didn't win an Oscar for nothing.\r\n  The only reason I am giving Taxi Driver a 90 percent instead of a pure 100 has to do with the final scenes of the film. After the bloody shootout, the voiceover of the thankful parents and the taxi ride with Betsy seem too surreal to work. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for extemely depressing endings, and would prefer the movie to end with the overhead shot of the crime scene. \r\n  Nonetheless, This film deserves every bit of acclaim it has recieved in the past 30 plus years. If you have not watched it, please do. And watch it again and again just to breathe in the cool New York City air.",

            "content": "\"You talkin' to me?\" Travis Bickle. This film is a true American classic film. One of Martin Scorsese best works! The story of the loneliest man, who lives in New York City disturbed by his past. Possibly one of the greatest anti-heroes in cinema.\n\nBefore writing my review on the film I want to warning you spoilers of the film might be said. The film opens with a great shot of a decaying New York, with a taxi appearing from a cloud of steam. This shot alone already sets you up with what kind of movie we're dealing with. This film is about a man named Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro), who works as a late night Taxi Driver. In a way this movie fallows a very traditional western theme. A man with a disturbed past (a Vietnam war veteran) goes to the city where he has to set things \"right\". In the film Travis does not really know how to communicate with anyone. In the film we see this when he takes Betsy (played by Cybill Shepherd) on a date to a porn theater. In the film Travis starts to build a large amount of paranoia which leads to him arming himself to kill Betsy's candidate, Charles Palatine, to later \"saving\" Iris (played Jodie Foster) from her pimp (played by Harvey Keitel). This whole movie is viewed in the eyes of Travis and we see how the media calls him a \"hero\" in the end of the film. Which goes to show how the media and society have this idea of what it takes to be a hero. Almost like its saying if it's worth killing a handful of men to save one life?\n\nAbove I said how this film fallows a very traditional structure of a western film. You see in most western films the hero rides into the town (in this film on a taxi) and is disturbed by his past. In this case Travis was a Vietnam War veteran, which is one of the reason why he loses sleep at night he can't live with his guilt. In traditional western films the hero is seen as trying to solve a problem in the town either if it saving the water for the town, or fighting off a bully or in this case cleaning up the scum off the streets. By this I mean in the film Travis keeps on saying the line \"Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up. \"  Which by the end of the film the main character is seen by the media as a hero. The police is never really seen in the film, which I believe its because the director wants to give you the impression that this is a helpless city and there deserves a man that can stand up for it  (that man being Travis Bickle).\n\nThis film contains one of the greatest lines ever said in film history, which happen to be \"You talkin' to me\" (which Robert De Niro is known for his improve). This line tells you how insane the character really is and how lonely the man is. My favorite shot in the film is at the end right after the blood shed in the hallway. In this shot the camera almost relives what just happened in such a short amount of time. Also I just want to say Jodie Foster was really good, which this film got her an Academy Award nomination.   And the same goes for Robert De Niro he played a killer roll in the film. \n\n\n\nThis is a very dark film and I would not really recommend it if you are in sad mode since this isn't a really up lifting film.  With that said the film is amazing I loved every aspect about it.  It shows how a man appears to be a normal human being in the being of the film. To a man that is quickly descends into a violent and offensive mentality due to society having an effect on him. Taxi driver has tested the test of time as being an American classic, and is a must watch to any movie lover.",
