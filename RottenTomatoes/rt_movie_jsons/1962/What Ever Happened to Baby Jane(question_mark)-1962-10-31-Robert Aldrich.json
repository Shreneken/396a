    "summary": "Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) is an aging child star left to care for her wheelchair-bound sister Blanche (Joan Crawford), also a former child actress. Stuck living together in a mansion in old Hollywood, Blanche plots to get even with Jane for the car crash that left her crippled years earlier. But Jane is desperate to keep Blanche imprisoned as she plans a new rise to fame, and tries to hide Blanche's existence from doctors, visitors and neighbors while she devises a way to get rid of her sister.",

Who wants to watch 2 hours of Bette torturing poor handicapped Joan; just to watch the even uglier revelation of the ending.  That revelation being that Joan started the whole thing in the first place by trying to kill Bette; and then handicapped herself by crashing her car.  Talk about ableism!  What a cruel film.  People talk about this being an ersatz sequel to Psycho in the whole Psychobiddy/Hagsploitation mini-cycle of the 60s.  And others refer to it as the prequel to Mommie Dearest.  And then there's all that backstage drama about the real-life rivalry between these two grand-dames; and how much of the onscreen fighting was real, etc.  And that all might make Baby Jane an interesting curio to some, but that's not enough to recommend it.  It's heavy handed humor and repetitively vicious plotline is unenjoyable.  Thumbs way down ladies!",

            "content": "If a notorious narrative reputation been perceived and reached in attachment to the title, then that's the mindset you should equip yourself as reminder on how disturbing this film has gone through, and you'll find out how it was brilliantly handled. An inhumane suspenseful thriller being defensively psychological in both meanings with frightening lengths between the oppressor's madness and the crippled weakness, progressing into a humane horror that creeps full blown like prolonging or slowly lingering the final \"Sunset Boulevard\" moment backed up by shared aesthetical preference. Even though unaware by the real-life rivalry between the two main stars [similarly] paired as sisters, both Davis and Crawford professionally grip their roles and stunningly embrace each psyche seemingly out of their comfort zones and mustered extra strength in performative handling. Davis especially establishes a genetic connection to \"Gone Girl\" with a demonic threat above Rosamund Pike's diabolicality, meaning any narrative consisting of a female serial killer would be placed third behind the two unwarranted disgrace. It's going to be a challenge to sit through the torturing madness as it adds a little extremity onto what Hitchcock had put together in his scenarios, but given the atmosphere, the ticking tactics and the commitments, it's fairly brilliant thanks to being elevated by enough inspired praiseworthy merits.

Watching it again, the film maintains its chilling and shocking values, but there is also under the surface a sadness, compassion and campiness(in a good way) that I didn't notice as much previously.\n\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane is essentially a must see movie. The production values are superb, with beautiful yet atmospheric cinematography, well-tailored costumes, well-constructed/chosen sets/scenery and above all the grotesque yet brilliant make-up. The music never detracts from the atmosphere which is resolutely chilling albeit with moments of pathos as seen Davis' and Crawford's envy, the script shocks, amuses and delights and the story is well-paced and never less than interesting. Aldrich directs superbly, and while Victor Bueno is wonderful, it is the performances and hair-raising chemistry between the two leads that takes centre stage. Joan Crawford is superb, but Bette Davis has the meatier role as a very over-the-edge character and gives a portrayal that is both terrifying and heartbreaking.\n\nOverall, a must see film especially for the leads. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It was sad, but also realistic in regard to child actors. The movie itself was often slowly paced, the extras in the movie were pretty bad (gee whiz robotic 50s kinds), script was meh, and I felt like it could've gone darker/more in depth with the characters with flashbacks or what not. Some of the shots of Davis were great, but overall cinematography was just ok. The twist ending was very ironic. Worth a watch if u r into classic films, Old Hollywood, or dark but campy films.",

It keeps a steady pace for most of its runtime, before ramping things up significantly in the 3rd act. Some of the actions and even language seem very risqué for the time period, but I think that's one of the reasons that it was so successful. It feels like it wants to go all the way, not just giving us a few hints of what might transpire. Both Crawford and Davis throw themselves into their roles, though the latter is giving significantly more to do. It's not hard to believe that these 2 are sisters with a genuine animosity for one another, especially considering what the actresses thought of each other in real life. The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but it's clear to anyone watching what will happen to them. There's a few memorable side characters, including the house maid Elvira and piano player Edwin, but the reason the film has stayed in the public consciousness for as long as it has it entirely down to the 2 main characters, and how they go about tearing the other one down in their own way. A classic psychological thriller that will stay with you for a long time.",

            "content": "Often you have to think of films in the context of their time, overlooking the features that have since been updated or refined. But What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? still feels like a genuinely creepy thriller, with a painfully simple premise (helpless characters that cannot provide for themselves being taken advantage of) driven home by a devilish, malicious performance from a high-powered lead; everything you liked about Misery is present in this Aldrich classic, with the exception that the film is set down the road rather than in the remote wilderness, and with a dash of Sunset Blvd on top of it.\n\nWhat I can't understand is the belief that equal weight should be given to Crawford's performance compared to that of Bette Davis. Seeing Crawford spin a wheelchair frantically in a locked room does not seem nearly as daring or demanding as the neurotic, paranoid, and terrifying Jane Hudson, whose supreme selfishness and hate has calcified in the belief that her sister, rather than her own terrible nature, led to the demise of her career. She alternates between personalities in an attempt to retain some of the dignity from her past, offhandedly dismissing those who don't recognize her supposed beauty, meanwhile prancing around in a coat of makeup as thick as whitewash on a farmhouse in defiance of her inevitable aging. Jane is the star around which the film orbits, and to me it seems more reasonable to classify Crawford's turn as Blanche more in the context of a supporting role.\n\nWhile it has nothing to do with Crawford herself, if there is a major problem with the film, it is the treatment of Blanche as a character. Despite being almost interred with her sister for decades by the time the meat of the film gets rolling, she still harbors some benefit of the doubt in her treatment of Jane, as if she genuinely believes there is some redeemable attribute to her character. Between this and Jane's immediately terrible behavior upon her introduction in her older state, there isn't much room for character development; when you already are witnessing an antagonist serve her victim her own pet parakeet as a meal, there isn't much more you need to do to convince the audience of her nature. Plus, there's plenty that could easily be edited out of this film, particularly toward the end - it's a half hour longer than necessary, and features an unnecessary bit of redemption at the end for a character that doesn't really need it.

The movie is gripping from start to finish, as long as one can overlook some of the glaring leaps in logic that exist throughout.  For example, if Blanche is able to open the window to throw a call for help letter to the driveway below, why not just scream for help?  In another scene, when she gets access to the phone, she calls her doctor instead of calling the police.

            "content": "Few films attain the status of being a true camp classic and this is an essential film within the genre as two of the greatest divas of all time are united on screen with their real life rivalry bleeding over into the film. I have always been a fan of Joan Crawford as while her acting style could never be described as subtle she has a star quality that few performers possess and is an absolute revelation in Mildred Pierce (1945). I have never had the same affection for Davis but I can respect the fact that she is a great actress and it is terrifically entertaining to watch her camp it up in a deliciously villainous role. 57 years later this film still shocks, thrills and entertains as even those unfamiliar with the real life animosity between the lead actresses are wrapped up in the passions and tensions of the story.\n\nChild star ‘Baby Jane' Hansen, Bette Davis, supports her family by playing a sweet innocent singer on stage while behind the scenes she is a spoilt, difficult child. Her sister Blanche, Joan Crawford, resents the attention she receives and years later as Hansen's career is on the decline and Blanche becomes a movie star the rivalry between the two intensifies. After a mysterious accident Blanche is left paraplegic with only Hansen to care for her, complicating matters is Hansen's alcoholism and declining mental state. After it is revealed that Blanche plans to sell their house Hansen begins starving Blanche as she has delusions of being a beloved child star again with the help of greedy pianist Edwin Flagg, Victor Buono. Blanche makes desperate attempts to escape but by the time the police have been alerted of the situation Hansen has whisked Blanche off to the beach where shocking revelations are made.\n\nWhat elevates the film above it's imitators in the so-called ‘hagsploitation' genre are the wholly committed performances of the leads who are aware of the fact that they are in a trashy film that intends to profit off of their real life personas and completely camp it up. Personally I prefer Crawford's more layered performance as the sympathetic victim who proves to be less innocent than she initially appears. She uses her eyes to great effect here as her expressions of intense fear as she tries her hardest to contact authorities before her sister arrives home convey a true terror. Davis is excellent in the more showy role as she poses in the mirror and flashes her teeth like the predatory figure we believe her to be. These same features make her haunting and rather sad when she pantomimes as the child performer she once was. Neither of the performances would work without the other as the two complement one another wonderfully and each get a chance to display their unique skill sets. This is what makes it so odd that Davis was the only to receive a Best Actress nomination as the two are equally brilliant and both should have been nominated despite how strong the 1962 Best Actress lineup was.\n\nThe real horror of the film is that so many sibling relationships teeter on the edge of this sort of mania as while the sisters hate one another they understand each other in a way that few others will. Davis' final lament, \"You mean we could have been friends all this time?\", is sad as many siblings will be able to relate to the feeling of regret over their mistreatment of their siblings. At heart the film is a story of two women who have been placed in opposition since childhood but who, at heart, want the same thing, to have successful careers in the entertainment industry. We end up feeling sorry for Baby Jane after hating her for so long as while she tortured her sister she has faced her own traumas and her actions were not necessarily driven by a desire to hurt her sister. Her sister represents everything that she can not attain and the alcohol and food restriction are a way to ignore her own insecurities.\n\nLovers of classic cinema and those who enjoy psychological thrillers will be instantly drawn to this film but it has a universal appeal in that deals more with human relationships than violence or gore.",

I love Bette Davis' ability to allow herself to \"not have to be pretty\" and the roles where she was ugly inside and sometimes out.  \nThis movie is certainly one to keep you tense and alert, if not on the edge of your seat. Watching things unfold is the worst of it,, there is nothing too quick, and that's the problem.  It just keeps getting a bit worse and worse the further we go.  It's every bit as painful as a shock thriller, but artfully drawn out, and we are made to feel the pain and anxiety as we go along.  Joan Crawford, is excellent, for a role that keeps her in bed for the duration, and her acting compensates for any lack of movement, as her face is all the expression we need.  It's excruciating and manic at the same time.  Highly recommend. ",

            "content": "Seriously creepy.  Bette Davis is extraordinary, and really put herself out there for this film, garish make-up and all.  She plays an aging, former childhood star who lives with her sister, played by Joan Crawford, who eclipsed her as they got older to become a star herself back in the 1930's.  Three decades later, Davis is still living in the past, craving attention, and dominating Crawford, who is in a wheelchair.  Early on, the film includes pictures and brief movie clips from Davis and Crawford when they were younger ('Ex-Lady', and 'Sadie McKee') which is nice.  I don't want to give away any of the plot, but will just say there are lots of tingly moments, and director Robert Aldrich did a great job gradually building these to a crescendo.  \n\nThe film is special because of Davis's performance, and because of its extra dimensions.  There is of course the horror of being helpless while in an unbalanced person's care, and Crawford turns in a strong performance as well.  There is also the horror of becoming irrelevant, of being deluded in holding on to a dream that has long since passed, which has a pathos to it.  The 'stories within the story' - Davis and Crawford's real-life antipathy for one another, and their own fading glory - make the movie even more fascinating.  Victor Buono is excellent as the pianist who responds to Davis's classified ad, which is her pathetic attempt to revive her act.  He's a tragic figure himself, struggling to find work and living with his nagging mother (Marjorie Bennett).  There are a few moments which strain credibility, and whether you call them plot holes or not, you may find yourself yelling instructions or warnings out to the screen (perhaps true of many a horror movie).  It's on the long side but it flies by, and never feels long.  Great movie.",

Instead of forcing the camera to do a lot of fancy tricks, he outright relies on suspense inherently existing within the situation the screenplay creates.  One of the best examples is when Blanche throws the note out the window pleading for help.  It's all filmed very conventionally, maddening the viewer.  First her voice can't be heard, so she writes a note, but instead of making a paper airplane, crumbles it like trash and tries tossing it.  It only reaches the edge of her own driveway, and by this point Jane has arrived home.  She thought she saw something out of the corner of her eye when she pulled in.  The note is intended for the neighbor Mrs. Bates, who remains unaware of the note.  There's no chance of her picking it up, and the only reason Jane takes the time to acknowledge her at the edge of the driveway is so she can get that note.  It's a movie, naturally we are hoping for a miracle, but it plays as it would in real life, and Jane gets the note.  Blanche is fucked.  Even more infuriating is the final scene at the beach.  Jane is a criminal on the run and she doesn't even know it, both her and her victim are sitting out in broad daylight, and she's so lost in her la la land that she's oblivious to her crimes or that the law might be after her.  And for a good while, it feels like she's going to prance around the slow stupid policeman, who are busy either eating at a snack bar or writing up information about an abandoned car, and get away with it.",

There's some serious complexity to pulling off a role where we simultaneously hate her and yet see that she isn't without any moral compass at all. Meanwhile Joan Crawford is equal parts sympathetic and scared. She also has a moment or two in the film that show depth in her character beyond those obvious traits, and that is when you can see the quality of her performance up to that point. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane utilizes a lot of techniques you typically find in horror films from that era, and it builds tension throughout. I thought there were some moments where the film got a bit far-fetched, and the level of melodrama almost strayed into the realm of comedy for me. These flaws didn't break the film, but it kept me from loving it. In many ways What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is structured similar to Misery, and I expected it would be even more intense because the lead characters were siblings.

            "content": "Sharing a distinction with Sunset Boulevard in showing the aftermath of Hollywood stardom, What Ever Happened To Baby Jane goes a step further in that we follow the fallen careers of former vaudeville child star Baby Jane (Bette Davis) and her invalid sister, the former star Blanche (Joan Crawford). How does your life go on when you had access to everything, but end up with nothing but memories and fallen glory. It is truly enough to drive a person mad.\n\n \n\nThe film opens with Jane being the child star on the vaudeville circuit, with all the spotlight shining on her young face and every whim of the young girl being fulfilled. At such an early age this child is being merchandised by dolls, perpetuating the idea that she is the center of the universe. Hiding in the shadows is Blanche, all but forgotten by their father who focuses on Jane's career. There is a deep resentment in her face as she watches Jane's behavior. We jump to later where Blanche is the star in Hollywood, but insists that Jane also have a film contract even though her childhood talent did not translate into adulthood. Things turn for the worse when Blanche is paralyzed in an incident that Jane is blamed for, effectively ending both of their careers. After the accident Jane has been caring for Blanche in their spacious Hollywood home. Resentment is the main ingredient in Jane's fall into madness and it finally comes to an apex when she learns that Blanche plans to sell the home for something more manageable. Resentment turns to torture, turns to terror as the film plays out.\n\n \n\nCasting Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as the sisters was a work of genius. While watching the film I realized that the reason that both actresses took their respective roles was due to the intense competition between the two that had occurred for decades. Joan Crawford could make Bette Davis look terrible and Bette Davis could kick Joan Crawford around for two hours. A wonderful time was had by all. That genuine resentment between the two flows throughout the film, delivering an even deeper experience that pulls the viewer into this world that they created. Blanche is still loved and her films still run on television. Jane's vaudeville career is forgotten. Either actress could have played either role, but they were set in the roles that were best for themselves.\n\n \n\nDirector Robert Aldrich shoots a film that, unlike Sunset Boulevard, doesn't cast a bleak, dark world, but a world that has continued beyond the careers of the two leads. The sun still shines, people still have a good time. Aldrich follows Jane's spiral into madness, hinting around the psychological and physical torture that Blanche receives. This feeling that the world has moved on fully develops in the ending where the world around them is being entertained while the sisters are literally in the middle, gone and forgotten. An ending that seems weird, but symbolizes the entire theme of the film. No matter how famous you are, eventually the world will move on no matter what. It's a sad truth that every celebrity needs to face and some may take it better than others.\n\n \n\nFilms about Hollywood are always a touchy subject. The possibility of falling into the pit of over glamorizing is always an issue that can occur and dilute the message that a filmmaker is trying to achieve. With Baby Jane show business really dies in the film when Blanche is paralyzed, something that Blanche accepts, but Jane cannot do. Eventually she descends into replaying her childhood career, a middle aged woman singing songs that a young girl sang all those years ago, becoming a pathetic parody of herself. This film is a more subtle examination of the fallen star than Sunset Boulevard and stands on its own. They may be related, but they're distant cousins. Both with madness, both with terror, but this film is more optimistic. This film is one of the greats and serves as the swan song for the careers of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane is a necessity in cinephile viewing.",

Jane was once a child star and Blanche was, in adult life, a star of the silver screen.  Blanche's career ended when she was left paralysed from the waist down in an accident involving Jane.  Now Jane looks after Blanche in the house, though not very well.  Filled with bitterness at her own cinematic career never taking off, envious of Blanche's career and money, an alcoholic and a touch deranged, Jane goes out of her way to torment her sister...\n\nA very well made thriller.  Starts off slowly and is more a relationship drama for a while.  Over time, however, director Robert Aldrich ramps up the intrigue, tension and malice.  It is soon apparent that this isn't going to be resolved simply by dialogue...\n\nQuite Hitchcockian at times in the tension and intrigue...and menacing undercurrent.\n\nGreat twist towards the end and a powerful conclusion.\n\nBette Davis is superb as Jane, providing just the right level of menace and insanity.  The result is one of the scarier characters in cinematic history.  Davis got her 11th, and last, Oscar nomination for her performance.  Quite astounding that she didn't win.\n\nJoan Crawford is solid as Blanche, and is the perfect foil for Davis/Jane.  Victor Buono puts in a good performance as Edwin and provides the movie's best comedic moments.  He got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.",

Robert Aldrich managed a truly historic feat of even getting these two iconic and open Hollywood enemies into one room much less convince them to do this movie. The making of this film is the stuff of legend. And it is important to note that at the time of its release this film was genuinely shocking to audiences who had never seen these highly respected movie stars presented in such a disturbing way. With time, this movie has become brilliantly campy entertainment. But the truly brave and brutal performance by Bette Davis is undeniably potent. Looking back, Bette Davis gave the most powerful performance of 1960. Joan Crawford's work is oddly out of place. Choosing to play it in her standard glam movie star way is without any level of realism. The mixing of not only these two incredibly charismatic actors and their widely different approaches to their craft actually serves to add a level of surrealism which is oddly effective. While most definitely a cult and campy ride of a movie, it power should never be underestimated. ...even if it was largely accidental.",

That's the premise to this film, Bette Davis's character was a child-superstar, with a huge fan-base her stage name was Baby Jane. It amazed me how quickly the film goes through the trivial back-story so quickly, so the film can let the main plot play out with a thriller type plot with horrific outcome. Neatly adapted screenplay from a novel I am sure is just as surprising and sinister as we watch two sister go through a story that shows close relation to Stephen King's Misery, as a envious and jealous sister who's child-star years have drifted like wreckage in the sea, takes out a built-up anger for her crippled sister, who's fame has had a more popular after-life; we watch shockingly as she pushes and torments her sister to death! Will she kill her? Will someone find out whats Baby Jane is doing. Only time will tell in this, psychotic-horror.\n\nWith a fine cast, this film needs no help, Opening quickly and to-point; although the ending could had a couple seconds longer, the movie heads into a dysfunctional and deadly relationship of two sister, ultimately leaving behind a frightening film about the essence of jealousy.",
