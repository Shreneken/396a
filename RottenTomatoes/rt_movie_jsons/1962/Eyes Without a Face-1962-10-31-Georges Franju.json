            "content": "On of the most artistic Horror films I've seen to date, Eyes Without a Face examines a doctor's guilt and obsession with fixing his daughter's mutilated face. It was the father who caused the disfigured face of the young daughter and he is so obsessed that he seeks to fix her face himself. In order to do this he has his mistress, whose face he repaired, scope out and lure young beautiful women back to the doctor's secluded home. At this home the doctor has a secret lab behind trap doors and hidden in the basement. It's here that the young women are sedated and their faces cut off in order to give his daughter the face she had lost. The film is amazing to behold and presents a disturbed man and his terrifying quest that consumes him. The dark and wonderfully filmed settings and imagery are what really elevates the film above and beyond most other in the genre. Highly recommended to horror fans and anyone that enjoys a tale of the macabre.",

When his daughter's face is horribly disfigured in a car accident, a doctor begins kidnapping young women in order to murder them and surgically graft their faces onto his daughter's.  It's incredibly macabre throughout, an atmospheric thriller that relies on manipulating the viewer's imagination instead of showing the audience all of the gruesome details \u2013 with the exception, of course, of the actual face removal surgery.  Other than the music score, which sounds like something you'd hear at a circus, it's hard to find fault with this influential and unique film.",

            "content": "There's a good argument that the 1960 French film Eyes Without a Face is more of a thriller with horror elements than an all-out horror movie. However you classify it, Eyes Without a Face is a peculiar film with haunting imagery. Since its addition to the Criterion Collection and late-night airings on TCM, it has become almost like required viewing for fans of classic horror and international horror films. Eyes Without a Face could qualify as \"arthouse horror,\" or \"elevated horror,\" but watching it isn't like doing homework. Eyes Without a Face is its own brand of horror.\n\nAfter a car accident disfigures Christiane (Edith Scob), her father, Dr. Genessier (Pierre Brasseur), a renowned plastic surgeon, fakes her death and keeps her locked away at their country estate. He makes her wear an expressionless white mask and conducts experimental surgeries to restore her face. Dr. Genessier is acting entirely on his own wishes, not his daughter's; he mentions briefly that he is responsible for the accident that maimed her. Dr. Genessier's loyal and murderous assistant, Louise (Alida Valli), preys on young women to lure to the chateau for the doctor to use in his experiments. Christiane wants none of this, but she is a prisoner in her own home.\n\nThere are elements of body horror in Eyes Without a Face though it is not as graphic or explicit as the modern era films of David Cronenberg or Guillermo Del Toro. However, there is a prolonged scene of surgery where a girl's face is removed that is graphic and gross. It is not played for sensation but coldly and clinically without any background music and very few cuts. The horror of the scene comes from its context. There is nothing sadistic to the surgery, Dr. Genessier is just doing his work. The final moments of the film are filled with eerie and creepy imagery beautifully shot in stark black and white.\n\nThis is a good film to watch with someone that doesn't like horror movies but wants to watch something spooky. It is totally unlike anything resembling a conventional horror movie. There are no pop-up scares. The villains are not especially devilish or sadistic. The climax where Christiane finally takes agency of her own fate is played low-key. There is a detached feeling between the film and its macabre subject matter. It also has the structure of a mystery/thriller though we the audience know every angle of the story. Christiane's fianc\u00e9 believes she is still alive and detectives are on the case of the missing girls, but these elements are in the far background.\n\nEyes Without a Face straddles the thriller and horror genres and also the classic and modern film eras. The unsensational, almost documentary-like approach to the story and characters lean towards the trends and style of the French New Wave being pioneered at the time by Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. The score, however, is firmly rooted in the older era of filmmaking and feels too jaunty at times for what is happening on screen. The Criterion Collection, dedicated to highlighting notable classic and modern films, has few horror films in its library. I'm glad this is one of them.",

The events of the film don't so much thrill, as make the stomach turn uncomfortably. Still, it's an arthouse film, with all the preconceptions that such an identity entails to contend with. To me, the use of unpolished, simple cuts between scenes (and the lack of color) evokes earlier silent horror films, at least in small doses. (3.5/5)",

Though the movie is well acted, and there are a few frightening scenes that are well made, I found I was bored more than I was frightened.  Mind you there are two rather scary scenes.  The first one being the scene where we see the doctor perform the transplant surgery.  Another is seeing the doctor dispose of the bodies fo the women he has kidnapped for his experiments.  However Those are the only times I was spooked watching this film.  Edith Scob does very well as Christiane, the daughter who's face was badly disfigured in a car crash caused by her father's negligence, but hers was the only performance that did not seem formulaic.  Also the movie leaves many unanswered questions at the end.  \"Eyes Without a Face\" is considered a horror classic.  After seeing the film, I frankly can't understand why.",

Not necessarily a horror film in itself, more a tale of grief and anguish, despair and the abandonment of hope. It has some great moments, especially the reveal of the heroines disfigured face, but the film suffers badly from its near-static pacing and crushing lifelessness. The editing is very poor, with constant black outs at inappropriate times, and some scenes are allowed to go on for an unnecessary amount of time. For example, we see the main character arrive at his home, drive into his garage, get out of his car, walk up the steps to his house, and all the way through his house until he reaches his daughter's bedroom. Did we really need to see all of that happening in real time? It gets better later as we see less extraneous events, but it results in the film being significantly longer than it needs to be. There's not much of an atmosphere, not much tension, and too often feels like a product of its time. Even the controversy it attracted back on original release doesn't feel warranted, as we really don't get to see much of a controversial nature. I think people maybe have badly overreacted. It's not a film I'd re-watch, or even suggest to a friend. It needs better pacing, better editing and an actual sense of urgency.",

Kind of makes you wonder.\n\nThe almost Scooby-Doo sounding soundtrack lightens up the mood throughout the movie which is great because it can be atmospheric and creepy at times. Seeing the mask and outfit is pretty creepy. But at the same time it's almost like she's not wearing a mask at times.\n\nI can kind of see how the original Bioshock and Infinite could have been inspired by this movie. Specifically the relationship between the doctor and his daughter. As well as the obsessive doctor who seeks perfection in all his facial surgeries that he does.\n\nThat surgery scene will forever be ingrained in my memory. It was so uncomfortable and uneasy to watch. Even though you knew and looked like a mask, when they we're peeling it off, it still looked pretty damn good. Great make up effects.\n\nThis movie is great because instead of the \"monster\" being the evil or bad one, it's actually the ones who are taking care of the monster. In this case, Christiane's father and her mother figure. While Christiane, the \"monster\" is the one who in the end wants to put things right.\n\nQuite a beautiful ending, other than the doctor's face. Kind of funny too given that the dove took a crap on her arm. But beautiful nonetheless because it's stating that Christiane has come to terms with her deformity and will now lead a life of peace among animals and nature. I wish the best for her.\n\nOverall, wonderful horror film with an interesting story line and great performances.\n\n\n\nWhat an interestingly macabre but jaunty piece of music they decided to open with during the credits. Complimenting the music but in a more darker, ominous way are the continuous shots of the trees in the dark that are lit by only the headlights of the car. It's interesting how the dark ominous imagery juxtaposes the sort of playful but macabre music. The music reminds me of Scooby-Doo lol. \n\nWhat an odd man the professor. It's almost as if he's holding onto a very dark secret or something. And I bet you anything that the girl he identified at the morgue, wasn't his daughter. This man's obsession with finding a new face for his daughter has borderline sociopathic/psychopathic tendencies written all over it. An obsessed scientist trying to prove his own theory on facial reconstruction surgery. Part caring father, part obsessive sociopath. Very creepy and unsettling when she puts the mask on Christiane and starts brushing her hair, with the almost lullaby music playing in the background. Christiane's a typical case of the monster that's kept locked up in the room/dungeon/attic \"for her own good\". It's ironic cuz I can tell Christiane is beautiful - or was beautiful before the car accident, her eyes at least seem very pretty. And it seems like her father is to blame for all of this due to the way he drove the car that fateful night. So he's most likely feeling some sort of guilt.\n\nI think they actually used a mold to create the mask since it perfectly contours and fits the shape of her face. It's so weird how much the secretary and the girl they're trying to subdue look alike. It's almost like the secretary could be her mother. I can't believe the actresses are not related in real life. God that's terrifying, the stuff of real life nightmares. To meet a charismatic stranger you think is trying to help you out but really they're just luring you into a trap. Those poor dogs - caged up just like Christiane. Only their cages are smaller, much uncomfortably smaller. It's no wonder she has a natural bond with them - they're both in similar situations. \n\nWhat really sells that operation scene isn't the blood or the prosthetics (which is noticeably fake lol) - it's the silence. There's no music. Just the professor's heavy breathing and the clanking of the surgery instruments. It's brilliant. They could have easily used some sort of eerie music to build the tension, but I think going with the silence made the scene much more effective and tense. Damn, that really sucks. I thought the operation was a success but it turned out the graft rejected the tissue. I feel bad for Christiane. There was a glimmer of hope for her, and now she's back at square one. I was really looking forward to her starting a new life. Call it karmic justice the way the dog's ravaged the professors face once they were freed by Christiane. I love how she walks away into the forrest with the animals - now accepting of her situation. \n\nReally tight and effective storytelling, quite captivating actually - poetic. Even though it kind of dragged for a couple of minutes towards the 1 hour and 15 minute mark, I never really felt bored watching it. Every scene has its purpose that contributes to the overall story and its subject matter is pretty dark and shocking - especially considering the time it came out in 1960. I bet there hadn't been another movie quite like this one at the time of its release. It's basically like a grounded in reality retelling of Frankenstein. The composition of the shots are very well thought out. I really liked the shot of the cemetery as the professor and his secretary are leaving - with those dead ominous-looking trees and the car in frame between the gate. Really terrific use of creepy imagery and fantastic use of lighting. This movie could serve as pretty good commentary on animal testing, like from makeup companies or skin product companies. As well as good commentary on car crash facial reconstruction surgery victims. I do feel like the music choice could have been better. I felt that it didn't really compliment the overall creepy tone of the movie. It was too playful and jaunty sounding, like something you'd hear in a circus arena. And on top of that they kept playing the same tune throughout the movie several times. Other than that, I thought the movie was a terrifically creepy journey through one girl's tragic circumstance and an obsessive scientist/father's desire to help his daughter but also prove his theory and advance science. A great depiction of a real-life horror situation that can happen to anyone involved in an accident. Although I don't think I'd own it on physical Criterion blu ray, I would like to have a download of it.",

The mad scientist has been done since the beginning of horror films, but here the mad scientist acts relatively normal, and is just psychotic underneath the surface. He goes about his daily routine and he never becomes a ranting lunatic (he kinda walks a fine line, but it never goes overboard). The look of Christiane (the girl without a face) is classic, iconic, and creepy. She's not really the villain of this movie or a monster, but she deserves a place alongside Dracula, Frankenstein, the Bride, and the Invisible Man as an iconic horror character. The movie has a lot of subtext to it. There's a theme of vanity and that to be normal is to look beautiful and perfect, but Christiane is the most normal of her small family despite being the one disfigured. The surgery scene is another great scene, and considering the year this was made it's impressive and bloody. One of the great surgery scenes in film. There are plenty of great shots and the pacing is pretty good, though it drags a bit in the third act when they're like, \"Well, I guess we need another girl's face to cut off!\" The music is a not very fitting and actually sounds like the theme to Curb Your Enthusiasm. It's unintentionally funny. Before re-watching this, I would have been quick to put Eyes Without a Face up there with the classics. Now, I'm a bit unsure. It's still very good for its time and one of the absolute best of the decade, but it doesn't quite reach the level of Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, or Night of the Living Dead. Looking at this movie now, it's more on the level of Village of the Damned and Carnival of Souls. Very, very good 60s horror movies that are under appreciated. Still, Eyes Without a Face is another movie that shows a horror revolution that started in the early 60s, not the 70s.",

            "content": "Eyes without a Face (or \"Les yeux sans visage\") is a 1959 French/Italian horror film about a renowned surgeon who kidnaps young women and tries to graph their faces on to that of his daughters, who's own face was left horrible disfigured after a car wreck that her father was responsible for. Touching, isn't it? Considered extremely controversial for 1959, this horror film didn't just get negative reviews by critics, it was outright hated by them in both France and America. All the controversy was over one surgery scene in which a girl gets her face sliced off. It was pretty graphic and I can see why it would cause a flare amongst critics and moviegoers of the late 50's. But this was marketed as a horror film and they're suppose to shock and thrill you. One theater reported that seven people fainted during the scene, so I guess you could say it was the Hostel of it's time. The scene looks pretty realistic and even made me cringe up a bit. But this one scene is about as violent as it gets, the rest of the film is pretty mild aside from the ending. The film does drag on from time to time but it makes up for it with well character development, especially Dr. G\u00c3\u00a9nessier and Christiane, the two main characters in the film. Dr. G\u00c3\u00a9nessier (Pierre Brassuer) isn't the typical run of the mill mad scientist we're so use to seeing in horror films. Here we see someone who is calm and quit-witted, but also grief-stricken at the fact that this is all his fault and he doesn't take pleasure kid-napping women and preforming surgery on them, but feels he must to atone for his carelessness. Christiane (Edith Scob), daughter to the good doctor, wears a white mask through about 90% of the film. The mask is a perfect mold of the actresses own face which makes it look very natural and this mask would later serve as an inspiration for the mask used in Halloween, as stated by John Carpenter. Christiane's movement throughout the film is very fluent and dream-like, Edith Scob does a great job of showing emotion through body language as a substitution for lack of facial expression. Her character doesn't actually play the villain, she's more of the protagonist if anything. She spends most of her time alone in her room nursing her many pet doves and trying to come to terms with her disfigurement. The musical score did need to improving, in my opinion it sounds a little like circus music. It's isn't very menacing, but isn't too out of place either. The dialogue is pretty good, but it does get over dramatic at times. However, it is in the french language (which I dont speak) with English subtitles, so I feel my criticism wouldn't do justice on this. The film sends a pretty powerful message that beauty comes from within and to accept your fate, and accept yourself for who you are. Seeking outer beauty can sometimes come at a high cost, so high that it eventually turns you into something ugly. Overall this is a great film in regards to acting, special effects, set design and atmosphere. It does lack a lot of the scares of your typical horror film, but this was done intentionally to be able to pass the censors for screening to make up for the surgery scene. That's what I love about a lot of foreign films, especially from France, Italy or Japan. They aren't afraid to take a risk at something no one wants to try. And if you take a look at the new wave of French horror now, you will see a glaring difference between it and American horror. Far more originality and far more shocking. They don't sellout by making a billion different zombie and demon possession movies that try to out do The Exorcist and Night of the Living Dead like we do over here. Instead they just move on to new ideas. We could stand to learn a lot from the French. Sorry to say, but they got us beat when it comes to horror and always have. Eyes without a Face is definitely a film to watch if you like classic B&W horror as well as being a great starting point if you're interested in dipping into French horror. Though it isn't a horror film that everyone will enjoy, it is a good film regardless of genre. French horror probably wouldn't be so shocking if they didn't have this film as a blueprint.",

The Criterion Collection is a great companion piece if you are interested in learning more about film theory, or just learning more than from your average wiki article. It was a stark reminder of just how controversial a film like Eyes Without a Face was way back when. Georges Franju's vision, while perhaps being a bit of a let down in its first thirty minutes, escalates quickly. The dark imagery and some of the horrid shots was a game changer in the genre. Hell, a horror film that relies on its visuals and tone rather than the jump scare aspect seems like a horror film of note. And this one deserves all its attention.",

I may have to re-watch it when I'm less tired. But the sad truth is that on my first viewing Eyes Without a face wasn't good enough to keep me from falling asleep. Eyes Without a Face tells the tale of a doctor and his horribly disfigured daughter. He and his assistant kidnap young women and surgically remove their faces in order to transplant them onto daughter. It's a very creepy premise and there were many elements of this that I did like. It looks brilliant! Eyes Without a Face is shot and lighted in ways that were ahead of its time, creating a wonderful mood and sense of atmosphere. In fact the most interesting and most terrifying scenes are all visual. The mask worn by the disfigured daughter is one of the creepiest things I've ever seen in a film. It looks so life-like and yet completely inhuman at the same time. And then there's the surgery scene, where the doctor cuts off the victims face and its shown in as much detail as possible. But the unfortunately thing is, underneath all the fantastic imagery there's not enough content to sustain an entire film. First off, I never really felt like I actually knew any of these characters. They all have their role but beyond that I didn't ever see the human beings behind them. The story itself only has a bullet-point narrative, getting us from point a to point b without any reason for us care about what's happening. And finally it's really very padded. There are a lot of sequences that just shows one character moving from one location to the next. They are meant to build up suspense but I just became bored and tired of it, wanting the film to move on to the next scene. These problems really cut into the best parts of the film and keep it from working as a whole. I really hate to call a film with this much going for essentially shallow, but that was my impression of Eyes Without a Face. Maybe my second viewing will give me so much more, but as of now I cannot call Eyes Without a Face the masterpiece it has so often been touted as.",

I've been gripped by films made a decade before this was conceived, so why was I not moved by Franju's vision? I admit there were moments of human sorrow that tugged at my heartstrings, but mere seconds in a sea of drudging scenes? After viewing; minutes passes, hours passed, and time continued to move on while this film left a strange aftertaste in my mind. This is where the most credit I can place shall lay. I found this film un-engaging to watch, and that is exactly the same position our faceless protagonist feels about living her life.

The superficial elements - framing, effects, visual themes - are top notch, real cutting edge stuff for the period. The sympathetic lead, a young woman whose face was ravaged by a violent car accident, wears a fragile, unsettling China doll mask to conceal her disfigurements. It's an especially powerful effect when combined with the rich black-and-white film stock, which makes it difficult to determine where the mask ends and her flesh begins. Late in the picture, as the girl's mad surgeon of a father graphically peels the skin away from an unwilling donor to \"fix\" his daughter's wounds, it's tough not to flinch. The scene, and the concept, is that convincing, that unnerving. The plot suffers from a serious lack of depth, however, retreading the same territory several times before making any progress, and the film plods along for too long as a result. A terribly loud, mismatched score further sours matters, flooding the room with brow-furrowing carnival music at regular intervals. It's a curious relic, one which clearly influenced a whole new generation of filmmakers in the years after its release, but probably works better as an exercise of original theories than a complete picture.",

The father, a brilliant surgeon who attempts to give new beauty to his beloved daughter by kidnapping and surgically stealing the faces of other beautiful young women. An horror movie from 1960, exploring the fine layer between beauty and grotesque. Very interesting the way how this movie manages to turn beautiful into horrendous and vice-versa. Pleasently surprised by it's apparent seriousness, it didn't fall for the mistake of comical skittishness as I'd expect for such a movie, pretty sober stuff. It never really spooked the hell out of my and it was somewhat predictable, but I really appreciated how it handled the goriest and spookier moments, nothing to obvious, the director was smart enough to play with subtlety, suggestion and expectation. And yet, some viewers might be surprised with the level of gore detail present in this 1960 movie!\r\n\r\nAn Horror movie it might be, but odd as it may sound, the greatest impression I came out of it was of its aesthetical appeal and beauty... there's a certain enchantment here stemming from the great cinematic sensibility of Georges Franju, camera work and photography (German Expressionism). This made the movie worth to me, despite the mindless script. I say mindless script because I never felt there was a true purpose or intent behind the majority of the events in the movie, a simple succession determined by basic and clich\u00e9 writing, but beautifully carved to enhance the visual appeal of it. This movie is an interesting stylistic exercise in the Horror genre. I liked it and highly recommend it to lovers of Classic black-and-white Cinema. And of course fans of Horror.",
