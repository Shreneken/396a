This one has been out there for a while on a must-see movie, but I never understood it beyond it being Superman's favorite movie. It took me a while to make time for it and in the end, it was well worth it.\n\nScout and Jem Finch are two kids out enjoying their young lives in rural Depression-era Alabama. Like most innocent kids of their time, they learn the ways of the world while just having fun and being raised by their father, a lawyer with impeccable quality for right and wrong given where he lives as he ends up being put into a trial that teaches his children a great deal regarding the lack of humanity for black people in the South. Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a young white woman. Despite the idea that an accused is innocent until proven guilty, it is obvious that Tom Robinson is innocent, and his only crime is that he is a black man desired by a white woman he had spurned. That alone in the white rural South is despised and disgusted by the ignorant and hateful people of this area. Justice is served if one could call it that as the Finch family live and learn with such honesty and righteousness.\n\nI watched this and loved it with all my heart. With great acting from not just Academy Award-winning Gregory Peck but also the kids who show that talent is not just limited to adults. But it is the story that earns its place as a timeless treasure that should be seen by all ages.",

            "content": "So before we start, a few warnings. First off, I have covid \ud83e\udd12 Which gives me lots of time to watch movies but also makes it a little tough to focus on them, so I definitely found myself drifting al little near the end of this one. Also, the only exposure I've ever had to the novel is through the SparkNotes of the second half of the book which I read in 9th grade after joining the class halfway through. So if you're expecting a well-educated, unbiased, expert review on this movie, you've come to the wrong place. Anyway, here we go.\n\nThe trial scene of this movie is really, really good. Solid performances, excellent dialogue, powerful speeches: it's everything you could ask for. The bookending story about the trio of children is kind of endearing, but honestly it's just so damn slow. It's a clever idea to show this blatant racism through the eyes of children, but to be honest, it doesn't really do that. It just sort of flips point-of-view in the trial scene and then flips back to the children. Also, the narration is kind of awkward and doesn't really do anything except remind us all that this is based on a book.\n\nI strongly admire the message of this film (and the novel it's based on, of course) and it's lucky that the film was made when it was, because it definitely wouldn't work as a modern film. It would be immediately dismissed as overly-simplified Oscar bait featuring white saviorism. However, for the 60s, it gets a LOT of things right and the symbolism used throughout is very powerful.\n\nAlthough it's not without its problems, both thematically and narratively, it tells a powerful story and is expertly directed. To Kill a Mockingbird is absolutely worth watching for the movie itself but also for its cultural impact.\n\nNow send healing vibes so I can hopefully watch movies with a clear head soon \ud83e\udd1e",

To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Every breath and pulse in my life and maybe... Those of you reading this have the same feeling\u2026 of remembering a movie that projects a growing paradox in our lives. It's so riveting to me that the whole narrative is delivered through the glasses of little Scout, the daughter of a lawyer, Atticus Finch. Where we are presented with a phenomenon of segmentation that exists in the city, where Atticus is mired and cannot avoid in his duties appointed as an advocate for Tom, a Black man accused of immoral acts against white women. Black and white and cinematic that is so classic is not the point of weakness of this film, with the sense of the classic I felt how to suffocate and deep every conflict featured in this film.\n\nHonestly... I am not bored, even though it has been repeated many times and read the novel many times..., I think this film projects well from the word strokes that exist on the novel to the screen as a masterpiece. In my opinion. Departing from the conflict of debate and the courtroom, I was very impressed with Atticus, despite his status as a person struggling under the criticism, sentiments, and tightness of the courtroom, he also showed his affection and always kept his calm in educating and raising his two children, Jem and Scout. He managed to bring a good approach in balancing his life as a defender in a case that paradoxically defended him, at the time... It's a pity...hufff(take a breath)... And not infrequently in the movie scene you can see where occasionally Atticus tells the case he handled with his two children, this shows how Atticus always had a harmonious relationship with Jem and Scout. And plus, how accustomed Jem and Scout are with the use of Atticus diction that is like in a will letter, showing a more comprehensive relationship between father and his two children. This is based on what I read in the book itself...maybe this is the point of satisfaction and interest from reading the novel book and watching the film as well, I think I can understand more intensively the storyline in the film... How about yes... There's more satisfaction for me...\nBut despite all that when watching this movie... You can see another story that is presented is about prejudice, where when Jem, Scout, and the friend, Dill, try to treat the sense of knowing about Boo, a child who is discriminated against due to the stigma of community to him, where there will see some scenes where these three children visit boo's house not far from the house of Atticus. From what I saw on the screen\u2026 anyway\u2026 Well from that I was before I found out Boo's true identity, I had assumed whether Boo was also someone who was black, how surprised I was when I found out that Boo was also white... Whose lives are isolated because of the stigma that is formed... This is directly proportional to what was experienced with Tom and other Black citizens are one of the mistakes in thinking.\n\nIn the final seconds of the trial, Atticus struggled to convince the hearts, thoughts, and citizens present in court. His two children were also present from the beginning. On the second floor with a priest... but... Sadly... Finally, Tom is found guilty of his charges in the jury's decision... Shortly thereafter Atticus heard that Tom who had escaped from the jail was killed in vain by being shot dead. Where sad... Atticus said to Tom's wife... That he sees that Tom is running away like a madman whose mind is empty and doesn't know the direction way... Honestly, the story scene in this film thrilled my heart's niche... Until I shed tears...\nRight in the final minute of the film I see where Jem and Scout run from the chase of people who want to harm him when coming home from school, unfortunately, Jem falls in the run and... More disturbing is the figure who helped to carry Jem to go home is Boo who has been discriminated against due to the \"shallow\" way of thinking of society at that time..., finally the film ends with Atticus as a father who shows warmth and affection for his two children. I feel this film is suitable to be enjoyed together with\u2026 family and children... for entertainment and educational purposes\n\nAt first, I read the title of this book quite confusingly indeed... but... And then watching the film, I finally\u2026. understood the meaning contained in the title of the same book and film, which is analogous to a mockingbird who never did anything but sing cheerfully and sincerely to us, and when we killed the bird, it was a sin and there was a mistake in judging it. This is reflected in the actual figure of Tom as a Mockingbird who symbolizes innocence but is vilified and takes Tom's life empty-handed by racism-based injustice due to so narrow and shallow way of thinking in this film. The deduction that I take away from this all-time masterpiece, is to make it a reflective material with the richness of learning contained as well as the learning of everyday life and the issue of racism content that is again sticking out in our ear. And it's always been Harper Lee's line in To Kill a Mockingbird: \"You can never understand anyone until you see everything from his point of view... Until you slip behind his skin and live life his way.\" I made it clear that this film will be the masterpiece of all time... even the classical cinematography vibe for me is make it valuable and compatible\u2026and recommendations for a source of life inspiration and thought for all of us. This movie is ... like a needle in a haystack... but.... that will be my cup of tea forever...",

Peck's Academy Award winning performance anchors the movie, which is finely crafted with a perfectly balanced script by Horton Foote.  A paragon of decency who stands for tolerance and nonviolence at all costs, Atticus also is a loving, nurturing father who treats everyone around him, including his children, with respect.\n\nDespite the ugly truths portrayed here, a gentle goodness pervades, even during the darkest moments.  Foote includes more than lynch mobs and courtroom fireworks; he also offers lower-key intimate moments, such as when young Scout questions her older brother about their deceased mother.  Or, on a lighter note, when Scout fidgets during her first day of school; she can't get comfortable in her new dress.",

The book is essentially a series of stories about a little girl's view of events in a 1930's southern small town, while the movie leaves out subplots like the house fire and concentrates more on the black man on trial for rape. Good performances by all and the movie has tension, even if the movie also has the book's major fault-Atticus Finch is rather like a Gary Stu who can stand up to anything.

            "content": "An old classic with some very fine-tuned, underlying themes. To Kill a Mockingbird is surprisingly progressive in its movie making techniques considering it was released in 1963. The biggest shocker about this movie is its pacing. For a movie that's almost 50 years old, it handles pacing rather well. No moment is dull, uninspired or boring and scenes don't drag on or go by too fast. It's amazing how innovative the filmmakers got with the pacing and how they managed to make it work with the tools they had. Secondly, the way it handles such heavy themes such as racism, empathy and justice is truly remarkable. They showcase in very discreet ways how racism can change the lives of both those who are racist and those affected by it for the worse. The movie showcases very subtly how those who don't treat others with kindness and respect end up being rejected by society and those who do the opposite end up getting adoration and respect from those around them. In short, in subtly showcases both the positive and negative repercussions of being a good or bad person respectively. A few things I didn't like however were some of the long pauses between lines and takes, but then again, that might be a product of its time. One thing that can't be excused by that logic is the acting, some actors do an extremely poor job of acting out their roles and it's incredibly jarring in contrast to some other actors who do a mighty job translating their character from novel to the big screen. On the other end of the spectrum, the writing is absolutely fantastic. Characters behave like actual people and the dialogue they have with each other seems genuine and realistic, it's a shame some just couldn't utilize the writing to its fullest extent with their mediocre acting work. In closing, To Kill a Mockingbird tells a beautiful story that makes you feel melancholic, knowing that there truly was a time where society was like this...",

Child actors Phillip Alford and Mary Badham (also nominated for an Oscar) play a convincingly earnest set of siblings, enthusiastic and inquisitive avatars for the audience. The authenticity of their lock-stepped performances might be partially lain at the feet of director Robert Mulligan, who opted to run with many first takes, lest the youngsters grow weary of the repetition. Brock Peters also shines in limited work as Tom Robinson, a black man on trial for a flimsy rape accusation. Peters really only gets one opportunity to make his mark, but it comes at the emotional crux of the story and he sees that it hits home.\n\nThe film isn't without weaknesses - antagonists often seem a little too narrow and stereotypical, and the flat (if essential) epilogue undercuts the power of the film's real climax - but those are minor nitpicks. On the whole, To Kill a Mockingbird is a smart, well-reasoned picture that still speaks to America today, generations after it was set, published and adapted. Jim Crow may be dead and buried, but so long his influence still resonates, this story will carry extra relevance.",

The film, like the book before it, transcended its medium and pushed forward the boundaries of what was thought to be too progressive and too radical for its era. The kids are all extremely likable, genuine and real. Their chemistry is unmistakably exceptional. Tom Robinson, played by actor \"Brock Peters\", elevates his character by bringing a warmth, a clear since of innocence and deeply rooted human soul that is tragic to behold. Scout is near perfect, played by actress \"Mary Badham\". The bedroom scene in which Atticus hands Scout his gold pocket watch and explains the significance of it and the death of her mother, is one of my favorite contained scenes in any movie ever. The courtroom sequence remains the greatest adapted cinematic depiction involving a case of prejudice and racism in the south. \"Peck\" preaches and invigorates a tour de force powerhouse-symphony of excellence on how to command and convince the screen with his presence. The result of the verdict is devestating and forces you to look through the eyes of the children and see now through their realization that the world is a much  grimmer and dark place. At the end remains a glimmer of hope. The Mockingbird that once resided in the innocence of Brock Peter's character has now passed on to Robert Duvall's Boo Radley. The story is wrapped up after the children are rescued by Boo Radley from a prowler looking to kidnap and bring them harm. Radley takes Jem back home with Scout following. Atticus and Sheriff debate what to do about Radley, ultimately letting him return home and allowing Scout to escort him.",

            "content": "A sin to kill a mockingbird, and a sin not to watch \"To Kill A Mockingbird\". \n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a film based on Harper Lee's novel with the same name. The story follows a middle-aged lawyer called Atticus, and his 2 kids; Jem and Scout. These roles are respectively played by Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Philip Alford. Something that caught my eye was that this film did not feel the need to include unnecessary romance or action, but just talked about life in Alabama. The film was released May 24th 1962 and was produced and directed by Robert Mulligan. The novel on the other hand was published July 11th 1960. I initially didn't expect all too much since I'm someone who does like action in movies, but it pleasantly surprised me. \n\nThe movie is narrated by an older Scout talking about her family's past in Alabama. They were frankly quite a boring family with the only oddity being that their mother is dead. Atticus is a guy with the people's best interests at heart, although he comes across cold occasionally. Scout (6) is a complete tomboy in every sense of the word, and Jem (10) is a completely normal boy with all the interests a boy would have. \n\nThe main premise of this film is a court case Atticus decided to undertake. He's defending a black man, Tom Robinson who's been accused of assaulting and raping a white woman. I mention their skin tones explicitly because back in the 1930's, racism was a far more common occurrence than nowadays. \n\nIt's in said court case that we truly get to see how meticulous Atticus can be. From playing people into revealing the truth to using unconventional ways to get the clues he needs. It's in this fashion that Atticus finds out and proves that Tom couldn't possibly have raped and assaulted Mayella. But this didn't necessarily mean the judge would be impartial. \n\nI found the movie quite boring initially, not to say that I hated it, but it simply didn't appeal to me. It's once I started to learn the characters better and got to see their depth that I started appreciating it. As I mentioned earlier, there's no unnecessary violence and romance, if any at all (at least not on screen). And usually I like myself some romance or action but in the case of \"To kill a Mockingbird\", its simplicity is what makes it so great. \n\nA good example of this would be Scout, always getting teased for having her father defend a black man, instead of getting to see a cool fighting scene that shows how even if you're a girl, you can whoop a guy's ass; we see Atticus reprimanding her and telling her to not ever use violence if not required. \n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a beautiful example of a film that doesn't need to use modern day Hollywood tropes and clich\u00e9s to still be an absolutely stunning movie. From the near perfect acting to genius ways of unfolding a plot, it never ceased to surprise me as I was watching. The only flaw I'd be able to mention would perhaps be the lack of colour, since in my opinion it'd enhance the general feeling of the movie. But that's more of a lack of technology than anything else really. All in all, a beautiful movie. \n\n9/10",

            "content": "This is a much beloved classic but I found myself shocked at how poorly this film addresses the issue of racism as it is the worst example of the white liberal fantasy in which the white savior surpasses the victims to take over the entire film. Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor, as shown by his performances in Duel in the Sun (1946) and The Yearling (1946), but it's hard to tolerate his ooey gooey, paternalistic shtick in this film for over two hours. I endorse schmaltz, I even loved other 1962 hits like The Miracle Worker (1962) and Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), but when you are dealing with issues as serious as racism it's not fair to reduce the issues down to the level that this film does.\n\nLawyer and single father Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck, is ordered to represent African-American Tom Robinson, Brock Peters, against charges that he raped a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell, Collin Wilcox. Meanwhile his tomboy daughter Scout, Mary Badham, raises questions about morality and investigates mysterious neighbor Boo Radley, Robert Duvall, along with her brother Jem, Phillip Alford, and friend Dill Harris, John Megna. Finch faces opposition in local white racists including Walter Cunningham, Graham Denton, but he maintains his resolve and takes actions to protect Robinson. During the trial he makes a compelling case for Robinson's innocence but the white jury choose to have him charged and he is later murdered. In the end the Finch children are protected by Radley and the man who murdered Robinson receives punishment.\n\nWe don't hear any dialogue from black characters, other than the dutiful house servant Calpurnia, Estelle Evans, until the trial that takes place halfway through the film and even then Robinson's words are simply jumping off points for Finch to monologue. While Peck does handle these monologues quite well you can't help feeling that the film is shifting the genuine weight that bears down on Robinson onto our privileged white protagonist. This feeling is only amplified when Finch departs the courtroom with all of the African-American friends of Robinson standing for him as a show of respect. I wanted to at least see more of Robinson's life outside of his relationship to Finch and I needed him to feel less like an excuse to show how wonderful and progressive our protagonist is. In a time when A Raisin in the Sun (1961) and Anna Lucasta (1958) had already been released I expect more from major studio films about race.\n\nThe movie also doesn't have a great sense of pacing as while it tries to set up an L.M. Montgomery-esque idealism of Finch and her childhood it seems as though the translation of Harper Lee's prose from the page to the screen did not capture this spirit. I found myself bored as the three children spend their time running around their neighborhood and discussing Radley. In films like The Last Picture Show (1971) this works as the characters are fascinating and their conflicts and silly antics all add up to something meaningful. These children felt too much like moppets for me to invest in them and Badham and Alford don't inject them with much life. Even the courtroom scenes don't have the bang necessary to have me indignant over the horrific racism in this town. These issues have been addressed far more provocatively and with more intelligence than in this film. No film can ever really equal 12 Angry Men (1957) but this film could have taken some cues from that classic and presented it's lead character as more conflicted and more outraged about the issues at hand.\n\nFinally, the conclusion of the film in which the two children are saved by Radley and we are meant to believe that the murder of Robinson's killer resolves the problems we have encountered is unsatisfactory. So much more is needed to convince me that the film is worthy of the subjects it discusses and it is sad that this film is recognized over Imitation of Life (1959) and Jungle Fever (1991). This is not my favorite of the 1962 Best Picture nominees, which I don't particularly like, and I think that even a film like The Music Man (1962) has more to offer.",

            "content": "A timeless insight into American racial dynamics.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962) is director Robert Mulligan reinventing the courtroom drama, coming of age story, and American classic of cinema. The finale in the court is a sight to behold as Gregory Peck his tour de force portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is the star as you find Peck endearing as a father, respectable as a lawyer, and admirable as a man. This is a story about a man that does the right thing because it is fair and a black man deserves a fair trial as anyone else.\n\nMulligan directed black and white film perfection as the atmosphere is always creepy and unnerving. There are many long scenes with a shot just focused in on panning down a street to close up on a character's face that are stunning shots. The use of Elmer Bernstein's lovely score is brilliant. The haunting forests, chilling streets, and eerie homes at night are elevated by Bernstein's music.\n\nIt really is incredible how To Kill a Mockingbird clearly influenced A Time to Kill, Mississippi Burning, Stand by Me, and The Goonies. Every coming of age and courtroom drama takes a little something from the look to the style of direction in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe cast is pretty outstanding by any standard. Gregory Peck is captivating every time he is on screen as Atticus Finch. Robert Duvall is so tender and shy as Boo Radley. Mary Badham is so adorable and likable as Scout Finch. You see her confusion at the new ideas presented to her. Her indignant attitude is very fun to watch too. Lastly, I must mention that Phillip Alford is very impressive and expressive as Jem Finch. His sorrow and concern show a subtle understanding in his acting far beyond his years.\n\nIn all, To Kill a Mockingbird is a must watch film forevermore. It is excellence in direction that is gripping from beginning to end. It is creative angles and perspectives not normally seen in film. It is unfortunately timeless messaging on racial divisions and tensions in America. To Kill a Mockingbird is just wonderful!",

I suspect it captures the nostalgic feeling of childhood memories of \"events of significance\" even more than the movie does.  And the movie does a very nice job of showing us a grown-up world through a child's eyes, a grown-up world where things are unfair and people are treated badly because of the colour of their skin.  It is small-town Alabama in the early 1930s and the children are Scout, a six-year-old girl, and Jem, a ten-year-old boy, and they are the children of grown-up lawyer Atticus Finch, played by a dignified Gregory Peck.  He's a widower with a deep sense of justice who is called upon (and agrees) to defend black Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who has been accused of raping a white girl.  Of course, the odds are stacked against them and the racism of the town is such that Robinson needs to be protected from lynching from the same sort of men who are later sitting on the jury.  Yet, we believe in Robinson, and in Finch. as wholeheartedly as his children do, and we see the girl's father, Bob Ewell, as the true villain, almost an embodiment of evil here.  But the movie is not all serious and we also see the children enjoy themselves, daring each other to run up and touch the door of a spooky nearby house where rumour has it that \"Boo\" Radley, a shut-in young man (who represents a sort of Bogeyman) lives and who may be dangerous (or perhaps not, since he may be leaving small gifts for the kids).  The plot ultimately weaves a number of different strands together into a satisfying whole, even as it avoids any semblance of a happy ending that would claim to have solved the problem of racism.  Off in the future, from the standpoint of the narrator (a grown-up Scout), these events still seem significant - and the effect of the book and the movie on American society, perhaps more significant still.  Yet, more cultural advances would be needed before we would begin to hear black voices telling their own stories rather than having white advocates speak for them (inside and out of the movies).",

I like the acting from the child actors but man, you can tell that they're just reading off a script, the kids don't have talent unlike the guy who plays atticus, scouts father, he does or I should say shows how good of an actor he is and that he cares for the role and he does a fantastic job.",

From its opening shot where Scout (Mary Badham) hums while writing the title to its ending when the character of Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) is finally revealed. Each moment is considered to be a great triumph of film-making; ranging from its camerawork, directing, editing, and score. But let's not forget the character of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck in a deserved Oscar-winning performance); the lawyer and caring father of two. He is what holds the film together like glue. Finch is a character who believes in what is right, no matter what other people's perception is, especially when it comes to defending black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) during a trial in the film's most powerful moment. He doesn't give in to anger, and helps young Scout get through the problems in school. I can only describe 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as one of the most important films you will ever experience (even if you have never read Harper Lee's novel).",

I was relieved to see that two giants, Andrew Sarris and Roger Ebert, also didn't like the film - phew, it isn't just me !  My impressions:  stilted movie-making, almost as if they had filmed a stage play; manipulative, superficial moralizing; cartoonish, politically correct caricatures and fantasy scenes.

What i felt watching it is that there are three movies here: Tom Robinson's story, Boo and the children's one and the lone father/liberal white lawyer Atticus' one. The three elements of the story don't work perfectly together, i think, and each of them could be analyzed in a deeper way. We perceive the difficulties that Atticus is facing  growing the children without his wife, but the movie just hints to that, for example. But perhaps if had watched it in 1962 i would have had a totally different impression of it and, given the time, it was a courageous movie. Anyway, it's worth watching it just for Gregory Peck's amazing, Oscar winning performance! What an actor!",

When I started watching I was a tad annoyed by how much time went into the setup. There was nearly half the film that was entirely focused on the kids running around and playing. I started to wonder if I even read this book because none of this stuff (other than the names) seemed familiar to me. So I think if I had an issue with this film it would be that it spent so long in those early scenes establishing characters, and Atticus remained mostly in the background. However whenever Atticus showed up the story was truly remarkable. I love this tale of 2 kids learning just how important their father is in the community. And the story really got going once we were allowed to step into the courtroom, that is when the film becomes one of the best crime dramas ever captured on film. I love the way the story unfolds in the court, and how you could see the uphill battle Atticus was waging. The after-effects of the trial were just as riveting right up until the last frame of the film. In fact the back half of To Kill A Mockingbird is so strong that I virtually forgot about the slow parts in the first half. I think if I watch the film more I'll learn to appreciate the setup as an essential part of character development which makes the second half so effective, but on a first watch I just wanted it to move a little faster.",

The best part for me was the court room drama. What I didn't like was that it took too long to get there.

In particular Scout. I understand that now but, he was that I had new that coming in. I had these expectations that it was a court room drama film. I had not read book so I didn't know what was coming or what to expect. Like I said the best parts where definitely the court room scenes and I love the scenes with Nr. Finch and what his character represents. What I also didn't like because I didn't really understood was the thing with Boo ( Robert Duvall's character ).

The drama in this movie was handled very well; \"To Kill A Mocking Bird\" could've easily been a movie with a two-hour courtroom scene. \"Robert Mulligan\" The director of \"To Kill A Mocking Bird\" filmed the movie beautifully; in every shot he captured everything. If you are a person who has read the book then I highly recommend you watch \"To Kill A Mocking Bird\" as it has amazing acting, stunning visuals and thrilling music. Although the movie has some issues one being nothing happening with then two kids, more lead up to the courtroom scene and nothing really explained about the neighbour. I give \"To Kill A Mocking Bird\" a 9/10.",

            "content": "\"To Kill A Mockingbird\" \nSpoiler Alert\n\tWe have all had a childhood. But it might have not been as exciting as Jem, Scout, or Dills. Harper Lee expresses an exciting and suspenseful climax in this movie. She shows a childhood of three kids that have to live through the great depression. \n\n\t\"To Kill A Mockingbird\" is a movie set during the time of 1930s when the great depression occurred. In this movie the main characters are Atticus Finch the father of Scout and Jem.  Also Tom Robinson, Bob Ewell and Boo Radley. All of these characters live in Maycomb, Alabama. In the start of this movie Jem, Scout and Dill wonder about Boo Radley, who lives inside the house across the street. Atticus Finch takes on a case and he is defending a negro, Tom Robinson. By Atticus defending  a negro people start to have a lot of issues with him.\n\n        \tGregory Peck who is Atticus Finch in the movie acted very well. In the trial scene he showed passion for winning the case. He was sweating and the tone of his voice showed emotion. Mary Badham who is Scout also I think played good in the scene where her and Jem get attacked. She looks very worried and scared. I also think she acts very well when she treats Jem like a real brother. She acts like she really cares about him. \n         \n        \tSome things I didn't like about this movie was when Scout and Jem got attacked. In the book I thought it described it so much better. I also didn't like how they didn't show Tom Robinson being killed. I thought that it was a huge part of the story and they left it out. However I did like the movie overall. I thought it was very interesting even though it was in black and white. I also thought the actors were great. \n          \nOverall what I got out of \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" was you cannot judge somebody unless you have walked in there shoes. I thought this whole movie was based off of this. Since it was during the Great Depression there was segregation. Atticus got a ton of crap because he was defending a negro. Anything you did back then was with whatever race you were. Blacks and whites did not mix.\n      \n          \tI would recommend this movie to teens and up. It was overall a good movie I think you guys would like it. I don't know if younger kids would understand what all is going on because some of the language they use. I would rate this a PG-13 movie.\n        \n           Rating: 4.5/5 stars \n           \n           Katherine is a freshmen in high school. She plays travel softball and skis. She likes hanging out with her friends and likes to watch TV and movies.",

On reflection tho, it's better the focus was on Atticus defending his kids. Despite being an older gentleman, he had a deeper and higher purpose, perfectly reflected by Gregory Peck.\nMy want for graphic violence was really gratuitous and unnecessary.\n\nAs a tenth grader, I truly saw this as an adventure from the childs point of view, and the racial tension hadnt fully sunk in until a few years later. Stunning to me how the film worked completely on both levels.\n\nClassic cinema, not to be missed.\n\n5 out of 5",

            "content": "The movie, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", is a movie that I would suggest to anyone that has read the book or has an understanding for the Great Depression. However, if you loved the book, keep loving it, because the movie doesn't even come close to it. SPOILER ALERT!  This review is gonna have some major spoilers, so if you still want to read... please don't hold it against me! \n\nWe start this story in Maycomb County, Alabama in the year 1929. The people of Maycomb had an unrealistic thought that the Great Depression existed for everyone else except themselves. The people of Maycomb also believed in segregation and had no intention of abandoning their old southern beliefs.  Atticus Finch, one of the best known lawyers in the county, represents Tom Robinson, a black man. Atticus isn't a bad person for defending this man, but that's not how the whole population of Maycomb sees it. \n\nAtticus is the father of Jean Louis or \"Scout\", whatever strikes your fancy, Scout is an outgoing character. Scout is Atticus Finch's daughter and Jem's sister. Scout is more of a fighter and she certainly doesn't take any nonsense. But Atticus has a way with his children, especially Jem. Jem is the type of boy to follow directly in his father's footsteps. But Jem also believes Atticus is unable to do many things. But in reality, Atticus hides his talents and the rest of Maycomb knows all about them, except for Atticus's children. Now onto Atticus, Atticus is the county's best known lawyer and certainly has the most integrity of all. So much integrity, that he decided to defend a black man in court against a white man's word. This was definitely frowned upon. The man Atticus defended was named Tom Robinson. Tom was a hardworking man who from time to time helped the Uhl family out, that was a mistake on his part. Tom was accused by the town drunk, Mr. Uhl, of raping his daughter. Tom was found guilty after his first trial, but Atticus knew they had a good chance of winning the second one.  An awful incident made another trial impossible.\n\nThere's so many things I loved about the movie.  What really stood out to me was the way Atticus spoke to his children and the way he seemed to have an understanding of everything. Atticus Finch could make sense of anything. I loved it.  I was disappointed with the amount of details missing from the movie that were included in the book. They definitely left out some crucially important details, like Miss Maudie's house burning down, that could have really made the movie even better than it already was. Other than a few scenes, the movie did an a great job of telling the story.\n\nMany lessons could be taken from this movie, One lesson that really stand out to myself is integrity. In my opinion, this is the best lesson to be taught in life. Atticus teaches this lesson to us throughout the movie by standing up for what he believe in, even if it makes him unpopular. He teaches us by showing Jem and Scout how to make the world a better place and to stand up for what is right. He showed Scout and Jem that even while the county was taunting him and his family for defending an innocent black man, he would still stand strong \nand have the utmost honesty and try his best at every point during the trials. One of the things Atticus says before Tom's trial is something along the lines of, \"I would not be able to hold my head up in this town if I did not give Tom a fair trial\". After Atticus said these words I was hooked!\n\nFor anyone who is interested in any American history or Great Depression topics this is the movie for you. There is a strong sense of controversy in this movie and a lot of racism. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone fourteen and up. If the individual watching does not have an understanding of racism, segregation, or the Great Depression this is not the movie for them. I do not recommend for anyone under the age of thirteen. This movie is definitely a PG-13 because of the language and content of the movie.  \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is definitely an extraordinary story and a must- watch! \n\nThe Movie, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", deserves an A. This A is well deserved because of the fantastic acting and wonderful illustration of this time period for small towns, like Maycomb, in the south. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" has such an amazing storyline, as well. The entire movie has a way of showing you the truth about this time period. \n\nBIOGRAPHY ON THE AUTHOR \nThe writer's name is Morgan Mullin. She is a freshman at Bohemia Manor High School and is also in Ms. Gunther's honors english class. She has read and watched \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" at least three times in the past two years during school and says every time how extraordinary the story truly is. She absolutely loves it! She is also very involved in softball, she plays for the Maryland Legends 18U Gold. Softball is pretty much all she does besides schoolwork. Anyways, she's probably hoping you enjoyed her review and it helped you figure out if the movie is right for you.",

            "content": "To Kill a Mockingbird was #1 on the list of movies no one could believe I had never seen until now. I always knew I would, I just never got to seeing it.\n\nOne of the problems, as I mentioned in my comments about The Third Man, is that if you wait too long to see such an essential movie, you'll know all about it before you do, and that first-time experience can be lost. Don't worry about it. It didn't matter that I knew every beat in this movie before I saw it, I was still blubbering like a goddamn baby at the end.\n\nI have scarce little new to say about it, but I'll make a few notes. \n\nA movie centered on children can be difficult because the kids can either be terrible actors, or even worse, really good professional child actors. Years ago, after a friend had seen the 1994 reboot of The Little Rascals, I asked him if the kids looked like kids or like child actors. He said, \"Child actors.\" That's all I needed to know. I've never seen it and doubt I ever will.\n\nHappily the children in To Kill a Mockingbird are note-perfect. As Scout, Mary Badham carried the furrowed brow of a young girl trying to figure out what all this meant, how her well-taught respect for elders could possibly comport with the abominations to which she bore witness. Scout is a little girl swept up in an event much larger than her scope of understanding. \n\nThe actress Mary Badham could probably strongly relate, being a young actress in the making of a movie that was itself a cultural touchstone. The role of Scout is possibly the 20th century version of Huck Finn, the quintessential American literary character of its culture. \n\nGregory Peck, of course, is also note-perfect. I have little to say about him that hasn't already been said in excess. It is the role of a lifetime for any actor. \n\nThere is one inherent problem to the movie, and that is a problem that has been around for a long time in our movies. That is the tendency of movies on the theme of racism against blacks to be more about how that racism affects whites. In no sense is To Kill a Mockingbird about a black man unjustly accused of rape, a man ultimately killed by police (thank God that doesn't happen anymore, right?). It is about the white lawyer who defends him, and whose only physical injury comes when a redneck spits on him. Just as the Steve Biko movie wasn't about Steve Biko, it was about the white man who wrote about him. Just as The Help wasn't about black housekeepers, it was about the white woman who wrote about them. \n\nThis is not anomalous. It happens all the freaking time. \n\nIt should not be ignored that for at least the first fifty years of movie history, the two largest box office successes in America were emphatically supportive of Southern racists - Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind. To Kill a Mockingbird is high on the crest of the wave of socially conscious movies that emerged in the '50s and '60s. It cannot be interpreted as anything but a searing indictment of racial bigotry. But if it was not focused on a white man, the movie might never have been made at all.",

He will face death threats and his children being targeted as part of the case; but to do what is right, he can't turn the case down.\n\n\"Are we poor?\"\n\"We are indeed.\"\n\nRobert Mulligan, director of The Man in the Moon, Summer of '42, Kiss Me Goodbye, Baby the Rain Must Fall, The Rat Race, and The Pursuit of Happiness, delivers To Kill a Mockingbird.

The acting is excellent, especially Gregory Peck as Atticus who is just perfect acting and is intimidating at the very finest. The writing by Horton Foote is great, and kept the spirit and faithfulness to the book. The direction by Robert Mulligan is terrific, and the soundtrack is nice to listen to. It's unpredictable knowing that it takes place during the 1960s and white people didn't respect black people at the time. It's actually Robert Duvall's first acting movie, and he's actually not that bad despite the fact that he doesn't even have a line. The court scene is really investing and is refreshing that we wouldn't know anything about both the victims, which makes us just as curious as the people in court that have no idea about what's going on.

I like how half the movie establishes the different characters, and the remaining half deals with the case and town's attitude. The movie maintains proper pace and doesn't seem to be in a rush, and that really works for it. The acting by everyone involved is quite commendable; in this film, we see the dashing young Robert Duvall for the first time. I really like how it shows how a parent's attitude towards certain things really shapes a child. Our attitude towards things are always shaped by the people around us.",

The movie suffers from some old-fashioned weirdnesses like the canned suspense of the shadow creeping towards the children when obviously, the figure casting the shadow (Boo) would be completely visible to them; the canned suspense of when Scout accidentally rolls into the Radleys' yard and Jem and Dill embark on a needlessly elongated rescue attempt with Jem running up to slam the Radleys' front door for no apparent reason; the canned suspense of Boo hiding behind Jem's bedroom door and no one figuring out that he was the one who rescued the kids. So what I'm saying is, there's a lot of hokey canned suspense.\n\nThe themes of coming-of-age, fatherhood, goodness, tact, humility, fighting against injustice in the face of futility, as espoused by the novel and film are still beautiful, and the entire court sequence with Brock Peters' plaintive testimony, Gregory Peck's masterful closing argument, and Reverend Sykes chastising Scout to stand as her father passes and the entire black congregation rising, are just indelible moments in our cinematic history.",

You have to love Gregory Peck (again) after watching To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nHarper Lee brought the Finches into my life and it could be one of the best things happening to me. The story reminds me of Inherit the Wind as well as The Crucible. A man chose to stand up alone while everyone else was sitting down. He did not bow down or kneel. What Atticus represents is simply conscience, a clear and pure conscience.\n\nThe novel is very detailed about everyone and everything in Maycomb.

Instead we got Horton Foote faithfully adapting Harper Lee's work, bringing the amazing story to cinematic brilliance on the silver screen with the exact amalgamation of tenderness and poignancy that makes the book so enthralling, while simultaneously capturing almost every form of symbolism her book had to offer. Seen through the eyes of young tomboy, Scout, To Kill a Mockingbird shows her and her brother Jem growing up in depression-era Alabama, and witnessing the ugliness of racism as their father, Atticus defends a black man accused of raping a white woman. Contrasting such dark themes with the naivet\u00e9 of childhood shows how much our environment matures us, while Gregory Peck (who IS Atticus Finch) stands up for the best of America. Surprising direct and alert in the way films from its time weren't, Mockingbird simply hasn't aged, more metastasized.",

Confronted by the fact that they know each other and have children who know each other, the evil of the lynch party becomes apparent.\n\nThe other golden moment is when the black church minister tells Scout to stand up in honour of her father who \"is passing\".

The whole courtroom drama showcased the film's limited power that bring the viewer in the room and interacts with eyes-widening on the power and -rising on the effected while feeling the tense. The star Gregory Peck delivered a great performance, that'd won him Best Actor, for bringing such power while defending an accused, innocent black man and trying to break through the walls of ridiculous racism in a quiet tone. But the rules of such power applies: it'd limited his character's abilities that could've expand away from the courtroom. Although, he probably already knew about the rules and was just using such power try to create peace between men by communicating a hard message that black and white are equal. However, back to the applied rules of the power usage, there's a direction that'd pointed out the said limitation that'd went for the purpose of keeping the story going for the drama but there was enough power for an alternate direction that would've worked in a more satisfactory note and still provide the same outcome.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is definitely one of those great films that deserves its winning titles by the contained greatness energized by the nice performances and what they were able to deliver to the adapted storyline to showcase the film's excellency.

            "content": "After recently watching Philadelphia and reading that the plot for To Kill a Mockingbird also involved a lawyer defending a man within a prejudice community, my interest grew in the film and I was looking forward to seeing what it offered. However, my expectations were way too high and I was left feeling disappointed. The movie does in fact contain a courtroom scene which keeps you hooked on the characters actions, however this segment was only a small part of the movie. This was the highlight of the movie for me and left me wanting more. After the verdict was given I was expecting the story to continue. Instead the accused was written out the movie with a single line. Following this, you witnessed a number of scenes which left me confused with what was actually going on. Since reading up and realising what happened, it still felt it was a strange end that I don't necessarily agree with.\nTo Kill a Mockingbird does contain one filmmaking aspect that was a nice change and that was to have the movie narrated by an older version of the featured young girl. Whilst it did catch my attention at the start, I just couldn't keep hooked. It was only when the film went into court that I began to perk up, but that was finished before you knew it.\nI'm not saying it's a bad film and I respect that a lot of people hold it quite highly, however for me personally it was nothing special. I didn't find it hugely entertaining and simply could not see what all the fuss was about. Whilst my score may seem low, To Kill a Mockingbird will definitely have it's fan who would give it a more deserving rating.",

            "content": "To Kill a Mockingbird Movie Review\n\tFrom April 29 to May 16, I watched the movie To Kill a Mockingbird with my class. To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), directed by Robert Mulligan, is a black-and-white film based on the novel To Kill a Mockingbird published two years earlier in 1960. Although the film follows the novel's largest storyline, many important themes are eliminated in favor of action. The children in the movie generally acted better than their adult counterparts, although there are exceptions. On the bright side, the costumes are fitting for the characters, and the music well-suited for the scenes. No special effects were used throughout the movie, as they were unnecessary.\n\tThe movie To Kill a Mockingbird follows the plot of the novel. However, many scenes are altered or completely missing and removing many sub-themes, some more related to us nowadays than the central anti-racist theme, along with them. One of the most important aspects of the novel missing in the film is the part relating to Ms. Dubose (Ruth White). In the novel, she teaches us that courage is the capacity to endure any hardship to achieve a goal that, even then, one cannot be sure of achieving. In the film, she is only shown as a cranky old woman who Atticus uses to demonstrate the effects of politeness. Also missing in the film is Aunt Alexandra and the Christmas visit to Finch's Landing. In the novel, Aunt Alexandra and her missionary society provided valuable insight into women's life in the early 19th century, and Uncle Jack learned alongside the readers how we should treat children. These important scenes are all non-existent in the movie. Another example is the children's visit to Calpurnia's church in which readers learn that it is not necessary to show off every chance one gets. Although the movie attempts to use action and suspense to make up for plot, even these are insufficient and hardly affect the drabness of the film as a whole. Adding to this list of disappointments, the movie also makes a mistake many Hollywood films make; it sharpens the contrast between black and white. For example, in the film, Tom's criminal record disappears to make him appear more innocuous. It is also responsible for shifting the focus of the story almost entirely on the heroism of Atticus.\n\tThe acting was not especially proficient either, although some performed better than others, and the costumes were fairly decent. For example, the children (Scout played by Mary Badham and Jem by Phillip Alford) seemed completely into their roles, and their lines flowed without stumps. Mr. Ewell (James K. Anderson) was fit for his role both physically and through his performance. Gregory Peck fit Atticus's old, tired yet loving fatherly character flawlessly, yet, as previously mentioned, he is given much more emphasis in the film than in the novel. Both Ms. Maudie (Rosemary Murphy) and Ms. Stephanie (Alice Ghostley) say their lines too quickly, as though reciting. Mayella (Collin Wilcox) acts too dramatically in the movie, perhaps another attempt to make her appear more guilty.\n\tThe music is the best aspect of the film, and it generally fits the mood of the scene it's played in. For example, it becomes eerie near the Radley house and was adventurous when the children were playing. Whether intentionally or not, the movie ends with the same calm and harmonious melody, perhaps to signify that with the death of Bob Ewell, everything had finally returned to normal.\n\tIn the end, after watching the movie twice, one with my class and once by myself, I have concluded that the movie To Kill a Mockingbird fails to reach the standards of the novel it is based on in its plot, cinematography, and acting, and I do not recommend anyone who has already read the novel to watch this film, since it would be a great disappointment.",

It reminded of my childhood days where I would go exploring around my neighborhood on those hot summer days, not having a care in the world. I never believed there were evil things in this world, but that changes through time when you grow up and see the true natures of this world and that there are things that can scare you, but that's just a small part of life.\n\nI told my dad we were going to watch the movie in class and he wouldn't allow it because he wanted to watch it with me. So he goes out and buys it and we decide to watch it as a nice movie night type of deal.\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a cinematic masterpiece and will forever remain as an important part in cinema history. The whole story to it is just so nostalgic and just reminds us of how young and innocent we all were and not knowing what true horrors lies within. Gregory Peck gives a phenomenal performance as Atticus Finch, a southern lawyer who believes what is right and stands up for Tom Robinson against a prejudice, southern community. He teaches Jem and Scout that there are principals in life that includes equality, beliefs, and values of others and that life isn't a walk through the park, that it's precious. In these 16 years on my young life, I have never seen a movie so moving, so soulful, so beautiful as To Kill A Mockingbird. While it may not be the best full on adaptation ever, they still managed to capture the essence of the book and make into a remarkable major-motion picture. \n\nUsually movies don't make me reduce down to tears, but when the scene where Scout meets Boo Radley for the first time, it made me realize how innocent we truly are and I just lost it.\n\nI'm glad I watched it with my dad and not watch it with a class of 30  moronic, stoner, assholes who don't get the true art of cinema and would rather watch Movie 43. To Kill A Mockingbird is a film that should be preserved and loved by all and for eternity.",

Robert Mulligan (The Great Imposter (1961), Inside Daisy Clover (1965) and Up the Down Staircase (1967)), was hired to direct the film. It's a powerful and dramatic adaptation, and it's a film which lives up to it's reputation as one of the greats. Set in Maycomb, Alabama in the early 1930's, this tells the story of widowed father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), who is a struggling lawyer in Maycomb, and he's always able to divide his professional life, from his family life, raising his two children Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford). While they're off having adventure of their own with new friend Dill Harris (John Megna). Atticus is asked to defend black man Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), who is accused of sexually assaulting local teenage girl Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox). Atticus accepts the case, which seems open and shut, but Atticus ends up being ganged up on by local bigots who believe Robinson is guilty, and his children end up getting taunted because of it. It's a very compelling film with some brilliant dialogue and brilliant performances, from the children and their exploits, to Peck as the idealistic, unprejudiced lawyer, (he won an Oscar for the role), it's a timeless film, one that will never date as it's a true American story, one which has heart and tenderness, and family at it's heart.",

It's the type that tends to bore you when you're younger, but then comes back and presents itself as a whole other movie when you view it as an adult.  I guess I can understand why some people find the lengthy courtroom sequences a little boring, and the overall quality of the film - as in its appearance on the screen - seems unreasonably grainy and hard to make out.  But maybe that's just my DVD.  Anyway, everything else just clicks so well together, with unrivalled performances from all its main cast, quite possibly the most beautiful, hauntingly poignant music ever put to screen, and the most perfect balance between the wondrous innocence of childhood, and the bleak but affirming struggle one makes as they encounter an adult's world.  The book is definitely better, but this movie ticks almost all the right boxes.

This also causes trouble for Atticus' children Jem and Scout and the book takes a look at racism and its infamous impact back in the 1930s setting.\nThe movie is a classic, one of those ones you must see before you die.

            "content": "Films about racial prejudice often date very badly. There's no denying the historical significance of something like In The Heat of the Night, but the style in which such a film conveys its message now seems heavy-handed, even while its message remains important. Many films about racial conflict are so much a product of their time that they quickly become historical caricatures. This is true right back to the days of D. W. Griffith, though with Intolerance he could just have been trying too hard.\n\nIn contrast to these films, To Kill A Mockingbird has survived largely untarnished for 51 years, with neither changes in film technique nor wider social changes serving to blunt its powerful message or diminish its memorable characters. Through the steady hand of Robert Mulligan and the brilliance of Gregory Peck, Harper Lee's beloved novel is wonderfully realised in a film which is equally graceful, playful and heartbreaking. It remains, with 12 Angry Men, the standard to which all courtroom dramas aspire, and is a genuinely fine piece of drama in its own right.\n\nI've already reviewed two other films based on Pulitzer Prize-winning novels, namely Gone With The Wind and A Place in the Sun. The common observation about these two was that neither film had enough of a story to warrant their respective running times: the ideas were either improperly executed or not that nuanced in the first place. Whether through the superior nature of its source, Mulligan's solid approach or the influence of producer Alan J. Pakula (All The President's Men), To Kill A Mockingbird does not suffer the same fate.\n\nHorton Foote's screenplay is a great adaptation of Lee's novel, retaining all its unique imagery and rich language while ensuring the story is told in the most efficient and visually intriguing way possible. Just the right amount of time is taken in setting up the lives of our young protagonists: we see Atticus and his children Jem and Scout going about their daily lives, setting up the ease and ethics of their existence before the crime conspires to shatter their world. In short, each movement of the story is accorded as much time as is needed and nothing more.\n\nMulligan's directorial approach is similar in one way to that of Clint Eastwood. Both are at heart steady, nuts-and-bolts directors, interested in getting the job done quickly and telling their given story in the tidiest manner possible. The vast majority of their films tell their stories plainly and logically, and there is very little slack in either the visual or verbal narrative. You'd think that such an approach would dent the subtleties of Lee's book, but in fact it allows them to emerge freely. By being so reluctant to invade stylistically, Mulligan creates a naturalistic environment in which the young actors can produce their great performances.\n\nThat being said, Mulligan does benefit from assistance elsewhere in his crew. The film is shot by Russell Harlan, who also shot Blackboard Jungle and Witness for the Prosecution. Not only is he at home with the formal settings of the school and the courthouse, but his lighting choices add real tension to the story, particularly in the shadows and shot choices for Boo Radley's house. The film also benefits from a score by Elmer Bernstein, later known for his collaborations with John Landis. His light, cheery themes beautifully underscore the childlike innocence of the opening act; their absence is conspicuous during the later, darker scenes, which become more effective as a result.\n\nAs a result of these creative decisions, To Kill A Mockingbird is much more tense than you might at first presume. Considering its reputation as a lynchpin of American liberalism, you might regard it as a worthy but overly talky drama, full of big speeches about morality but not enough actual character development. But its moral backbone is only part of the film, since it is also the story of a child's innocence being invaded and ravaged by a dark world of prejudice.\n\nOne of the great assets of both the book and the film is presenting the action through the eyes of Jem and Scout. Through the early scenes of them playing with Dill, we get to see the world as it appears from their experience, including their own levels of prejudice regarding the children at school. The case that Atticus takes forces them to confront issues about race and injustice long before they are ready or their father would have wanted. We feel both Jem's pain and Scout's heartache at her revelation, in a way that we wouldn't if we saw the film through Atticus' eyes.\n\nAs for Atticus himself, it's not hard to see why the AFI ranked him as the greatest movie hero of all time in 2003. Atticus is the embodiment of all the values Western civilisation holds dear: justice, decency, freedom and equality before the law. He is unbending in his belief in the power of law and the rights of man, and unlike the heroes of many westerns he does not carry out these beliefs by morally duplicitous means. Gregory Peck thoroughly deserved his Oscar for a role which feeds off his natural grace and authority; even amongst such a glittering career, it remains his finest performance. \n\nThere is a comparison between this film and A Man For All Seasons. Robert Bolt's original play was written two years before this film came out, and both stories revolve around a tragic hero. Both Atticus and Sir Thomas More are idealists struggling in a world which has abandoned said ideals for the sake of short-term satisfaction, be it power, wealth, status or revenge. The courtroom scene in To Kill A Mockingbird wins out, however, being less stagey and needlessly histrionic than Fred Zinnemann's film. Mulligan uses similar techniques to The Paradine Case (which also starred Peck), using low angles to give the characters more authority over proceedings. \n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a beautifully nuanced examination of prejudice. Rather than needlessly caricature the more red-neck characters, it takes its time to show how ordinary people defy reason, logic, good argument and morality just to satisfy their own convictions. No courtroom drama since has quite captured the heartache of injustice as this film does when Tom Robinson is found guilty despite all the evidence proving his innocence. The long, slow walk that Peck endures, in the presence of all Robinson's supporters, is a heartbreaking image of a man of good faith broken by needless, gutless hatred.\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a truly great film which still delivers an emotional punch even after all this time. Despite a few scenes which seem tame or creaky by today's standards, the film as a whole has held up immensely well. Peck's performance, and those of the young children, are beautifully complimented by Foote's deft writing and Mulligan's unfussy hand. It is a classic of its time, and essential viewing in ours.",

Some of the power it held over audiences fifty years ago has no doubt diminished with times as movie audiences have allegedly \"advanced\", but one of the reasons I was so drawn to the film is because of its old-fashioned sentimentality.\n\nIt takes place in a time before kids became so cynical, when brothers protected their little sisters rather than mock them, and fathers were everything in the eyes of their children. It's so refreshing to see that.\n\nGregory Peck was given the role of a lifetime in that of Atticus Finch, and its restorative to see a character this fundamentally good, taking on essentially the problems of society seemingly because no one else can carry the burden. An updated version of the film simply could not work basically because no modern actor could pull off Finch's sincere graciousness and unassuming demeanor. \n\nThere are a lot of other themes running through the film that students in classrooms right now are struggling with, but the film is enormously gratifying as simple viewing for pleasure. Along with Peck's extraordinary performance, the three child actors are so natural and believable in their roles that it never feels like acting. Young Mary Badham is simply tremendous as Scout. It's a wonder that she never acted much after this.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is such a renowned movie for so many reasons, but I appreciated the way it transported me back to a time that was simpler yet so much like today.

            "content": "To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:\n\nAn external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson\nA relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley\nAn internal development plot of the children's maturation\nThe external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.\n\nThe external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.\n\nThe internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.\n\nIt's a great movie.\n\nMy only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.",

He believes this man to be innocent and that because he is black, he is being treated unfairly in the court of law. The movie moves in a very dramatic pace and is an emotional ride through it all.

            "content": "Based on the award-winning novel by Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), an honest, respected lawyer living in Alabama during the Great Depression. His career is put to the test when he is called to defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a man falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell (Collin Paxton), mostly due to the fact that he's black. During all of this, Atticus's two kids, Jem (Philip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham) learn more about racism and mature in their years.\n\nAlso appearing in this film includes Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a man who is viewed as a mental psychopath by the town, John Megna as Dill, Jem and Scout's friend, Frank Overton as Sheriff Tate, Estelle Evans as the Finch's maid Calpurnia, and James Anderson as Bob Ewell, the father of the victim who is not only racist towards Tom, but also towards Atticus and his family.\n\nIn my freshman year of high school, I was assigned to read To Kill a Mockingbird in my English class, as with many other kids over the years, and my opinion of the book was not good. I viewed the book as boring and too long and it needed more focus on Atticus and not the kids.\n\nWhen coming across the film, however, I was certain that I would at least enjoy it more than the book, and I was right, but the film ended up exceeding my expectations.\n\nThe reason why To Kill a Mockingbird works as a film is the overall message of the film about racism. When it was released in 1962, the Civil Rights Movement was going on, and I believe that this film helped make the movement a success. The studio took a risk at releasing it during a movement like this, and they paid off. If Lawrence of Arabia wasn't released the same year, then this probably would have won Best Picture.\n\nOne of the most unique things about To Kill a Mockingbird is the decision to film it in black-and-white, during a decade when more films were being released in color. I think this decision to film it in the traditional black-and-white format was a smart decision. The tone really works here, and it wouldn't have worked as well if it was made in color. The black-and-white really makes the cinematography stand out.\n\nElmer Bernstein's score is haunting and beautiful. The opening theme is just stunning, especially considering at the originality of the opening credits sequence.\n\nThe acting is the big standout of the film. I give special credit to the performance of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, who won an Oscar for this role, beating out Peter O'Toole for his acclaimed role in Lawrence of Arabia, which caused a huge controversy by Lawrence fans. In my opinion, while O'Toole was great as Lawrence, Peck really earned his Oscar. The way he presented his character is just magnificent. The scene in the courtroom is just chilling.\n\nGenerally, when there are kids in a film, it either helps a film or kills a film. Jurassic Park was a good example at nearly killing a film due to the child actors in it. To Kill a Mockingbird, on the other hand, has some pretty good child actors in it. Mary Badham, who plays Scout, is just fantastic. Considering that this was her first acting role, you'd think that she had done acting before. Same with Philip Alford as Jem.\n\nWhile I was skeptical as how a film based on the overrated book would turn out, I'm glad I watched To Kill a Mockingbird, cause it is a million gazillion times better than the book, and does it's purpose at moving and informing people about the sins of racism. Peck will always be remembered for playing Atticus Finch, and in a million years after his death, he will still be remembered.",

Unfortunately, many great works of literature would ultimately go on to be adapted poorly to the big screen and the books themselves would not be given the proper cinematic treatment. The Huckleberry Finn film from 1960, for example, was just atrocious, barring anything a fan of it might say in its defense. But one of the all-too-rare successful novel adaptations to cinema was indeed To Kill A Mockingbird.\n     It remains one of the most magical movie experiences for me, and I know I'm not alone in that position. It did everything right: it properly adapted the material to best suit a motion picture format, but not at the expense of the heart and soul of the book itself. Everything that needed to remain intact did, and anything that needed to be adjusted for the film treatment was. But nothing else was done to the story. The filmmakers must have recognized that the story was already good enough on its own, and any major alterations would have only lessened the impact of the message and drama, not improved upon it. So, like any proper adaptation, they essentially left it alone. And the end result it simply magical.\n     Whether you're experiencing it for the first time or passing it on to a loved one, I guarantee you'll marvel and delight every single time at the unlikely adventures of Scout and her band of curious friends as they grow and mature in the heart of the roaring south at a very crucial era in history.",

The direction is seemless, graceful and beauitful never forcing it's themes on you about youth and how everything around it affects us when we're young in society, parents, morals and prejudice. It's also one of the best adaptations on film, bringing the more important parts of the book into the film and focusing on them.

Or so you'd think because it's as it should be, because even though we can't change the past we can learn from the guilt we take away from it.\n\nThe screen version of Harper Lee's \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" by director Robert Mulligan and writer Horton Foote is less a rallying cry for social revolution than it is a gentle reminder that principle can sometimes come from people and places unanticipated. It also helps the story, spun from the mouths of babes, has all the simple but dazzling wonder of youth and purity, like the townspeople's final muster against the scrappy kid killer at the black heart of Fritz Lang's \"M\" or the heaven-sent coming-of-age of \"It's a Wonderful Life\". \"Mockingbird\" is also less an interpretation of than it is a perfectly-executed pledge of allegiance to Lee's book.

Furthermore, this film covered the issue of prejudice when it was still a very explosive subject to many people. Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it. This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time. It follows the recollections of Scout (Mary Badham) as she remembers her childhood with her older brother Jem and their widowed, lawyer father Atticus. The plot revolves most importantly around the trial of a black man for an accused rape of a white girl . The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do. In probably his greatest performance, Gregory Peck portrayed a quiet yet courageous man, Lee had likened to her father. Instantly we are drawn to this well-grounded person who is not always liked or successful for that matter, but who always does what is ultimately right",

Gregory Peck doesn't turn in a remarkable, emotional performance that is often associated with film's great heroes, but rather an understated, well-modulated one that's inspiring in just about as many ways as one can think of. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" also features some gorgeous black-and-white photography as well as a handful of great child performances.",
