    "summary": "In 1944, the U.S. Army and Allied forces plan a huge invasion landing in Normandy, France. Despite bad weather, General Eisenhower gives the okay and the Allies land at Normandy. General Norma Cota (Robert Mitchum) travels with his men onto Omaha Beach. With much effort, and lost life, they get off the beach, traveling deep into French territory. The German military, due to arrogance, ignorance and a sleeping Adolf Hitler, delay their response to the Allied landing, with crippling results.",

            "content": "The events of D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view is the focus of the film. \n\nThe day after the film opened at the Warner Theatre in New York City, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times declared: \"The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and colored by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, sad ... It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war as this one does\". Variety described it as \"a solid and stunning war epic\" that \"emerges as a sort of grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary concerning the overall logistics needed for this incredible invasion\". Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called it \"a tingling, eye-gripping, fantastic picture\" that \"must rank as the screen's most massive battle epic\". His only criticism was \"the lack of perspective in depicting the German belief that the Normandy landings might not have succeeded had Hitler not taken a sleeping pill ... 'The Longest Day' should have taken infinitely more care to put this German belief, however strongly held, into proper proportion\". Brendan Gill of The New Yorker called the film \"a tour de force of audio-visual verisimilitude,\" but confessed that \"my emotions were hardly ever engaged, and I ended, rather to my embarrassment, by being bored\". He went on, \"Mr. Zanuck made it all the harder for me to take this mock-documentary seriously by stuffing it with innumerable celebrated actors, most of whom make such fugitive appearances that the audience finds itself engaged in a distracting game of instant identification\". The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, \"The Longest Day is a monument split down the middle by compromise. At its best, what comes across very strongly is the feeling of immense and careful organisation that went into the whole D-Day operation, the sheer crippling weight of noise, the simple fact that a lot of people died, and the sense of personal confusion and dismay of soldiers wandering alone through the countryside ... But the film is, first and foremost, a spectacle, and therefore it has stars\u2014a multitude of them, often with barely a line to speak, and usually with no real part to play\".\n\nThis American epic war film, shot in black and white is based on Cornelius Ryan's 1959 non-fiction book of the same name about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944. This WWII film is a masterpiece in so many ways being made in 1962. Fantastic battle sequences set in Normandie and other real places, an amazing ensemble cast including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Steve Forrest, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Jeffrey Hunter, Rod Steiger, Gert Fr\u00f6be, Curd J\u00fcrgens, George Segal, Robert Wagner, Paul Anka etc, the different languages are intact in the film which is a big plus, great cinematography (the helicopter shots in the end of the film is fantastic) and with a general epic look and feel. The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three others. Twentieth Century-Fox was taking a gamble making this movie. At $10 million, it was a hugely daring venture, but even more risky was Cleopatra (1963), which was being filmed concurrently. This was to set Fox back the then unprecedented sum of $40 million. Although \"Cleopatra \" did well at the box office, it was simply too expensive to recoup its costs, and nearly bankrupted the studio. Fortunately, this movie turned out to be one of Fox's biggest hits and helped offset the financial damage caused by the other epic.\n\nTrivia: When cost overruns on Cleopatra (1963) threatened to force Twentieth Century-Fox to shut down production of this movie, producer Darryl F. Zanuck flew to New York City to save his project. After an impassioned speech to Fox's board, he regained control of the company he founded, ultimately finishing this movie and getting the production of \"Cleopatra\" under control. After he had spent the budgeted amount for \"The Longest Day\", he started using his own money to pay for the production. To create a more sympathetic stance to each of the different parties, producer Darryl F. Zanuck had Englishman Ken Annakin direct the British segments, the American parts were handled by American action specialist Andrew Marton, and German Bernhard Wicki took care of the scenes with the German Army officers. The film employed several Axis and Allied military consultants who had been actual participants on D-Day, and many had their roles re-enacted in the film.",

The black and white is very effective. Henry Fonda and Robert Mitchum are great. John Wayne does a good job as his normal self.  Sean Connery has a nice little part. Peter Lawford, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowell, Richard Burton all have some good scenes.   Jeffery Hunter is particularly effective as a grunt who is forced into a heroic act.  The only negative, is 40 year old Red Buttons very poorly cast as a 20ish paratrooper who is in for some hammy comedy relief. That aside the movie does an excellent job showing the scope of the invasion and the confusion that ran rampant.  Very highly recommended!",

While the story is relatively cohesive and the individual characters solid, The Longest Day is still, at its core, the victim of an incredibly outdated interpretation of the epic film: throwing 500 characters at the audience with a slight wafting of screen time each, such that you can hardly remember most of them. Throwing subtitles with names as if the audience could differentiate after a three hour run time is laughable, but the phenomenon is mitigated by the fact that most simply disappear from the narrative at some point.

            "content": "The war epic is a difficult genre to nail down as they tend to go in one of two different directions with bold anti-war art films like Apocalypse Now (1979) and mainstream films that glorify war like Patton (1970). This film falls into the second category as it is packed with stars, including John Wayne of the infamous The Green Berets (1968), and is heavy on the patriotism and light on the commentary on the damaging effects that war can have. With it's all male cast and almost three hour running time this film felt like a chore to watch and that meant that I was struggling to stay awake.\n\nThe film follows the French, Americans, British and Germans as they prepare for D-Day and attempt to set up their troops so that they can defeat enemy forces in battle. The men face off on the battlefield and the Allies prevail with their victory serving as a testament to patriotism and the intelligence of their commanders.\n\nWhat takes you out of the film while also providing some interest amid the dreary discussions of battle strategy was the neverending parade of stars who pop up to play various significant historical figures. The issue is that we get so little time with them that it is hard to dissociate them from their public personas and believe them as men going into battle. With movie stars it does take a while to relax in their presence and begin to treat them not as the tabloid fodder we know them as but as whatever character they happen to be playing. When Sean Connery arrives on the beach in Normandy and announces that he is Irish despite having a thick Scottish accent we are aware that this is the man who has become famous playing James Bond and do not empathize with the very real dangers his character will face. It does not help that some of the performances in the film are truly awful with Wayne phoning it in by relying too much on his iconic voice and stature. Only Robert Mitchum and Henry Fonda deliver sensitive, natural performances as lifelong military men wary of facing off against such a well organized army. Whatever the various directors of the film were doing they certainly weren't focused on coaxing good performances out of their cast and seemed to be happy to let them rest on their laurels.\n\nThe many different directors who had a hand in shaping this film also make it feel uneven and disjointed as much like How the West Was Won (1963) the film is episodic to the extreme. Yet it does not have the fun of that film as each section is full of clich\u00e9s of the genre and the scenes of warfare quickly become monotonous. I felt only horror when the film wanted me to feel some deep sense of pride at the sight of young boys losing their lives at the hands of other men. The film never touches on the horrific actions that the Nazis are taking and most of the characters are driven by bloodlust and a vague sense of patriotism that is never entirely validated by the film. For the time the aerial sequences were probably impressive from a technical standpoint and the film did earn nominations in a lot of technical categories at the Academy Awards. Today, however most of the film's achievements have been eclipsed by later films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) leaving an empty film with little emotional appeal.\n\nThose who like this sort of big, jingoistic spectacle may take to the film but for a person like myself who does not see how anybody could love war and cannot stand watching it held up as something to marvel at it will disappoint. Going in, I had fairly low expectations but I did not expect the film to be quite so hard to get through. There needed to be something in the film that did not target specifically male audiences who thrill at the sight of violence and good old boys triumphing through use of weaponry. The film had a very narrow target audience and that audience happened to fit the demographic of most Academy members.",

Many of the exteriors toward the beginning I can now plainly see as composited. Much of the dialog is \"shouty\" as in live theater. Interpersonal exchange lacks intimacy. Though Richard Burton is alaways a pleasure, just to hear him speak. He keeps the director (there appear to be 4) under control. \"Realism\" has today moved on. In this movie, the sets are too clean, the language unrealistically puritan. I didn't make it through the movie this go-around. ",

            "content": "An overindulgent war epic.\n\nThe Longest Day is massive and lengthy as its name implies. It is probably about a half hour too long. The story itself is rather disjointed. We get almost 2 hours of context and introductions before the invasion, then all the action feels endless. The excessive number of leads and extras leads to you zoning out and not focusing in one the characters, but rather the events as a whole. The Longest Day does an incredible job giving you all the details of this historic conflict, but it feels like far too much. The editing is all over the place, randomly cutting from person to person, often with no regard to the audience trying to keep track of all these men. It's actually too much of a good thing.\n\nThe Longest Day can boast its meticulous recreation of D-Day's battles on the beaches of Normandy and in the towns of France, but they go on forever with everyone just going through the motions.\n\nThe acting is hit or miss. With such a large cast of famous actors, every few moments you'll be saying, \"oh, it's that guy!\" but their actual performances leave much to be desired. The Longest Day has an all star cast of legendary figures in cinema, but wastes most of them on bit parts and supporting roles. I cannot even remember most of their lines or moments.\n\nThe action is exciting, if long winded. The mini models still look neat, but the on location stuff is still excellent. The occasional green screen looks terrible and fake now. The military outfits look period accurate. The sets are massive as the battles themselves. The Longest Day is certainly a large production.\n\nOverall, The Longest Day is worth a watch as a piece of film history wherein every major movie star of the day (1962) got a small role. It's massive battles rival any war film's efforts, but the movie is bogged down with too much exposition with no feeling, constant switching of characters, bad green screen backgrounds, mediocre acting, and aimless plot. I still think The Longest Day is an enjoyable, yet flawed movie all the same.",

We are bounced around so frequently, that after awhile I barely even read the names on the screen because I knew I\u0092d never remember any of them.  In many ways that first act felt like an actual history lesson where we are expected to memorize dozens of notable names, titles, and other information because we\u0092ll be quizzed on it later.  I observed the accent and the uniform to figure out whose side they were on and figured that was enough for me to get by.  Once the actual battle starts it is almost non-stop war sequences.  There are a few breaks where we are sent back to the command posts to find out what\u0092s going on with the high-ranking officials, but then it\u0092s back into the trenches.  The scope of some of these battle scenes is quite impressive.  There were a number of brilliantly executed shots, and I always felt like I knew who was on what side in any given battle sequence.  The Longest Day also includes a host of famous actors who I recognized, even if I didn\u0092t know who they were playing.  Unfortunately, with such a massive host of characters, I wasn\u0092t able to connect with any of them, unless I happened to recognize the actor as someone I like.  So Richard Burton\u0092s scene is a little more poignant, not because of the way it is told, but just because I think he\u0092s a superb actor.  A little more focus on smaller details, and a little less emphasis on the grand scope would have helped this film a lot.  As it stands, I find it to be just an average war film without much to say.",

The black and white cinematography looks great, and the battle scenes are truly stunning. The film was one of the most real-feeling WWII films I've seen (despite the total lack of blood) due to the screenplay's exacting dedication to showing what preparations were made for the battle, and all the flubs and mistakes made that changed the course of the day. We all know how things ended up, but it was interesting to see what plans were being made on all sides and how each one panned out. The performances are well done, although there is not any stand outs since you generally never focus on one character for very long. My only complaint about this film is one of its strengths, that while we do get to see all sorts of characters and sides of the battle it makes it hard to latch on to any characters. I felt that even considering all the material they had to pack in that it certainly could have been cut down by about half an hour. This is by far one of the most impressive war films you could ever see, and it will give you a new sense of appreciation and gratitude for the astonishing courage these men had on that day.",

            "content": "The Longest Day (1962), directed by Darryl Zanuck is the forerunner of the big-budget war movie, with  one of the largest, most star-studded casts ever assembled, including John Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Paul Anka, and Eddie Albert, to name just a few of the forty cast members. \n\nWhat makes The Longest Day significant is how it became a model for the war movies that followed, such as Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and even 2015's critically-acclaimed Fury, but what makes this film great is its attention to history. The film details events leading up to the capture of a key German-held bridge during WWII, dubbed by the British as \"Pegasus Bridge.\" The assault is led by Richard Todd's Major John Howard, a man who actually had fought at the Battle of Pegasus Bridge. Also, the film shows French Resistance fighters being air dropped into Normandy, three days before the famous American landing on D-Day, a historically correct and significant event that is often forgotten and not widely known, as well as a depiction of the scaling of the sea cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc at Normandy by Joseph Lowe who, 17 years earlier, had scaled the same cliffs as a member of 505th Army Division. \n\nWhile this film was probably spectacular by the standards of 1962, the grandeur of the spectacle will not disappoint modern audiences. The battle scenes in this movie are fantastic for their time; the film used an actual army division as stand-ins for the Omaha Beach landing, as well as two working and historically accurate battleships: the Springfield and the Little Rock. The amount of explosions in this movie make it impressive even by today's standards, but with a movie budget of 7.4 million ($57,920,293.33 in 2015 dollars), they sure could afford it. This movie was the most expensive black and white movie made until 1993, and I'd say they budgeted very well; there was a lot put into this movie and it shows. \n\nThis movie is a must see to any history buff or war movie lover.",

Featuring John Wayne, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Red Buttons, Henry Fonda, and Roddy McDowall (just to name a few), the ensemble cast that's been assembled is incredible.  However, there's a bit of jingoism going on, as the Nazi's are shown mostly as incompetent and the American/British forces are selfless and brave.  There's also very little blood and carnage; which is indicative of the time in which the film was made.  Still, the coverage of the various battle fronts on the land and sea is comprehensive, and gives a sense of scope to how massive the operation was.

            "content": "The Longest Day is nothing short of a war classic, and it stands out from so many other films of its genre and time for several reasons.\nIn terms of plot, story execution and the presence of an ensemble cast, The Longest Day is clearly very I influential of the later epic war masterpiece A Bridge Too Far, yet The Longest Day isn't nearly as confusing or repetitive. As it goes through the complex development of June 6, 1944, The Longest Day ensures that all it's dramatic plot dynamics are in order and making sense, and from a technical standpoint it honestly feels ahead of its time.\nBy that I mean the cinematography is absolutely astounding. It gets up close with the characters when the dramatic tension is building within them, and it follows them well when they move through battle. It tracks them perfectly and always manages to get the perfect quantity of elements into perspective. The cinematography in The Longest Day is some of the finest I've seen in a war film ever, and it's some of the finest use of the tracking shot technique in existence as well, definitely worthy of the Academy Award it was victorious of.\nThe Longest Day is heroic but it always feels real since it touches on the intense and damaging effect of the battle in the same manner that Saving Private Ryan did decades later while covering the more human side of the soldiers the same way that The Big Red One did. It's production design is impeccable and it feels really humane, touching on both sides of the war from each perspective and pointing to the middle man in the situation too. For a John Wayne film, it isn't right wing propaganda. It's a spectacular war epic with strong drama and entertaining action which makes it a powerful visual experience which hits the viewer pretty strongly. And with the directional efforts of Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald and Darryl F. Zanuck all collaborating, The Longest Day truly had an epic production to match its epic scale which makes it a powerful all around. It tells its story very well and it never comes up short, and with a well written script and a talented cast it proves great.\nThe standouts of its ensemble cast begins with John Wayne, because despite being more familiar for his patriotic western efforts he breaks into the cast of The Longest Day without skipping a heartbeat and delivers a commanding patriotic charisma which makes him perfectly dominant for the lead part.\nHenry Fonda also makes a great splash in his brief role on screen by putting in fine line delivery and facial gestures with a real spirit in them.\nRobert Mitchum also manages to dominate the screen when on it in a likeable manner since he conveys the role of a military hero worth following as a leader without glamourising the role. He gets it just right.\nSean Connery of course is a real genial presence because his natural Scottish Charm makes him an exceptional action hero like it did when he played James Bond.\nRichard Burton was good too and Eddie Albert really nailed the dramatic heft of his character.\nRoddy McDowall was also good early on in his career.\n\nSo The Longest Day is surely a war classic, an action classic and a cinematic classic in general.",

The Longest Day pulls no punches, and shows the viewers not just the Airborne Operations and Beach Landings, but the strategy and planning that went into Operation Overlord. Such as British troops using \"dummy\" solders to confuse the German troops and the Allied high command contacting the French resistance to cripple German communications and transportation. Everything we take for granted about war movies nowadays such, Military and Historical advisors was started by this film. Another one the films main strengths is not showing the German Officers in France as mostahce twirling stero-types but as solders following orders, much like their allied counter-parts.  Something that very few movies about World War 2 have done since. Along with an A-List cast, including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Sean Connery to name just some of the star power behind this gem of the silver screen, The Longest Day cements itself as a true landmark film in an era when movies about World War 2 where being used as propaganda films to get young men to join the armed forces. However the movie is a bit long, and despite the fact the I recomend it highly. If your'e looking for a action packed war flick filled with blood, guts, and explosions you might be better off watching Saving Private Ryan because The Longest Day is a for a very niche market nowadays if you like history then is movie is for you, but if you just want action, action, and more action then you'll most likely find first half of the movie a more than a little boring. Which is sad because most modern movie goers just want to see an action packed blockbuster rather than something historically sound. But I digress The Longest Day is a film that I do recomend very highly, not just for the history behind this flick but because it makes the viewer thankful that there where and still are people ready to stand against tyranny.\n\nIf wen't for them I would probably writing this review with a different tone, and I would be writing this review in German.",

One that shows the Germans' perspective, for which they demonstrate some concern, but are also fairly positive that they can resist this takedown. Another perspective by the French, for which Normandy is obviously located, shows their worry of the overall operations. Then, there is the one of the English, who is closely associated with the United States in their operations. Finally, the United States' point of view, for which we find most of the all-star cast, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, and many, many other stars. They enter Normandy with leadership conflict, fear, and enthusiasm. Despite its length, the movie is compelling from start to finish. One of its assets is the fact that sections revolving both the Germans and French personnel are in their respective language with English subtitles, rather than just in English. As well, we also get all these perspectives as the film unfolds and the beginning of the movie does not start out with the American perspective, but the German. The battle scenes are also very good. Could have been potentially bad, as it is around 50 years old, but ended being really well done.",

            "content": "A day with this film on has got to be the longest day. Don't get me wrong, I love a good war movie, and almost all of these films' long lengths work, but seriously people, I don't know how many times we have to watch people walk around and blow each other up here and there for three hours. One can only imagine how long the war film that actually covers the highlight of an entire war would be. If it's just highlights, then it would probably be shorter, because these war films that we do actually have run about the span of an entire war. Hey, if that's the case, then hand me my rifle and send me back to the trenches, because I'm hooked on the thrills of war... movies. I don't know why I would need a rifle; maybe it would just be for my suicide plan, just in case the war movie they show is \"The Thin Red Line\", because although I liked the film, well, seriously Terrence, that's too much of a snoozefest... I said having made plans to watch the film a third time somewhere down the \"line\" (Sorry, but pun definately intended). Still, even though that film was a mess, it's still certainly better than this film, which isn't to say that this film is bad, though it is to say that it is more of a mess.\r\n\r\nRunning 178 minutes with limited material, padding with superfluous, excess material is to be expected, yet padding is least of this film's worries when it comes to tightness, even though you know that they would have pump an extra large dose of excess material in this film to even out the many rushed spots. With all of these many subplots and characters in this massive, star-studden cast, few, if any are developed, and almost all of them are rushed past points of exposition at one point or another. Actually, come to think of it, nevermind the few in \"few, if any\", because if they were to extensively develop one subplot, then they'd pretty much be setting up everyone's, seeing as these stories are all so very similiar, with only enough distinctions for you be thrown off when the stories transition into each other jarringly. Still, what might bother me the most about this film is that it's just so slow, quiet and dry in atmosphere, lacking enough of the oomph and intrigue in the substance to sustain your attention for the mammoth runtime. It's all so very messy, underwhelming and borderline boring, with ambitions going squandered in many regards, and that's enough to make a film like this mediocre, at best. However, this is an ultimately better film than that, and I'm not just saying that because I keep believing in the immortal concept of \"Three hours, I better like it\". The film leans closer to failed ambition and successful, but the film knows how to pick the right compontents to supplement that ambition to where every slip up finds its fall broken, whether it be through the writing or production.\r\n\r\nFor the time, this action was something to behold, and to this day, it remains impressive, because it's during those moments where this ensemble of directors really wake up and deliver on tension and thrills by manipulating the dynamic staging of the action, as well as the fine production designs and handsome cinematography to produce classic action composed of both style and substance that manages to hold up today. Of course, although this film is so much D-Day, the story substance remains more prominent, and if you're story is going to be overlong and messily-executed, it still better be a worthy one. Well, sure enough, this script, while plagued, is extremely original in its concept of multiple story angles in the midst of war alone. Still, that's not the only inventive concept within this story, because where most war epics tell us of the tales on the battlefield, and almost always the American side of it, this film explores the sidelines, studying on the verbal tension that determines most every battle and stage during wartime, and does it all while showing us every side of the battlefield, without bias and with intellegence, which isn't to say that you don't get plenty of intimacy with the poor suckers going out there to die for their country. I really wish that the story was used to its full potential, yet it's still very worthy and inventive, and if you see this film for no other reason, see it for its refreshing concepts, if not its using a star-studded cast of classic actors, for the most part, to good use. From John Wayne - who's playing himself again, but still doing is pretty well - to Sean Connery - who showed up... somewhere -, the film is pumped with star after star and they all charm, if not impress a little bit here and there. The cast is broad and colorful, showing you why most every person in it was then or went on the be the classic stars that they are today, and while the massive cast seems to further bloat the film out of proportions, they also serves as key components to its ultimately being generally watchable, through all of its many faults.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the indeed long day, expected padding plagues the film, though not as much a rushed moments that dilute exposition, as well as the compellingness already tainted by dry storytelling, yet what raises this film well above its potential mediocrity is its sharp production, worthy and highly unconventional storyline, as well as a massive cast of across-the-board charmers or classic stars, ultimately leaving \"The Longest Day\" a fairly watchable dramatisation of D-Day, both on and off the battlefield and American grounds.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

The film tells who is who and what location is what with facts and some fictional stuff. We see commandoes of all sides making the preparation of the attack and defense. Heck, we even go underground the French resistance is at. This entire prelude leads up to the invasion where we go from the beaches (yes, Omaha included) to the paratroopers doing the leap of faith.

With a slew of big names including Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, and the Duke himself, whose character broke his ankle landing and told the medic to put his boot back on real tight, has to be one of the best John Wayne scenes I have seen.

Quite long but more accurate than say \"Saving Private Ryan\" since it's not just the Americans that went into that particualr battle but other countries as well, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Poland, Norway, Greece, Poland and the United States!   Like Oscar winner \"The Hurt Locker\", theirs no storyline to describe but just to state one of histories longest battles!  Another one of the highlights are the appearances of several well known actors including Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, singer Paul Anka, to name a few!   My only beef is that their is more talking than action!\r\n\r\nWon 2 Oscars out of 5 including \"Best Cinamatography Black and White\" and \"Special Effects\"\r\n\r\n3 out of 4",

The cast features John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitcham, Sean Connery and teen-star Fabian.  All of these individuals give memorable performances. The most significant performance comes from John Wayne, who is the commander of the 82nd Airborne. The epic story is large in scope, however, flows according to the events of the day. The viewer feels for each individual and their contributions to the D-Day Invasion as well as the frustration of the German invaders in being unable to stop the Allies because of Hitler's decisions. The film is both entertaining and educational. The filmmaking was extremely excellent for it's time. It featured several special effects and excellent aerial and crane shots, which were rare for the time. The thing that is lacking in this film is the realism found in other films. It is occasionally \"cheesy'\" and \"gung ho\" but it is a film of its time. The film is extremely long. It does encompass entire day, the \"longest\" day. The length of the film may affect the patience of the viewer.",

            "content": "Without question this is one of the greatest movies about World War II ever made. At 3 hours long, it is also possibly one of the longest however, the structure of the movie means it never gets dull to watch.\nThe story of the D-Day landings is told as a series of short tales involving set piece action or back office continuity so that as the movie unfolds, the viewer can keep a handle on the progress of the battle. Interwoven between these brief stories, are longer threads dealing with more involved plot development.\nThe cast reads like a 'Who's Who?' of the acting profession in the early 60s with appearances from Richard Todd, George Segal, Richard Burton, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Leslie Philips, Henry Fonda, Roddie McDowall, Gert Fr\u00c3\u00b6be, Rod Steiger to name but a few. Both Robert Mitchum (playing a typical cigar chewin' General) and John Wayne have longer threads throughout the movie and i suppose could be called the leading characters but this really is a true company piece and it is amazing how even with the briefest of appearances the tales of the soldiers and individuals become etched into the memory. You really do care about these people and their plight thanks to a masterful script and brilliant direction.\nI've seen this film many times and some scenes have stuck with me. In particular, Red Buttons as the hapless parachutist who becomes entangled on a church spire and can only watch as the rest of his squad are shot down as they miss their allotted landing zone due to an error. Also, the jubilant French civilian greeting the British forces with a bottle of champagne on the beach or the female resistance fighter grappling with a Nazi soldier to try to prevent him raising the alarm that a railway line is about to be blown up.\nThis film doesn't focus on any one particular aspect of the landings but tries to tell the broader picture. As such, it involves the navy, army and airforce of the Allied Forces. What was almost revolutionary at the time was it also bought in the stories of the German soldiers and their commanding officers, dealing with some of them in an atypically sensitive manner. Indeed, you feel as much empathy and sympathy for the German soldiers shot by an American soldier because he doesn't understand they are trying to surrender as you do for the Allied soldiers gunned down on the beaches.\nThis is a masterful piece of cinema that has stood the test of time very well indeed.",

Today's viewer, however, may not find its kudos entirely earned/deserved. Well recommended are the battle-recreation scenes, some vast/wide, some quite up-close and personal. This is the content that makes the film truly epic - and fast-tracked the film to Blu-Ray. \n\nAppropriately Cinemascope, but why Zanuck shot in B&W is anyone's guess. \n\nThe viewer's also rewarded through the film's ensembling of nearly 100 first-tier and second-tier actors. Even a few 1960s teen-idols were thrown in for good measure. Few films offer as many brief glimpses of mid-Century talent as this. \n\nThere's a grand illusion of content accuracy - subtitling continuously yields the names of who's-doing-what, information sourced from the heavily-researched underlying 1959 novel - shooting's on historical and/or authentic locations - and the story's told in a fair, balanced perspective from all sides of the conflict, generally using ethnically-correct actors and languages. \n\nWhen it comes to dialogue and characterization, however, there's mostly heavy fictionalization intended to facilitate American flag-waving and cheat-beating. The time's long gone by when a viewer will be awe-struck in admiration by hearing John Wayne stupidly demand mid-battle that death be risked to respectfully cut dead paratroopers down out of the trees. Or by Peter Lawford ordering his bag-piper to strike up while the Scots march along standing straight and in-the-open under fire. \n\nWith that sort of content, the film does drag along, and it comes in long at three hours. \n\nStill, it's recommended for its battle-scene visuals and look-sees over a ton of mid-Century talent.",

The war just happens to an extraordinary challenge to the outcome of our real plot, an un-natural threat to our happy couple, or a crucible of fire for our heroes to get their issues sorted out, and a gigantic classroom to teach our characters the True Meaning of (loyalty/sacrifice/humanity/equality/justice ... whatever)\r\n\r\nThe Longest Day is one of the very rare movies that actually thinks that a part of World War II (The D-Day invasion)  makes for a good story in and of itself. And it does. Almost every major character is an historical personage, and can generally be divided into two types of characters - the generals who give orders and worry about their men, and the soldiers who execute orders and hope to live through it.\r\n\r\nComparisons between this and Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan are, I suppose inevitable, and the verisimilitude of The Longest Day suffers a little from it's many deaths being bloodless. (one particular shot is when a US paratrooper comes under fire from a heavy weapon --- which causes nothing by teeny tiny firecrackers to pop on his vest).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, for all out strategy and tactics, TLD provides a much better presentation of the assault on D-Day, not just on Omaha beach, but Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword as well.

            "content": "A lengthy look (almost 3 hours) from both sides on this historic day. It lacks the realism of Saving Private Ryan but showed more detail of the various assaults such as the one on the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. Some curious filmmaking can be seen, such as an abrupt cut by the seaside when a character is in the scene and then the scene changes to the same background without the character. I like how the characters spoke in their native languages, and the film being black and white I think helped enhance the realism.",

The arial photography of pitched battles on beaches and in towns is alone worth the price of admission, along with the sheer scale of many of the battle scenes, but there are also several set pieces which really manage to hit an emotional mark and highlight the futility of war. Lots of fun to be had picking all of the famous faces on board too.",
