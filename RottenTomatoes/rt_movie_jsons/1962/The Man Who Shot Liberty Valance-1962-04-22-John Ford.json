    "summary": "Questions arise when Senator Stoddard (James Stewart) attends the funeral of a local man named Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) in a small Western town. Flashing back, we learn Doniphon saved Stoddard, then a lawyer, when he was roughed up by a crew of outlaws terrorizing the town, led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). As the territory's safety hung in the balance, Doniphon and Stoddard, two of the only people standing up to him, proved to be very important, but different, foes to Valance.",

A bit short in the political correctness category but still has plenty of lesson to convey and course one must remember the film is 60 years old. A great cast makes for a seamless story for this self admitted easy to satisfy film critic. Interesting that the movie inspired Burt Bacharach to write a song by the same title that Gene Pitney made into a hit.",

I had been as deeply moved by it as I had by any film, let alone those restricted to the Western genre. I wasn't ready yet to reflect on the depth of my experience. I had seen a movie which had functioned perfectly at both intellectual and emotional levels; serving both to entertain and to offer a profoundly deep philosophical perspective on the dividing line between civilization and savagery; diplomacy and the law of the gun. The film is perfectly cast and immaculately executed; it is bittersweet, poignant, intelligent, and profound. It has the strengths of the emotionally distilled qualities of the Western format while also leaving us pondering its intellectual implications in a fashion reminiscent of the most profound moral philosophies. It draws a line in the sand which challenges us to examine the tenuous nature of civilization while simultaneously engaging us at the more direct level of fulfilling entertainment that most film-viewers crave. It is more than a Western, it is an awe-inspiring testament. It ranks among my all-time favorite Westerns, and is surely an masterpiece to be cherished.",

James Stewart plays a Senator who returns to his old town to honor a citizen (John Wayne) who has just passed away.

The film looks at honor among those living in the wild west, and how violence solved the problems of the day.    More importantly it looks at  how history remembers events and how it often embraces the better story over the facts.  The facts aren't really surprising, but the film is bold in its cynicism.",

I assume this is why this film felt like it was offering something deeper than most of the westerns I've experienced.\n\nThe casting here was flawless, with Wayne, Stewart, and Marvin embodying roles that I now can't imagine anyone better for.

            "content": "Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they pay their respects, local newspaper editor Maxwell Scott asks Stoddard why a United States senator would make the long journey from Washington to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years. Upon entering the territory as a young attorney, Ranse is beaten and robbed by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Tom Doniphon finds Ranse and takes him to Shinbone. Ranse's wounds are treated by Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, and others, who explain to him that Valance terrorizes the residents, and the town's Marshal Appleyard is powerless to stop him. Tom is the only man who stands up to Valance, stating that force is all Valance understands. Ranse is determined that law and justice can prevail over Valance; however, Ranse begins practicing with a gun. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom advises Ranse of Valance's trickery. Tom also makes sure Ranse understands Hallie is Tom's girl by showing renovations to his ranch house are intended for his marriage to her. Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the statehood convention at the territorial capital. Ranse and Dutton Peabody, the local newspaper editor, are elected, despite Valance and his gang's attempt to bully the residents into nominating him in order to represent the cattle barons. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines...\n\nLiberty Valance was released in April 1962, and achieved both financial and critical success. Produced for $3.2 million, it grossed $8 million, making it the 15th-highest grossing film of 1962. Edith Head's costumes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design (black-and-white), one of the few Westerns ever nominated in that category. Contemporary reviews were generally positive, although a number of critics thought the final act was a letdown. Variety called the film \"entertaining and emotionally involving,\" but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, \"it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,\" instead of concluding with \"condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes. What should have been left to enthrall the imagination is spelled out until there is nothing left to savor or discuss.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin agreed, lamenting that the \"final anticlimactic 20 minutes ... all but destroy the value of the disarming simplicity and natural warmth which are Ford's everlasting stock-in-trade.\" Despite this, the review maintained that the film \"has more than enough gusto to see it through,\" and that Ford had \"lost none of his talent for catching the real heart, humor and violent flavor of the Old West in spite of the notable rustiness of his technique.\" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that \"Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here,\" but opined that the film \"bogs down\" once Stoddard becomes famous, en route to \"an obvious, overlong, and garrulous anticlimax.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"a leisurely yarn boasting fine performances,\" but was bothered by \"the incredulous fact that the lively townsfolk of Shinbone didn't polish off Valence [sic] for themselves. On TV he would have been dispatched by the second commercial and the villainy would have passed to some shadowy employer, some ruthless rancher who didn't want statehood.\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Director Ford is guilty of a few lengthy, slow periods in his story-telling, but for the most part the old, reliable Ford touches are there.\" Harrison's Reports gave the film a grade of \"Very Good\", but Brendan Gill of The New Yorker was negative and called it \"a parody of Mr. Ford's best work.\" More recent assessments have been more uniformly positive. The film is considered one of Ford's best, and in one poll, ranked with The Searchers and The Shootist as one of Wayne's best Westerns.\n\nThis John Ford classic is somewhat a bit too talkative if you ask me and yet again I think James Stewart is paired with a much stronger actor, in this case John Wayne, within the western genre. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" becomes more of a James Stewart drama than a John Wayne western. It´s nicely shot, it contains of many great scenes and Lee Marvin is as evil as only he could be. Rest in peace Lee. But, it´s not enough in my book. There´s something that doesn´t make ends meet for me at least. And I don´t think it´s John Ford´s best movie as some claim.",

            "content": "A pensive Western on what progress requires of men.\n\nJohn Ford directs what is arguably his finest Western drama The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). It's gripping with serious gunshots and men standing up to vicious bullies and robbers. I was also surprised at how funny and lighthearted much of Liberty Valance is with plenty of comedy relief. This is also Ford's most explicitly political film as he demonstrates through the use of an ethical lawyer the moral imperative of voting in the democratic process.\n\nJames Stewart is fascinating as the lead Ransom Stoddard with his guffawing at Western violence and stalwart upholding of democratic ideals. He has nice chemistry with the lovely Vera Miles' country girl desiring real love Hallie Stoddard. Her earnest fondness for quiet country life is matched by her joyful spirit over learning to read. John Wayne doesn't waste a second of screen time as the quickdraw master and rancher Tom Doniphon. His tough guy persona feels more heroic and realistic than ever before in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. There's some hilarious back and forth between Stewart and Wayne.\n\nLee Marvin is phenomenal as the brutal villain Liberty Valance. Marvin's deep booming voice rages against the law and decency with his visceral silver whipping, rapid fire shooting, and fearsome snarls and insults. You've never seen Lee Marvin this scary before for sure. Alongside Marvin's terrifying Liberty Valance is Lee Van Cleef's surly henchman Reese appearing out of the dark to scare Edmond O'Brien in one of John Ford's best shots ever. Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine are hilarious in supporting roles I will not spoil. John Carradine cameos at the end with a flurry of flowery Southern gentleman speeches full of lies and political spin. The entire cast is just amazing in hindsight.\n\nDorothy M. Johnson's story lets you see how a strictly moral man may be led down the path of violence to convince the violent of the way to progress. She also tells her tale about unsung heroes and how we perceive the past. The Man Who Liberty Valance remains a brilliant example of the power of Westerns.\n\nJohn Ford's direction is all about misdirecting the audience about the meaning of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. His heavy use of black and white camera tricks, silhouettes, and shadowplay still looks striking today. His compelling and visceral, creative direction lead Ford's narrative on conveying the range of toughness required for both gunslinging as well as legal upheaval to bright heights.\n\nWilliam H. Clothier and Carl Manoogian's cinematography uses bursts of white light to guide all the shrouded darkness of the old West. Their black and white cinematography features heavy use of shocked gritty faces in stellar close-up shots and perfectly framed wide shots to see all the action. Liberty Valance has this slick stark look that appears like its a film noir with Ford's iconic Western style.\n\nOtho Lovering's editing is super sharp with hard cuts all over Liberty Valance. He keeps Ford reigned into a swiftly paced 123 minutes. Farciot Edouart's visual effects are dazzling from gunfire to shattering glass and much more. Cyril J. Mockridge and Irvin Talbot compose a killer Western score with exciting swells of symphonic danger, helping the feeling that anyone can get hurt or killed in the wild West without the law being enforced. Edith Head's costumes are very cool from Jimmy Stewart's proper suits, John Wayne's cowboy classic look, and especially Lee Marvin's wicked rogue aesthetic.\n\nIn conclusion, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance must be seen by all fans of Westerns as it features some of James Stewart, Lee Marvin, John Wayne, and Vera Miles' best acting alongside John Ford's best direction.",

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance should have been made at least a decade before it was. Many of the supporting characters are there for comic relief and are extremely exaggerated, something that fit better in a ‘30s adventure like Stagecoach than it does in a ‘60s drama like this, and the political and societal aspects of the plot often make it feel like Mr. Smith Goes To the West and Then To Washington. Unfortunately, Jimmy Stewart isn't as young as he was in 1939 and struggles to be entirely believable as a young up and comer, but he still delivers a compelling performance alongside John Wayne at his most heroic and cynical, although not young enough for his part either. However, it wouldn't have worked with any other actors as the characters of Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon seem made for Stewart and Wayne respectively. The story is powerful as well, telling of a man who gives up his girlfriend, the spotlight, and credit for his action to a man he believes is more capable and deserving. The film combines the pensiveness of The Searchers and the tenderness of My Darling Clementine, a feature that suggests John Ford did need to wait until 1962 to make this film in order to allow these ideas time to fully evolve. Even so, and unlike the two previously mentioned films which very much fit their decades, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance feels out of place, like a newer movie (for the time) dressed up to look old or an older one made to feel new, not unlike Jimmy Stewart playing younger and older versions of his character.",

I like that he was playing the straight-laced lawyer who wasnt the type to fit in amongst all the rough frontier folks. And it made sense that over time his charm and honest nature won over the townspeople. John Wayne offers a great contrast to Stewart, and I was surprised how well they played off one another. I wasnt the biggest fan of John Wayne going into this movie, but I thought he perfectly fit this role. And they are just the two leads but there were also good performances from the supporting people including Vera Miles, Andy Devine, and especially Lee Marvin. \n\nIm not exactly an expert in the Western genre, but I could basically predict what was going to happen from one scene to the next in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. It latches onto a number of familiar plot devices, although Im willing to bet this movie did it first, I just know it from derivative stories. And thats not to suggest anything that this movie does is bad or uninteresting. I get quite involved in stories like this, because we have such a clear-cut villain against admirable protagonists. I like the way the story is laid out, and even the framing device works for me, because it somehow adds emotional weight to the end of the story after we know all that happened before. \n\nThere was a romance subplot as well in the film, that could have been a pointless distraction, but I didnt mind because of how well it was handled. Most of it was understated as they trusted the viewer to know what was actually going on. I thought it was intelligent storytelling and thats not something you get all the time, especially not nowadays. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that one could easily pigeonhole into the genre of Western, which has never been my favorite, but it has elements of a character drama and even feels a little like a biopic (thats how realistic they made it all seem.) There were some small elements that didnt click for me in this film, but in general I loved it.",

That always seems to be the case in these old Western movies. Everyone just seems to get along with there co stars. This marshall is such a useless fat bodied yellow belly. That diner scene with Liberty Valance really shows how malicious of a person he is and how much I'd like to see him get his ass beat. \n\nIt's interesting seeing the difference between how Ransom the attorney lives and carries himself as oppose to how Tom and the town carry themselves. Liberty Valance is so extra! He's like that one jock bully in school who's dad never loved him lmao! Sometimes you just got to settle things on your own terms and say fuck what the law says. I'm glad Ransom did what he did. \n\nThat Langhorne, what a gimmick having the horse come on stage and the lasso. Ugh. That was a good unexpected turn. Wow, Ransom basically owes it all to Tom for all his success. It's crazy how the guy who gets credit for doing the amazing act is the one who gets the success and everything when in fact it wasn't him the whole time, while the man who in fact did the amazing act ended up doing nothing. Ransom had to live with this lie which ended up in him finding success within the government. But now that Tom is dead, feels uncomfortable and guilty with taking credit for Liberty's death. This is some very good social commentary on how politicians might find there way up the ladder and into power. Sometimes, the best of them have to lie or do things they might regret later on. \n\nAnother fantastic Western from John Ford with a great message that goes deeper than one expects.",

Released just before the rise of the Spaghetti Western. characterized by gritty gang warfare and bounty hunting, the film is a quieter story dealing largely with the changing politics of the era, largely constrained to interiors rather than the expanses of the West. While these elements feel kind of refreshing in the genre, and there's lots of other nice elements to back the movie up, the film itself feels a little flat in delivery. The first act, setting up the characters and relationships, and third act, in which the title really comes into play, are solid and show signs of a really engaging Western, but the middle drags and hinders these elements at times. It's a slow paced story that takes its time in getting to its conclusion, which is admirable but sometimes leaves you wishing for a bit of a quicker pace. In terms of acting, James Stewart and John Wayne, two legends working together in the same film for the first time, are both expectedly great, helped by playing characters with opposing worldviews that allows for a unique dynamic. Vera Miles is a pleasant supporting presence and Lee Marvin is a mostly imposing figure as Valance, although the character sometimes feels like little more than a Westernized school bully. As a whole, it's legendary for a reason, but doesn't come without its fair share of problems.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Das, was den Western vom Abenteuerfilm unterscheidet, ist der Mythos. Für John Ford muss der \"Westen\" ein mystischer Ort gewesen sein, an dem seine Träume hingen. Historische Fakten spielen in seinen Filmen deshalb auch nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Er war ein konservativer Utopist. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance ist sein nachdenklichstes Werk geworden. Wer erschoss Liberty Vallance? Die Entscheidung zwischen der Wahrheit und dem Mythos fällt im Film ganz einfach: Der Westen lebt von der Legende. Der Film spielt zu der Zeit, da sich das Gesetz des Stärkeren zugunsten des Rechts im juristischen Sinne verschiebt. Wir erleben den Beginn der Moderne: Braucht ein Mann eine Pistole, um sich zu verteidigen oder sollte er sich besser eine Meinung bilden? Wir befinden uns in Shinbone, in einem unbenanntem Territorium. Die Grossgrundbesitzer versuchen, diesen Status zu erhalten. Die kleinen Farmer wollen einen Staat gründen. um ihre Rechte zu verteidigen. Drei Männer stehen im Mittelpunkt des Geschehens: Stoddard, Doniphon und Valance. Der Film eröffnet damit, dass Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) mit seiner Frau Hallie (Vera Miles) nach Shinbone kommt. Ein Zeitungsreporter fragt den berühmten Mann nach den Gründen seines Besuchs. Stoddard trat die Reise an anlässlich des Begräbnisses eines Mannes namens Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Niemand kennt diesen Mann. Seine Leiche liegt in einem primitiven Sarg, man hat dem Toten die Schuhe gestohlen. Ein Armenbegräbnis. Der Reporter fragt nach, wer diese Person sei? Ein Freund. Ein alter schwarzer Cowboy führt das Ehepaar noch einmal zum abgebrannten Haus des Toten: Es ist klar, sie haben ihn geliebt. In einer langen Rückblende, die fast den gesamten Film einnimmt, erzählt Ford den Hergang der Ereignisse. Viele Jahre zuvor terrorisierte der sadistische Bandit Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) die Stadt. Tom Doniphon beschreibt den vielfachen Mörder: \"Liberty Valance's the toughest man south of the Picketwire--next to me.\" Als Ransom Stoddard als junger Anwalt in die Stadt einreist, wird er von Vallance überfallen und fast zu Tode gepeitscht. In der Stadt pflegen ihn Nora and Peter Ericson gesund und arbeitet in deren Restaurant. Stoddard besteht darauf, als Tellerwäscher zu arbeiten, um die Unkosten zu bezahlen. Während der meisten Szenen im Film sehen wir ihn mit Schürze (anstatt mit Revolver). In dem Restaurant arbeitet auch Hallie. Im Reisegepäck hat Stoddart seine Bücher des Rechts und ein Schild für seine Anwalts-Kanzlei. Er befestigt es am Gebäude der örtlichen Zeitung. Das Schild ist ein Affront. Tom Doniphon beobachtet ihn und macht Stoddart darauf aufmerksam, dass im Westen derjenige im Recht ist, wer schneller schiesst. Stoddard entgegnet, dasselbe hätte Liberty Vallance auch zu ihm gesagt. Eine Dreiecksgeschichte bahnt sich an: Jeder im Ort geht davon aus, dass Doniphon Hallie heiraten wird, doch sie hat nur noch Augen für den kultivierten Stoddart. Auch das beobachtet Doniphorn, aber reagiert zu langsam. Hallie sitzt bereits in Stoddarts neu initiierter Schulklasse und lernt Lesen. Wir erleben den Siegeszug der Demokratie über den Faschismus. Bisher herrschte der Tyrann Valllance in Shinbone. Die Einwohner hassten ihn, waren aber machtlos. Durch Stoddarts Bildung lernen sie, demokratisch zu denken. John Ford filmt diese Dreiecksgeschichte in seinem puristischen Stil. Ich hab mir den Western heut ein zweites Mal angesehen und mir fielen einige Kleinigkeiten auf: Shinbone ist eine der wenigen Western-Städte, in denen keine Prostituierten auftauchen. Es scheint, als seien die Anwohner auch in der Hinsicht bereit für demokratische Verhältnisse. Die Art und Weise, wie Ford ganz nebenbei die gängige Rassentrennung in der Stadt im Film betont, ist besonders beeindruckend: Der schwarze Cowboy Pompey wird beim Betreten der Bar kurz darauf angesprochen, dass der Zutritt für ihn verboten sei - aber Doniphorn reagiert barsch und bestellt dem Schwarzen einen Whisky. Ganz nebenbei registrieren wir diese gute Eigenschaft an ihm. Es gibt noch viel mehr zu entdecken in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance und in einer alten Kritik lese ich, es sei der grösste politische Film aller Zeiten! Tatsächlich wird die Rolle der freien Presse betont und genau gezeigt, wie eine demokratische Abstimmung organisiert wird. Ich denke, die Behauptung, Ransom Stoddard wird letztlich in den amerikanischen Senat gewählt, weil er Liberty Vallance erschoss, ist keine Übertreibung. Für John Ford steht hinter der Frage, wer Vallance erschoss aber noch viel mehr: In den Worten des Zeitungs-Reporters: \"This is the West. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" dazu haben wir die (für unseren Geschmack) fesselndsten Western der klassischen Phase ab 1946 in unserer Film List zusammen gestellt.",

            "content": "\"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that is highly revered today by critics and audiences alike, although when it was released in 1962 it wasn't met with the same enthusiasm. Ironically today it is one of John Ford's most popular films along with The Searchers and Stagecoach. Many even consider this to be Ford's masterpiece and the purest example of the Western genre and the transition it was heading for. The film's greatest appeal was that it starred James Stewart and John Wayne for the first time together. Wayne always did his best work under Ford's direction, but Stewart was the real star and had been at the height of his career for a while. I'm assuming watching the two together must have intrigued audiences at the time because I was definitely interested in catching up with this classic for that very reason. The film was shot in black and white, which I believe had a lot to do with the fact that both Wayne and Stewart were playing characters 30 years younger than their actual age, although it also gave the film a nostalgic quality to it. A nostalgia that works for this film in particular because through this character study we see a shift of power and dynamics from the traditional macho cowboy character living by the way of the gun to the literate and educated character who believes in justice and law. It also has a strong political undercurrent but it is basically a western where the power balance is shifting from one ideal to another. The black and white composition also allowed Ford to focus more on the characters and their relationship, delivering a carefully constructed character study as well. \n\nThe film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at the train station of a small local town with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). This is the town where Hallie grew up in and where she met Ransom some 25 years earlier. When a local reporter asks the Senator what thy are doing in town he mentions they are in town for the funeral of a dear old friend named Tom. No one seems to recall who Tom was, except of course his personal ranch assistant Pompey (Woody Strode) who is mourning his friend's death next to the casket. Wanting to know why this mysterious man's death is so important to them, the reporter asks for an explanation. And so the flashback begins as Ransom narrates the story of how they met. He was a recently graduated lawyer at the time who was arriving from the East in search of better opportunities. Upon his arrival, his stagecoach was robbed by a bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and he was brutally beat. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) came across his unconscious body and brought him to a local family restaurant where Hallie worked at. Once he recovers, Ransom wants to press charges against Liberty but he soon discovers that isn't the way things are handled in the West. Not being able to make much use of his profession in this town, he offers his help at the restaurant and also begins educating Hallie and some local ranchers in the area. Meanwhile, Valance is still in town causing havoc everywhere he goes, and Ransom sees no other way to stop him but to face him despite his lack of expertise with guns.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Western genre and had high expectations for this classic, but I was underwhelmed by it. I found the pacing a bit slow and the fact that the film was shot on sound stages at the studio took away what I appreciate the most about the genre: the beautiful and vast location. The film is shot mostly in enclosed spaces focusing more on the characters, and although John Wayne and James Stewart were both great, I never felt their characters were developed naturally. The transitions they go through were merely there to serve the purpose of the story which was to expose the shift of our ideals of the western world. The facts are much more boring than the legends and that is exactly how I felt about this film. The villain in this film wasn't menacing at all and he simply behaved like a grown-up bully so the tension there was missing as well. The twists in the story were rather predictable as well so the final revelation never did anything for me either. The fact that Wayne and Stewart are supposed to be playing such young characters was also a distraction. Overall I understand why this film is regarded as a classic, but I just wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I had anticipated.           \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I also dont get why people like John Wayne which is why I was reluctant to watch this movie. Im a big Jimmy Stewart fan though so I thought Id give this a go. I knew straight away itd be a struggle when I heard Jimmy Stewarts accent but I still hoped for the best. However it descended into a farce. The movie starts with a old Jimmy Stewart attending a funeral and then it goes to a flashback of 25yrs previous when a young lawyer (Jimmy Stewart) fresh out of college enters town... However Jimmy Stewart still looks about 50 in the flashback (probably because he was actually 54 in real life at the time).. Its so unbelievable. Its actually ridiculous. it lost me. He is clearly a 50 some thing year old man, not a young man so why cast him as one.. He just doesnt suit the role at al.. In fact all the \"young\" people in this flashback look about 40/50 probably coz they are... John Wayne is 55. Vera Miles is 30+.  Actually I dont think there are any young people at all in it.  Also most of the towns folk are caricature idiot type characters. Just cant take them seriously. Liberty Valance looks about 40. His two middle aged side kicks are terrible in it. I love Lee Von Cleef but somehow theyve turned him into a idiot and the other sidekick has some kind of sex pervert expression on the whole time.  Also at the end of the movie theres a scene where John wooden Wayne goes into a bar and after one sip of his drink he is blind drunk and falling out the place... Its just so stupid as was the shooting scene... How many times are you gonna let Liberty Valance shoot before you shoot back???? ffs... . arrghhhh... How did this movie get so many stars???? and how do people like \"Pilgram\" John cant act Wayne.... Every time he said Pilgrim I cringed.... He is terrible at acting. So so wooden.. Also the end of the movie is so predictable and why is Jimmy Stewart asking his wife \"who put the cactus rose on the coffin\".... Why is he jealous of that.. Of course she was gonna do that...Oh thank fuck its just ended... I endured this movie. Silly movie and Im glad its over. The kind of stupid slap stick western I hate.  \"When the Legend becomes fact print the Legend\"... yeah like the legend that this is a good movie and that John Wayne can act.",

            "content": "As I was impressed with The Searchers, another collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne sounded like it was a good choice to watch, so The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was a must see.\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of John Ford's westerns which are a lot less focused on the frontier and getting filmed on a large scale, and instead keeps its focus on a smaller level. A lot of the film is more political and focused on the dramatics behind the fight against Liberty Valance from a non-violent perspective. This makes The Man Who Shot Liberty one of John Ford's most anti-violence westerns as it values dealing with its character from a peaceful perspective a lot more than shooting them until realising that it is futile to do so. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film which is certainly anti-violence and doesn't glamourize its battle between good and evil. It finds the appropriate themes and rests on then, giving them a meaningful exploration throughout. \nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a far from perfect film because it isn't as great as John Ford's western masterpiece The Searchers. It stays on a small scale and focuses on the political side of the west a lot which it does through having its characters talk a lot. While the dialogue is effective, some viewers may find that it makes the pace if the feature a lot slower than it already is as a western. Western films are generally slow, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is slower than the average, so it is not a film for the impatient. But it is still a good piece of western cinema.\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is interesting because of its two main characters. One of them is the political Ransom Stoddard who refuses to carry a gun around as he is a non-violent person and feels that the law will protect the innocent and persecute the guilty, while on the other hand there is Tom Doniphon who knows that the only thing criminal cowboys understand is violence and should be treated as such. The contrast between both characters emphasises both the negative and positive elements of violence in the west, even though the main focus is largely on trying not to resort to violence. So John Ford's style of storytelling in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a truthful and honest look at the west which is packed with a lot of talking which may prove too much for certain viewers, but others that can appreciate its innovative approach to the western genre as a means of preventing it from falling into the territory of being a generic western allows it to maintain its strength as a memorable feature which proves just what kind of writing talent James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck maintain when they put their minds to it.\nJohn Ford also gives a great stylish direction to the film. He ensures that the scenery maintains a strong western feel and that the look of the buildings and sets all fit into the appropriate timeframe, as well as the fact that all the costumes enhance the actors in successfully portraying characters from the time of the film's setting. And the cinematography is great because it constantly has a feeling of stability and captures everything from a good distance without excessive editing.\nThere is a lot of strong elements in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, but when you get right down to it none are more key to its success than the skill of its cast.\nAs Cary Grant dominates the screen most of the time in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, his performance is arguably the most important to the story. Playing the man who thinks that the law can handle itself without having to resort to violence, Cary Grant has to experience a lot of character development in the role of Ransom Stoddard. As he comes to terms with the true violent nature of the west, he must develop as a person to face the kind of harsh reality that truly is the West. And without fail, Cary Grant succeeds every time. He faces the material head on and puts his natural sophisticated charisma into the role so that in contrast to tough guy John Wayne who he acts opposite, the two are very different figures. This allows a complicated chemistry to ensue between them which shows both characters approaching situations in different ways and revealing more about how the other characters react as a result. Cary Grant is firm with developing his character at a strong pace over the course of the running time in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and his line delivery projects his emotions as well as his facial gestures do, so his performance is thoroughly convincing.\nAnd John Wayne is the other leading man in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Capitalising on his natural cowboy charisma and ability to give a performance with true grit to it, John Ford brings out some of the best talents in John Wayne once again. Projecting his natural cowboy persona, John Wayne takes on the role of Tom Doniphon, the man very different to Ransom Stoddard and he rides it to another successful performance. Refusing to back down, John Wayne stands tall with his heroic charisma in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and establishes a sense of support that comes with his fearless leading strength. John Wayne is a great presence in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and his leading skills are as fine as ever.\nAnd Lee Marvin's natural skill for portraying an antagonist makes him an awesome and rough edged enemy as the titular Liberty Valance. His character represents the dark nature of the west and Lee Marvin plays it out with natural gritty charisma, so it presents another strong performance from the Academy Award winner.\n\nSo while The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an imperfect film with a very slow pace and a lot of talking, it still emphasises John Ford's skill for directing strong western films and reveals the talents of its cast once again.",

That quote is a great one, especially when it comes to taking a closer look at history, but especially historical memory, and its impact. And it's the key to this film too, which is one of many standouts from its legendary director John Ford.\n\nJimmy Stewart is Ransom Stoddard- a greenhorn eastern lawyer whose efforts to dispense his brand of justice out in the small western town of Shinbone are hampered by the local menace Liberty Valance, played wonderfully by Lee Marvin. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphan- the toughest and meanest man in Shinbone (next to Valance), who does his best to help Stoddard, despite some complications, namely their methods of how to proceed, as well as the fact that they're both pining after the same lady- the lovely Hallie, who is played by Vera Miles. \n\nThis is one of many elegiac westerns that was ahead of its time for trying to demythologize the west before it became popular. It's also maybe the only time in his career where Ford is presenting things with a decent amount of pessimism, something that would also later get popularized a few years later along with revisionism, and demythologizing.\n\nThe acting is great, and Ford had a tremendous cast to work with, There's also lots of smaller appearances from way too many genre luminaries to count, and that certainly scores the film some extra points, too.\n\nI love how, even though this was made in 1962, they chose to shoot in black and white, and almost exclusively in interiors. There's a few moments outside, but there's none of the grand landscape shots you might expect. I think it really adds to the mood, tone, and point the film is trying to make about expectations versus reality.The music is also pretty fine as well.\n\nAll in all, this is a superb film. Definitely give it a watch.",

There, he tells the story of how the two came to overthrow the disorder in the village in the form of a feared bandit, Liberty Valance. One of the great masterpieces of the Western genre, once again, signed by John Ford. Here, Stewart plays a lawyer and Wayne plays the gunman in what feels like one of the most genuinely striking American works representing the beginning of the end of the western law of the gun. Ford is able to connect with the audience by building an emotional bridge between the audience and every single character in the film. Furthermore, the usual stunning photography and the striking sentimentality of the dialogue portrays a passionate ambivalence for American society and its roots.",

Up steps John Wayne as a pragmatic gunman and as was the case with many of John Ford's films, there was a perfect John Wayne shaped hole in the script that enabled him to shine. Add enjoyable turns from Lee Marvin as the total shit-heel of the title and Edmond O'Brien as a sozzled newspaper man and you have one the the great tales of the old west.

It's a dramatic tale about bullying, strength, honor, creating myth and legends about alleged heroes, and what it really takes to adapt to the truth. John Ford did a great job with telling the story in a retrospective, by placing all the missing links together, and therefore, showing the world, who really shot the infamous Liberty Valance. James Stewart is very believable as the fearful, neglected and a bit foolish, newcomer, who steps on the wrong territory and tries to fight with a notorious gunslinger, known for his perfect proficiency in gun-related manners. In all of the tension, coming from the strong dialogues, and in all the romance, coming from the beautiful Vera Miles, he seems to have succeeded in defeating Liberty. But as the memorable story is being revealed, the true nature of events can be as shocking as it may be actually expected. Another remarkable collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne, and one of the darkest western tales in history.",

However, it is absolutely magnificent for more than just the themes. The acting is superb, to say the least, and the staging and lighting is something to behold. This is one of the more philosophically deep of the Ford films, making one wonder just how the world works and what motivates and moves a person to do what they need to do.

I can't distinguish specific actor, because they r all superb. Since this is dir. Ford's film, I must say this is the best John Wayne character I've seen n experienced. He's such great actor, I can't see anyone pulling of Tom Doniphon except him. Liked him from the beginning, because he is strong, royal, and sweet inside. By the end, I felt so sentimental towards Tom Doniphon, left me with very heavy feeling. Btw one of the surprising ending, and ties up everything so perfectly.

Director John Ford's masterpiece is a complete epic of both cinema and the western genre, an action packed coming of age film that's utterly gripping and completely hard hitting throughout.  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is loaded with beautifully choreographed shootouts, incredible cinematography, top notch action sequences and elite acting, it's a fully loaded balls to the wall adventure that's relentless as it completely absorbs the viewer.  Valance features a fantastically told story that takes place in a film long flashback, which was unheard of at the time in the early 60's.  Original, bold, daring, brutal, entertaining and unbelievably clever, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a must see, must have film, a film that belongs in every film collection....a hypnotizing classic from Director John Ford and company, two thumbs up.\n       The cast is stellar and the acting is excellent throughout.  The western legend John Wayne lives up to his epic name, he is wonderful to watch throughout.

It's a very offbeat western as well, but it's two stars play off each other well, and it has a memorable baddie as well. U.S. State Senator Rance Stoddard (James Stewart) recalls the time he came to the border town of Shinbone, where he was attacked by outlaw bandit Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). He was left for dead, but he was found by local rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), who has him taken in with restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his Swedish wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan) and illiterate daughter, Hallie (Vera Miles). But, Rance settles in, and works for Ericson and his family. But, it's not long before Liberty Valance comes back to town, and threatens Rance and the Ericson family, but Tom wards him off. Meanwhile, Rance falls for Hallie, and he even goes as far as setting up a school in the town of Shinbone. But, when newspaper man turned political delegate Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) is beaten nearly to death by Liberty and his men. Enough is enough. This is a very good western, it's very engaging and it has a good sense of humanity too, Wayne plays his tough guy well, Stewart is the everyman we've come to expect, but Lee Marvin nearly steals it with relish as the evil Liberty, it's one of Ford's better films.",

            "content": "\"I had taken Horace Greeley's advice literally. 'Go west, young man. Go west, and seek fame and fortune, adventure.' \" So starts U.S. Senator Ransom Stoddard's (James Stewart) story of his first arrival to the small western town of Shinbone in John Ford's highly thought-provoking 1962 Western, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. His arrival to Shinbone is not welcoming at all as he is brutally whipped and left for dead by a town bully by the name of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), who basically tells him that the laws created by the U.S. government will not suffice in the West. Ransom is eventually rescued by local rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) and nursed back to health by a restaurant owner, his wife, and their daughter Hallie (Vera Miles). \n\nEven with all of his belongings (law books and documents) scattered and lost, a now healthy Ransom is determined to bestow justice upon this local daily menace and his henchmen once and for all. There's only one problem with his plan to put Liberty Valance behind bars. Apparently, Tom states that in Shinbone, the law books and documents that Ransom uses won't apply to this politically unstable town. \"Out here, a man settles his own problems,\" Tom states to Ransom. Furthermore, many of the townsfolk, including Hallie, can't read or write. However, Ransom does volunteer to teach some of Shinbone's citizens how to read and write. While his voluntary teaching works well so far, the next big encounter with Liberty comes ever so closer to the point where Tom has to teach Ransom how to shoot a gun against his will. \n\nAnd no matter what the end result of Ransom and Liberty's next encounter will be, it will profoundly change the town of Shinbone permanently. Either way, it makes the whole plot all the more fascinating especially when it comes to dissecting what the main moral behind this film is. Does this story argue for the importance of educating others how to read and write as well as reinforcing law? Does it argue for the importance to defend yourself regardless if you're incapable and unwilling to kill a man? What makes this particular tale all the more interesting is that it answers these certain questions by giving us indirect answers and raising more questions both at the same time. In short, we're given an answer that makes us draw our own conclusions as to why it had to end up this way. Without revealing too much about this climax, it's unforgettable to say the least. \n\nAlong with the climax's brilliant and complex payoff, the way director John Ford brings the town of Shinbone to life is also worth examining. By the end of this film, one can obtain a better appreciation of what this town was like between when Ransom first arrived and when Ransom returns at an older age. When Ransom first arrives to Shinbone, we can clearly see how poorly run this town is. The town marshal (Andy Devine) does absolutely nothing about his town's troubles except get drunk at the saloon. The only person aside from Ransom who's willing to stand up against what's going on in Shinbone is the editor of Shinbone's newspaper (Edmond O'Brien). Everyone else is either too afraid to confront Liberty over his actions or too afraid to even admit or say that Liberty's actions are unjustified. When Ransom returns to this town at an older age however, that's a different story. \n\nI appreciate the way John Ford captures the change that the town experiences by simply focusing on the folks that occupy it as opposed to just showing the town physically change. After all, the main way change can be brought about is by being introduced to original thoughts and ideas regarding how we can make life better for all of us. In this case, the citizens of Shinbone agree to put an end to the Western law being determined by gunslingers and let it now be determined by politicians. By analyzing the dilemmas our main characters experience, we can obtain a better understanding of how change is created through this technique as opposed to just being shown shots of a town physically changing. This was not just a well-chosen storytelling decision on John Ford's part, but also on the part of the film's screenwriters James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck. \n\nI also respect how Ford and his writers handled the love triangle between Ransom, Hallie, and Tom. Even though Ransom and Tom are basically competing for Hallie's affection, I admire how they still end up respecting each other as opposed to becoming each other's foes. It just makes these characters feel more real as opposed to just becoming plot devices. It's all the more encouraging since these three all have very strong personalities. I respect how Ransom believes in the written law so strongly that he'll stand up to gunslingers without a gun just to stick to his morals. I found Tom's internal struggle between his beliefs in guns being the law and having Liberty Valance killed for the town's good to be fascinating. The main reason is because he realizes that he isn't going to win either way by having the best of both worlds. Although she can't read or write, I like how tough and defensive Hallie can be and how she stands up for herself. \n\nMany people agree that if there's one quote that sums up The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, it would be this: \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That quote basically means that regardless of the facts, this is the kind of story that people want to hear. But these words won't do justice unless viewers, Western fans or not, see this outstanding film for themselves especially if they want to have a career in politics.",

It's got memorable characters, a strong story, and worthwhile themes about law and order versus rugged individualism. I like going back to these older American movies every now and then to remember just how great that classical storytelling could be.\n\nThe frame narrative opens with a gray-haired senator (Jimmy Stewart) returning after many years to the small Western town where his political career started. He's in town for the funeral of his friend, an old gunslinger (John Wayne). He tells the story of how his friendship with the gunslinger started after a conflict with a local desperado and bully named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).\n\nWhat does one even say about John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, honestly? They are two of the greatest, most iconic movie stars. Stewart is excellent here as the lawyer new to the rough Western town, who is determined to bring Eastern law and order to a town unaccustomed to it. Wayne is as swagger-y and tough as ever as the local gunman who is cynical and skeptical of Stewart's idealism, believing that only individual violence can provide a reliable source of justice out there. But Wayne's performance isn't simply machismo, though - his character does get to reveal some vulnerability and depth. Wayne was an actor typecast all his life, and he knew it, but he was just so good at that type. Lee Marvin makes for a thoroughly despicable villain, one of those movie bad guys you just love to hate. Vera Miles is fine as the obligatory female lead, but her character does still have some dramatic interest, given how torn she is between the Wayne and Stewart characters. Andy Devine, a wonderful character actor whose voice you may remember as Friar Tuck in the old Disney Robin Hood, is hilarious as the completely ineffectual, gluttonous local sheriff.\n\nThe story is unhurried in its development, and takes the time to really flesh out the two main characters and the clash of their philosophies. The movie doesn't judge either one, but makes a point of the necessity of both their approaches. The cinematography (very nicely preserved on the DVD I saw) is beautiful black-and-white, with very effective but not overdone usage of shadows and lighting. John Ford's direction is sure-handed and unobtrusive. Despite being a Ford film, there aren't a lot of sweeping Western vistas here; the focus is mostly within buildings and town streets. The film is a wonderful elegy for the Old West and the sort of man John Wayne always portrayed in movies. It's also the source of the line, \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend!\" This movie should well dispel the possible prejudice that John Wayne and John Ford made movies without nuance or thoughtfulness.",

            "content": "I initially wasn't too enthused about the idea of sitting down with this film. While I certainly admire John Ford, I had grown accustomed to the more coarse view of human nature on display in the spaghetti westerns of Leone, Corbucci, and Petroni. However, I was in for quite a pleasant surprise with this film. \nThe film centers on the life of Rance Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) and his return to the Western town where he came of age. In a series of flashbacks, we follow the exploits of Stoddard and his brush with the town's hero Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), and the town menace Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Yet, while this seems to have all the makings of a classic good vs. evil confrontation, Ford plays around with the idea of justice. \nAs if representing two adverse parts of the brain, Wayne and Stewart are ardent about fighting their own fights in their own ways. For Wayne, justice can be achieved with old-school heroism, a little gunpowder, and a dash of wit. For Stewart, the law of the land is sufficient and he is intent on reshaping the town's attitudes in such a way. Both men mock the avenues taken by their counterpart and blindly follow what they know to be true. They are two opposing forces, both immensely powerful in their own right. However, influence eventually leaks in on both sides and both men seem to come to at least some sort of understanding regarding the importance of their separate ways. \nThis sense of duality is strongly diffused throughout the picture and Ford highlights this visually by his expert use of shadows. In most shots, the characters shadows are projected on the wall behind them as if to showcase the dual nature that lurks in the hearts of these men. Yet, rather than casting judgement, it seems as though Ford wants to illuminate and understand these two opposing ways of life, and to lament the passing of western way. \nBeing one of Ford's last films, the viewer gets a sense that he knew the rule of the Western was coming to an end. Although Wayne is just in his own way, his character seems to know that the times are changing. No longer does having the fastest draw bring virtue and success and Wayne's character goes through a heartbreaking acceptance that Stewart's generation is taking over. In one shot in particular, Ford has Stewart's character standing in front of an old stage coach covered in dust and cobwebs. It is an homage to the old west that is both understanding and mournful.\nWhile Clint Eastwood's \"The Unforgiven\" has long be touted as the definitive eulogy of the western, I would argue that Ford's film is a much more fitting tribute to such a wonderful genre of film.",

            "content": "Man, I'd shoot Liberty Valance just to put him out of the misery of having such a girly name. Shoot, - so to speak - forget girly, because Liberty Valance sounds kind of like a stripper name or something. You know what, I'm going to make a prediction so likely that it just has to be a spoiler: Valance was shot by... Chastity Summers! Sometimes, you can't afford to have competition, and I'm glad no one said that when John Ford was alive, because he probably would have ended up killing anyone else who made a western film, and John Wayne would have been his accomplice. Man, Ford sure could make a western, and Wayne sure could star in one... just as Lee Marvin sure could play a sarcastic jerk, and Jimmy Stewart sure could get involved in some sort of a murder-mystery situation. Come to think of it, so much about this film seems to be conventional that I'm surprised that a stripper didn't turn out to be Valance's murderer, although I'm glad it wasn't (Sorry to spoil your expectations, folks), because this is a serious western right here. Mind you, it was serious for 1962, and while that isn't to say that the film isn't good, it is to say that time sort of timed this drama with certain shortcomings.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the film doesn't fall too deeply victim to Hollywood superficialities of the time, but there are still plenty of Hollywood melodramatics, and other cheesy, maybe even overly safe aspects which even have the nerve to fall into formula. There are some surprising refreshing touches here, as well as more than a few unsurprising conventional touches, which betray a certain ambition to freshen things up and might even commit the great sin of placing some predictability over a plot which is driven by certain twists and turns. Among the elements that help keeping predictability at bay is a certain undercooking to exposition, for although the developmental shortcomings are hardly all that great, certain characters seem to lack dimension, with some coming off as cheesy types which exacerbate the Hollywood fluffiness and a sense of familiarity, no matter how much the film keeps you from getting too familiar with the characters. Of course, as little time as the film dedicates towards fleshing out its characters, it takes some time to drag its feet, having a somewhat minimal story that is interpreted into a two-hour affair that drags out developmental segments over action, despite not putting all that much meat to the execution, resulting in some relatively serious slow spells, limited though they may be. Quite frankly, there is little to complain about here, but there are subtle consequential shortcomings, and quite of few of them, and each one of them sheds some shred of light onto prominent natural shortcomings. As I said, this story, no matter how compelling, is minimalist, being more about talk than momentum, which is further retarded by the Hollywood superficialities, as well as certain other superficialities to exposition and pace control. The final product could have gone a long way for a 1960s Hollywood western, but as it stands, however, it's still very rewarding, sustaining your attention pretty thoroughly with sharp storytelling, and even good looks.\r\n\r\nHaving to work with a black-and-white color palette, William H. Clothier turns in a cinematographic performance that is limited by technical shortcomings of the time, but still handsome in its subtle emphasis on lighting that takes advantage of coloration limitations in order to provide a certain sense of grit that art director Hal Pereira compliment with his capturing of the grimy environment through solid production value. It's a subtle appeal to the visuals, make no mistake, but the appeal is still very much there, with a subtle immersion value that is, of course, augmented by some tasteful direction. Though held back by dramatic limitations of the time, John Ford's subtle directorial flavor to pacing typically cut through slow spells with some solid entertainment value, and when the slower spells go accompanied with thoughtfulness by Ford, there's a certain dramatic bite that was uncommonly effective for the time, and does justice to an intriguing story. The story is at least refreshing in concept, with an intriguing narrative about a stranger being embraced by a strange land, especially upon performing actions of questionable morality, that ultimately comes down to a pretty solid twist, yet is never short on thought-provoking themes regarding morality which thrives on smart scripting. Hollywood fluff holds some bite to James Warner Bellah's and Willis Goldbeck's script back, as does developmental lapses and thin spells, but characterization is generally strong, drawing memorable characters who are made all the more compelling by twists which make the should-be villains seem merely flawed, and make the should-be heroes seem irrational and immoral, thus reinforcing the themes on the thin lines between true heroes and true villains that are further complimented by performances which are as memorable as the characterization. There is the occasional cheesy performance to accompany some cheesy characterization moments, but there are still plenty of endearing supporting performances, - particularly those by the effectively intimidating Lee Marvin as the titular outlaw, Edmond O'Brien as the drunken newsman who speaks for the people, the beautiful Vera Miles as a flawed woman who falls for a flawed protagonist, and by John Wayne as, well, himself, complete with extreme charisma - as well as a strong lead performance by James Stewart, whose classic dramatic layering sells a man's pride as an intelligent man seeking honor in a lawless land, and anxiety over being given a great deal of respect for a brutal deed. The flaws rarely abate, but the strengths never abate, and whether they be respectable for being ahead of their time, and respectable for still being strong to this day, they craft a drama which is never less than compelling.\r\n\r\nWhen the case is closed, some dated and conventional aspects slow down momentum almost as much as thin spells to exposition, dragging, and, of course, natural shortcomings, which go defied enough by handsome cinematography and art direction, well-paced direction, intriguing themes and scripting, and many an endearing performance - especially by James Stewart - to make \"The Man Who Shout Liberty Valance\" a plenty entertaining, compelling and all around rewarding portrait on challenging morals for justice.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

I like John Wayne in very few films, but this is Wayne in a role with nuance playing to the actor's strengths and away from stereotype.  Ford was Wayne's best director and he elicits a depth of emotion from the actor that is rarely seen. Lee Marvin does a remarkable job balancing the story as the malevolent Valance. He's scary enough that when he's killed you feel the relief. Watch the movie more than once and then try telling a friend that the story is a simple \"Western\".

I only watched the film because Escapefromalcatraz and I made a deal: I would watch 'LIBERTY VALANCE,' and he'd watch THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST. Win-win situation, because both are fantastic movies, this ultimately eclipsing the other (although that's comparing apples and oranges). \r\n\r\nAs many have pointed out, the acting in this film is superb. Jimmy Stewart (who I was pleasantly surprised was in it) is pitch- perfect as a city slicker in over his heels. Vera Miles is damn sexy as his wife, Lee Marvin is downright terrifying as a sadistic menace, and John Wayne has one of his best performances (again, in my opinion, his all-time best) as Tom Donovan. It's a tour-de-force, career making performance. Clint Eastwood, hang up your saddle; John Wayne shames you in 'LIBERTY VALANCE'. Illest had a great point, that Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne are fantastic together. In the scene where Tom calls Rance to his house to shame the city-boy at shoot the can, the pair burn holes in the screen. \r\n\r\nAnd those are not easily-spoken words. Eastwood is a monster in THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES (previously my favorite western) and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (which goes without saying).

It's not the most interesting film in the world plotwise  - you aren't exactly on the edge of your seat in regard to what shall happen to these characters.  But, like most good revisionist Westerns, much of the film's success comes from the use of anacrhonistic characters (in this case, Wayne, in what may be his best role) set against changes in the West (and American culture) during the dawning of the Railroad Era.  While telling a nice story, the film bemoans the introduction of big business in this country and the dying of a certain species of man.  In this respect, Wayne has the feel of a ghost in this film, and Ford's cinematography makes love to Wayne's allegorical representation.  The title character, played by Lee Marvin, is also excellent; though sadly, his representation has a slightly different feel than does Wayne, more of a shifting omnipresence than a death.",

It doesn't quite make it to five stars, another story were it was \"bigger\" than could be done in two hours with full justice. Woody Strode, Lee Marvin, Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, and Strother Martin are great in supporting roles here. John Ford did a very good job with the supporting cast performances.

It's a film with a multi-layered story of a timeless kind that speaks as solidly to viewers today as it did when it was released 45 years ago, just as it will speak to viewers 45 years in the future. This is one of those very rare films that truly deserves to labled as a \"classic\".\r\n\r\nAmong the many excellent performances in this film, particular notice needs to be given to John Wayne. To the inattentive viewer, the character of Tom Donaphin is little more than a stereotypical \"white hat\" cowboy of the kind that Wayne played dozens of times during the 1940s and 1950s. However, Tom is a deceptively complex man whose macho bearing and sincerely held patrician beliefs and attitudes are both his greatest strength and fatal weakness. It's a complex character that Wayne does justice with what may well be the subtlest performance of his career. I suspect anyone out there who likes John Wayne has already seen this movie, but if you haven't, you need to seek it out. It will give you a whole new appreciation for the man's talent as an actor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\r\nStarring: James Stewart, John Wayne, Vera Miles, Edmond O'Brien, Lee Marvin and Andy Devine\r\nDirector: John Ford",

It's directed by John Ford, the great Western director of the age and deals with the laying to rest of the old ways of the West. \r\nHere Old meets New, Good meets Evil, Law meets Anarchy and America meets it's Future. The characters all represent their themes of the change that came to West, but also to the times of the changing Western. This was the last of the classic's and Ford's refusal to shoot in colour shows a mature artistic integrity. The death of the old ways is written all over this film, and marks it out as very special to the genre and cinema alike.\r\nThe performances are uniquely brilliant from all cast members with Stewart, Wayne and Marvin lending such gravitas to the film through their characters. This is more than just a Western, this is a real film - with real power behind it's shot.",

He's a drunk, a braggart, a bully, a thief and a cold-blooded murderer who strikes fear into the hearts of \"decent\" people everywhere.  He is the embodiment of lawlessness.\n\nJames Stewart's Ransom is goodness personified.  He's educated. He has courage.  He's stubborn in his belief in justice and law and democracy.  He thinks he's bringing \"civilization\" to the lawless west.  He is brave but not fearless.\n\nJohn Wayne's Tom is a brave man when facing other men but he drinks too much and is nostalgic for the way things were, not for what they are becoming.  He's a man of direct action but has a long fuse.  He is the only man in town who Liberty Valance is afraid of but Tom doesn't care.  He ignores Liberty, letting him be the town miscreant when he could easily put a stop to it.  He is a loner and he claims to like it that way.\n\nIt is the interaction between these three principles that makes the story.  Things happen.  Civilization comes to the west.  Ransom goes on to fame and fortune.  Tom dies a bitter man.  The truth is finally told and it matters to no one.  What happened happened and what matters is the official version, not the truth.  So is history written......\n\nThis movie is not as popular as Ford's other classic westerns and has always met with more hostility because of its messages.  For me, only Ford's \"Stagecoach\" and \"The Searchers\" are as good.  Those movies are opposite sides of the same coin.  Ford's early westerns helped create the \"western myth.\"  \"The Searchers\" showed the dark side of that myth.  \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" explained it.",

            "content": "John Ford was one of the few directors who could deftly balance entertainment with more ambitious elements in the undercurrent. Because of that, his appeal to mainstream audiences was as wide as deep his reverence among aficionados. His films are among the favorites of many great directors, from Scorsese to Kurosawa. \n\nFord made great films throughout his long and illustrious career. One of those was The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. That film, like many of his others, is skewered with problems and elements of period melodrama acted sometimes by not so great actors. But nevertheless, those films, and this one, survive and thrive in spite of them. \n\nJames Stewart plays Rance Stoddard, a big wig senator, once a small time lawyer. His fame came as a result of his killing of a notorious outlaw, Liberty Valance. Rance tells his story to a group of reporters when he returns with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to the small town where he found fame for the funeral of a man - Tom Doniphon. Lee Marvin plays Valance, who's gang holds up Rance's coach, then mercilessly beats him. He's found by Tom, a rugged wild man played with ferocity by John Wayne. He has a side kick, Pompey, a towering African American. \nThe two men get along, but there is conflict under the surface. At this stage in the game, Hallie appears to be in line for Tom, not Rance. Rance preaches the word of the law, while Tom insists the only way to survive in this essentially lawless land is through the word of the gun. He frequently stands up for Rance when Liberty rides into town, and though never outwardly stated, seems to emasculate Rance with his protection of him. In the mean time, Rance is persuaded to start teaching the townsfolk to read and write, and starts working for the local paper. He is a jack of all trades but the gun. \n\nWhen the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end. \n\nThe first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen. \n\nFord's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch. \n\nAs noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals. \n\nNevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.",

            "content": "This John Ford western begins with a senator (James Stewart) and his wife (Vera Miles) returning to a western town in an unnamed state to attend the funeral of a man (John Wayne). While visiting the body, Stewart tells the story of how they all knew each other and why this seemingly unimportant individual is the reason he became senator. The flashback takes up the majority of the film. In it, Stewart is driving through town in a flashback when a man named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) robs his stagecoach. Stewart is a lawyer and wants to prosecute him but John Wayne explains to him that's not how things work in the film. The plot is pretty good, although I'm not sure the flashback was all that necessary. It didn't add all that much and the audience never does know how John Wayne died.\n\nAs mentioned a moment ago, this film stars James Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, and Vera Miles. Of them, James Stewart is the only one whose character has much depth and he's the only one who really stands out in terms of acting. The other main characters are good, but nothing great. There were a lot of townspeople and I didn't really care for the way they acted. Many of them were supposed to be drunk half the time which was fine, but they weren't all that convincing and more irritating than anything.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good film but it's not up there with something like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It's the first John Wayne film I've seen, but it's usually regarded as one of his better ones so I'm sure this is a must-see for John Wayne fans. This is generally regarded as one of Stewart's better westerns, but again it's the first one I've seen. Fans of westerns will probably enjoy this, but I don't think it's good enough to where people who despise westerns will find much to enjoy in this film.\n\n80/100\nB-\n\nUP NEXT: To Catch a Thief.",

Ford uses this film to showcase the Old West turning into the New West, with Stewart symbolizing change and Wayne as the epitome of the frontier.

Wayne gives one of the best performances of his career, as a man conflicted on what do when he realizes his way of life is changing.

John Wayne plays his polar opposite, a gunslinging cowboy who knows how to use a gun. There are two people between them. One is the damsel in the tiny western town played by Vera Miles. The other is Liberty Valance, a sadistic gun for hire played by the great Lee Marvin.\nThis film is more about the taming of the west. When Stewart's character arrives it's a madhouse like all wild west towns are, but by the end of the film everything has become more civilized, even though the Easterner had to use means that he is against at the start of the picture.\nStewart and Wayne play their trademark roles in this film. This film is almost like looking at both icons in the stereotypes they have become in the mind of the general public. Vera Miles returns from Hitchcock land (ironically she was supposed to have starred with Stewart in Hitchcock's Vertigo) and gives a nice performance as the love interest of both men. It's Lee Marvin that brings pure evil to the screen as Liberty Valance. His performance ranks up there with some of the other classic western villains as he destroys everything in his path. He probably has the greatest gang backing him up as well, with Strother Martin playing a looney stooge while Lee Van Cleef shows us a glimpse of the quiet and dangerous force he would unleash when he went to Italy.\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a classic western that ranks as one of John Ford's best. The use of black and white is almost a way for Ford to bring the film back to simpler times. Unlike other Ford epics, the backgrounds do not overshadow the actors in the foregrounds.

James Stewart (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life), John Wayne (Stagecoach, The Searchers), Lee Marvin (Cat Ballou, The Dirty Dozen), and one of my favorite supporting actresses: Vera Miles (The Searchers, Psycho). Not to mention director John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers). Probably the most interesting thing about this movie, though, was the whole Stewart vs. Wayne thing. James Stewart believed in putting Liberty Valance (Marvin) behind bars and Wayne kept saying you had to be quicker on the draw in order to get back at Valance. Lee Marvin was a fantastic villain.[/color]",
