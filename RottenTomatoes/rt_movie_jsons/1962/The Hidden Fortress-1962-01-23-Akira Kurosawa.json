They find a man and woman whom they believe are simple tribe members hiding in a fortress. Although the peasants don't know that Rokurota (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) is a general and Yuki (Misa Uehara) is a princess, the peasants agree to accompany the pair to safety in return for gold. Along the way, the general must prove his expertise in battle while also hiding his identity.",

That was one of my main reasons for giving this movie a try and I actually really liked it! The acting was convincing, the action and duels/fights were very well directed for the time, and the story was original and captivating throughout! Akira Kurosawa was quite the film artist and inspired generations with his work, and all of the main cast members did real justice with the roles they were given. Plus, the scenery and wide shots in many scenes were gorgeous as well!",

The story of a rebel princess trying to covertly get back to her kingdom with the aid of a loyal Samurai and two bumbling peasants is engaging, funny, and multilayered.  I know George Lucas says it impacted Star Wars.  While it is clear to me that Dune was his major story influence that there are elements of this film in Star Wars.  The Enemy warriors' helmets are the foundation for Darth Vader's. In 1958 the role of Princess Yuki as a defiant, bold, tough, but feminine character is clearly a forerunner to Princess Leia.  After reading about Lucas it seems clear to me that R2D2 and C3PO are modeled after Hidden Fortress's two main characters, the bumbling, often at odds, peasants.  A great film.",

            "content": "An entertaining and influential adventure!\n\nAkira Kurosawa's Japanese adventure comedy The Hidden Fortress (1958) is an imaginative journey of transporting gold and a princess. It's not a flawless masterpiece of filmmaking like some of Kurosawa's other epics. I much prefer Rashomon, Ikiru, and Seven Samurai, but The Hidden Fortress is sure to delight fans of Kurosawa all the same for its good humor and neat adventure aspects alone. Kurosawa's writing is centered around laughter and fun instead of high moral concepts, but he does cover The Hidden Fortress' main theme of loyalty well.\n\nKurosawa's story appears to have been highly influential of George Lucas for Star Wars' concepts for A New Hope as well as Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly from what I watched. You can see the side wipes made popular in A New Hope here in The Hidden Fortress first. The duel between old samurai comrades is not unlike Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader's chance encounter. The similarities go on and on really. The search for gold and the fool's greed leading to betrayal feels like Tuco endlessly betraying The Man with No Name in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The two fools come across as lecherous versions of C-3PO and R2-D2 questing for gold with Star Wars from their perspective. In short, The Hidden Fortress is a fun adventure on its own merits, but its ideas are timeless archetypes for future film plotlines.\n\nKurosawa's direction is entertaining with farcical bits splitting up the epic adventure with some silly comedy. Not all the jokes land and hit hard, but you'll likely enjoy The Hidden Forest. It does get rather long and slow in the middle, but there is plenty of payoff with exciting chases and humorous diversions. Masaru Sato's score is uplifting and exciting with boisterous music!\n\nToshiro Mifune is the main draw as the cool samurai general in hiding Rokurota Makabe trying his best to outsmart two idiots and save his princess' life. Misa Uehara is fiery and intense in a playful role as Princess Yuki. I must mention Minoru Chiaki as Tahei and Kamatari Fujiwara as Matashichi. They are hilarious and a constant source of laughter in The Hidden Fortress. You feel bad as these two unlikely heroes desperately try to survive warfare, conquer their foes, and claim hidden gold as their own. They are made more ridiculous next to the ultra serious Mifune for extra laughs.\n\nThe Hidden Fortress is not a flawless adventure, but it is a genuinely funny one.",

He turns out to be Rokurota Makabea, a famous general in the army of Akizuki, the invaded country.  The two peasants scheme to enrich themselves at the General's expense, but he foils their every attempt.  However, he is also transporting someone more precious than gold - Princess Yuki, the heir to the Akizuki throne.  There is a bounty on her head and the journey will be a perilous one.\n\nNot Akira Kurosawa's best work - far from it.  Pretty slow-moving and dull, with little profundity or grittiness.  Essentially one long, linear road movie.\n\nStarts off slowly and never seems to find even second gear.  Every scene gets drawn out to the max.  No real focus either, just a long winding walk of a movie.\n\nMaking things worse is the presence of the two peasants.  Incredibly irritating and silly characters, they are largely responsible for the movie feeling so lacking in substance.  Whether through bad writing, direction, casting or performance - I suspect a combination of the four - they have a profoundly negative impact on the movie.",

            "content": "The opening scenes of The Hidden Fortress are a little scattered. It establishes the peasants played by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara, but they just seem to be bouncing around from one place to another. I really enjoy these characters, because they have a humorous report with one another. Admittedly they are a bit infuriating because they constantly make the wrong decisions, but they had enough personality that I found it funny instead of frustrating. They are the catalyst that gets the story going, but I still wonder if the movie really needed to start and end with them. Either way, after a little bit of rambling, the story settles down and hits its stride once that first piece of gold is found.\n\nThis is where Toshiro Mifune joins the movie and suddenly elevates it to another level. His interactions with the peasants is priceless because he is always two steps ahead of them. He also adds a lot of charm and gravitas to any character he portrays. Misa Uehara is superb as the strong princess who pretends to be mute for a large portion of the movie. Her clear dominance over Mifune\u0092s character is exciting to watch because it makes her the most important character in the film despite the fact that she barely speaks. There are a few other vital roles in the movie but this quartet are the ones that work together the longest and I love the arc of their story.\n\nThere were some moments where I longed for some of the more dramatic samurai fights that I\u0092ve seen in a couple of other Kurosawa films. The most significant fight in the film is done with spears instead of swords which seems a bit clunky, even if the scene still has a lot of intense dramatic moments. The plot carried The Hidden Fortress despite some minor tweaks I would have enjoyed seeing. I found this to be a well-made film that I would gladly revisit. You can certainly see a few places where George Lucas drew inspiration from The Hidden Fortress in the story and with some of the character creation. But I was glad to see plenty of differences so you couldn\u0092t accuse Star Wars of being a remake, at most it is an homage to this classic.",

As always, Kurosawa's use of extras is impressive and amazing.\n\nI love how the story just chugs along very easily as if a genius wrote the story out. Even though the movie is in black and white, I can definitely tell that the locations used are beautiful. It makes me want to visit that part of Japan or wherever it was filmed.

The use of peasants as an introduction to a story with a much larger scope is cool, but done better in Seven Samurai. The same goes for it's period detail. \n\nAt over two hours it is treading into the run time of some of his epics, which does not feel justified by the much smaller character driven story.\n\nI probably sound like I didn't like the movie, but it's really not a bad movie by any means.

            "content": "After the release and success of Throne of Blood (1957), Japanese writer/director Akira Kurosawa now had a proud and successful reputation in Japan and audiences around the world. For his next film, Kurosawa decided to lighten the tone a bit, noting that Throne of Blood has been a dark film, claiming \"I want to make a 100% entertainment film, full of thrills and fun.\" He certainly delivers here. It begins with two poor peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara), who had intended to fight with the Yamana clan against the Akizuki clan, but arrived at the battle too late. They bicker and argue before splitting up, but it's not long before they're both captured by the Yamana clan, mistaken for Akizuki. But, Tahei and Mataschichi both manage to escape, and they find a stash of Akizuki gold down by a river, but they're approached by Akizuki General Makabe Rokur?ta (Toshiro Mifune), who tells them he's escorting Princess Yuki Akizuki (Misa Uehara), and they're trying to hide the gold from the Yamana clan, they join in on this mission. It's an intriguing and compelling adventure film, Kurosawa's first film in widescreen, and it's got a good sense of humour about it, as well as some good action. The characters of Tahei and Matashichi were influenses for R2D2 and C3PO in Star Wars (1977), and the mission inspired The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nAhhh...it's been a while since I've given a film a 9/10.  And what better way too do it than with Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, an important piece in cinema history for many reasons.  You may be wondering why this may be....Well, Star Wars would not exist if it weren't for this film.  Yes, you fanboy nerds heard me right.  Your precious Star Wars wouldn't even exist if it weren't for this film.  However, the Hidden Fortress is more than just an inspiring film...It's one of the best.  Though it may boast more style than substance, there is a lot to love about this Japanese epic.\n\nThe Forbidden Fortress is about two dimwitted lowlifes, who don't care much for this world.  They are forced to work for a rival clan, doing hard labor.  They plot to escape, and they almost do.  But they get caught.  They are turned into slaves, working with the slaves.  However, they escape after an uprising and end up at a river full of gold.  There they meet two people: a man and chick, who turn out to be the general and princess of a fallen clan.  They are tasked with a simple, yet dangerous mission: Lead the two people out of the territory and into safety.  If you cannot see the hint of Star Wars within that premise, you obviously didn't watch Star Wars cause that's nearly identical.....except this film is set on Earth.\n\nOne of the best things I noted from this film was Kurosawa's directing.  The overall style of the film makes it seem much superior to Star Wars.  Also, the film is deeply comical.  Never would I have thought I wouldn't laugh with a film made 6 decades ago, but this film works.  It's witty, snappy dialogue is more than anything Lucas could do.  Also, the acting seemed to be great, though it is hard to understand due to language barriers.  However, it doesn't matter, seeing that I don't mind reading a little.  I think it's witty script and likable characters push this film well beyond the Star Wars films (sorry Han Solo).  Even if you don't like talky films, this film has plenty of action to keep you entertained for the entire 2hr 10min runtime, which flies by really quickly.  \n\nNow, I get sick and tired of people who won't watch a film because it's black and white, so I decided to make an open letter to them.  Dear whoever you are, please quit being so ignorant.  Just cause a film may not have the best technical merits (cause it's old) doesn't mean it doesn't have any merits.  The Hidden Fortress is a wonderfully written film and if you won't watch it cause it's \"old\", you are really missing out on great films.  I'm not saying you're an idiot, but just be a little more open in films.  I'm getting sick of all those Paranormal Activity films, but I'll still watch them if I can....Maybe.  I'm just saying: give it a try.  If it's not your thing, it's not your thing.  Just experiment.\n\nOverall, The Hidden Fortress is the first fully fledged 9/10 review I've given in the past 3 months.  It's always curious to see the obvious similarities between this and Star Wars, so I have made a game: Count how many things Star Wars used from this film.  Trust me, it's a lot.  Featuring witty dialogue, great battle scenes, and some nice open shots of an entire set piece, Kurosawa proves as to why he's a great director.  He seamlessly shifts from humor to action to humor again and again.  If you decide you don't want to watch it cause it's black and white, you're missing one of the best films ever that \"inspired\" one of the biggest franchises of all time.  Not only is this a must see for Kurosawa fans (though I'm sure most have already seen it), it's a must see for Star Wars fans.  Great time.  Thank you, Criterion for remastering the film.",

            "content": "I was intrigued to see The Hidden Fortress, not only because it was an Akira Kurosawa film, but George Lucas apparently cited the film as a major inspiration for the legendary Star Wars franchise (Hell, Lucas was such a fan of Kurosawa that he served as an executive producer for Kagemusha when Kurosawa and Toho had difficulty financing the film). Sure enough, upon watching The Hidden Fortress, it certainly lived up to its lofty reputation as one of the greatest adventure films of all time and yet another triumph for the legendary director.\n\nTwo bumbling peasants: Matashichi and Tahei end up getting taken on the ride of their lives in the wake of the country's clan warfare. After being forced to dig ditches to bury bodies and search for a missing bounty of 200 pieces of gold in the ruins of the Akizuki Clan's castle, the two end up discovering a piece of the clan's gold hidden in the mountains while traveling through.\n\nKnowing that the Yamana Clan is searching for these pieces of gold, the peasants begin desperately searching the area for more gold, when they run into a man named Rokurota who takes the two men and forces them to work for him with promises of gold. \n\nIt turns out Rokurota is actually a guard for the missing princess of the Akizuki Clan named Yuki and plans to get her to another clan territory for safe-keeping to start the clan over. When the peasants, despite being generally stupid, present a good plan for getting past the Yamana Clan territory, Rokurota decides to take Princess Yuki along with this plan, making her pretend to be a mute to protect her, while also recruiting the bumbling and greedy peasants to help smuggle the gold to their destination that is hidden in pieces of wood. During their journey, they also purchase and rescue a servant girl, and now the five unlikely allies must cross the dangerous territories, with the peasants unknowingly escorting the princess to safety.\n\nThe story is definitely much more light-hearted than many of Kurosawa's other works, but he proves that is more than capable of light-hearted and delivers one hell of a ride as far as adventure films go. The characters each have their own distinct personalities as any good adventure film should and the characters are very well rounded and interesting. It's a story filled with action, adventure, humor, suspense, excitement, and so much more. As far as storytelling goes, any fan of adventure films should find a lot to love in here.\n\nOnce again, especially with a cast that includes Toshiro Mifune, the acting is quite good. While this is one of his more light-hearted roles, Mifune seemed to have no trouble adapting to what kind of character a script would call for. Every cast member was great, and all the main characters became endearing and entertaining to follow on their bizarre journey.\n\nThe Hidden Fortress is certainly among the greatest adventure films of all time. If you enjoyed the Star Wars franchise, you should check this film out because of how much the much more famous franchise owes to this film. This film has anything any fan of adventure films, Japanese films, Kurosawa films, or lovers of great films could pretty much ever want. It's a superb film that is action-packed, exciting, fun, hilarious, and more. See it if you ever get a chance to watch it.",

            "content": "The Hidden Fortress may be best known for being the primary inspiration for Star Wars, but what people tend to forget is that this is actually the superior film. Its unusual blend of humor and action was quite rare for the 1950s, especially in Japan, where the film was dismissed by many film critics for having too much of a \"Western feel\" to it. Still, it's my favorite Japanese film, and deserves its place as a notable classic of foreign cinema.\r\n\r\nThe Hidden Fortress follows two bumbling peasants who, after going off to war, are forced to return to their village with their tails between their legs. Fortunately, on their way back they come across an old general, who enlists them to help transport an enormous cache of gold and a princess from enemy territory into her own ravaged kingdom. And yes, they're more than a little reminiscent of R2-D2 and C-3PO. The opening scene, where they're walking through a desert wasteland while bickering, is more than enough to give Star Wars fans goosebumps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the general is clearly Obi-Wan Kenobi (and his name even sounds eerily reminiscent of that infamous name), and there is, of course, an epic scene in which he duels with the baddie. But plot points aren't the only thing that Star Wars took from Kurosawa, and it took plenty of 'em... no, the style is also clearly the precursor to Star Wars. The long and dramatic landscape shots, the timing of the dialogue, the scene transitions-- they're all very Lucas-esque. If only Lucas had been able to capture the dialogue and character development as well as the style, Star Wars could have been even better.\r\n\r\nThe real feat of this movie is that, even though it was subtitled, I still laughed out loud at some of the character's dialogue. Usually, subtitled films make it hard for a viewer to judge the acting, as the line delivery is in another language, and therefore you don't know how well the acting is. They could be droning on in a monotone, screwing up their lines, or giving delivery reminiscent of The Room for all we know. However, The Hidden Fortress didn't make me feel that way once. Throughout the film, I was completely engrossed with the characters, which is an unusual thing for a subtitled film to do. Altogether an incredible cinematic feat.\r\n\r\nThe story, meanwhile, is a total classic. In the interview with George Lucas, he mentions an old adage saying that there are only 32 stories that can be told. He said he didn't subscribe to that belief, neither do I, and I doubt Kurosawa did either. He told a truly remarkable story with this movie, the likes of which had never been seen before by Japanese or western audiences. That's probably why his films are so repeatedly adapted, from the obvious Star Wars to A Fistful of Dollars and The Magnificent Seven. Filmmakers nowadays would do well to learn from his example, but unfortunately, it looks as if character development and sharp dialogue have been all but lost to time.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Hidden Fortress: 9/10 stars. Really, the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I am very stingy with my 10/10s, and don't like to use them much. I wouldn't be surprised if, upon another look, I saw fit to give this the rare Diego Tutweiller 10/10 Approval Rating... but until then, I'll be digging into my brain searching for a flaw in this spectacular film.",

Kurosawa accomplishes all three.\n\nAction and comedy are perfectly balanced. When this film was made, Kurosawa had already proven his ability to conceive great action sequences, build suspense over the course of a film, create emotional close shots between characters, and manipulate light and shadow expertly. In this work, he displays that he can write and direct humourous comedy scenes. He also permits the audience to infer certain details, rather than dumbing down the plot to the lowest common denominator.\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of a hapless duo (Tahei and Matashichi) engender audience sympathy despite their crooked nature because of their hilarious exchanges. The protagonists continually argue with each other yet each is enitrely dependent on the other. Those scoundrels walk the line between complete cowardice, utter idiocy, and giddy greed. They move from one misadventure to another following a selfish quest to profit by any means necessary during an ongoing war.\n\nI believe that Kurosawa pioneered the idea of screen wipes as a transition from one scene to another. Unlike George Lucas, he makes the wipe part of the scene, allowing the briefest snapshots (such as when the two jackanapes are pursued for stealing rice) to make the film more dynamic. The score suits the action beautifully. The scene when a mob of destitute prisoners of war escape and overwhelm the organized Samurai army is a great example of Kurosawa\u00e2(TM)s grand vision, as is the sword fight on horseback.\n\nTahei and Matashichi follow a general (Toshir\u00c3\u00b4 Mifune) and a princess through enemy lines, although they are unaware of their stature at the time. The beggars initially join the gang and face danger for the promise of gold but at the end receive self-satisfaction because they contributed to a good cause, despite the lack of reward.\n\nThis film should be screen at the Bloor Cinema; I think the audience would feel comfortable laughing at the many light-hearted moments. Although I complimented Mifune during a previous post for his great range, he seems to find a way to work the same laugh into every film. The Hidden Fortress is highly recommended (and totally ridiculous).",

That's the true power of a Kurosawa movie. Being a very engaging film, The Hidden Fortress is an action-packed adventure that also combines elements of a joyful comedy. Set in the times of feudal Japan, against the devastating Civil War, it's Kurosawa's auteur vision of a journey that binds two easygoing and cunning misfits, and a ruthless general in search of gold, and on a quest to save a gorgeous princess. It beautifully presents Japanese culture from within, making it an interesting piece for anyone, who wants to get a glimpse at the peculiarity and loveliness of the country of cherry blossoms. What's more, it adds up to the overall excitement with great sword-fighting sequences. A masterpiece.",

They encounter General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune), who is guarding Princess Yuki Akizuki (Misa Uehara), and her gold in a secret land. They want to flee the area. \r\n\r\nToshiro Mifune, plays the role of General in style and vigor, he is robust while dealing with Tahei and Matashichi throughout the movie; showing his superiority both through physique and expressions. He subjugates to Princess Yuki's tomboy attitude. Tahei and Matashichi characters in this film are fun to watch, as director George Lucas himself mentioned that creation of characters C3PO and R2D2, were inspiration from these two characters of Hidden Fortress.  You just love to watch them irritate Toshiro Mifune. They put him to trouble with their idiotic actions every now and then, they are full of greed to get hold of gold of Princess Yuki.\r\n\r\nKazuo Yamasaki applies exceptional cinematography, to first ever wide-screen film by Akira Kurosawa.

The fact that the two main characters were driven by greed rather than any noble motivation made them funny as each attempt they made to get rich by double-crossing each other and the others in their party was doomed to failure; Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara do fine jobs in these roles. Equally good is Toshir\u00f4 Mifune who plays the general; a more serious character but still able to provide a few laughs as well as some action. Misa Uehara is likable as the tomboyish Princess Yuki; a good strong female character. The story flows nicely and doesn't seem overly long despite being well over two hours long. If you are a fan of Kurosawa's other works or Japanese cinema in general this is a must see.its nature distorted by its status as the official \"inspiration\" for \"Star Wars\", \"the Hidden Fortress\" is a unique delight in the Kurosawa canon, balancing wry humor and deep empathy on the line between realism and fairy tale. The film opens and closes with the two bickering farmer/soldiers who inspired R2-D2 and C3P0, but they're nothing like their \"Star Wars\" descendants -- their swings from slapstick to base treachery make them so weird and un-Hollywood that Lucas' robots seem neutered by comparison.

Kurosawa's jidai-geki film does not take place in galaxies far far away, but in the mountains along feudal territory borders. The character don't travel in technologically advanced (and realistically impossible) pods or spaceships, but on horses and often by foot. The lead actors in Star Wars like Harrison Ford are rubbish and wooden compared to the commanding and mature performance given by Toshiro Mifune. Nothing in any Hollywood action film is as exhilarating as seeing him hunt down two enemy soldiers on horseback with both his hands on the handle of his sword (not some oversized glow stick). The fierce voice that Misa Uehara brings with her to the role of the princess puts Carrie Fisher's unspectacular performance to shame. Furthermore, the dull interaction between C3PO and R2D2 pales in comparison to the hilarious comedy of Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara. The two peasants are not helping the princess because of loyalty or some power of the force, in fact they don't even know she's the princess! They are just doing it to get their share of 200 gold pieces which are being smuggled along with the princess. So their motivation is simply greed, which is easier to relate to and makes much more sense psychologically. The greed of the two bumbling peasants allows for a much more complex relationship to develop between them, the princess, and the general (Toshiro Mifune). They are not simply sidekicks or henchmen, they have their own desires and intentions which further create tension and conflict. Their greed is also a commentary on the selfishness of people in society. In terms of direction, of course Kurosawa's film flows much more smoothly, more naturally, and more coherently than Star Wars, which was very awkward at times as it went from one scene to another; this is because Kurosawa's use of slide wipe are more fluent in their execution and seem like transitions, while Lucas' forced use of those same slide wipes seem like skipping. Ultimately, Hidden Fortress is an thrilling adventure with 4 memorable characters who have incredible experiences which are such a joy to watch. Funny it was easier to relate to a film set 500 years in the past than a film set 500 (or more) years in the future. Well, to give to some props to George Lucas atleast he did admit this film's influence on Star Wars, at least he changed the name of the film, and he also helped finance Kurosawa's late epic Kagemusha; don't be misled though the real respect should be paid to Kurosawa, the Emperor of filmmaking.",

They manage to escape, however, when the other prisoners revolt against the guards. After they go on a hunt for a wanted princess, in which they would receive a substantial gold reward if they capture her. At the same time, they also go on a hunt for gold in the mountains. Soon though, another man (Tishiro Mifune) persuades them to take him on as their boss and then they go on a hunt for gold. They soon discover he is associated with the wanted princess and the film goes onto interesting direction from there on. Highly entertaining work from the Japanese master. Beautifully filmed, emphasizing both the scenery (mountains and landscape), towns, and fighting throughout the film. The Fire Festival scene is astonishingly impressive. The acting is also fine and so is the humorous translated dialogue. Another great film from the repertoire of Akira Kurosawa.",

No one could create the world of feudal Japan like Kurosawa and his seminal picture weaves action/adventure and comedy into a heavenly melange set against a ruthless, medieval civil war where honor and loyalty are compromised in the service of self-preservation.  That Kurosawa was able to contemplate his usual cultural themes and make The Hidden Fortress the tremendous entertainer it is, is a testament to the director's uncanny virtuosity.

At the time, I was younger and didn't pay close attention as the film played.  So, I waited to review this when I had time to sit down and watch it with full attention.\n\nKurosawa is a master at painting pictures with a camera.  The cinematography in this film is beautiful.  The vast shots of the countryside, the mountains, and so on will, at times, make you gasp at the beauty.  Insert a story that's thrilling, funny, and pretty epic and you have a masterpiece on your hands.\n\nThe best part for me was watching the film that inspired the man whose films inspired me.  You can see where George Lucas got a lot of his inspiration for the Star Wars saga in this film.  There's the obvious like C-3P0, R2D2, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, but then there's Lando Calrissian, the Storm Troopers, and even the Ewoks (tell me the fire festival doesn't remind you of the Ewok scenes!).  It definitely added a layer to the experience.\n\nIf you're a fan of Akira Kurosawa, like I am, then you will love The Hidden Fortress.",

Set in medieval Japan, the deterioration of one of the major dynasties has forced the princess into hiding out at their hidden fortress. Initially following two peasants who accidentally discover a piece of the dynasty's hidden gold, they are then followed by a great general who enlists their help in transporting the gold and the princess back to her kingdom. Reading some of the reviews for this film, I've now found out that apparently was a heavy influence for Star Wars. And that does make quite a bit of sense, especially since I was thinking about Star Wars and Jedi fights during the fight between the two generals. Anyways, the good things about the film is it looks great, as always expected with Kurosawa, and the performances are all very good, and it's actually surprisingly a bit comical to top things off. But I did think it was overlong and some of the editing is horrific, even for an old film. Overall though, a Kurosawa film is never a wrong film to check out, so check this one out.",

I don't really get the \"Star Wars\" connections that much, but the two peasant characters were interesting in their own right.
