            "content": "At 17, I love David Lean, his films are filled with beautiful images and he also directs with real flair. Lawrence of Arabia is a perfect example of movie-making at its finest, the whole film is absolutely phenomenal in every aspect:\n\nWhether it is the film's visual style. Lawrence of Arabia is filled with absolutely beautiful images, such as the mirage that introduced us to Omar Sharif. I don't think this could be possible without the astounding cinematography, or the stunning, picturesque Morrocan, Saudi Arabian, Spanish and English locations. The shots of the desert were visually jaw dropping and the battle scenes are unforgettable. But that is the thing with Lean, all of the films I have seen of his are visually stunning, Passage to India, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, Brief Encounter and Bridge on the River Kwai all but to name a few.\n\nWhether it is the film's music score. I used to listen with real enthusiasm to Classic FM at the Movies every Saturday (on the radio that is), and along with the main theme of Gone With the Wind, the score's main theme was one of the main themes that stuck out most. Maurice Jarre's score is nothing short of outstanding, swift, sweeping, epic and even iconic. I could very well say it is probably one of my all time favourite movie scores.\n\nWhether it is the film's screenplay. The screenplay is intelligent and is like a withering satire on the mentality of Lawrence's superiors, who go by the book. Like the screenplays for Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, It's a Wonderful Life and All About Eve, the screenplay here has lines that are a) quotable and that b)linger long into the memory, just like the story the film tells.\n\nWhether it is the film's acting. Peter O'Toole is the easiest starting point, for he gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on film. His performance is so flamboyant and brilliant, it just highlights what a great actor he is. He nails Lawrence's complex character like a fitted glove, he is enigmatic and charismatic like TE Lawrence was like in real life. Supporting him all the way like iron are Alec Guiness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer. Their characters aren't as complex as Lawrence's but they are still fully fleshed out and intriguing.\n\nThe film is very long, but thanks to the quality of the visuals, direction, screenplay, music and acting there is no time whatsoever wasted. Quite simply one of the best movies ever made, movie-making on the grandest scale. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This 225-minute epic concerns the perilous journey of one man tasked with the (often self-appointed tasks) of traversing the desolate desert and uniting the Arab tribes against the Ottoman Turks. This man is T.E. Lawrence who becomes \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (Peter O'Toole). Like space, the Antarctic, and the Amazon rainforest, the Arabian desert is one of those landscapes that disturbs me. I'm terrified of these vast, empty spaces where one misstep could determine the end of your life \u2014 likely in an agonizing fashion. But Director David Lean takes the terror of the expansive wasteland and makes it beautiful, and dare I say, inviting. O'Toole plays Lawrence as a soft-spoken and even coy individual. The focus of the film is his evolution from smart-ass, overly educated Lieutenant to hardened guerrilla warrior. He has to execute a man he put his life at risk to save (I.S. Johar) and one of his young servants (Michael Ray) to put him out of his misery, and helplessly watch as his other servant (John Dimech) drowns in quicksand\u2026 If this isn't enough to request a desk-job assignment, then I'm not sure what is. But Lawrence wins over warring tribes with his courage and intelligence. There are good things and bad things that happen when a movie is made in 1962. The good are the practical effects. There are mesmerizing scenes in this film, most notably the attack on Aqaba, when we first meet Ali (Omar Sherif), when Daud (Dimech) reunites with Lawrence, and when all of those beautiful horses are hopping down from the train. The bad concern \"brownface,\" which is ample in this film, and some strange decisions concerning authenticity. I don't know much about the historical accuracy of the film and don't really care, but there is virtually no Arabic in the entire movie. It gets a pass because of 1962, but it wouldn't make sense that Arabs speaking amongst each other would be using English \u2014 unfortunately, we still see these decisions in contemporary movies. However, there are some head-scratching moments that are unacceptable despite the release date. Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) chases after a plane with his sword\u2026 I get what they were trying to do here, but the Howeitat tribe had guns and knowledge of modern technology, but this scene makes them appear like a remote Amazonian tribe. My biggest gripe with the movie came towards the end where Lawrence and Ali sneak into a Turk-held city, Lawrence assaults the \"Bey\" (general) and is severely flogged before being tossed into the street. Even after reviewing the plot, I still do not understand what the plan was here. It felt like a contrived way to make Lawrence second-guess future actions, but came off as moronic, especially for someone who had been so smart with military operations up to that point. The ending is a personification of the mantra: \"It's much easier to blow up trains than to make them run on time.\" The bureaucracy of governing newly freed lands doesn't seem nearly as enticing as cutting down fleeing Turks. Lawrence of Arabia gave us the classic, \"No prisoners! No prisoners!\" (gently roll the tongue on the \"p\" for the full effect) and won Best Picture at the 35th AAs for a reason.",

I wasn't too familiar with T.E. Lawrence going into this and always appreciate when a film attempts to portray the faults of their subject in balance with their accomplishments, as there aren't many worse movies than celebratory biopics that hit all the life points of their subjects while glossing over controversy. While the actions of Lawrence, and their positive and negative consequences, are not minimized, the script was not as impressive as the aesthetic qualities for me, and I didn't feel the same emotional reaction to what I was hearing as what I was seeing. I grant this may have been an impossible ask however, coming up with a script to rival the visual beauty of this film, akin to asking one to write a placard to sit beneath the Sistine Chapel for all of time. I also have to admit I did start finally looking at the clock in the fourth hour, but a definite compliment that I never once did in the previous three.

And, unlike \"Cleopatra\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\" did not feel like if it lasted nearly 4 hours at all. The first 20 minutes may seem boring to a casual viewer, but as T.E. Lawrence gets to the desert, every scene becomes intense and interesting, full of not only breath-taking beautiful shots, but also scenes that make you  think about if there is any reference to the modern world? That is one of the reasons this movie is amazing and why it is timeless. \n\tThe portrayal of the main character by Peter O'Toole is gorgeous. Besides him being a few feet taller than T.E. Lawrence was, O'Toole looks nearly identical to his movie counterpart, even if you look at actual pictures. As well as his emotional contribution to Lawrence was realistic. Besides O'Toole, one more actor that did an outstanding job was Omar Sharif, as his portrayal of Sherif Ali, besides being one of the only characters that were fictional, was amazing. Both actors were nominated for Oscars for these roles, which is already a great add-on to seven nominations that the movie won. \nThe cinematography in the movie is stunning. The shots in the desert, the transitions, especially the one from a match to the sun. The colors in the movie are a very important part, as they set the tone for the rest of the movie. They set the mood for what war was like on a different front, a front that was not that portrayed in the cinema. As well as that, the soundtrack of the movie also gives that \"desert-like\" feeling and is great throughout the entire 3-hour 47-minute run of the film.\nThe history part of this movie is partly accurate. There are some scenes that could have never happened, and as already mentioned, a character that was fictional etc. But, besides all those cons, the movie feels like a history lesson that teaches people about why the world was called \"World War\". It shows a front that is barely included in cinema at all and opens it greatly, as never before this film have, I ever encountered a movie about Ottomans and Arabs during WWI. Besides all that, it truly shows how horrible the war was, as the emotions of T.E. Lawrence throughout the whole movie are changing, leading him to a point of feeling depressed because of what he had witnessed on the battlefield. He is struggling from violence that is being caused and from how he must commit to either Britain, either Arabia, which is clearly leads him to the conclusion in his identity. The character of Lawrence is so beautifully established and is explained so good throughout the movie, which is the reason why the movie is so interesting. As well as that, the ending will leave the viewer stunned and trying to deal with what he just saw, basically thinking the movie through even after it ended. Therefore, this movie is magnificent, and I would even say one of the best movies I have ever watched, as this is what I would call cinema magic!",

Starting with what I think most people can agree on, this movie is most certainly a technical marvel. The beautiful cinematography and amount of work put in just creating the visual aesthetic of the movie are impressive. I also think Peter O'Toole gave a truly memorable performance in this movie and I think that in general, the acting in the movie feels authentic. My main issue with the movie is that it just feels boring to me quite often, which isn't always a great thing for a movie that is nearly four hours and feels like it. I don't think anything can be taken out of the movie as it is a historical movie that covers a lot of ground, but that doesn't mean I have to find it all entertaining. Overall I feel that it's a movie with outstanding technical elements that anybody who loves cinema can't deny, but personally, I also can't ignore how much work it felt like to watch it.",

Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), a British officer based in Cairo who led a tribe of warring Arabs during World War I to fight with the Turks. During which, he recruits Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness), Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), Auda ibu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), and his military liaisons at Cairo into his crusade. The best parts of the movie are the cinematography, the editing and Maurice Jarre's score, which set up a gloriously huge scope as well as establish Lawrence's love of the desert landscape. How can you experience the desert, witness the arid atmosphere without humming the sweeping pompous theme music? I especially love Peter O'Toole's remarkable first starring role, as he works off brilliantly with the other big names. Speaking of, Alec Guinness, one of my favorite Brits, is hypnotizingly great as the Prince. Omar Sharif practically sings his part as the stern Sheriff, bringing his Middle Eastern heritage and therefore constructing authenticity in the movie's parish. Furthermore, as I watch this film, I notice the influence that this movie had and future film directors, just ask Steven Spielberg or George Lucas. David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is truly the epitome of magnificent epic ambition, so much so that it's quite hard to top. \n\n(5 Motorcycle Accidents out of 5)",

That motion picture, just a few minutes short of 4 hours long, is Lawrence of Arabia which took the award in 1963.\n\nThis movie is as breathtaking as it is long, and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Director David Lean's ability to frame the camera to convey wonder, isolation, awe, desperation and even time, is quite frankly.. staggering. The majority of this film takes place in the desert and its majesty and pristineness seem boundless. When you pair the picturesque wonder with the Maurice Jarr score, performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, it is spellbinding. To be clear, scenes shot outside the desert are also given the same attention to detail, scale and hew so they are always enhancing the tale as it unfolds. Stepping outside this complex and well acted story, one's visual and auditory senses are always being gratified in a fashion that simply heightens the entire experience.\n\nThe movie starts with a completely dark screen as the overture builds for 5 minutes. As it crescendos, you already know this motion picture experience is going to be big. And then there is light. The credits role and you watch as Thomas Edward Lawrence meets his demise in 1935! After that, the film goes back in time to tell the tale of his involvement with the Arab Revolt between 1916 and 1918. Peter O'Toole is phenomenal at bringing to life a real person who was as intelligent and brave as he was egotistical and flawed. Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness are all equally enthralling. Interestingly, women are only seen in a few background shots. There was not one female speaking character in the entire four hours.\n\nCould the film have been edited down? Sure. Should it have been edited down? Absolutely not. This production is like a good bottle of wine that needs time to breathe and be enjoyed. Lawrence's tale is a complex one and this version of it is cinematic storytelling at its finest. Without doubt, this is one of the finest films I've had the opportunity to take in.",

Peter O'Toole, with the striking blue eyes, is a quirky and exuberant leader as his plays a part in the Arabs against the Turks fight but also much bloodshed. He would end up enjoying the killing too much. O'Toole's facial show all we need to know, there is the sadness, there is the anger but there also lies the excitement of war for him. The musical score is glorious with its clear vibrancy and expression for the desert we are in. It strikes a perfect balance as between the visuals. The film is a long movie and the second half does hold more interest than the first. The start f the movie with his death and funeral poses the question did people know him and was he well liked, this is slowly answered throughout the movie. The first half has many long scenes as they walk the desert.  At times we don't need dialogue we are in awe of the spectacle we are seeing. The second half continues many raids on trains, the massacres of many people and the end in Damascus. Omar Sharif mirage entry has gone down in movie history and rightly so, its a cinematographers dream. Cleverly using the music and desert for a grand entrance. The fighting are terrifically staged , they are real and very bloody. With many extras and before CGI is very impressive. Its very real and raw. We feel we are part of it with the camera keeping us there. Lawrence was a confused character, was he a saint, did he empower the people, was he a warlord?

Many of the scenes were very confusing, such as the beginning motorcycle scene with the funeral afterwards, then straight into the story of Lawrence's time in Arabia. None of these make sense, unless the audience member knows the story of T.E. Lawrence.

For others, such as a young teenager in the twenty-first century, the story is very confusing and slow as well as not very attention grabbing.\n\tThe plot of the film starts out with Lawrence on a motorcycle, then he runs into two school boys on bikes and crashes. The scene then skips to a funeral, while for many it might seem clear that Lawrence died in the accident, it was not made entirely clear. For those who knew the history of Lawrence, knew already that he died in a motorcycle accident other don't and the immediate jump to the funeral was too fast for the audience to process he died. The immediate jump cut from the funeral to Lawrence in Cairo was also hard to process. Then for the rest of the film, the plot moves very slowly and boringly. The build up to the fighting scenes was not even worth it as the fights were barely shown and very anti-climatic. There was no sense of theatrics or drama in the fights. The film struggles to hold the audience's attention and maintain a grip on their understanding of the film. It is hard to comprehend something that is too boring to pay attention to.\n\tThe deaths of Tafas, Gasim, and Daud, especially when unknown that this film was based off of a true story, seemed completely unnecessary. The film built up these characters, letting the audience get to know them, then killed them without a second thought. It leaves a feeling of dissatisfaction and hurt in the audience's heart. It isn't even mentioned in the film's opening credits \"Based off of a True Story\" so the reader doesn't know that they have a meaning to the plot.\n\tThe film does a great job of showing different cultures and races throughout the film, especially with the different tribes, and use of Arab people throughout. The casting of Omar Sharif was a great choice, however the casting of Alec Guinness, a white man, was not. While Guinness's acting was stellar and superb, a complete white man to play an Arab Lord is not very attractive for the film. If one can cast actual Arab descent or ethnicity, why make a major role of a person of Arab ethnicity and descent played by a white man in makeup and costume? Alec Guinness might have only been put on this film for name only, as he was already a major actor before this film. \n\tHowever, this reviewer applauds the acting of Peter O'Toole (Lawrence), and Claude Rains (Mr.Dryden). O'Toole did an amazing job of showing the mental stability of Lawrence deteriorate throughout the film. His moments of, \"I am a god!\" to being taken off that pedestal are amazing to watch and were very entertaining. He does an awesome job of playing a tortured, yet intelligent man during war. Rains also did an amazing job for the few parts he was in. This actor is truly a chameleon in his acting and can play almost anything. His and O'Toole's acting might be one of the only reasons to watch this film.\n\tThis film was good in trying to tell an important story from World War I. It did a good job of showing people a story not well known about in history. The film did achieve its goal in telling the story of T.E. Lawrence, through a long three hours and forty-eight minutes. The film was certainly worth doing as it tells an important part of history in the world, but it does it so slow and non entertainingly that it is only worth it for the previously mentioned select audience to enjoy and grasp.",

David Lean is one of the most famous directors to ever work in the genre and while I respected The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) I didn't find myself caring about the characters or particularly engrossed in the story. I had the same issues with this film as I just didn't care about the main character or the events that occur around him and I felt that the film was dreadfully over long. I would still recommend that people see this film because of it's importance as a piece of cinematic history but it's a significantly flawed film that I would argue was not deserving of the Best Picture award.\n\nBritish lieutenant T.E. Lawrence, Peter O'Toole, is sent to investigate Prince Faisal, Alec Guinness, who is leading a revolt against the Turkish in an attempt to recapture Arab land. He soon becomes involved in the plight of the Arabs and suggests they attempt to capture Aqaba which they do successfully, leading to Lawrence becoming a hero. He had already been accepted by the Arabs after he risked his own life to save another but his new allegiances cause him to be an outcast within the British military. The Arabs struggle to run the nation after their victories and as Lawrence's legend grows he attracts more attention from his enemies. He is disgusted by himself after he leads a violent, bloody assault on enemies of the Arabs and decides to settle down and live a quiet life that ends in a motorcycle accident that proves to be his end.\n\nIn a film that's nearly four hours I feel that a compelling lead character is necessary and Lawrence partly fills this criteria. His conflicted nature is appealing as we see that he enjoys being violent but is horrified by his own savagery and his relationship with Sherif Ali allowed for some emotional depth to be revealed. We don't get to actually see any of his home life or how his personal conflicts tear him apart however and that stopped me from really engaging with him and seeing the conflicts portrayed in the film through his eyes. This lack of engagement caused the film to feel like a slog and even the moments that were meant to have emotional impact were dulled in their impact by how little development was behind them.\n\nThe positives of the film are the technical elements of course as the score, cinematography and editing are undeniably impressive. Maurice Jarre provides a magnificent, sweeping set of compositions that feel as epic as the film itself does. Shots of the sky and of figures slowly approaching each other across the plains give you a sense of the wide scope that this film operates on and the film manages to show the distinct visual style of the desert, unlike The English Patient (1996). The legendary Anne V. Coates cuts together so many scenes that wouldn't feel as though they had any tissue between them if it weren't for her masterful ability to piece them together so that they flow into one another beautifully. These are the aspects of the film that deserved to be rewarded and I am sure they influenced several following films that I love.\n\nI know it's a controversial opinion but I don't think that this film is an all time classic and yet because I don't like any of the other films nominated for Best Picture in 1962 I would have to give this film the honor. Why couldn't they have nominated The Miracle Worker (1962) or What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) which manage to tell fascinating stories in less than four hours. I hope that I never have to sit through this film again even while I feel proud that I have seen it at least once and been able to appreciate it for how difficult it would have been to make and how incredibly well made the film appears.",

The film made me feel and think how interesting it would be to be a foreigner in those lands during that time. I truly haven\u00e2(TM)t seen another film like it to compare it to. In terms of the writing, I enjoyed when Lawrence and another gentleman are discussing the proper way to address Lawrence and Lawrence shares his background and that his mother and father weren\u00e2(TM)t married when they have him. It\u00e2(TM)s a great moment where Lawrence is really letting this person into his life and opening up to them. My favorite scene in regard to the directing is when Lawrence and the man are talking about the proper way to address him, Lawrence is laying back in a very nonchalant and relaxed posture. It shows his comfortability with his surroundings and the people in it and his feeling that he is one of them. Regarding the editing, I appreciated the scene in the beginning of the film when Lawrence is setting up to go to Arabia. His superior says that he has a \u00e2funny sense of fun\u00e2? as Lawrence runs his hand over a match and brings it to his mouth to blow it out. The next shot is of the Arabian sun rising in the sky. The sequence was a great set up to who the character is as well as a great set up to his adventures. Acting-wise, I liked the scene when the two boys are debating throwing a rock at Lawrence\u00e2(TM)s head. You can tell exactly what they\u00e2(TM)re conversation is and what they\u00e2(TM)re thinking without them needing dialogue \u00e2\" the scene was really well acted! Overall the cinematography in the film was wonderful. I particularly enjoyed when everyone comes from out of nowhere in the desert and you can see their distance shapes in the horizon getting bigger and clearer in the attack on Acava and before you know it there\u00e2(TM)s herds of people riding at the city. For the time that this film was produced, the sound design is well done! I liked the scene when Lawrence is riding the camel and singing into the canyons, and the sound echoes off of the walls.",

From its very beginning, I was quite surprised by the amount of humor I found, not only because I didn't expect so, but also because it often works pretty well!\n\nAnother great surprise I had watching this movie is that I didn't find it boring at all despite its nearly four-hours runtime. A long runtime alone doesn't make a movie bad or weak, but it certainly doesn't help. But I really think there is almost no second that David Lean has wasted in this textbook example of epic cinema. It's quite entertaining for plenty of reasons; two of them are the fascinating cinematography that treated my eyes with some of the most jaw-dropping images I've ever seen been captured on film, and the mind-bogglingly masterful editing that is easily also one of the best I've ever seen in film.\n\nLawrence of Arabia is also surprisingly very simple despite its fiendishly complex portrait of the titular character. Actually it may be sometimes too simple for its own good, for I think the movie became superficial and shallow at the beginning of its second half for the sake of nothing but developing the character of Lawrence. There are some key events that should have been more focused on, but ended up being demonstrated comparatively quite fast and superficially. That made the second half a bit muddled, unlike the unbelievably perfect first half, but this wasn't much of an issue for me; because David Lean really make up for this simplicity by delivering a disturbing, terrifying, opulent, astute and utterly unique psychological profile of a heroic, yet flawed historical figure that is the protagonist, Lawrence. As for Peter O'Toole's performance, the only thing I could say is that I was quite mad for about the first half of the movie because how inaccurately serious-looking he appeared on the poster of the movie despite the fact he was rather good-natured, and looked quite charming. Of course, I realized that I was embarrassingly wrong when O'Toole gradually changed 100 percent to a very serious, and even seemingly mad man who struggles to find a balance in his life,nay, to discover his identity.\n\nI also want to say that I'm so so proud of Omar Sharif, who brought one of the most iconic secondary characters in the history of cinema! Alec Guinness was also terrific as Prince Faisal, although I still think he delivered his best performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, another epic from Lean. Auda Abu Tayi is one of the most blatantly greedy characters I've seen in film, and it could have never been portrayed so convincingly by other than the great actor, Anthony Quinn.\n\nIf there is only one film deserves to be described as Epic, it's Lawrence of Arabia!\n\n(9/10)",

The story is compelling and mentally confusing as you try to wrestle with what is the correct course of action that should have been taken here or there. Lawrence himself is painted as both the grand hero and the grand villain of the film as he gives in to his baser natures, though whenever this happens it is always within the confines of some kind of justice, as even when massacring the Turk army caravan, that same caravan raped and murdered a village right before they got there and everyone knew it. Lawrence is mentally having a lot of problems throughout the journey with delusions of grandeur, nervous breakdowns, and it's even possible that he is a high functioning sociopath, but the inescapable fact is that he was throughout the film looking to give the Middle East to the Arab nations and unite them under a central government. It's an interesting film that will probably take many watches for me to fully understand my own feelings about it.",

            "content": "A fantastic story of a man who dared to defy fate.\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962) is David Lean's character study of T. E. Lawrence, as well as Lean's greatest film. The cinematography consists of stunning desert vistas, brilliant lighting, innovative editing, Maurice Jarre's lovely score, and Lean's own fascinating direction. Lawrence of Arabia is what happens when a director gets everything right. Lean paints a desert canvas with blood, camels, Arabs, and sandstorms all while simulating the sensation of thirst and heat exhaustion in the Middle East.\n\nOmar Sharif is brilliant as Lawrence's companion and confidant, while simultaneously playing his foil. Sharif initially starts out as the arrogant Arab lord that thinks he has Lawrence all figured out. Sharif portrays a humbled thoughtful man with real morality and ethics, while also representing the Arabic traditions and culture with a steadfast dedication to authenticity. He is wonderful and likable in Lawrence of Arabia with an ease of natural acting that always rings true.\n\nAlec Guinness somehow pulls off Brownface as he respectfully depicts the Arabian Prince Feisal with a calm, measured intellect. Guinness makes this man feel in charge in every scene as his presence is felt. Guinness gives Prince Feisal a knowing look that reveals he understands how Lawrence feels at any given moment. This is a fascinating role for Guinness as he really captures a traditional man trying to progress and lead his people into the future.\n\nSimilarly, Anthony Quinn plays Auda abu Tayi. His proud depiction of a strong Arab leader is enjoyable and often funny. His stern face delivers clever dialogue with a formidable presence. Quinn was just a great actor given amazing material in Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nOverall, Lawrence of Arabia features several outstanding acting performances, while the real joy is in David Lean's remarkable direction. Much has been said of Lean's use of vast landscapes, far wide shots, long panning shots, slow zoom ins, and intimate close-up shots. All the praise lavished on Lean is worthy of noting. David Lean simply directing an all time classic film that will certainly entertain audiences for generations to come.\n\nThe film itself is intriguing as it is an epic historical drama that details the exploits of T. E. Lawrence, while also existing as a biopic for Lawrence. But the real impressive aspect of Lawrence of Arabia is Lean's use of the camera to lean of Peter O'Toole's phenomenal performance as T. E. Lawrence to establish the complex character study of Lawrence.\n\nWe see Lawrence as a man of action and ambition. He wants to defy destiny and free Arabia on behalf of the Arabs. His motivations are complex as he genuinely loves the desert, Arabs, and yet, he also seeks glory, fame, and faces a troubling love for murder. O'Toole's sad eyes convey a sadness for the mass amount of deaths accumulated over the span of his conquest, while his voice and movements display a confidence in his quest. Meanwhile, Lawrence also compares himself to Jesus and Moses, seeing himself as a prophet as much as the Arabs do that follow him. Lawrence is a complicated man of stunning ambition, humbling bravery, creative ingenuity, deep compassion, kindly mercy, and frightening aptitude for killing.",

The film would be too long for anyone to sit through. The main character doesn't make much sense. Thankfully, it was screened in 1962, and the outcome is a masterpiece of the highest level.\n\nThe most captivating aspect of this film is Lawrence himself, portrayed effortlessly by Peter O'Toole. Lawrence is unconventional in every sense. He has no clear motive for doing what he does and he is always second-guessing himself. One moment he loves the desert, the next moment he never wants to see it again, and the moment after he's back without a qualm. That internal conflict happens not once, but twice within the movie. He's not sure how he wants to see himself. Almost ridiculously, he wants his followers to view him as a God-like figure who writes the future himself. However, he is also horrified by his willingness to deal out judgment. Additionally, his ambitions are so high, that he lets himself down in the end, even though he technically achieves his goal.\n\nThe scope of the desert, beautifully captured by F.A. Young, can be viewed as an analogy to Lawrence himself. Perhaps the reason for his obsession with desert life is that he wants to be portrayed like the desert: a fearsome expanse of power, dominated by towering landscapes that no man can persuade to change.\n\nIn short, Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that needs to be viewed by more filmgoers. Its cinematography and plot structure heavily influenced future epics such as Gandhi and The Lord of the Rings.",

I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film.\n\nAs for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. It's an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in Lawrence himself. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to shattered shell. We get plenty to think about, long after the credits have finally, mercifully rolled, but it's a marathon to reach that point.\n\nA Best Picture winner that's technically marvelous, thematically challenging and open-minded, but the ending left me feeling cold and there's really no excuse for it to run for as long as it does.",

It is an Art film that appeals to the masses.\n'Lawrence of Arabia' is a four hour film that feels too short and it grips the viewer throughout. \nWhat makes Lean's work even more impressive is that he made a populist movie about a man we never get to know. At one point, a soldier, on seeing Lawrence on the other side of the Suez canal, shouts across to him 'Who are you?' Lawrence stares blankly into space because he cannot answer the question.

            "content": "Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean, is undoubtedly a long watch, however, the viewers who make it through will not regret it. The film uses its many strengths--the grand cinematography, an epic score, an intriguing and aesthetically pleasing setting, and above all, a wonderfully complex main character--to engage its audience the entire runtime. The film stars Peter O\u2019Toole as the title character, Lawrence. Based on the true story, of Thomas Edward (T.E.) Lawrence, the story sets off after he is recognized for his well roundedness on the native Bedouin tribes and gets sent, very gleefully, to Arabia to determine the intentions of Prince Faisal. In the beginning of the movie, Lawrence appears to be smart, charming, kind-natured, just a little odd. But there is something innocent-seeming about his slight ignorance. Although I am not one for historical dramas or particularly three and a half hour movies, I was immediately drawn in through the character, which is a part of what makes the film so remarkable. You don\u2019t need to love the genre to love the movie. Throughout the rest of the film, Lawrence\u2019s character develops. For the first half, he is making allies--winning over nearly everyone he meets at some point, impressive decisions, and even sacrifices. When everyone ignores the discovery of his absence, Lawrence goes back to save Gasim, one of his accompanying travelers, when he falls of his camel at night. He risked getting lost and the high chance of death. Even though it becomes clear that Lawrence is aware of his power and strength, becoming more and more self-praising, the audience can\u2019t deny it either. He truly becomes a fearless leader, and a seemingly unstoppable one. He even compares himself to Moses and later chastises of someone for doubting him, saying \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m just anybody...do you?\u201d Further along though, things get take an unexpected route. When Lawrence and his army of Arab men stay at the Howeitat tribe, Gasim, the very man Lawrence went back to save, kills of of the Howeitat men out of a blood feud. In order to keep the alliance between the tribes, Lawrence executes him immediately afterward. While not unjustified, his actions were unexpected and changed my entire perspective of him. He seemed less of a God-like figure and more like any other war leader. What\u2019s even more unexpected, later, Lawrence actually confesses that he enjoyed murdering him. His facade begins to fade as he lies to the Arabs and even has a breaking point where he completely gives up. Although there is always justification or reasoning for his actions, you never know what to think of Lawrence. Even to this point in writing this review, I am still trying to figure out his character and his morals. Aside from him though, there were many other factors in the successful outcome of the film. Tension and general uneasiness is crafted very skillfully through the depiction of the desert--by far one of the most effective aspects of the film. When Lawrence and his Bedouin guide are drinking from a well, the faint figure of Sherif Ali suspensefully, and silently, approaches in the background. There is absolutely no certainty of what will happen. The soundtrack also guides the story. While the triumphant parts of the score and energetic and engaging, the tenser parts are more impressive as they tend to be edited precisely with the scene itself. For example, the music often appears to be pulsing with sun in the desert scenes. Whiles others may be fans of the classic for its historical story, that doesn\u2019t need to be the case. While I certainly enjoyed the historical aspects of the story, for me, it was far more of a character study, resulting in a wonderfully executed, genuinely amazing film.",

Despite its outrageous runtime of 4 hours, the film showcases cinematography and special effects more advanced than technologically-enhanced recent releases. The desert scenes and horseback battles are spectacular to watch and the dialogue is so well written it proves truly ahead of its time. It's portrayal of the Arab culture is not offensive or stereotypical which can't be said for most films released after 9/11.

I have to grant this movie one thing, unlike most other epic historical films I've seen, it gave me a clear protagonist and a personal story that made me care about all the big events happening around him. Lawrence is a very engaging character, and stands out as unique from the other British officers he works with. Peter O'Toole delivers an spectacular performance. \n\nUnfortunately, despite my best efforts, I just couldn't hold interest in this story for the full runtime. If it was only the first half I would have called it brilliant, and a superb historical film. That entire first half seemed to be building towards a specific goal and had some great moments. But the second half seemed to lose direction. It felt like it was split up into a number of vignettes instead of having a singular focus. There were select moments or scenes in the later part of the film that worked but I was in danger of boredom.\n\nThe visuals in Lawrence of Arabia are breath-taking. I never thought desert could look so amazing, but they capture the beauty in the scenery. You get a genuine feel of being there in the desert, and can sense the dangers surrounding the characters at all times. Some of these big sweeping shots are truly iconic. And equally as iconic is that music. The score from Maurice Jarre is one I recognized without ever seeing the film. It is a truly legendary piece of music and sets a tone that fits the story well.\n\nI wish I was more of a history nerd so I knew better what was going on in every beat of Lawrence of Arabia. I think I followed most of it, but there were some people (like Alec Guinness' racially questionable character) whose role I kept struggling to figure out. I sensed there were a number of underlying agendas that I wasn't picking up on. But the important part I understood. I certainly didn't actively dislike Lawrence of Arabia, in fact for awhile I was loving it. I just felt with a little more focus and a little less time it might have worked better for me.",

Like Lawrence's personality and his politics, as a poet he aimed to give equal voice to (in his time, dying; in our time, dead) the heroic Romance and, at the same time, (in his time, burgeoning; in our time, post-) the bleak and introspective Modernist. Like horizon landscapes that make up so much of the movie, as Lawrence balances between where sand meets sky, on one side (bright and empty) is a 19th C. hope in man's enlightenment, while on the other (filthy and dry) is a 20th C. arthouse nihilism. Lawrence, as the film notes, is a double-edge sword, cutting both ways, wielded by two masters, but like Joyce his contemporary, servant to none. Which is to say, the film-notably split down the middle, between the action of its first exhilarating half, and the stultification of its bureaucratic ending-is Lawrence through and through.",

Man, that desert search scene.\n\nLawrence, a Britishman has practicly nothing but manage to assemble loads of men, warriors, fighters. How? Well, he is very trustworthy, kind and knows how to interact with people. He always has an answer and he builds his army slowly by befriending enemies. There are naturally a cooperation between the Britishmen and the Arabs and the Turks and they're Ottoman Empire are the badguys here. Lawrence collects different tribes of the Arabs to make sure they reached Damascus after several other defeated areas. Why, you say? Well I'm not really sure, but he was put in the place to check the situation down there, being a liaison, by command from the British army, and I guess he figured he wanted to change a thing or two there.\n\nAmazing performance by O'Toole and a brilliant story. It's very long. Actually so long that my tealights that I lit in it's opening scenes nearly went out. Three and a half hours. That's a long time. I had my moments where I went off screen for shorter periods, since this is no rapid film - it's quite slow paced, but there is a constant development so it never feels flat.\n\nBig production. Loads of men and horses. What there is little of here is women, though. There are only a handful of them on screen for seconds only and there are no words given out by any lady. That's some special stuff indeed.\n\nI did like the moment after two hours plus a lot, called \"intermission\" - two or three minutes with a black screen and music. Great music by the way, the theme score is both unforgettable and fitting.\n\nBig film, a little dissapointment but still a very good film, worth a go when you really have the time for it.

What goes right for it is the solid base material, extravagant production design and a start-of-art output from all its technical departments, but a big letdown from the acting front. \n\nFollows a brief but an influential episode of British Army personnel T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) based on his exploits during WWI to negotiate and lay a pathway between British and Arab interests. Also takes on his relationship with the feuding tribal leaders Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). His wavering loyalties between British and Arabs and how he becomes a pawn in a bigger political game played by Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) and General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) where they use him to take over Damascus thus dissolving the tricky Arab revolt. \n\nPeter O'Toole has the best lines in the movie and he delivers them with the requisite wickedness but his awkward poise and body language makes it hard to digest him as a war hero in the making. Occasionally Omar Sharif and most other small time Arab characters have given a horrendous performance diluting the epic scale production to a B-grade ripoff. The set pieces, number of personnel used combined with equal number of camels and horses would have made it a very complex project to produce but the final product has come out in flying colors. The cinematography and the desert locations were exotic and exquisite while the battle sequences which are neither gory nor inspires awe are saved by sweeping background score that perfectly compliments and elevates the drama. Though adapted from Lawrence's own writing, his fears and dilemma could have been more realistic than dramatic - it looked like what's referred metaphorically were shown literally. \n\nWhile its a visual marvel telling a complex and celebrated story, performances left a lot to be desired",

In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it's use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.\n\nWhen one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.\n\nSet against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.\n\nAt almost four hours it's hard to imagine a film that wouldn't feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.\n\nThe film deals with age old themes such as the \"fish out of water\" theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the Arab culture, Water is so precious it's worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.\n\nUtilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it's masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",

The scale of this epic goes on for miles, the world that this movie is able to create is a treat to admire. The land and people that Lawrence and his Arab army come in contact with give this film endless entertainment and manages to make a viewer constantly invested. There's a huge adventure at the helm of it all that everyone watching feels like they experience due to the incredible characters who feel like someone you know. The writers were great enough to treat us with humane and interesting characters that only make this movie relatable. Lawrence throughout the movie feels like an ordinary person to himself but doesn't see the full picture of himself, which a normal human being understands what that's like. Lawrence is a real hero despite his controversial acts of violence because he is a normal human that is able to conquer extraordinary goals for the good of others and not just himself. He's vulnerable and gets scared and portrays himself to be a real person rather than just a character in a script. The performance by Peter O'Toole is one of the best because he doesn't look like he's portraying a character, but actually being the character himself. The side performances are incredible as well and memorable as Lawrence himself. This film is a movie buff/film makers dream due to the incredible story portrayed by the sets and actors and is an inspiration. This is one of those special works of cinema that is considered an artistic masterpiece. The film is beautiful beyond belief and has everything that you could want or expect and then some.

The most fascinating element is how Lawrence experiences with his own opportunities in and out of battles. Peter O' Toole creates possibly the most fascinating character in all of cinema-ranks with Robert De Niro in TAXI DRIVER. Truly impressive Cinematography (Freddie Young), and searing lead performance. A miracle of a movie.

The quality makes the film even more marvelous to look at. The camera lingers on each location with sweeping visuals and panoramic shots, adding to the theatrical effect. \n\nPeter O'Tool is the perfect choice for Lawrence. He has a humble savoir complex but you can admire him for it. Even when he isn't good, he's portrayed in an innocent way instead of violent. He approaches death and the act of killing with a morbid curiosity and not obsession or indifference. When he shoots several Turks later on in the film it's like he's completely removed from the moment. He's like that through the whole film. In every scene he seems both crazy and sane, like he's always on the verge of a nervous breakdown but he has the strength of character to never cross the line. A very dramatic performance supported by the brilliant and poetic dialogue. \n\nEvery actor is good in this. The most important supporting actors, in my opinion, were the two teenagers who journey with him at the beginning. I think that relationship more than any other established Lawrence as someone worthy of the praise he gets later on in the film. \n\nWhat really makes the movie great for me is how you get carried away by how epic and important the experience feels, like a a big budget WWII production, but for most of the film it's just men wrapped in sheets riding through the desert on camels. It kind of has a post-apocalyptic vibe to it, like the setting of Fist of The North Star. Also worth mentioning is the memorable theme song. many filmmakers underestimate the importance of a catchy song for a movie about a hero. Look look at James Bond and Indiana Jones.",

In this movie, we can see not only Lawrence's gentle attitude toward Arabs but also self-doubt until in the end. So I guess this is one of the most interesting movies about the Arabs  WW?,and as a biography.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, you will see the funeral of Lawrence and he is evaluated as both a great and a rude man by attendants and main act of the film starts off with his senior's recollections. \n\nLawrence was a commander, who was tasked with providing assistance to the Arabs in their battle against the Turks.\nHe was British but had an idea to establish the Arab's own country, so he started gathering tribes in the area and organizing the military. As a result, Lawrence and the Arab army could succeed in some operations. Finally, he occupied Damascus and held meeting of many tribes. But what makes us regretful is Lawrence's cruel act when he killed soldiers who had surrendered and he seemed to be possessed by his own ambitions.\n   After the war, the U.K and France tried to negotiate with the Arabs about the territory, seeking benefits, so his ambition failed.\n\nAmong the Arab tribes, Lawrence wore same clothes as them and also behaved as they did. Furthermore, we can see he did not discriminate against them and seemed to put himself in Arabs shoes. That would be why he was accepted in the Arab society. But, also we can see his agony because of the difference between reality and his ideal.",

Much praise much be given to the style and direction of the cinematographer , the sound editors , the costume designers and all those thousands of extras used in the film so much so as a film of this scope in today's world will arguably be the biggest budget movie produced. The story follows the titular character's journey  through the length of the film , the rise and the disintegration and finally a sense of redemption. It tackles complex thematic material which are very subtle  and nicely done through the expressions of Peter O'Toole. The cinema production spent enough time on getting the timeless feature of this feature making the technicalities of the film as close to perfect as it possibly can be.The outstanding score written by Maurice Jarre runs through the threads of the movie.

Literally, because this film was one of the first films, if not the first popular film (72nd highest grossing film of all time) to film in 70mm film, instead of filming in 35mm and then blowing it up. What this allowed for was some magnificent shots of the desert, complete with visible heat waves and blowing sand, images too complex to be seen on a regular television. I saw this movie in a theater, which is a must for true film lovers, according to Roger Ebert. The detail was breathtaking. Most people's complaint about this movie is that it is too long, with too many shots of people walking through the desert. Those people's problem is that they are focusing on the characters, and not the desert behind them. On TV it's hard to understand what's so great about people walking through the desert. On a big screen, it is brought to vivid life with immense detail. However, after seeing it in theaters then watching it again on TV, I felt like I was being cheated. That doesn't take away from its story though, which is the main aspect of the film. That, and Peter O'Toole's performance, which was criminally overlooked by the Academy. No one else could have played the role properly. The story is very intriguing, even more so because most of it actually happened. It even feels like the movie left some parts out of the story, even at 4 hours! The dialogue is not the greatest, and mostly exists to advance the plot forward. However, these are just quibbles in an excellent film with nearly great acting, excellent directing, and some of the best cinematography in movie history. It is truly a film masterpiece!",

The famous theme is found with a fitting score provided. The characters have also been successfully cast. Whilst Peter O'Toole gets the most acclaim for his role, it should not go without forgetting Omar Sharif who portrays someone as interesting as O'Toole's T.E. Lawrence. As well as the dialogue, both stars are exceptionally good at showing their feelings through their facial expressions. As the film progresses, you can really work out what is going on within Lawrence's mind and the struggles he encounters.\nHowever, all what is written above is not what caught my interest. The cinematography award couldn't have gone to a better film that year. Whether it's desert or building, it is beautiful to watch. For a film made it in the early 60's, it is quite something to see so much of the natural Earth on show. The picture is shot in a way that gives you a real sense of how it was to travel under the hot sun, and at times makes you want to be there.

What makes it stand above other epic films of the 50's and early 60's is that it combines the broad filmmaking elements of John Ford and Cecil B. DeMille with the introspective ones of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. Instead of just watching a landscape, we witness one man redefining the landscape. We see T.E. Lawrence, an Englishman already an outsider to his own culture in many ways, stepping foot into Arab culture and transforming it, not by presenting British customs to the people, but by unleashing his personality - egocentric, insecure, ruthless, violent, clever, humble and sympathetic all at once. This is what made him such a transforming figure of World War I and such an incredible icon to witness on the big screen. The stupendous performance by Peter O' Toole is a large contributing factor. The cinematography (including the very first color mirage on film) is still impressive by today's standards, proving nature to be far more captivating onscreen than computer graphics.",

Director, David Lean, has created one of the most memorable films and it still stands amongst the best movies in history more than 50 years after its creation. Lawrence of Arabia is the go to movie when you want to make an epic film because it has it all. My only complaint for this film is its running time (almost four hours long), but Lean deliberately directed it this way because he wanted the audience to experience the lengthy and difficult journey through the desert. The heat and the dryness of the desert transcend the film and the audience is expected to experience it first hand. It is not an easy film to watch, it requires your full attention and the pacing at times is deliberately slow. The characters are flawed and their motivations aren't always easy to follow. It is a complex film, but the journey is one worth taking. Lean took a huge risk by directing such a big film that wasn't going to be easy to produce, but the grandeur of it, is what made this such a memorable film. This is a masterpiece considering it does everything absolutely right, but it isn't exactly entertaining throughout its entire runtime. I still prefer Ben Hur, another epic film which I found much more entertaining, but I know this is a much more perfect film which delivers in all the technical aspects. When thinking of this ambitious and epic film it will be very hard to forget the gorgeous and magnificent scenery which hasn't seemed to age one bit. This is a film that could've been a disaster in the making, but Lean pulled it off masterfully delivering a masterpiece.\n\nBased on the life of Thomas Edward Lawrence, the screenplay was successfully adapted from his autobiographical book by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole)  is a British intelligence officer serving in Cairo during World War I. He is assigned on a mission to assess Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) who is revolting against the Turks, and therefore assisting the allies. This is where Lawrence's long journey begins. Once he meets with Prince Faisal he immediately catches his attention for being outspoken and unconventional. Against the advice of other British officials, Lawrence recommends the Prince make a surprise attack at Aqaba which was a strategic port held by the Turks. Lawrence convinces the Prince to provide him with only 50 men to make a surprise attack by land. He allows Lawrence to take some of his men led by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) and together they embark on another dangerous journey through the Nefud desert. On their way they encounter Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of a powerful local tribe, and Lawrence convinces his men to join the cause. Thanks to this strategic allegiance, Lawrence manages to overtake Aqaba, and soon he becomes a respected man among the Arabs and a center figure in their war against the Turks. \n\nThe film centers on Peter O'Toole's lead performance and he delivers. He plays a complex character who makes some strategic decisions, but who also is conflicted about his allegiance to the British army. The journeys in camels across these dry and hot deserts are beautifully shot. The cinematography was way ahead of its time and the scenery was captured marvelously. The score also plays an important role in this film and it's no surprise it remains as one of the best scores in film history. Lawrence of Arabia is just a stunning film that delivers in all the categories. It won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, but unfortunately O'Toole and Omar Sharif didn't win for their great performances. The dynamic relationship between both their characters was also the heart and soul of this film. I'd include Anthony Quinn in the mix as well considering his character provided some well needed comedic relief. The mid section of this film was the most entertaining, while the opening and closing sequences lacked better pacing. It is an astonishing film to look at and the characters are captivating. If the film weren't so long I might have enjoyed it more, but I have to agree this is a perfectly executed epic film.",

            "content": "\"We can't fight a bloody war without bloody artillery.\"\r\n\r\nI've reviewed many films on RT, and I've just realized, I've never reviewed a Best Picture winner. I've reviewed films that were nominated for the award, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Music Man, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and Sunset Boulevard, but I've never reviewed an actual Best Picture winner... until now. David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, based on the true story of military leader TE Lawrence, clearly defines the term of the word epic. What follows is a four-hour journey of brutality, heroics, and complexity that the film deserved to win Best Picture, even if I preferred fellow nominee To Kill a Mockingbird a little more.\r\n\r\nTE Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, in his film debut) is a bored, but fun-loving British officer who enjoys a good adventure. He's called upon by General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) to travel to the country of Arabia to aid Prince Fiesal (Alec Guinness) in the Arab revolt against the Turks. Lawrence gains trust from Fiesal, concern from Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif, in his film debut as well), and confidence from fellow Arab leader Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Together, Lawrence bands the Arabs together and leads them in a rebellion against the Turkish empire, unaware that his quest for power will drive him mad.\r\n\r\nOther stars appearing in Lawrence of Arabia includes Claude Rains as military helper Dryden and Jose Ferrer as a sadistic Turkish Bey who shows up in one of the screen's most disturbing torture sequences.\r\n\r\nLooking back at my experience from this film, it's hard to put my opinions on this film into clear words, cause Lawrence of Arabia is one, ginormous, stunning epic. I was disappointed in some of the things David Lean decided on in Great Expectations, but in Lawrence of Arabia, Lean shows how brilliant of a filmmaker he really was. Because of how excellent this film was in Lean's epic style of filmmaking, he influenced future directors in Hollywood, such as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nThe character of TE Lawrence is one of the most complex characters I've seen in film. He starts off as a happy, free-spirited, fun-loving Englishman who loves heroics and the desert, but is transformed into a crazy lunatic in the second half. I don't know what to think of how insane Lawrence really was, but either way, his performance by Peter O'Toole is portrayed brilliantly. What's original about the film is it begins where Lawrence dies, and picks up what made the character famous. Lawrence's opening scene is fantastic (\"The trick, Mr. Potter, is not minding that it hurts.\") and his performance is fantastic for a screen debut. People have cried foul over the years that he lost the Best Actor award to Gregory Peck, but if you look at Peck's performance from To Kill a Mockingbird, Peck's win was well-deserved. But O'Toole plays the part of Lawrence mighty well. If this film was released in a different year apart from To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm 100% confident that O'Toole would have won that Oscar. Omar Sharif is fantastic as Sherif Ali and his chemistry with O'Toole is brilliant. Alec Guinness is fantastic as always as Prince Fiesar, Jose Ferrer is chilling in his one scene as the Turkish Bey, and Claude Rains, in one of his final roles, delights as the old officer Dryden. Lawrence of Arabia has one of the most epic castings out there, and Lean picked a talented group of actors in the roles.\r\n\r\nEven more stunning in this delightful epic is the cinematography. It's some of the best cinematography ever shot in a film. The cinematographer, I don't know his name, shows us phenomenal shots of the deserts of Arabia and wows in the widescreen panoramic shots of Lawrence's army in action, My favorite sequence is when Lawrence blows up the Turkish railways. I also enjoyed the sequence towards the end where Lawrence goes on a rampage and hollers \"NO PRISONERS!\" An interesting thing about the cinematography: the crew didn't have the right technology to film at night, so when Lean had to film nighttime scenes, the crew dimmed the focus on the cameras and filmed the night scenes in broad daylight. While you can tell that now when watching it today, the uniqueness of Lean's idea and perseverance of getting the job done makes Lawrence of Arabia that more special.\r\n\r\nLast thing to note about the film is the score by Maurice Jarre, I believe is his name. The score is fantastic. The heroic Lawrence theme is memorable and heroic, and the whole score adds into the epicness of the story. Some moments I believe inspired future composers like John Williams, Howard Shore, and Michael Giacchino.\r\n\r\nIt's called the \"epic of all epics\", and while I believe Ben-Hur deserves the title more, Lawrence of Arabia is a fantastic epic, and deserving of the word, with a brilliant and chilling performance from Peter O'Toole, phenomenal cinematography, fantastic direction from David Lean, an epic score, and a story that delights in heart and heroics. It's a deserving winner of Best Picture, and man, they don't make epics like they used to.\r\n\r\nRIP Peter O'Toole",

Who is Lawrence? To which nation does he belong? The solution to this identity crisis is left up to the viewer to decide. There is so much to like and so much to see and hear in this film that I will no doubt be seeing it again, and it is deservedly considered one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nGrade: A",

The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs.\n\nThe major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence.\n\nIt's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact.\n\nBut, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring.\n\nAlso, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway?\n\nThese are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long.\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/5818821692620800/5878607637381120/Film/Lawrence_of_Arabia",

The film takes several details of many movies, but with a greater potential: there's a lot of actors, a lot of story-scenarios, a lot of landscapes, a lot of story, a lot of ambitions, and of course, a lot of runtime. Many call Lawrence \"the epic of epics\"...yeah, it is a great epic, but...I have seen others with greater size and scope, like The Ten Commandments. Don't get me wrong, this is still a great epic, one of the greatest, but i don't think this IS the greatest of all. We all have opinions, and mine is that Lawrence is just \"close\" to be the best epic.\r\n\r\nFor what I heard, the depiction of Lawrence is barely half-accurate. Isn't that supposed to be the center of this movie? Other problems I have is that the story, through understandable, is convulted. Sure this story is based on real events, but a movie is done so it can be told easily, not more confusing. Another problem I have with this movie is that it doesn't let us breathe on these events the enough. I mean every time Lawrence is on something, it does well on leaving us some landscapes and crisp explanation to be connected, but this is only in the first part of the movie. The second part seems bothered with showing more up-close Lawrence on it. It's inconsistent, and I would've had a much better experience if the second part could also let us breathe on itself. But the rest done in this movie is just perfect.\r\n\r\nLawrence of Arabia is a great epic, even if some of the depictions of the title character are questionable; it never stops being a wonderful, big, brilliant epic. A movie every cine-phile must see.\r\n\r\nLikes for killing. Because fuck you guys.",

David Lean's prodigal way of filming the desert, from the smallest grain of sand to the Empty Quarter large space, delivers not only the masterpiece of its time but the masterpiece of all time. So why is the movie a big deal? It is one because of the performances given by the 3 all-time stars, O'toole, Sharif and Quinn.

Sure, it probably could've been edited so there wasn't so much walking through a desert, but it does take you on a journey.

The stand out performance of course is by Peter O'Tool as T.E. Lawrence, he plays him in such an interesting way that you can never be sure if he is crazy or just lucky.

It inspired both Martin Scorcese and Steven Spielberg to become directors and is my favourite film, that is pretty darn amazing for me! Amazing in all aspects the film boasts incredible direction by David Lean who deserved every Oscar and BAFTA he got. It is an incredibly hard thing to do to make a film as bold and dramatic as this but Lean and Spiegel re-established the boundary for Bio-pics, epics and most importantly the art of Film-making itself. What makes the film so good is the scale of it. Michael Bay when given a big budget can make the worst film in the world, but when David Lean is given half the budget he creates this. Shot on location in 156 days the film won seven academy awards and eleven BAFTA's. Peter O Toole in his breakthrough first screen role played the character of TE Lawrence very well, balancing the hero and courageous side of Lawrence with the slightly insane, wants to be left alone side. The character of Lawrence himself is a very strange person and the portrayal of him by Toole in the film has long been argued, especially by Lawrence's official autobiographer, who made many changes to the screenplay especially Lawrence's dialogue. But in my opinion he did a really good job. The real honour should go to David Lean who directed the piece and the beautiful cinematography. \nTruly the best film ever, I recommend you watch it again and again but with breaks.",

            "content": "Lawrence of Arabia finds itself in a tricky spot in cinema history, both in terms of its chronological date and the legacy it leaves behind. The film was made in the early 60s the exact point where old Hollywood began to die and the new sprung up, and it is hopelessly stuck between the two. The film was shot ambitiously in an exotic and unforgiving location near Jordan in Israel, and featured a limited respect and understanding of the foreign culture which dominates much of the film at least as much was possible while still being a Hollywood film at the time. It features Omar Sharif at the time merely a popular Middle Eastern Actor unknown to American audience in a major supporting role as a character who is portrayed as dangerous but ultimately human and relatable. But it also features British Actor Alec Guinness and White/Latino Actor Anthony Quinn in brown face as two different and admittedly muted but still offensive Arab stereotypes. But much of this is surprisingly forgivable and can be chalked up to being a product of its time the real question is how does the film handle its subject of the imposingly controversial TE Lawrence. David Lean and Sam Spiegel were no strangers to tackling difficult subject material, their previous hit war film Bride on the River Kwai featured an equally ambiguous male military lead whose ethical ground was largely up to interpretation but how they handled one of the most sensational and famous British military figures of all time would be the true test of their skill. How did it work out? Does the film succeed or fail and depending on the answer why is it viewed as one of the best of all time yet so rarely discussed? Let's take a look, but remember nothing is written.\n\nAs mentioned the film covers the life and military exploits of Major TE Lawrence (O'Toole), a flamboyant and driven military officer who at a very young age thanks to his dry wit which alienated other officers found himself sent to the Arab front of WWI with the improbable task of helping to organize them against the Turks under British command. Upon arrival Lawrence's admiration for the Islamic Culture of the Arabs and unbridled ambition impressed Prince Feisal (Guinness) who in turn started relying on him over his superior officers intended to advise him. So much so he looks the other way when Lawrence takes higher up Sherif Ali (Omar Sherif) and a small battalion of men and leads them across miles of unforgiving Desert in an insane gambit to take the fortified base of Aqaba which is a key portal through the country. Through sheer force of will Lawrence and his men with the help of Auda abu Tayi's rival tribe (Anthony Quinn) take the city and Lawrence wins the respect and loyalty of the Arab people as well as military prominence as a rising officer. He is given leave to launch a successful campaign against Turkish railways by politically minded General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) but things take a turn for the ugly after he is captured and tortured by the sadistic Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer). In the end destruction and madness would be Lawrence's defining traits as his campaign became reprehensibly brutal and his desire to leave the army for good and the refusal of his COs to let him drove him past the brink of sanity. But the film attempts to paint a picture of the whole man and largely succeeds.\n\nYeah if it's not clear at this point I really like this movie. Not without its flaws it earns its title of a Hollywood epic in every way with a sweeping but ultimately justified run time that is seamlessly divided into two thematic if not equal in time parts. The first half of the film tells the story of Lawrence as a rising idealist and a young man and supplies the arresting visuals to boot. Over 50 years later the grand shots of the desert Lean went to great lengths to attain are still breathtaking and portray its grandeur and allure as no film successfully had. The first half might be my favorite but it's a hard fought battle, but the beginning has this more epic feel much like life itself in its beginnings. It stands on a smaller scale and yet every move and action seems to have more weight which gives it a smoother narrative cohesion and a more legendary feel. The events of the first half were documented only by Lawrence himself and as such have the feeling of anecdotes told for the purpose of self aggrandizement replete with Lawrence's witty retorts and glib moralistic suppositions at every question or statement posed at him but once Lawrence is forced to take the step of gunning down a man in cold blood we start to see the change and the real man poking through. During the second half which was also documented by other soldiers and Lowell Powell who made Lawrence internationally famous we see Lawrence start to lose it from the power and importance that was thrust upon him at his desire which he suddenly finds he does not want. In an interesting touch his flowing white robes he begins to wear grow thinner and thinner as he starts to lose his power and mental stability. Yes while the first may seem like British Pride in one of their most talked about citizens run amok, but in the second half we see Lean's characteristic no holds barred assessment of military figures come into play and Lawrence's behavior and legacy is called into a sharper alignment with reality.  And none of this would have been possible without Peter O'Toole's legendary performance to guide the character through his charismatic and flamboyant highs and his crushing heart rending lows with the grace and range O'Toole would come to be known for. In fact the cast in pretty all around fantastic here particularly Omar Sherif as an Arab who desires democracy for his country and Anthony Quinn as a boisterous war mongering Arab leader even if he and Guinness's use of brown face is quite uncomfortable.\n\nI think the brown face and length are ultimately what keep this film from being more frequently discussed because it has otherwise aged quite well and lends itself to discussion. It features some of the best directing from the time of its release and a story told with surprising depth and balance about the nature of military life and by consequence life in general through one of the more sensation figures on the 20th Century. As always it is mercifully or frustratingly depending on your opinion clouded in obscurity by featuring plenty of dialogue being thrown around and therefore points being made about the morality and ultimately value of its subject and as such will engender multiple interpretations of its story. It is a film that is both life affirming and cynically depressing and when viewed actively leaves a mark like few others can. Ultimately I was torn on TE Lawrence as the movie presents him and I view the man in the film as one who is ultimately idealistic and has good and noble intentions that are bogged down by his flair for the dramatic and ultimately destroyed when he is horribly tortured and broken. The one thing about this movie I can irrevocably say is its presentation of the desert is one of my favorites, and after seeing it in glorious (restored) Technicolor you have to wonder how the real thing compares.",

            "content": "Well, Peter O'Toole just died, so I'm going to write a full review of Lawrence of Arabia in his honor. This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and is pretty much recognized worldwide as one of the best movies ever made, so I think it's fitting. O'Toole never won an Academy Award, and is the most-nominated actor to never have won an Oscar. This will probably go down in history as one of the great injustices in Hollywood history, seeing as he starred in Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter, My Favorite Year, and countless other classics. He will be missed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Lawrence of Arabia... wow. What can be said that hasn't been said already? This is truly the epic to end all epics, a spectacular cinematic achievement on such an incredible level that it rivals The Godfather and Citizen Kane's claims to \"best film of all time.\" The true story of T.E. Lawrence, the British officer who united the Arabs to defeat the Ottoman Turks in World War I. This movie is not only a shockingly good character study, but it has some of the best action sequences ever, including the storming of the city of Aqaba and a grandiose train derailment. All of these scenes are shot with the sweepingly epic camera angles that one would expect from a David Lean movie. The first time Lawrence sets foot in Arabia is one of the best-filmed moments in film history, and fully captures that vastness and emptiness of the desert. Rarely will you find cinematography as beautiful as this. It puts the desert right in your living room.\r\n\r\nO'Toole is spectacular as Lawrence, who starts off as a mild-mannered and clumsy British officer who grows to be one of the most formidable and influential figures of the 20th century. He also develops an insatiable bloodlust, a product of his environment-- the butchery and overbearing terrain of the Middle East is enough to make anyone insane. His character has the added value of being aware of his transformation, which genuinely unsettles him. The best example of this is where he saves a man's life by turning back and traversing the desert for him, and is then forced to execute him later on to prevent a tribal blood feud. Lawrence, and the movie itself, question the moral code of warfare, and whether or not there is any. O'Toole's facial expressions and delivery are great, and he conveys his conflicted soul to the audience impeccably. This is one of the best performances of all time.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also great-- Alec Guinness, another of the greatest actors of our time, brings his A-game with an unexpected yet fantastic turn as Prince Faisal, a Bedouin who knows the outcome of the war before it even starts: No matter who wins, the Arabs lose. Meanwhile, Omar Sharif plays a hothead Arab with a spectacular 'stache who is forced to team up with Lawrence in several of his guerrilla attacks. These actors are both amazing, and bring two powerful personalities to the movie. Sharif is young and idealistic, much like Lawrence, but their two different upbringings make them initially cold and distant from each other. They both have serious disdain for each other's culture, which makes their friendship all the more entertaining. Meanwhile, Guinness is older and wiser than most of the other characters, and wants to do what is best for his people. But at the same time, it is all for naught, because (as any history buff knows) the British move in to fill the power vacuum left by the Ottomans.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Lawrence of Arabia works also as an educational film, giving the audience some serious political drama, especially towards the end. This movie should be shown in every history class around the world, as it takes a decidedly sympathetic stance towards the Arabs, which is not something that's being taught much here in America... and especially not in the South. Historical drama is a soft spot for me, because at the end of the day, history is a lot more interesting than what's going on in the world right now. The way the British used Lawrence as a means to conquer the Arabs is one of the great injustices of our time, and paved the way for a lot of the problems the Middle East has now. Also, the culture clash between Lawrence and his Bedouin horde is extremely well-written, and sometimes verges on dark comedy. And it's good to know that at least one Brit was able to throw aside cultural expectations and get shit done. By the end of the movie, Lawrence identifies more with the Arabs than his kin.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Lawrence of Arabia: THE COVETED DIEGO TUTWEILLER 10/10 STARS. I wouldn't call any movie perfect, but this one comes close with sweeping action, beautiful scenery, and some of the best performances from three of the greatest actors of all time. Yeah, Peter O'Toole was snubbed for this one, but nobody should really care, because this movie (and his performance) has stood the test of time. This spectacular and haunting epic was unprecedented in 1962, and it has not been matched since. One of the ultimate best.",

Then a flashback goes to his time in Africa and the heroics he showed there. Lawrence's task was to unite the Arab tribes and lead them in rebellion against the enemy so the British might win. A very unique, at times controversial, and long unheralded man, Lawrence contributed to the war effort in a far different way. Although it seemed he was soon lost to history his feats of courage and bravery renewed his legacy. This is one of those films you want to see on the big screen because the scenery and cinematography is just that impressive by itself.",

Lawrence binds Arab tribes in the West's battle against the Turks.\nWhile I consider this film necessary viewing for anyone who considers him/herself a student of film, I can't say that it is unquestionably great.  Yes, Peter O'Toole's performance is marvelous, and David Lean's direction, particularly the cinematography, is quite strong as he frames beautiful shots and often captures the mood of the environment.\nHowever, at close to four hours, the film is extraordinarily long, and some of its length can be attributed to Lean's penchant for showing people walking great distances in order to carry out the scene.  Rather than keep the camera focused on a character as he walks into the scene, it's rather simple to show the character approaching, cut away to an reaction shot, and then have the character present to begin the scene.  It's a technique that's so often used we barely notice it any longer.  It's true that Lean is trying to capture the vastness of the desert, but he does this in so many other parts of the film that I could see how the film's running time could be trimmed considerably.\nMore important is the film's relationship to race and politics.  Edward Said writes eloquently about Lawrence in Culture and Imperialism arguing that Lawrence follows a tradition of colonialists who treat Arabs and Arabia as racially inferior.  The film argues that Lawrence's relationship to these people is far more complex than Said claims.  The Lawrence of the film recognizes his white privilege and is in conflict with his own identity. which makes a compelling conflict.  If the film's relationship to race and colonization stopped there, then I wouldn't have a problem with it.  After all, just because the film's thesis differs from Said's opinion of Lawrence doesn't mean it's a film to be rejected.  But the casting is more problematic.  Alec Guinness, a Brit, and Anthony Quinn, a Mexican, portray Arabs in - for lack of a better term - \"brown face.\"  The only Arab in the film with a major speaking role in Omar Sharif (who coincidentally harassed Edward Said during their school days).  While I balk at calling Lawrence of Arabia a racist film, I think that it's fair to say that the casting and the inability of the film to fully question the morality of Lawrence's behavior makes it racially problematic.\nOverall, I think you should see this film because its scope and its technical proficiency are extraordinary, but it's not without its ambiguity and flaws.",

And even after 50 years I found myself forgetting how old it was. Although it's almost four hours, and pretty old school, it's a timeless classic. \n\nOnly one or two little details bothered me - most disturbingly, the mental state of Lawrence - who seemed to change his mind for no particular reason numerous times (Maybe I didn't get it, but I give you an example what I mean: when he gets caught by the Turkish patrol and interrogated and tortured by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer afterwards, he wants to quit his command of the Arab forces - I think because he realized that he always remain a white guy - but then when he gets back to headquarters, the general doesn't do much to get him back on the field - in fact he doesn't really say anything and Lawrence just changes his mind back without any reason - at least none that I could observe). \nThings like these hurt the film a bit. Besides, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn a.o. did a decent job, but was it really necessary to cast Brits as Arab tribesmen? Especially Guinness just doesn't look like a Bedouin no matter how much make-up you put on his face.\n\nBut let's look at the whole picture. Is it an essential movie in film history? Yes, it definitely is! Is it one of the most beautifully photographed films ever? As far as I'm concerned, yes! Is it entertaining and well-paced despite it's long runtime? Yes, and it really needs the time to show us what it wants to tell us. The desert scenes need some duration, only this way we can understand how the heat and the endlessness must feel.\nI could post some more (rhetoric) questions, but I think you got what I was trying to say. If you take the film as a whole you won't find much criticize about it. It's perfectly balanced, features decent performances and breathtaking cinematography. Not to forget David Lean's signature eye for great settings (Lean is one of the best examples of how a director's roots influence his style).\n\nPS: Have you ever noticed that they used the same desert locations numerous times? It doesn't really matter because they look the same anyways but that's a fun fact I guess...",
