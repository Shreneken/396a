This film has everything: comedy, tragedy, great cinematography that was innovative at the time, and well drawn characters very well portrayed by the principals. It is funny, sad, and touching, and surprisingly fresh after 60 years. A throuple in 1962? Wow.",

            "content": "Love triangles, passionate affairs, questionable sanctity in marriage, fleeting interests, restlessness, excessively dramatic gestures - it's all the stereotypes of the French view on romance crystallized in a single film. Events happen quickly but not necessarily with much force as this trio float through their lives according to their own set of rules, having latched onto a dynamic that sustains them even if they don't adhere to traditional depictions of relationships. \n\nMoreau's Christine, though the sole protagonist left our of titular honors, is the key figure defining the drive of the film; she's irrational, spontaneous, romantic, and unsure of what she wants in life - it's understandable and even empathetic in a sterile environment but infuriating to see play out in relationship to her principle dual love interests, Werner's Jules and Serre's Jim. The film's strength lies in bringing out the positive elements of their boisterous relationship rather than following through on the heartache, as you watch the three cavort around pre-War Paris in defiance of cultural standards simply living life as they see fit in a potent chemistry that emerges despite their different personalities. When Truffaut tries to dive into the flip side of that irrationality as it begins to threaten the long-term stability of their affections, you'll start to wonder exactly what he was trying to say beyond the incorporation of tragedy and discord. Jeanne Moreau pulling a gun on her withdrawn lover with some shockingly lazy delivery can really take you out of the moment. Plenty of good content here, but to call it among the greatest films of the French New Wave is a pretty far-fetched claim.\n\nUnfortunately, in the current Criterion release of this film, many early French subtitles were left in, with the result that some scenes have their updated English subtitles awkwardly pasted over their earlier iterations.

Sometimes Truffaut chooses not to explain character motives and other times they talk with each other in endless long monologues with tremendous exposition and subtext. The french new wave techniques used in cinematography, editing, blocking are incredible. Montages are thrilling, use of changing aspect ratio is cool, voice-over is powerfully used. Martine Scorsese has stated the influence of Jules and Jim on the casino and many of his other films. \n\nWithout a doubt its an extremely important film of those times but did it age well with time?

            "content": "The first thing that strikes you about Jules and Jim is the exuberance (joie de vivre?) with which director Francois Truffaut endows the story.  As in his first two films (The 400 Blows, 1959, and Shoot the Piano Player, 1960), Truffaut experiments with film technique, mixing and matching styles in a way that keeps the viewer interested and shows off what Raoul Coutard (cinematographer) could do.  In fact, the first reel, detailing the relationship between best friends Jules and Jim (and the women they loved before they met Catherine) speeds by so fast, with so much cutting between anecdotes, that it is hard to keep up. Part of this may be due to the use of offscreen narration that fleshes out the story and reveals the characters' inner thoughts and feelings - there are a lot of subtitles to read!  But once Jules (Oskar Werner) and Jim (Henri Serre) meet Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), the film slows a bit to better observe their melodramatic relations across the decades from just before WWI until some years after.  I suppose it comes as no surprise that Truffaut takes the male point of view and treats Catherine and her willful ways as both an object of desire and the cause of suffering; perhaps it is a bit ambivalently sexist but Moreau is nothing if not empowered in the role.  Yet, despite the exuberance, there is a profound melancholy at the core of the film - a yearning for a love that cannot be and perhaps an acknowledgement that it may be difficult for a free spirit to maintain a stable relationship with any one person, let alone two (or three), no matter how strong their passions sometimes are.  Those around them can and do get burned. Ultimately, it isn't clear whether Truffaut is advocating the sort of compromises that most people make to keep their relationships alive or whether he sides with Catherine's unfettered approach. Perhaps, as the ending suggests, he knows that some candles burn much too brightly to last.  Fortunately, this jewel of the French New Wave is ours to treasure forever.",

They also touched on the idea of two friends on opposite sides of the war which could have been really cool. But we only hear about that part in voiceover.\n\nCatherine, the object of their affection, is one of the most infuriating characters ever captured on film. The fact that these guys put this much effort into being with her made me want to rip my hair out. The film fully invests in the idea that you can\u0092t help who you fall in love with and that you\u0092re bound like an idiot to that person you love no matter how horrible they behave.

The characters do crazy things and one has to be able to at identify with their emotions for the film to work, even if one does not like the things they do.

            "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"Jules and Jim\" is a masterful examination of a true m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois remains oddly \"current.\" \n\nThe film takes place both before and after WWI. Jules and Jim fall in love with the same woman. \"Catherine\" played with casual sensuality and eroticism by Jeanne Moreau, is strangely transfixing. This has always been Moreau's unique gift as an actor. Far from conventional ideas of \"beauty\" or \"the erotic\" -- she non-the-less is irresistibly alluring. To Truffaut's credit, he captures Moreau's unique presence, intelligence and sensuality so that just about every viewer will feel something for her.\n\nThe two friends never surrender their friendship despite a tragic war and their shared love for the increasingly fickle and odd Catherine. Ultimately the two friends end up trading places as her lover. There are vague hints that the two men might also be in love with each other, but that doesn't really need to be explored. It is a given. \n\nAs fun, wistful and beautiful as the film is -- it is equally devastating. After years of friendship and love, these two men gain the true insight into their Catherine. The insight comes too late to avoid tragedy. \n\nWe are left forever wondering if we were in love with Catherine or some misplaced idea of what we thought Catherine was. Freedom and love come at a price. But the market place will only bear so much. \n\nA true French Cinematic Masterpiece of La Nouvelle Vague. Not to be missed!",

In the beginning it seems a nice movie. The boys have fun together. Fall in love for the same girl, but they still continue to have fun.  Then one of the boys ask the girl to marry him right before the beginning of the war. She accepts and then he goes to war. And here the story starts to become weird and kinda boring. We learn that the girl is pretty \"slutty\". She goes with anyone she likes and it seems her husband doesn't mind so much as long as she stays with him. He even gives the permission to his best friend to come and live with them, or more likely live and sleep with his wife. So at this point I start to hate all the characters in this movie. Most of all Catherine, she just seems to me hard-hearted. She doesn't care about her husband's feelings or her lovers' feelings, she just lives for herself. I think we're suppose to feel pity for her, because she's an unsettled soul trying to find love or her place in the world. But I just can't relate to her... She's so annoying to me.",

Sadly the film falls short in making these aspects interesting due to the film's central characters. I have not read the novel, and this film would mark as my first in exploring Francois Truffaut's filmography, so I had no expectations coming into this. Truffaut handles the film's characters and story in a quirky and offbeat kind of way, where the events and emotions that films like these would normally walk on would be manipulated in order to have them look and feel stripped down. I see what Truffaut is trying to do with it, as he wants the film to feel more natural, with emotions not always being expressed in a clear and heavy way paralleling to the true nature of humanity, but he has forgotten to give the film a handle for audiences to easily hold, therefore leaving me feeling detached with the characters and the story almost throughout the film's running time. I have to search so much into each scene that by the time I get to its emotional core, I end up feeling exhausted and the drive to figure out what the film is truly trying to deliver starts to fade away from me.\n\nIn terms of the film's plot and narrative, I found it to be interesting as the struggle between each member of the trio of keeping the one they truly care about from leaving and it wasn't hard to follow the intentions of each character. My main issue with the narrative is the pacing and it's delivery of its emotions, which is something I have already discussed. The film flies by the first act of the film, with the introduction of its two male leads and the relationship the characters have. The film doesn't slow down to give us any room to breathe and take it all in, therefore I gave up trying to keep up with it and hopefully as the film goes on, I'll gain a better insight on the characters, which in a way did. The second and third act does eventually slow down the film's pace, but not by a lot. Truffaut gives us a bit more time to take in the characters' motives and persona but I still personally felt that the tempo was still too elevated for me to really feel comprehensively invested, as there was just so much that Truffaut wanted to flesh out but didn't want to lose that sense of urgency and offbeat quality. At first I felt that the film's climax happened too suddenly and lacked any sense of impact, it started to grow on me a little bit as I'm writing this and developing some sort of empathy towards the decisions both of the characters would make; I think it would be something that would come off much better during a second viewing.\n\nWith all of the film's issues, it would be normal for one to find the dialogue in this film to be lacklustre, but surprisingly, it's actually one of the film's best qualities. This is not to say that it's perfect but it is a clear notch up when compared to other aspects of the film. The dialogue really made the characters feel interesting to watch, as they ramble on things that definitely resemble the personality and interests of Truffaut and his colleagues. The topics being discussed throughout the film are of the \"higher\" class, going in depth in things like wine, plays, and psychology. Even after the war that the male characters has went through, the way they discuss it upon reflection is more along the lines of a third-person rather than first; discussing how it impacted others rather than how it was for themselves, almost as if they didn't participate in it. Though, I did find the film's dialogue at times to be a tad bit too indulgent. Characters at times tend to ramble on a tad longer than they should and therefore coming off as a bit tedious in particular moments. The dialogue also lacked a bit off emotion, which was definitely needed on defining moments in the film. The film also includes a voice-over which was used in a way that was smarter than the characters themselves. It acts as a support for the audience to make up for the emotional core and insight that the film lacks, which did its job wonderfully but I personally found unnecessary. The film would have been much more effective if the characters were a bit more clear in themselves and let out a sliver, just a sliver, of elevated drama to give the film a bit weight.\n\nThe film's black and white photography looked quite good though I felt could have been much better in making scenes feel more impacting. Throughout the film we see wonderful tracking shots and pans that do occasionally create that parallel to the film's themes and ideas, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. The film's score on the other hand was a much more satisfying aspect. It was able to heighten that offbeat and quirky style that the director was going for. It also wonderfully captures the mood of the scene perfectly, with at times keeping me highly engaged due to the score alone.\n\nThe film's acting was actually great for what it was. If the actors weren't so restricted by Truffaut's direction and script then the actors would have definitely gotten more praise from me as their characters would have felt more fleshed out and genuine in a cinematic way. All of the three main actors, Henri Sarre; Oskar Werner; and Jeanne Moreau, were great in their roles. All were able to give that energy that Truffaut demanded from them while also sneaking in a hint of internal vulnerability in their characters. Each actor was able to deliver their dialogue really well and they were able to make use of the space that was given to them, exhibiting great physical performances.\n\nI can definitely understand the praise that this film has received as I do see the qualities that make it a unique and great film, but it just didn't hit home for me at an emotional level, coming off as over-directed rather than the genuineness that it was clearly trying to evoke.",

But then again, the film is also about how a friendship can easily fall prey to the idiocy of romance, the bipolarity of love and the captivating beauty of a woman before they can even know what has hit them.\n     \nEffortlessly becoming the best of friends immediately after their first meeting, Jules and Jim's friendship is suddenly drawn into a moody yet, to a certain extent, wonderful ride of both love and life via an adventurously unpredictable woman named Catherine (perhaps a prelude to the character trope we now know as 'The Manic Pixie Dream Girl'). \n     \nFrancois Truffaut, a most visually playful auteur, is dead set on exploring love with a sure grasp of irony and relentless energy. \"Jules and Jim\", with its constant visual frolics and overall feel, is really hard to categorize within a single genre. Part-comedy, part-drama and part-romance (with some hints of war-time dramatics), the film is everything a cinephile can ask for. For the entirety of the film's almost 2 hours of running time, I was just engrossed with what I'm seeing, and it's not just about the film's pioneering visuals. Even when the three central characters are just talking, exchanging reflective remarks and laughing, one can still sense the same tight energy that was fully evident in the film's fast-lipped narration, silent film-like music and playful cinematography. This is definitely because of how well-realized and inspired the performances in the film really are, specifically by the centerpiece threesome comprised of Oskar Werner (Jules), Henri Serre (Jim) and Jeanne Moreau (Catherine). \n     \nDespite the film tackling a relatively heavy-handed tale about romantic deceit, Truffaut was able to inject a sense of childish gayness in it all. And it is in this childishness that the film was able to separate itself from other films of its kind. \n     \nFor me, what makes \"Jules and Jim\" stand out and be rightfully heralded as one of the best films of all time is how it has took on infidelity and romantic apprehension with such carefree warmth and transcendental tenderness. Truffaut, one of the ultimate film intellectuals in cinema history, has relied solely on one concept and it has repaid him and \"Jules and Jim\" a hundredfold: Optimism. \n     \nEven in the face of tragedy and melancholy, Truffaut was hopeful enough to make us feel that the pursuit of love, no matter the context, the situation and even the consequences, is something that is just truly wonderful to be denied an entry into our hearts. But in the end, he was also able to highlight the fact that obsession, even in the context of love, is an entirely different matter. \"Is it the pursuit of an elusive, on and off love or the subtle pains of moving on?\" That, for me, is the film's ultimate question. \"Jules and Jim\" is about how something's got to give.",

The characters feel like real people. The first 40 minutes is purely to set the picture and to give exposition. The real drama starts once we've really gotten to know the three major characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie keeps things light with a fun score and plenty of laughs scattered throughout. The movie's shot to perfection. Truffaut keeps things smooth and casual. He's a real professional. He makes it all look so easy.\r\n\r\nJeanne Moreau is an absolute doll in this film. She's such a great actress, and just like she did in Elevator to the Gallows, she steals the show here. I also quite enjoyed the actor who played Jim. Moreau's Catherine may not be the most perfect girl in the world, but as the characters mention, she's a real woman and in terms of that she nailed it.\r\n\r\nJules and Jim is quite an accomplishment. It proves that in \"love triangles\" it is often the relationship of the friends rather than the lovers that actually has more love. The roller coaster ride of relationships in the film all felt authentic because the characters felt so real. The writing was so strong that it was easy for me as a viewer to relate to what was going on in the characters' heads. This tender and iconic film truly has it all.",

            "content": "The dynamics of any relationship are always fascinating but when you add a third person to the mix, and all three love each other equally, the results are unpredictable and captivating.  This mixture is exactly what you see in JULES ET JIM (Francois Truffaut, 1962) and this film is a great stepping stone for Truffaut.  He crafts a narrative which focuses on adult issues and problems but paints his characters in a way to identify them as children, a task not readily achieved.  His narrative is controversial and a reflection of issues bubbling quietly below the surface of when the film was made.  He stretches as a filmmaker, using techniques he hadn't used before.  He continues his examination of human interaction and the intricacies entailed there.  Finally for the first time in his filmmaking he allows a star to dominate his film and believe me there is no time when Jeanne Moreau doesn't hold the strict attention of the viewer.\n\nPlaying the part of Catherine, Moreau teams with Oskar Werner (Jules) and Henri Serre (Jim) in forming a childlike trio.  Truffaut skillfully creates a childlike presence to his characters in dress, activity and emotion.  One scene particularly stands out.  Jules has been spending a lot of time with Catherine and he wants Jim to join them.  Jim arrives and Catherine proceeds to dress up as \"Thomas\".  The three run through the streets of Paris masquerading as three boys.  They come to a bridge and race across, with \"Thomas\" using a childlike subterfuge to win.  As the trio laugh and giggle at the finish line they decide to visit the sea.  For these three adults, life is childlike and innocent.  It is a vacation and this is exactly how Truffaut wants them portrayed.  They become an extension of characters he already has shown us on screen.  Jules and Jim can be seen as extensions Antoine and Rene, older versions of his two truants.\n\nCinematically Truffaut himself showcases a more experienced and experimental filmmaker.  Throughout the film he uses techniques previously unseen in his work.  When we are introduced to Catherine we see several images of her frozen on the screen.  Later he uses the same technique for her again, giving us a glimpse of the fracturing taking place inside her mind.  Truffaut uses handheld camera more extensively and even takes to aerial work, imparting a dreamlike quality to aspects of the narrative.  He also is more experimental with camera placement and movement.   His narrative subject matter is adult and controversial, tackling a subject long considered taboo not only in cinema but in society in general.\n\nThis tackling of controversial narrative fascinates me.  Truffaut's examination of the human condition and our interactions with each other is often quite profound.  With this film he tackles love and monogamy, forcing a look at not only our own personal views but societal ones.  The societal conventions he places under the microscope are remarkable in regards to where we stand presently.  The place in society for marriage, cohabitation and the roles children play in our adult decisions are prevalent topics today.  And what of his examination for love outside marriage?  Truffaut's dealing with three people that love each other equally is deftly and tastefully done.  In fact it is almost Utopian, if it weren't for a brilliant and fractured protagonist, Catherine.\n\nAnd to me, ultimately Catherine is the protagonist to the film and much of this has to do with an outstanding portrayal by Jeanne Moreau.  So many adjectives describe Catherine; powerful, strong, broken, imperfect, joyful, morose, loving.  Moreau skillfully maneuvers between her three loves (can't forget Albert), seeking and finding that which she needs from the three.  Unable to comprehend the needs of others and being full of disdain for the conventions of society, Catherine exudes the essence of a contemporary woman.  Her best moment in the film is as she sings Le Tourbillon de Vie.  The lyrics are  melodic and the tune catching.  But placed into the context of where she is in the film, they are haunting.  Who is she singing to?  And can't the lyrics really be aimed at all three males?  Truffaut's genius really shines through here in his composition of the scene in how he positions Catherine to face Albert but still be amidst the three.\n\nThe more I watch of Truffaut the more he grounds himself in my mind as a genius director.  This film is great, albeit paced a little slowly.  And as I always write in my notes on his films, remember his films are always autobiographical.  Which makes me wonder what inspired this gem.  Oh to know that!",

            "content": "Ah, the French New Wave.  And poor \"Jules et Jim\"-- it's probably the best film of the period and Godard's \"A bout de Souffle\" gets all the credit for being the big one.  I love the latter, but it doesn't have that total magic that \"Jules et Jim\" offers, and it doesn't feel the same the second time like this film does.  Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut is my personal favorite French director, and this is certainly one of his best films. Jules (Oskar Werner) and Jim (Henri Serre) are fast friends in 1912, traveling the streets together and having mini-adventures to pass the time.  Their relationship is rocked quickly when the charismatic and outgoing Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) becomes a part of their lives, working as a sort of love object and temptress.  Eventually, Jules is the one that gets the girl, but it isn't happy for long. The war separates the three friends for a period of time, and once they're reunited, Jules and Catherine are married, with a young daughter.  Jim has shaved his cartoonish mustache, and sports a more mature outlook that suits him better.  The two men have aged, and their friendship seems more trusting than ever, but Catherine, who inside is still the the inconsiderate, unstable woman, desperately wants Jim's affection once again.  He knows it's completely the wrong decision-- after all, she cheated on her own husband multiple times-- so he doesn't take the opportunity.  But Catherine isn't the kind to just \"let things go\". \"Jules et Jim\" moves along with the frenetic energy of a silent movie. \u00a0Something is always happening, and the characters are either animated, and if not, capture the look of a '20s film star. \u00a0Serre especially, has the awkward lankiness that fits perfectly to be a comedic actor, whereas Werner is his foil. \u00a0The film isn't really funny, and neither are its characters, but there's something in the relationship that's somewhat exciting and reminiscent of a comedian with the best sidekick in then world. \u00a0As the film gets darker, the friendship takes a downward turn that is undoubtably a little bit sad. The friendship at first seems solid and friendly, and quickly it turns into something much worse. \u00a0In the second half of the film, one is left to wonder-- is Jim really that selfish of a friend, or is it Catherine that's turning him into a jerk? I'll pick the latter, but some won't think so. \u00a0People trying to look too deep might misinterpret the dissolving as artificiality, but truly it shows how much simply \"growing up\" can change a person. \u00a0Then Truffaut turns the tables once again and the plot is twisted right under our noses. In the meantime, the technical aspects, especially the voiceover, are highly important to the new wave.  While it shouldn't work, the voiceover makes the period setting feel just as chic as '60s France itself, all the while maintaining to give \"Jules et Jim\" a light touch of experiment and total modernization. \u00a0Voiceovers were mostly used in America in hard-boiled film noir, but Truffaut uses it as though he's trying to prove everyone wrong. \u00a0It, if anything, makes the film even better. \u00a0It's a huge component. The setting is set between 1912 and 1933, but Truffaut, unlike most directors, isn't as concerned about the costumes or the set pieces. \u00a0He knows this is a character piece, and the focus goes on the trio. \u00a0The filming style is certainly dreamy, and the editing is artistic beyond belief, but not once can we take our eyes off of Jules, Jim and Catherine. \u00a0This is certainly one of the best casts in a film, even though there is so few. Truffaut's direction is masterful, and sets the standard of modern filmmaking completely. \u00a0He throws away the conventions of directing that the '60s brought on and shapes it into a statue of a film that's incredibly appealing. \u00a0It shines almost with the feeling of a \"new car\", even though it's 50 years old.  \"Jules et Jim\" is almost exciting to watch because, while it's entertaining like a film should be, it's also artistically fascinating without being pretentious. \u00a0Truffaut is a better version of Godard, one that can make a film pop all the while maintaining a fascinating story. The men who play Jules and Jim aren't the \"actor\" types like Alain Delon or Jean-Paul Belmondo (even though they're both important to the French New Wave), and are instead portrayed by Oskar Werner and Henri Serre, more average looking and relatable. \u00a0They're portrayals are simple, likable and subtle, but the fact that they aren't so good-looking make femme fatale Jeanne Moreau all the more appealing. Moreau is certainly the most talented (and most memorable) of all the French New Wave. \u00a0The other important actress of the era, Anna Karina, always managed to look cool and mysterious, but never did much otherwise. \u00a0Moreau on the other hand constantly gave terrific performances and almost always stole the film from everyone else. \u00a0She has a look that's totally distinct and unique, and a voice that rings with sweetness but can deliver bit. \u00a0Moreau is the archetypal French actress; while she's beautiful, she has the elegance and range to pull off any role. \u00a0\"Jules et Jim\" might be her most intriguing role. \u00a0She is the focal point of the film, even if she isn't a titular character. \u00a0There isn't a second where we don't believe she isn't a seductress, but there also isn't a minute we don't like her. \u00a0She's to enigmatic for that. \u00a0Catherine is a character unlike any other, and Moreau is probably the only one that could have pulled it off so well-- Catherine obviously has a few mental troubles, but Moreau doesn't once overdo it. \"Jules et Jim\" is obviously a film I could go on and on about.  The point is-- see it.  This is the definition of what an important film is, and there isn't one doubt in my mind about that statement.",

The relationships gone on and off throughout the years between the 3 are portrayed in a very repressed style for the men, but very freespirited through the female view, will make it obvious that the story is told through a male writer. Ironically, the women in the 60s loved and wanted to model after the Catherine character (in a slutty way), which was not anything the original writer intended... silly how things end up.",

As part of the French New Wave, I knew to expect this film to be overflowing with style and technique, but I also expected it to be fun. Maybe I shouldn't have been so insistant on that last part. This film is fun, at times, but it gets serious too, and when it does, I find it harder to swallow. Maybe because it's hard to completely identify with or care deeply about the characters.\n\nThis story is all about an Austrian named Jules who is friends with a French guy named Jim. They share a mutual love for a (probably bi polar) woman named Catherine. The story takes place over a coupkel of decades from the 1910s to the 1930s, and hops all over Europe (mostly France and Germany). I don't mind love triancgle movie, but the way the story progresses seemed very odd and all over the place and unlkely. Also, this is a period piece, but I never really got that sense. It seemed more like the time it was released than the time it was supposed to be portraying.\n\nBecause this film is style over substance, and because the characters are nuts, ridiculous, and hard to identify with ocmpletely, I should, by all rights, knock this down a notch or two. However, the film has a gorgeous look, great camera work, wonderful music, good performances, and the aforementioned style, so there. \n\nI do recommend this movie, despite it being overrated. Part of its importance and legacy and undeniable and understandable, but this film is a bit of a mess. It's not always apparent though since often this film is light, breezy, and not restricted by a super dense plot.  See it, but don't expect it to be the masterpiece that many claim it to be.",

            "content": "Sadly, I've really only seen a couple of French New Wave movies, but this one was the best so far. Seeing this movie back in 1962 must have been astonishing for audiences; it moves quickly and feels alive and raw in a way virtually nothing else I know of up to that point had. The style of the film is mainly what made it so important at the time and why it is still famous today, but unlike Godard's cold, clinical Pierrot le Fou, there is actually a story here too.\n\nThe film shows us the lives of Jules and Jim, a German and a Frenchman who are best friends before they fall in love with the same woman, and actually continue to be best friends anyway after falling in love with the same woman. The woman, Catherine, played in a great performance by Jeanne Moreau, marries one of them, but then decides she wants the other to move into their house, then sleeps with the first one again, and so on. Their story unfold over the course of about 20 years, from 1912 to 1932 or so.  While it's easy to see Catherine's charm and why they would like her, it's also tempting to dislike her for her the way she toys with the two men, and to think them contemptible for the way they put up with her shenanigans. \n\nDirector Francois Truffaut's style is what really sets this movie apart. I especially liked the lightning-fast prologue, which bounces through a lot of exposition about Jules and Jim's early friendship very quickly. Especially towards the beginning, the film seems to have a much shorter average shot-length than was common in the early 1960s; it's like the movie wants to rush headlong into its story and expects you to be able to keep up. Truffaut uses other little tricks here and there, but they always make sense in terms of the story - I especially liked one little sequence in which he uses brief freeze-frames to capture some of Catherine's facial expressions. Other shots are great just for the way they're set up, such as the scene in which the three characters shout to each other from three different windows. The whole film is characterized by a certain immediacy that Hollywood films of the same period tend to lack. It's clearly a very important part of film history, and I can't believe I just now got around to seeing it.",

This sets the work apart from films such as Goddard's Breathless where it seemed at times that many of the devices used in the film were used because they were \"cool\" or different, rather than augment the power of the story. \nIt is a dynamic rumination on friendship, love, war, and the changing nature of femininity, and certainly one not to be missed.",

The dialogue is clear and powerful; the filming techniques are magnificent and inventive, especially through the stills. In particular, one scene where Catherine, the woman at the centre of Jules and Jim, is showing off her attitudes towards life before she even met them and then after she met them. Those were some very unique shots. Below the sadness, there is exhuberence, as well, showing how the two men are constantly flirting with Catherine, that is before the WWI came.

Catherine jumping in the canal while Jules qutoes Baudelaire is a memorable scene.  The scene with Jim and Catherine at the corner of the house and Jules on the balcony is primo.  Also in the scene near the end with Jim and Catherine when the camera shakes after he mentions still being able to have children with Gilberte--is brilliantly evocative of Catherine's psychological state.

On one hand it's stylistically profound, of another world, a mile marker in the great journey of filmmaking content and technique; on the other hand it's about an insane muse that makes every man who comes into her life fall madly in love with her, including two best friends who revolve their entire lives around her capricious cries, calls and random disappearances to sleep with other men. \n\nI can't quite put my finger on what irks me overall about this film, whether it's of knowing actual women like that in real life who gave harm to my friends, not being enchanted by Jeanne Moreau, the weakness of both men, perhaps all of it. \n\nI can imagine if this film were made today, how Kate Hudson, or someone equally attractive, would play the role, while two helpless shmucks whined around her slapstick suicide attempts, eating sandwiches together, while on the side--eating whatever shit she doled out, depending on her boredom. \n\nGwyneth Paltrow's Margot in the Royal Tenenbaums got it right at least with her cold sincerity and regal demeanor, but she was a misunderstood genius, not a cataclysmic mess for the sake of being cataclysmic. \n\nFemale characters feasting on the souls of pathetic men is not compelling, unless the genre is horror, thriller or comedy, none of which was Jules and Jim--a \"quirky, romantic, cerebral\" drama? Undoubtedly cerebral, yes, but romantic, I couldn't say, unless romance is declared synonymous with terminal illness. But ask most poets; they'll say yes to that one in a snap.\n\nBut many people love this film, especially because of the director and the directing, because it's French and quirky in that dark, French manner of dysfunction being real and hilarious and charming women who are crazy drive men mad with desire versus boring beautiful women with every their predictable mannerism just sitting there with nothing to say--yes, yes, yes, I see the attraction and the fodder for conversation this film would bring, the debates of what is what defines art and New Wave greatness. \n\nJules and Jim is a walloping time capsule of style preserving culture, attitudes, an homage to joie de vivre and the struggles in love which make even the strongest of humans vulnerable in its pursuit. Hence, its classic infamy, and its ever growing list of admirers placing it on the pedestal of greatness. \n\nI myself wouldn't watch it again unless I got in a time machine, went 12 years back into my reckless, carefree lifestyle and turned it on to watch after downing half a bottle of wine with a malleable male admirer, or two.

It is a difficult call as to whether someone will like it or not. For people who need to make sense out of relationships between people and the world around them, they will be lost. There are few answers here, so if you need all questions answered, then it is best to watch another French New Wave film first(The 400 Blows maybe).\r\n\r\nThe film has great lead performances, a psychologically draining story and a brilliant, energetic style. All of the French New Wave films pushed the boundaries of what film had been. The French New Wave(Breathless, Band of Outsiders) changed film and so many of the techniques used here ar still used today. It was a very influential movement.\r\n\r\nThe movie is about a romantic love triangle that lasts for decades. So much of this will be quite frustrating for some viewers, because the person at the center of the triangle is such a complex and difficult character. She will never commit to anyone or anything, which will only infuriate and confuse a mainstream audience.

The dialogue is, at times, witty; but it's not enough to make me care about anything that happens in the movie.\n\nThere was one scenes however, that stands out in my mind, in which the three main characters have a foot race across a bridge. It's one of those scenes that has a kinetic quality to it, and almost forces you to smile. That's it though.\n\nSo far, The 400 Blows is still the best French film I've seen.",

            "content": "A truly great, yet painful film about friendship, love, and loss.  Certainly one of Truffaut's better works.  Jules and Jim are the best of friends.  Jules marries Catherine and goes off to war.  Jim and Jules fight on opposing sides in WW2, and get back together after the war is over.  Jules's marriage is failing. Catherine has cheated on Jules numerous times and is about to walk out of his life for good.  Out of desperation, he begs his best friend Jim (who has always found Catherine intriguing and beautiful) to marry his wife, if only so that he can still see her.  Jim and Catherine fall in love, but Catherine just can't seem to figure out who she loves.  After Jim gets tired of Catherine's incessant infidelity and diva complex, Catherine takes him out for a drive, and plunges the car into a lake, killing them both. Yes, I realize my pathetic synopsis does this brilliant film no justice.  :)",

Both Jules and Jim I liked, and the entire movie I was hoping that Catherine would just leave and never come back, leaving them to their own lives. But no. She has to continue be a freaking nightmare for the both of them. I liked the style of the film, though (I'm guessing the same style was intentionally applied to Amelie, but I don't know). Especially in the beginning. Very lighthearted and fun. Until Catherine goes totally psycho.",

It is a filmic lexicon unto itself. Aside from its stylish flourishes, it is also an irreverant exploration of identity and love.As he does in several of the Antoine Doinel films, Truffaut explores love with a master's hand--it is an emotion that both elevates us to heaven and damns us to hell. And to this reviewer, there is no better definition of love than that. It is a bipolar emotion as evidenced by the character of Catherine whose love oscillates from Jules to Jim to others and ultimately can only be satisfied in death. Ultimately, Jules and Jim is about the hollow nature of our expectations of love--it is picture of the disappointment entailed by our love of love. We expect to find an other that will complete us in ways that are ultimately impossible as evidenced from Catherine's jumping from one love to the next.",

The storytelling, the imagery, and how Truffaut conveyed emotions through his characters are all brilliant.\n\nHowever, I will admit that the character of Catharine, and how the men in her life (most notably the title characters Jules and Jim) acted around her got really old by the end of the film.  For me, a movie is successful if I can somehow relate to the characters and can understand their emotions and actions to some degree.  Here, I couldn't understand why someone like Jules would stay in this situation or why none of the men acted angry or confrontational when the other men who have slept with their girl were around.  I know Europeans look at adultery and the like a tad differently (or at least that's how it's portrayed in most movies), but I wouldn't be able to just hang out with two guys who have been sleeping with my wife.  \n\nThose elements, along with the end of the film (which Jim should have seen coming seeing the gun being pulled on him in an earlier scene) are what make this film tarnished for me.  The first two thirds are great, but that last third grated on me.\n\nStill, it's a great film that's a must see.",

It wasn't that they were poorly developed, I just didn't approve of their lifestyle, and if I were the two men, I would have left Catherine way beforehand. I think Truffaut at this point was embracing the French New Wave a little too heartily, and he just wanted to make a romance that was dramatically different. While this is certainly admirable, it leads to a film that doesn't quite work. Luckily, when Truffaut indulges in style, he does it in a way that helps tell the story (unlike the stylistic tendencies of Godard). You can tell he's having fun with the material, and the music certainly backs him up on that. All in all, \"Jules and Jim\" does have moments of brilliance, but I was disappointed by the overall story. It's not particularly compelling. Still, \"Jules and Jim\" is worth a watch if you're looking for something original. I'm not sure I've ever seen a romance quite like this one.",

Jim & Jules fall in love with Cathrine, Cathrine marries Jules, Cathrine then ends up with Jim, then back and forth, she cannot make up her mind. It's one of those ingenious plots that really captures you in the moment of it all.

            "content": "Jules and Jim find each other -- and subsequently a strong friendship -- in a small coffee shop in 1912 France. Jules (Oskar Werner) is an Austrian writer whose generosity and tendencies for the serene have kept women at an earnest length, while Jim (Henri Serre), also a writer, seems to attract attention with his eager confidence and stately French charm. The two men share curiosities for such things as literature, strange art, and eccentric living -- and when Jules finds Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a whimsical (and rather rickety) girl who bares a strong resemblance to a beautiful stone sculpture both he and Jim admire, all of the friends' interests seem to radiate through her. As the relationship between Jules and Catherine grows, so does the friendship between Jim and Catherine -- she even tells them that she never knew happiness until she knew them. But as the years pass, her claim proves to have been either naive infatuation or coincidental irony, for she becomes miserable and irresolute with and about her desires, and her desolation spreads to Jules and Jim and eventually ends in calamity. \r\n\r\nFrancois Truffaut is known as one of the great directors of French New Wave -- a brand of French filmmaking that rejected classical cinematic methods and ideas in favor of more unorthodox, gallant ones -- but he was more a student and great architect of cinematic speak and relationships, and \"Jules and Jim\" is his finest example of each. Not only is it visually audacious, but also the sound of its words is as smooth and lovely as that of Shakespeare's (a common reference in the film), and discernibly more provocative and sensual than that of other great films spoken in Truffaut's native tongue (\"Breathless\", \"The Bay of Angels\", \"Day for Night\"). And the love triangle (easily film history's most elegiac menage a trios) that binds the three stars together is calculated and expertly crafted -- by both Truffaut and his actors. We care for (at least two of) these characters, and though the decisions they make may range from innocent to detestable, their happiness, confusion, and anguish are too palpable to brush away or simply ignore. And above all else, that's what makes \"Jules and Jim\" not only Truffaut's highest directorial achievement, but also one of the best films of the New Wave movement, and of the 1960s and all decades -- because of how effectively it captures the beauty of life in spite of life's dull and morbid times. It's a movie about love that has and should continue to be celebrated as an example of passion and possibility.",
