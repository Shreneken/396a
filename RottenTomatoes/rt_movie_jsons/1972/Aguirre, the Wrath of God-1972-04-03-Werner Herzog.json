This is especially true of \"Aguirre the Wrath of God,\" the result of which is particularly harrowing given the obviously genuine dangers encountered by the film's beleaguered performers under the guise of medieval fiction. While Herzog's work grasps at what he refers to as \"ecstatic truth,\" the truth encountered here is typically cold, hard and immediate. We witness not only the unraveling of a work with a basis in historical fact, but also a more immediately palpable documentary of the travails of the filmmaker, actors and crew. What emerges is a remarkably austere work suffused with an almost merciless level of hushed solemnity as the conquistadors (and perhaps performers themselves) defiantly navigate their way towards oblivion under the protective umbrella of delusions of grandeur.",

The depiction for his Cast's reactions are always taken from real life circumstances. In Aguierre's wrath of God the characters struggles to overcome their journey on the raging River are real. Risking their very lives with each obstacle they have to face.Exotic animals happen to cross their paths just at the perfect moments. Although the time elapse seems long and foreboding there is always something to observe. Unfortunately I tend to get quite bored with the underdeveloped Protagonists. In most of Herzogs movies you cant help but notice they are all overwhelmingly weird or outrageous. Klaus Kinski however is always being himself, who is difficult to say the least for any director to work with. The time and effort put into his work is undoubtedly immense. Therefore it is worth each star rating for the times spent creating these feature presentations.I cannot however give this film a perfect rating for the simple fact the storyline is not my cup of tea or a DVD I would go out of my way to buy.But as it is ,its well worth having watched it for novelty's sake.",

However, most often, I can at least understand the admiration someone might have when it comes to certain aspects of one of these films. \n\n'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' is different. It is simply a crappy film on almost all fronts. What more would you expect from an arthouse in the Amazon feature? It was hard to take this film seriously most of the time, whether it was its documentary-like shooting style, the mostly lifeless performances, those bizarrely silent scenes (of which there are plenty), or one of the many times I noticed somebody actually looking into the camera. It often felt like an extended 'Monty Python' sketch that fails to produce any humour (except ironically)...or entertainment for that matter. \n\nI admire the tenacity of Werner Herzog for getting this thing made, as it looked like it would have been incredibly difficult (and dangerous) to film, to say the least. With that said, the epic undertaking of producing this picture does not absolve its many faults. And yes, I understand the limitations of filming in the jungle, and I take that into account when it comes to my generous 1.5-star score. \n\nIf you see a 5-star rating for this film somewhere online, unfollow that reviewer. They don't know what they're talking about. Stop praising this anti-climatic bore as though its the Second Coming of Christ. It's an ambitious b-movie at best.",

            "content": "With a shaky, handheld cam and a documentary style, Werner Herzog captures the nature at its grittiest, wildest and most most perilous to tell a story of a megalomaniac's descent into madness. It's a story of a man whose God completely denounced him because of his greed and delusions of grandeur, and therefore cursed him in the midst of paradise and turned it into hell. A hell of illusions, mirages and unfulfilled desires, preceded by inexplicable, dreadful nightmares and an ominous warning of a disturbing sound of silence. This is the Wrath of God that comes upon whoever exceed his limits as a human being.\n\nWhat strikes me about this is that it's a story of a grand scale, compressed into a compact 95-min long film without losing a pinch of its epic quality, and that's due to the perfect pacing, I guess. As my first Herzog, I'm really impressed by how his raw docu style feels so cinematic. Unlike other directors who only use some kind of a pseudo-documentary style to give their films an authentic feel, Werner's camerawork, as I mentioned above, fully adopt this style throughout the entire film. We even get, once in a while, observational and poetic shots. And, all of a sudden, a ghastly and hideous image is revealed, and then lingered upon it. Moreover, the way the film changed its tone and became a bit whimsical and implausible at the end is simply astonishing. However, I think there are some jarring tonal shifts between one act and the other. Other than that, this is a peerless masterwork of filmmaking and storytelling.\n\n(9/10)",

            "content": "Watching this film I concluded my personal \"Amazon Madness Trilogy,\" which featured different meditations on the similar subject matter and started with \"Lost City of Z,\" followed by \"Embrace of the Serpent,\" and finally, \"Aguirre,\" with the last two films being much more metaphorical and dreamlike. I feel like several of my recent reviews start with the words: \"this is not for everybody...\" and this film is probably no exception. The movie is mesmerizing in its pace and tone, and certainly the on-location filming on the Amazon itself lends to its etheric and mystical qualities. The lead role of Aguirre is played by nutcase German actor Klaus Kinski with maniacal fervor and barely chained explosiveness. The film should be watched to witness this seminal performance alone. There is an odd dark and absurdist humor in this film, lurking behind the horror and depravity that made me laugh out loud more than once, which is quite a feat given the complex and occasionally disturbing events that take place. Overall, I was hugely gratified watching this film, spell bound by a master of the craft (Herzog) depicting a story about Europeans on a quest to find a fabled city of gold in a foreign land that mirrors his own relentless pursuit of the goal of completing this harrowing production and making a mark for himself as one of the greatest living film directors. My only complaint was of the sound design. The dubbing of the dialogue into German was a little disorienting and about 2/3rds of the way through I stopped the film and found an English dub in YouTube and watched that. I believe the dialogue was performed in English so that helped me enjoy the film a little more. An improvement here would push my rating to 5 stars. The music was awesome, both the soundtrack and the natural pan flute played by one of the native characters on the raft. Highly recommend, for any cinemaphile, or especially for fans of \"Apocalypse Now,\" who are interested in seeing a film that undoubtedly inspired Coppola.",

The movie is largely improvised with the plot changing with the productions problems, most plot and action is implied than explicitly played out. All of the dialogue which would be in Spanish (but filmed originally in English for an international audience) is dubbed afterwards, and dubbed into German for TV and left like that. Not sure if any of sounds in the movie are actually from the scenes, the birds are stock recordings and probably most of the sound effects . The Popol Vuh music is incredible, beautiful, and iconic. Not sure if Kinski is actually doing much acting as he is mostly either pissed or brooding, but he does appear to stay in character quite convincingly. Apparently Kinski's voice is never in the movie at all since he refused to dub his lines, so his lines are done by a voice actor?\nNot a movie for everyone, and if you don't pay close attention at first you won't understand the story, but is very rewarding to watch again and again.",

            "content": "Historical fiction is a great genre of films that I have only recently become obsessed with thanks to Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), JFK (1991) and this exceptional Werner Herzog directed classic. There was a certain fear that I felt going into this film because it had been built up so much and I was worried I either would not like it or would not get it intellectually. The second concern was partially proven true because I could not provide an intellectual analysis of this film that would be satisfactory but I was swept up in the emotions and the crazy Klaus Kinski of this movie enough to enjoy it as a piece of cinema even without Ã¢~getting it'. This is actually a great movie to watch with your father because it is both awe-inspiring, disturbing and funny.\n\nLope de Aguirre, Klaus Kinski, is a dangerously ambitious Spanish conquistador who is under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro, Alejandro RepullÃƒ (C)s, as they journey through the East Andes looking for El Dorado in the 16th century. Aguirre manages to split off from Pizarro and launch a mutiny, as his tyranny continues and the resources he works with dwindles Aguirre becomes more and more crazed. The conquistadors defend themselves against local Indian tribes as they journey down the river and this causes most of the casualties.\n\nThe music and cinematography of the film is what has stuck in my mind most because it is all very distinctive and obviously hugely influential on films like Apocalypse Now (1979). A German progressive rock band called Popol Vuh that I had never heard of composed the entire soundtrack and they did a great job at creating a mood of wonder and almost religious suffering in the right moments. The deep hues of the color that Herzog photographs in this film is stunning and the fact that they shot on location in the Peruvian rainforest with native Peruvians serving as extras gives the film a sense of authenticity that only makes the descent into madness more realistic. The spinning shot at the end of the film and the opening scene of the Conquistadors making their dangerous trek through the mountains are particularly brilliant.\n\nKinski's performance in the lead role is one of those where I find it to be both magnificent and completely ridiculous and over the top. His giant bug eyes and platinum blonde hair make him extremely believable as a crazy man and his monologues are visceral and terrifying. Hearing speeches that are generally about a man wanting to become a dictator delivered in angry German will always have a Nazi connotation. I understand that Kinski is very influential as an actor and I can see where Marlon Brando's performance in Apocalypse Now has shades of Aguirre.\n\nThe only other Werner Herzog film I have seen is Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997) and that is a documentary with a very different tone. His attention to detail and ability to display fear and mania are on full display here as his camera focuses on the bodies of dead men and then cuts immediately to Aguirre philosophizing as a crazed person. I am now desperate to explore the rest of his feature films but I worry they won't match the experience of his breakout film. Although I am not completely on board with Kinski as an actor I expect his other collaborations with Herzog to be equally fantastic. Who knows, I may even listen to some Popol Vuh in my spare time after appreciating their work here so much.\n\nThis is definitely one of those seminal films that you absolutely have to watch, unlike the pretentious Breathless (1960), if you want to understand where all of those great 70s and 80s films made about hysteria come from. The film is also oddly funny and extremely entertaining despite it's dark subject matter. German cinema has given us many great masterpieces, from Metropolis (1927) to Tartuffe (1925), this is one of the films that deserves to be ranked up there because it's a stunning portrait of a man's own ambition eating him alive and how the claustrophobic environment of the jungle causes people to become even more wild than they would usually be.",

Particularly impressive is how the beautiful nature of South America contrasts with the increasingly disturbed mentality our protagonist descends into. Unfortunately this movie is so poorly paced that it becomes very ponderous very quickly. It tries to be moody and contemplative, even when there's very little to contemplate. The dialogue is uninteresting, many of the characters just disappear from the movie without us discovering anything about them, and while Kinski has some great moments, he spends most of the movie looking bored out of his mind. In fact an alternative title to this movie could be 'Klaus Kinski Stares Off Into The Distance With Complete Indifference.' It promises a lot, and I admire how well respected it is, and how much influence it had on movies like Apocalypse Now, one of my all-time favourites, but so little actually happens in the film that probably the most exciting scene is one where a horse gets slightly agitated.

He plays the conquistador, Aguirre, a man with delusions of grandeur. It becomes clearer and clearer as the film goes on that Kinski's character is indeed deluded by his mission to conquer.

This movie is well shot with long pans and hand cams, well acted and the dialogue is thoughtful.\n\nAguirre makes you wonder what the point of it all really is in the violence.

Werzog is not a classically trained director, which leads to his amateurish and often outright hazardous methods of working that lead to some one-of-a-kind film scenarios.  That is much of  the joy in a movie like this, seeing everything on screen and knowing it's actually there.  It's really a beautiful looking film shot on location in the jungle and rivers.  I also loved Klaus Kinski's performance as the titular character.  He is a fascinatingly insane man, both the character and Kinski himself, and whenever he is on screen he is hypnotic to watch.  All this being said, this is often a difficult film to watch.  It's what they would call \"deliberately paced\" and nothing really happens and it ends with no real conclusion.  That's sort of the point, but still, it makes it a chore to sit through at times.  I'm okay with slow-paced movies, but there were quite a few times in this where it felt like things could have moved along much faster than they did.

The overall haunting quality of the film as a whole is dreamlike in it's delivery, but dark in its implications of human nature and especially in larger context of the natural world itself which both surrounds and spawned that nature.\n\nRemoved from the historical context and cinematic importance and its potent subtexts, the film itself has not aged very well. An irreverent viewer or an inattentive viewing would result in a poor experience and a lot of questions about the high praise this film carries.

On the other hand, it's a bleak tale, and one in which little episodes such as natives approaching in a canoe and the Spaniards burning one of their villages are stitched together somewhat weakly, with jumps forward in time.  The screenplay and editing seem disorganized, and while that may add to an overall dreamlike (or nightmarish), chaotic feeling, which was perhaps the point, it also made it a little less enjoyable for me.

I particularly love when Aguirre is the last man standing, reduced to his most common ancestry, surrounded by monkeys who he begs to see the wrath of God - these little fellas have neither the ego nor the inclination to ascend to man's need for such an entity who corrupts intent as we've seen.\n\nLit and shot like a documentary.  Most shots seem very improvised, but there's a couple of circling shots around the raft which are beautifully staged, however cheaply done.  The first one expresses the idea that they're going in circles while Aguirre tries to liven the morale on the ship unsuccessfully.  The film then ends on a recurrence of this shot, expect now only surrounded by, appropriately, monkeys where there were once humans - this is all he has command of.",

After separating into groups, one is taken over by Aguirre, who longs for the discovery of the ancient city El Dorado. Werner Herzog believes in the voodoo of location, meaning that he places his actors in convincing locations, such as filming in a forest 500 miles from civilization, opposed to a rain forest right outside of a major city. Like only a handful of great epic films like Apocalypse Now, and 2001, watching the movie we are constantly aware of how it was made. Kinski's performance is one of the greatest in cinema not in small part due to the real conflict on set. The images, music and performance of Kinski is why this film will probably remain transcendent. It largely inspired the equally visionary Apocalypse Now, and later The Tree of Life. Aguirre is in a small handful of films that transcend to the sense of wonder and mystery. It is not about characters, except for Aguirre, whose personality is completely realized through his movements and expressions. Another similarity with Apocalypse Now is how Aguirre attaches one great scene after another, from the striking first shot of the movie, with a long line of men snaking its way up the mountain slope, to the chilling, and ambiguous climax. Out of all the films Herzog as done, Aguirre might be his most expressive and meditative work.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Werner Herzog - Aguirre. Herzog bietet neuerdings online seine Dienste an, uns in sein Handwerk einzuweisen. Doch kann man im Internet lernen, wie man einen Aguirre filmt? Ein Fluss, den Gott nie beendete - dort spielt Werner Herzogs Aguirre. Die letzten Mitglieder einer spanischen Expedition, auf der Suche nach der Goldstadt El Dorado. Sie brÃ¼llen die eingeborenen Indianer an, versuchen mit Hilfe ihrer Sklaven zu Ã¼bersetzen. Ein Priester hÃ¤lt ihnen die Bibel, das Wort Gottes, entgegen. Vergeblich, El Dorado muss am Ende dieses Flusses liegen. Weiter, immer weiter... Werner Herzogs Aguirre ist eine der eindringlichsten Visionen des Kinos. Die verdammte Expedition des Konquistadors Gonzalo Pizarro, der im 16. Jahrhundert eine Handvoll MÃ¤nner in den Regenwald Perus fÃ¼hrte. Was hat Herzog daraus fÃ¼r Bilder gezogen! Eine lange Linie von Eroberern, Ã¼ber ihnen hÃ¤ngen verwunschene Nebelwolken, die feststecken in den Gipfeln der Anden. Die MÃ¤nner tragen rundliche Stahlhelme. Ihre Frauen werden in SÃ¤nften getragen - gekleidet fÃ¼r einen Empfang am Hof, aber nicht fÃ¼r den Dschungel. QuÃ¤lend klingt dazu die Musik von Florian Fricke, der so viele von Herzogs Filmen veredelte. Wir hÃ¶ren eine Art Orgel, die sich wie ein menschlicher Chor anhÃ¶rt - und doch wieder nicht menschlich klingt... Die Musik ist essentiell fÃ¼r Herzogs Film, der keine Geschichte mit einer AuflÃ¶sung erzÃ¤hlt, sondern uns in eine bestimmte Stimmung versetzt: Es ist das GefÃ¼hl, teilzuhaben an einer wahnwitzigen Vision. Wir werden aus Raum und Zeit gerissen, hinein in Herzogs spirituelle Welt. Dorthin, wo das Universum den Menschen niederringt. An den Punkt, in dem seine TrÃ¤ume und Wahnvorstellungen entspringen. Genauso entscheidend wie die Musik ist das Gesicht Klaus Kinskis. Mit seinen blauen Augen und seine fleischigen Lippen kÃ¶nnte dieser Schauspieler sinnlich wirken, wÃ¼rde sich sein Mund nicht immer wieder zu einem steifen Grinsen verziehen. Herzog behauptete einmal, Kinski schon in jungen Jahren kennen gelernt zu haben, als er vor Wut eine Toilette zerschlug. Laut Herzog konnte man anschliessend die Keramikscherben durch einen TennisschlÃ¤ger sieben. Kinski, seine Muse! In dem Moment, da Pizarro bemerkt, dass seine Expedition eine Torheit ist, schickt er wenige MÃ¤nner vor, den Fluss zu erkunden. AngefÃ¼hrt wird diese Gesandschaft von dem Aristokraten Don Pedro de Ursua gemeinsam mit Aguirre (Kinski). Mit dabei, ein paar Soldaten und Sklaven, ein Priester sowie Aguirres Tochter Inez. Ein Sklave erzÃ¤hlt den Frauen, dass er einst ein Prinz war, dem niemand ins Gesicht sehen durfte. Heute steht er in Ketten vor ihnen. Herzog hat keine Eile und nicht das BedÃ¼rfnis, diese Reise mit Action aufzublasen. Stattdessen vermittelt er uns ein GefÃ¼hl fÃ¼r die Grenzenlosigkeit des Flusses und des Regenwaldes darum herum. Kein Ufer ist in Sicht, alles wurde durch das Hochwasser geflutet. Das Schicksal dieser Entdeckungsreise: Der Tod. Nach und nach sterben die AnfÃ¼hrer, schliesslich regiert Aguirre, terrorisiert die Hinterbliebenen. Wahnsinn liegt in seinen Augen. Er glaubt, jemanden flÃ¼stern zu hÃ¶ren - eine VerschwÃ¶rung... Sofort trennt er den Kopf des VerrÃ¤ters ab! Die letzte Einstellung ist eine der nachhaltigsten und eindrucksvollsten, die ich je im Kino sah: Aguirre ganz allein auf seinem Floss, umgeben von Hunderten kleiner Ã„ffchen. Und immer noch plant er sein Imperium. Die Herstellung von Aguirre gehÃ¶rt an sich in den Mythenkreis des Weltkinos. Wie Herzog in einem entlegenen Teil des Dschungel drehte, wo das Fieber tobte und man leicht den Tod erwarten durfte. Herzog behauptet, Kinski die Regie-Anweisungen mit einem Gewehr gegeben zu haben. Kinski wiederum verneint das: Nur er hÃ¤tte ein Gewehr besessen! Die gesamte Crew verbrachte den Dreh auf denselben Flossen, die wir auch im Film sehen. Herzog, erklÃ¤rt, alle Dialoge wÃ¤ren ihm unmittelbar vor den Szenen eingefallen. Aguirre wird weder durch Dialoge getragen, noch durch Charaktere. Nur Kinski fÃ¼llt seinen Aguirre aus mit seinem Blick, seiner KÃ¶rpersprache. Es ist eine Geschichte, direkt aus Herzogs Universum: Ein Mann, der das UnmÃ¶gliche versucht, seine Vision zu leben. Ein Mann, der die Natur herausfordert. Von allen Filmemachern ist Werner Herzog der obsessivste, der besessenste! Nur ganz wenige Filme erreichen die KÃ¼hnheit dieser, seiner Vision und ihnen allen ist gemein, dass sie keinen ordinÃ¤ren Erfolg suchen, sondern Transzendenz. Vergleichen lÃ¤sst sich Aguirre aber nur mit einem einzigen Film: Dem Herzog Film, der unserer Filmkunstbar Fitzcarraldo ihren Namen verlieh!",

Klaus Kinski was a real odd ball in life and this is exemplified here as he is insane in the film. He turns in a great performance in Herzog's masterpiece that apparently heavily influenced Apocalypse Now and it is not hard to see why, given the similarities of some elements of the films.

On the one hand, this seems like a film that would be loaded with symbolism and deeper meanings, but in an interview, Werner Herzog, the director of the film, said he is incapable of seeing things in terms of symbols or metaphors. This is really confusing because the film is very vague and doesn't tell you exactly what it means. I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all, I love films with deep symbolic meanings that you need to interpret yourself, but after hearing what Herzog said, that makes me feel like the film is just vague for the sake of being vague. I am not at all passing this off as bad, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, but this is one of the films I need to re-examine in a few years when I've had time to let it sit.",

Unfortunately I feel largely the same way about this movie as I do about 2001: A Space Odyssey, another film you're not in any way allowed to speak negatively of.\nThe movie has some stunning landscape shots, a simplistic but haunting musical score, and I liked how the environments reflected the mood and state of mind of the characters, whether it be bleak, desolate or violent. Particularly impressive is how the beautiful nature of South America contrasts with the increasingly disturbed mentality our protagonist descends into. Unfortunately this movie is so poorly paced that it becomes very ponderous very quickly. It tries to be moody and contemplative, even when there's very little to contemplate. The dialogue is uninteresting, many of the characters just disappear from the movie without us discovering anything about them, and while Kinski has some great moments, he spends most of the movie looking bored out of his mind. In fact an alternative title to this movie could be 'Klaus Kinski Stares Off Into The Distance With Complete Indifference.'  It promises a lot, and I admire how well respected it is, and how much influence it had on movies like Apocalypse Now, one of my all-time favourites, but so little actually happens in the film that probably the most exciting scene is one where a horse gets slightly agitated. Thankfully it doesn't fall into the trap of being several hours long, but even at 90 minutes it feels unnecessarily protracted.",

The film's narrative and premise is quite similar to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (which would be released seven years later), although with seemingly minimal dialogue. Of course, due to the language barrier, I can't exactly understand what the characters are saying, or even the narrative itself. However, the film's biggest strength is its atmosphere and visuals. The film's soundtrack really conveys the protagonist's journey into the heart of darkness, while the film's overall atmosphere is rather calming. This sounds like the kind of film that I could watch if I needed a calming atmosphere. The weird thing about the performances is that even though I couldn't understand the language, I still liked the performances, as though they seemed to speak for themselves in a very effective way. While it's not a flawless film, I still found it to be very enjoyable, thanks to a great atmosphere and performances of admirable quality.",

It's like these people value cleanliness and looking like royalty and they're fighting against nature trying to pull them down in the dirt. To me the whole journey scene symbolizes the struggle to hold onto our humanity when isolated from civilization. \n\nBut the most disturbing scene is where they push the horse off the raft and in one scene it's fighting and making a noise, and then everything goes quiet and the horse is like a statue staring at them.

Well...\r\n\r\nThis is Herzog not just giving us the usual, remarkable film moments, but also giving us a real story in-between.

If Herzog overplayed his hand and became anything other than a spectator then this would have failed. If this had been shot on anything other than a stolen camera then it would not have worked.

The title character, Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), has an unwavering stare that does not conceal his murderous zeal, but he moves unsteadily on his feet, weaving and tilting as if perpetually drunk. He is calculating, but not sound of mind. His\nambitions-not just gold but power, to \"stage history the same way that other men stage plays\"-obviously exceed his grasp as he and his dying crew navigate a tattered raft through hostile lands. The only characters who seem to grasp the severity of the situation are Pizarro's handpicked expedition leader Ursua and Ursua's wife Dona Inez, but their rationality leaves them no better-equipped than Aguirre to survive the jungle. The story seems allegorical, a mockery of those who proclaim themselves rulers, and many of the characters are little more than clichÃ©s (a gluttonous emperor, a concerned wife, a sadistic henchman, etc.) Yet narrative is less important to this film's success than atmosphere. The props, costumes, and cinematography are of a high order, and although the Spanish conquistadors speak German, the language of the filmmaker, the natives in the movie speak Quechua.",

Gefahr und Tod lauern an jeder Flussbiegung, die unsere furchtlosen Helden durchqueren mÃ¼ssen um zu ihrem Ziel zu kommen - und so stirbt Mann um Mann in der Crew und der Wahnsinn nimmt seinen Lauf.\n\nWo Wahnsinn ist, kann auch Klaus Kinski nicht weit sein, der die Hauptrolle des Don Lope de Aguirre bekleidet. Als Bestandteil von Pizarros Peruexpedition wird er unter der FÃ¼hrung des Don Ursua vorausgeschickt - in Richtung Eldorado.\nLangsam aber stetig Ã¼bernimmt der von Macht und Ruhm gelockte Aguirre die FÃ¼hrung der Truppe untergrÃ¤bt die AutoritÃ¤t der FÃ¼hrer und spielt mit Macht und Einfluss. Aguirre ist vielleicht das definitive filmische Statement zum Thema Machtkorruption.\n\nKaum vorstellbar sind die Strapazen die die Crew durchmachen musste, um diesen Dreh, im sÃ¼damerikanischen Dschungel, in schweren EisenrÃ¼stungen, Ã¼berhaupt zu ermÃ¶glichen - noch dazu bekriegten sich Herzog und Kinski am Set andauernd, Morddrohungen sollen gefallen sein, aufgrund kÃ¼nstlerischer Differenzen. Das Paar sollte noch etliche weitere Filme nach Aguirre gemeinsam drehen, auch wenn die Vorzeichen schon zu diesem Zeitpunkt reichlich schlecht aussahen.\n\nDas aus diesem Konflikt GroÃŸartiges entsprungen ist, lÃ¤sst sich jedoch nicht abstreiten. Herzogs unvergleichbare FÃ¤higkeit einzufangen, was sich vor der Linse abspielt und dem Geschehen einen dokumentarischen Touch zu verleihen, Ã¤uÃŸert sich hier extrem stark. Speziell deshalb, weil der begrenzte Raum und der Expeditionscharakter ohnehin Ã¤hnliche Rahmenbedingungen wie eine konventionelle Dokumentation aufweist.\n\nEs geht jedoch nicht um Historical Reenactment, das muss klar sein. Herzog geht es um Macht und deformierte Seelen - wie jeder KÃ¼nstler will er den Code des Sinns des Lebens aufbrechen und stÃ¶ÃŸt naturgemÃ¤ÃŸ auf eine unlÃ¶sbare Aufgabe. Wenn es jemals einem KÃ¼nstler gelingen sollte, dann wohl Herzog, dem stursten, verbittertsten und hartnÃ¤ckigsten der Sinnsucher.",

And also, may have the most bleak outlook on human nature than any other film I have seen, but nevertheless,  it is a monument in filmmaking and one of the best films ever made. Werner Herzog wrote, produced, and directed this medieval fable about Spanish Conquistadors in search of El Dorado. The story is simple enough, a group of men are sent out by Pizarro to find the city of El Dorado, and no doubt, it turns out to be a much harder task than expected.  But Herzog makes this film so much more than that, this film is a study of the emptiness of men's actions in a world where they have denied God and the awesome power of nature. The music is really an essential part to this film's greatness, as it gives the film a tone of desolation, isolation, and madness. Aguirre is the main character,  and he is honestly one of the most insane men in cinema's history; he has completely abandoned the notion of God and nature, in his world, he is the wrath of god. Aguirre is alone in his pursuits, without nature and God, and without those things, he is left only to strive for wealth, power, and fame, because he seeks only earthly gains, he has no spiritual or philosophical pursuits. He is an utterly empty man, with no meaning to his life, and a cold, hard soul. The whole film you watch Aguirre slowly go insane, and become overrun with his hunger for power and gold. And this all leads to one of the greatest final scenes ever to be in a film, a scene where Aguirre is alone on the capuchin monkey infested raft, talking to himself about how he and his army of monkeys will take over all of the New World, but the monkeys will not obey him and he is eventually left alone to float down the river to his inevitable death. This is one of the most haunting visions of man in literary or cinematic history, and is essential viewing for any film buff.",

            "content": "EpopÃ©e tropicale librement inspirÃ©e de l'expÃ©dition du conquistador Lope de Aguirre (un vrai sale type qui boxait dans une catÃ©gorie dÃ©jÃ  connue pour son pourcentage Ã©levÃ© de sales types), 'Aguirre, la colÃ¨re de dieu' fait partie de ces oeuvres affublÃ©es, pour de bonnes ou de mauvaises raisons, de l'encombrant qualificatif de \"chef d'oeuvre\", et qu'il faut avoir vu au moins une fois pour pouvoir, Ã  dÃ©faut de l'aimer, Ãªtre capable d'en parler.  Comme on parle tout de mÃªme ici d'un film de Werner Herzog de la/sa grande Ã©poque, il est nÃ©cessaire de garder Ã  l'esprit que, le recul et la connaissance thÃ©orique des particularismes du rÃ©alisateur allemand aidant, ce qu'il y a autour du film pourrait trÃ¨s bien Ã©clipser ce qu'il y a dedans. On pense Ã©videmment au fait qu'il constitue le dÃ©but de la collaboration explosive entre Herzog et Klaus Kinski, avec son lot de crises de fureur et de menaces de mort.  On songe Ã©galement aux diverses lubies de Herzog : sa fibre documentaire le poussait Ã  filmer sans le moindre artifice, notamment la jungle amazonienne qui est ici exposÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©tat brut...ce qui ne la rend pas moins oppressante pour autant et compense largement le manque de moyens financiers.  Cette volontÃ© de rÃ©alisme l'incitait Ã©galement Ã  plonger son Ã©quipe dans les conditions rÃ©elles exposÃ©es dans la fiction : ainsi, les scÃ¨nes (comme celles du radeau sur la riviÃ¨re en crue) qui semblent dangereuses Ã  l'Ã©cran le furent rÃ©ellement pour les acteurs impliquÃ©s ! Tous ces Ã©lÃ©ments font de 'Aguirre' un objet singulier qu'on dÃ©couvre avec une curiositÃ© non dissimulÃ©e.  Werner Herzog l'a Ã©galement envisagÃ© comme une oeuvre porteuse de sens -parfois obscur! - et pas seulement comme une odyssÃ©e tropicale et guerriÃ¨re. C'est Ã©videmment le personnage de Aguirre qui cristallise ce qui s'apparente Ã  une forme de  synthÃ¨se de la condition humaine et plus spÃ©cifiquement occidentale.  La folie tapie chez Aguirre, magnifiÃ©e par Klaus Kinski, est la plus Ã©vidente, celle qu'on repÃ¨re Ã  l'Ã©tat latent dÃ¨s les premiÃ¨res minutes et qui ne demande qu'Ã  trouver un Ã©crin oÃ¹ s'Ã©panouir.  Son appÃ©tit de conquÃªte et sa soif de reconnaissance rÃ©sonnent quant Ã  eux comme une pathÃ©tique tentative pour retrouver une raison d'Ãªtre dans un monde dÃ©senchantÃ©, et virent Ã  l'hubris mÃ©galomane lorsque Aguirre s'octroit lui-mÃªme la lÃ©gitimitÃ© morale pour dÃ©fier les hommes, la loi, Dieu et la nature.  Ce dernier Ã©lÃ©ment suscite le constat absurde que de tels actes, supposÃ©ment historiques et glorieux Ã  l'Ã©chelle humaine, ne reprÃ©sentent rien Ã  l'Ã©chelle du monde : ils sont futiles, insignifiants et dÃ©pourvus de signification.  Deux scÃ¨nes illustrent plus particuliÃ¨rement ce constat amer de l'insignifiance humaine : dans la premiÃ¨re, isolÃ© Ã  des milliers de kilomÃ¨tres de la civilisation, Aguirre Ã©prouve pourtant le besoin de formaliser sa prise de pouvoir par un acte juridique, soumis Ã  l'approbation d'un aristocrate et d'un prÃªtre.  Dans la seconde, le conquistador dressÃ© sur son radeau Ã  la dÃ©rive alors que ses hommes succombent les uns aprÃ¨s les autres aux privations, se fÃ©licite de disposer d'un empire grand comme dÃ©jÃ  cinq fois l'Espagne...sur lequel il n'exerce Ã©videmment aucun contrÃ´le ! Eminemment intÃ©ressant pour qui voudra bien se donner la peine de creuser un minimum son propos, 'Aguirre, la colÃ¨re de dieu' pourra nÃ©anmoins rebuter le spectateur moderne en raison des sempiternels parti-pris artistiques et narratifs de Werner Herzog, de son mÃ©pris affichÃ© pour l'esthÃ©tique et les artifices de mises en scÃ¨ne, et sa vision d'un cinÃ©ma dont la vocation est de reflÃ©ter l'expÃ©rience humaine de ceux qui en furent partie prenante.  MÃªme si on n'a plus guÃ¨re l'habitude aujourd'hui de devoir effectuer soi-mÃªme la majeure partie du travail d'assimilation d'un film, le grand public pourra nÃ©anmoins trouver son compte dans ce thÃ©atre de l'absurde au coeur de l'Amazonie, ne serait-ce qu'en repÃ©rant les similitudes qui ont fait de 'Aguirre', l'une des principales sources d'inspiration de Francis Ford Coppola pour la seconde moitiÃ© du mythique 'Apocalypse now'",

How brilliant ever aspect is, and how consistent it is at doing so. I believe Herzog knew this was his greatest vision, and it's impressive how well he supported it.\n   Narratively, it couldn't be better. It is narrated through the diary of the monk, vaguely, while being controlled through the hauntingly powerful performance of the great Klaus Kinski. It's style/scope is open to the right and wrong of each decision. The humane and the inhumane. It constantly displays scene of such great power, it's nearly beyond my comprehension. It's among the most beautiful films ever made. It's visuals won't be entirely appealing to everyone, understandably, but the STUNNING camerawork (among the greatest cinematography ever, like Terrence Malick great). That last shot will stay with me for years to come, and almost every other shot, as well. This film unleashes on appeal to the senses, in every way. The soundtrack is quite magnificent as well.

            "content": "This highly influential exploration of the machinations of society would set the template for the rest of Werner Herzog's career in fiction film making and prove to be his most prolific and talked about film. The movie itself is not widely seen or talked about beyond cinephiles but Herzog's dark portrayal of an actual 16th Century Expedition by Spanish Conquistadors in search of El Dorado in the Amazon would inspire countless other filmmakers with both its meta themes and the staggering effort it must have taken to film the damn thing on scene in Brazil. In fact the film and its hands on approach to film making is what inspired Francis Ford Coppolla's infamous sojourn to Vietnam to shoot his now lauded Heart of Darkness adaption Apocalypse Now. In Herzog's own career apart from being a vivid showcase of the themes of homo sacer, society destroyed by disaster and of Imperialism gone horribly wrong which are three of his favorites was also his first project with distant relative and at the time minor German Star Klaus Kinski. Though at the time Kinski was best known for appearing in Spaghetti Westerns he would cement himself here and later in Fitzcarraldo as one of cinema's most fascinating actors, not least of which due to his and Herzog's infamously tortuous professional and personal relationship. Much like the aforementioned Vietnam epic, this has one of the most notoriously brutal shooting histories of all time, with countless cast and crew almost dying as Herzog recklessly refused to use special effects (yeah they're actually firing cannons into the jungle and the like) and Kinski and Herzog's friendship was never as bipolar as on this film where Kinski lost part of a finger and the two reportedly actually tried to kill each other multiple times. It's understandable than to wonder is this really a good movie or just a fascinatingly hectic clusterfuck? Well let's descend into the clouds and take a lawful look.\r\n\r\nAs the title suggests the movie is about second ranking Conquistador Lope de Aguirre (Kinski) a historical footnote and nut job who was part of Pissaro's original expedition to South America. Pissaro's party is split into groups in an attempt to spread out and find El Dorado in the jungle under a deadline and Aguirre finds himself under noble and high ranking Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra). Tensions inevitably come to ahead however and when Ursua decides their time is up and they must return to Pissaro treacherous Aguirre intimidates the rest of the group into following his puppet \"Emperor\" the fat nobleman tag along Don Fernando de Guzman (Peter Berling) and imprisoning Ursua. However neither Aguirre nor the rest of them including the Monk Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro) who documents the trip can anticipate what hardships await them in the jungle and ultimately Aguirre's hubris is their undoing.\r\n\r\nThis story of the film is a lot more than the sum of its parts, the most basic thing to take away from it is people are overly ambitious and often that coupled with greed can lead them to ruin. A slightly deeper read is that the film is about the folly of 16th Century Western Imperialism, this is not a new idea but it can't be denied it's built into the very nature of the events the film is based on. The Conquistadors viewed themselves as God's people and thought they could come to a totally new environment and take it over and colonize it on the first try. But the film serves as a showcase of their foolishness which ultimately leads to their destruction as they try to carry litters of nobleman and women through the jungle as well as horses and cannons which are useless in the rainforest environment. For all their pomp and sincerity and talk of bringing enlightenment to the savages they end up looking like the fools and they trip and stumble their way through the jungle and end up starving, near death and adrift on a slowly breaking apart raft. And truly this is an idea Herzog likes to toy with he doesn't exoticize the South Americans in fact the film mocks it, by portraying many of the South American characters like the deposed Tribal Prince who longs for fealty from his people as just as foolish as the Spaniards. One of the more memorable characters is Pissaro's black slave Perucho played by Daniel Ades who is sent with the rest of them and proves just as stupid and arrogant. But there's an exciting third level the story probes which is one largely critical of society and the norms we place on it. Some of the more humorous moments of the film come from the Conquistadors trying to impose rules of life in Spain onto the unforgiving and untamed jungle, like in the ceremony coronating their \"Emperor.\" The movie basically is an exploration of how our society only really works in the world that we've carved out, basically we've bent the Earth around us to our will and in nature societal stigmas are unnecessary and in fact look downright foolish. How the viewer interprets that is largely up to them, it's certainly saying look how far we've come but how the movie and Herzog feel about that is a different matter. Personally I think Herzog has a problem of over romanticizing man and the Earth's primal nature but its still a fascinating treatise to a fascinating film. \r\n\r\nThere's a deceptively lot going on in this story, it becomes a battle between religion (who if you keep score is one of the first ones out), hereditary nobility, actual chivalrous nobility and the madness that exists in us all and while we all knew which would be the last one standing from the very beginning it's still marvelous to see how it unfolds in this film. All of this works all the better for Herzog's brilliant direction, how he got many of these shots we'll never know but the fact this was made in the middle of the Amazon is certainly prevalent and helps to make so many shots in this utterly unforgettable especially the ending. Also pervasive is his love of animals with many actual rainforest fauna popping up throughout this film to often breathtaking effect even with some of the simple ones like mice. Tying it all together is the performances other than Kinski as the madman Aguirre none of these are exceptional stand out roles but he coaxes such a great and naturalistic performance from the notoriously hammy Kinski you can't help but not care. Kinski looms and slouches his way through the movie alternating between growling his lines and saying them in an aghast windswept whisper and damn it does it work. This movie's a classic for a reason it holds up far better than I expected upon first hearing about it as an influential movie and just a bona fide masterpiece in its own right. Whether Herzog reached these heights again immaterial he reached them here, and no one's accusing Herzog of being a slouch of a Director.",

However rich a man may be he is astounded by the presence of something in this world that can make him more richer. No man is self satisfied by the things he has with him, but rather he plaintively envies the neighbours rich assets. Humans are a strange form of beings who enjoy fighting among themselves for money , land and women with profound sadistic amusement . Aguirre , Wrath of god is a movie about spaniards going in search of the mysterious Eldorado gold mines. As the name suggests this movie is enigmatic from the first shot depicting a vicious cloud and men as small as toys coming down through those translucent clouds. These men are of no interest to the gold but are rather forced to go because they are servants of the Holder of the throne. We see barefooted Indian slaves chained carrying the luxurious mistress and the tender daughter of fifteen years old. Their faces are filled with anger and agony on having to have suffered as slaves under Aguirre and Ursula the two second in command to Pizarro the leader of the expedition. Ursula more calm and subtle ushers them without contempt or anger but Aguirre shows disdain and bitter anger to even the harmless slaves. Pizarro on account of the obstacles and extreme hardships decide to send forty of the best for the expedition from the shore. Ursula is chosen as the commander and Aguirre the second. As the rafts are filled with the forty people including slaves and soldiers, we see misfortunes befalling the group . One of the rafts goes into a treacherous whirlpool and returns with the men dead and then Aguirre much to the dismay of Ursula fires that raft with a cannon. A day passes by and strangely the rest of the rafts are found missing. New rafts are ordered to be built but Ursula knowing that the expedition is a suicide orders the crew to return but then Aguirre tells the story of Hernando Cortez's daring conquest of Mexico and rejuvenates the capsized crew . He takes command and orders the murder of Ursula and anyone who's on Ursula's side. Ursula after a gunshot at him Woes silence till death and is taken to treatment by his mistress. Aguirre becomes paranoid and mad from then on. What we see then is harrowing and outrageous atrocities of Aguirre. Aguirre proposes himself the wrath of God and slashes off a man's head when he's counting the number of bends in the river in order to escape from death. The movie is hypnotic and psychotic from then on. What we see then is the strange events resulting due to egoistic and paranoid attitudes all through the crew. The movie written and directed by Werner Herzog is enigmatic and extremely disturbing. The movie's not driven by dialogue but it speaks for it's own when Aguirre with his blue eyes and distorted stature looks at us with contempt and disdain.Laden with dark photography the valley of Peru and the amazon forests are pictured with picturesque beauty amidst the melancholic and terrifying aura all through the movie. The movie's psychotic sequences are literal stupefiers. They petrify and scare you so much that the ludoweeko experiment in 'A clockwork orange' would have been a mercy. The mental shock you experience after the movie is so hallucinating that it can give you nightmares for days and days. Herzog employs sublime music from the first long shot of the hazy mountains till the Psychotic end sequence. Herzog manipulates our minds and fills it with strange hallucinations. This brilliant movie is so disturbing that to watch it a second time would be a daring act of true valour. The movie ends with Aguirre standing on the raft all alone suffering from fever and experiencing hallucinations from starving. Aguirre becomes the true wrath of God when all the people around him die Mercilessly and he has none but a group of monkeys to help him conquer the world. As when paranoia got into this man he not only destroyed himself but also created feud between the crew and became The prodigy of devil on earth. Disturbing, hallucinative, hypnotic and horrifying this movie may give you chills of a lifetime and provoke your deepest thoughts. Herzog Explores the visual power of Cinemas by making your mind burn and writhe with unbearable pain and fear .",

            "content": "This was one of the earliest movies from Werner Herzog, one of the world's greatest and most prolific directors, and it seems like a perfect prototype for much of his later work. It's not a conventionally satisfying narrative, but it sustains a sense of doom and madness for its entire running time and has some truly amazing images. If you only saw one Herzog film (though of course you should see many), it should probably be this one.\n\nThe story, which is loosely based on a real historical journey, is about a conquistador's doomed quest for the fabled gold city of El Dorado along the Amazon river. Gonzalo Pizarro sends a search party up the river to look for El Dorado. Unfortunately for everyone, the search party includes the delusional Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), who will not stop searching for the city even if it means getting everyone killed along the way. Aguirre manipulates the group in various ways on their road to doom.\n\nThe only actor worth talking about in the movie, really, is Klaus Kinski as Aguirre. You've never seen anyone crazier-looking than Klaus Kinski, especially in this movie. Apparently he actually was pretty much out of his mind, but that helps make his performance that much more convincing. The rest of the cast varies from okay to kind of wooden, but it doesn't really matter, since the film is more about their situation than it is about the characters themselves.\n\nHerzog shot on location deep in the jungles of Peru, and it's abundantly obvious throughout the movie, There are some scenes involving animals, particularly a horse and tons of monkeys, that I suspect wouldn't clear SPCA regulations if the movie were made by an American today. But the images from those scenes are among the movie's best. The soundtrack, by a German band called Popol Vuh, seems both ecclesiastical and very eerie, and is not like anything else I've heard. It's hard to describe exactly what makes this movie so great - it's not any sort of conventional pleasures you get from it. It's more just like the movie is a weird, quiet, scary place that you could visit from time to time to contemplate human folly and the cruelty of the universe. Or something like that. Now that I think about it, it's kind of like a less violent version of Blood Meridian. No wonder Herzog and Cormac McCarthy got along so well in that radio interview they did. Maybe Herzog should direct the Blood Meridian adaptation.",

            "content": "Perhaps I'm just never going to get a giant erection over a film by Werner Herzog. I feel like everyone has one great director that they just for some reason don't love as much as everyone else. I guess mine is Herzog. However, I can safely say that I thought Aguirre: The Wrath of God was the film by Herzog I like the most. I agree with people when they say it's haunting. I never did feel so pulled in that the haunting feeling took over the film. I guess that's what I always get from Herzog's films. I feel like he tells great stories but I tend to feel distanced and hardly ever involved. The second half of this film is where I became the most involved that I've ever been in his films. The first half had some silly shots that weren't as interesting as he thought. I understood that the natural elements were taking over them. I didn't really think that cut to a static shot of rushing water was very smooth nor effective. I loved the opening slow moving shot that showed the crew walking through the clouds in the mountains. The next shots where we were with them in the mountain felt pretty amateur. It took me out of the movie. I was more focused on seeing these people trying to not look into the camera and seem as natural as possible. I could tell I was watching a movie. Perhaps this was what he wanted, and if that's the case then I just simply didn't understand. I could nitpick and go through so many things that I didn't care much for in the first half, but it also establishes the characters really well and sets an amazing tone for the better part of the film. It all leads up to seeing the madness of Aguirre and the rest of the crew. What I thought was most well done is how people die. When they are shot there's not a jolt in the music and the person doesn't freak out. They die in a way that they accept everything is over. The best part of the film's towards the end when they are going down the river on the raft and the crew's getting killed by spears. They are completely mad at this point and don't believe that anything's actually happening to them. Aguirre in his thirst for power yells at them telling them they are dying. When they are stuck with a spear they just stay on the ground where they're at and eventually die. The story here shows these people that are lead to their doom. They love gold and God so much that they believed the Inca's when they told the story about El Dorado so they go on the search for the great city. We know straight from the beginning they are doomed, so we are just watching them become consumed by nature. At the same time they become less and less civilized. They no longer want to give the city over to Spain. This will be their's and they will assign their own emperor and everything. At times the film's hypnotic and the music is always top notch. It begins to take you under after a while and before you know it you're lost in the film. It kinda betrays itself when one of the guys is killed and he makes a joke about the bigger spears becoming fashionable. There are moments like those that I don't understand their purpose. But overall, I thought Aguirre: The Wrath of God was great, but not as focused or engaging as it could have been.",

The movie trails Spanish conquistadors in search for El Dorado, that much-coveted Lost City of Gold. The trek is long and difficult, and Gonzalo Pizarro's large group soon breaks off into a smaller one led by Don Pedro de UrsÃƒÂºa, but the real fire fueling the expedition is the crazed Don Lope de Aguirre, portrayed with unsettling believability by Klaus Kinski. As his group's number dwindles, Aguirre's determination to conquer the Americas grows. With the occasional bursts of dark comedy that, in the midst of such harrowing aimlessness, are all the funnier in a morbid kind of way, Aguirre, The Wrath of God at times strikes one as a parody.

I was surprised to know that Herzog wrote script within 2.5 days.\r\n\r\nKlaus Kinski plays Don Lope de Aguirre, he pursues blind dream to find El Dorado leading alongside Spaniard expedition team and 2000 Indian slaves. Kinski performs role in total obsession, he moves with camera and gives expression of Wrath of God (which is what he calls himself at near end). It is further believed that Herzog used verbal confrontation to tout Kinski, and later he would roll camera around him. It is significant film, where you come to understand greed, treachery, obsession, and religious profundity.",

The clash of man and nature is also highlighted by dangerous cinematography of Thomas Mauch who brings the viewer to the razors edge of perilous cliffs and furious tides. Herzog is a man of habit, but one may go as far to say his habits are his obsessions - and the fingerprints of his obsessions are all over this film.

While the second half, is the chronicle Aguirre spiraling into his own omnipotent fantasy, while the expedition itself is left to suffer the slings and arrows, in most cases literally of the unseen, but equally menacing presence of the natives.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the movie that Apocalypse Now wanted to be, but couldn't pull it's head out of it's art school ass long enough to become.

This group is steeped in Christianity as they spread it throughout the new land and the natives that inhabit it. It's like a trade in a way: We'll give you Christ if you give us the gold. As the film progresses and the group heads further into the jungle everything begins to fall apart as the natives become more and more restless and Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) develops the obsession of being the next Cortez.\n\nAguirre lends itself to so many films that came after it, particularly Apocalypse Now. The basic premise between the two films is the same. A mission on a boat slowly falls into total chaos. Just like the characters on screen, we have no idea what's around the bend in the river ahead. With Aguirre, there are two things that make it such a great movie. The first is Werner Herzog's direction. All great directors use the environment and the background as another character in their film. Herzog accomplishes this by making shots seem so beautiful and so sinister at the same time. What lies in the trees over there? Herzog gets into the soul of the jungle right along with the souls of the characters. \n\nOf course when we talk about characters we have to discuss the second part of the Aguirre equation and that is Klaus Kinski. He is that desire, that rage, that cut throat individual that will advance to his goal no matter what the cost. He surveys the land like a god looking over his domain. He will start is own empire, even when things are at their darkest. In a way Aguirre and Kinski are bound by their identities. They're the same person in the end.\n\nAguirre is one of those films that people stumble upon. A story that doesn't sound like much on the surface becomes an imaginative journey into the unknown. A story that is universal in nature, Aguirre is a great piece of German cinema.",

With a plot that takes a page out of history (with some leniency of course), \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\" is a treasure of the adventure genre. The long, arduous journey of the conquistadors is captured excellently. At only 96 minutes, the film is short, but feels long, almost as though it is trying to drag us into the story. And it works!!! With a crazy actor playing the crazy Aguirre, this is a very rare film in that it is both funny, wacky, and scary at the same time. Engaging, fantastic, and peculiar, \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\" is more than worthy of your Netflix reservation!",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nA thousand Spanish conquistadors make their way across and through the Andes Mountains. A cage and the chicken within it don't make it. Everyone else does. Instantaneously, they descend into the Amazonian jungle below. It becomes very clear that the Amazon River plays a big part - rather appropriately - in the vast jungle itself, and these men (plus two women) are searching for El Dorado. And they will probably find it much faster if they split up into units; one traveling across river by raft, another by land. Gonzalo Pizarro, commander of the expedition in its original form, assigns one of his most fierce and trusty conquistadors - Lope De Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) - to head the river-raft expedition. Once the two units have gone their separate ways; there's no turning back.\r\n\r\nAguirre is a frightening, deceiving, secretive, scarred man. He has a face that looks as if he hasn't smiled once in his life; although we do see him with a wide, silly grin for a brief moment in the film, when he presents to his young daughter (who has gone along for the ride) a sleepy sloth that is so small that it can fit into the palm of his hand. But this is nothing more than momentary bliss; he is otherwise a sadistic control freak, feared by his fellow men and especially his fellow women. He is like a time bomb without a time; pretty much ready to explode at any given moment. But that moment cannot be predicted; adding even more danger to his character.\r\n\r\nAll the same, he is willing to command his unit; keeping his - and their - eyes on the prize. Traveling by their wooden raft, which floats elegantly across furious rapids that closely symbolize and mimic the perverse anger of the titular character; they must keep going until they reach the desired destination. However, this is easier said than done; cannibalistic Indian tribes linger not far from the shore of the treacherous brook, spears and poisonous arrows in hand. One might suppose that the animals of the Amazon would prove a problem too; but in this case, they are seen in a more sympathetic light. From the pigs to the little sloth to the dozens of monkeys in the film's concluding frames; the animals represent a sort of deep-seeded connection with nature.\r\n\r\nBut what else would one expect from Werner Herzog, writer and director of \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\"? Naturalistic, observant, existential, and intellectual; he is a filmmaker of many talents. He is famous not only for his work in the departments of feature filmmaking; but also for his in-depth, passionately-made documentaries. His gifts and skills as a documentarian have served him well in the past; and even if \"Aguirre\" was made before he had made a name for himself in the field of documentary filmmaking, it kind of feels like a film from that genre anyways. But the fact that it is a straight-up feature film production lends it an upper hand; and advantage; a unique flavor that a documentary on similar subjects might have lacked all-together. It's the sort of cinematic experience so rich and delicate that you can practically taste, touch, and smell anything that can be seen or heard.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about \"Aguirre\" is the fact that, in terms of story and characters, it is purely minimalist; but when speaking of the film as a visual experience, it is something new and hallucinatory. Herzog achieves a sort of dark, enamoring surrealism with the film; relying more on beautiful, inspiring, frightening, moving images rather than sympathetic or memorable characters. That's not to say that the film is without its narrative substance - it's a very well-told story of madness, obsession, and authority - but people come back for what they can see, hear, and above all, feel. One can certainly absorb the film in one sitting, yes, but it's completely beneficial to see the film a few more times afterwards, for only then will the viewer get a tight grasp on Herzog's artistic vision in its most complete form. There are symbols - some obvious, some not; and some that I can't identify whatsoever, therefore rendering them irrelevant to me at the time, but certainly not irrelevant for the future - that carry the film and give each image some background and panache.  \r\n\r\nThis is another superb, intoxicating performance from Klaus Kinski - Herzog regular - and we all know that he's had a good many of those. So I'm not exaggerating when I say that I think his portrayal of Aguirre is unpredictable and masterful enough for me to call it perhaps his best performance in his entire, expansive, life-long career. I don't know what that says to you, but to me; it says a lot. Kinski is intense and capricious; the only thing we know is that he is angry and relentless towards the crew that he has been given, but we often question: why? Herzog isn't ready to give us all the correct answers - as this is a work of fiction and the imagination rather than a close, accurate history lesson - but he provides the audience with enough questions to keep each member of it busy for a few solid months, days, possibly even years.\r\n\r\nI do not have any favorite scenes from \"Aguirre\". In a sense, every scene is my favorite. It is a film filled with such stunning whimsy and imagery that one cannot simply single out specific scenes and images, labeling them as more important than any others in the film. The case is that they aren't; every image is of equal importance and relevance. They are all beautiful; and they've all captured me in some way. Through the macabre, strange, inexplicable poetry of the movie camera; Herzog is able to take us on this grand trip. Through the jungle, through the river rapids, through the all-too-humane corruption of each hero and each villain; we watch in horror, but in the end, we are but sloths to Herzog's gentle palm, and he neither exploits nor attempts to explain us.",

The film portrays an expedition into the mountains of 16th century South America, in search of the alleged El Dorado. El Dorado doesn't exist at all so it's blatantly clear that this expedition is doomed from the beginning. As the expedition continues and rations run short, the surviving conquistadors fall prey to the Indians constant barrage of spears and the terror Aguirre reigns on them. \r\n       The movie becomes immensely intense towards its ending with its depiction of physical and moral decay amongst the surviving men. Klaus Kinski plays Aguirri and portrays some of the finest acting I've seen. His depiction is so powerful that he nearly washes out the entire cast, which all give solid performances as well. His depiction of a man losing his sanity is not over exaggerated but powerfully realistic. He is so good, that any scenes not containing him feel slightly empty.\r\n       The on-location shooting does more than reveal the merciless world they were trying to conquer and the films cinematography wonderfully establishes the magnificence of the jungle. The film contains an eerily claustrophobic feel and uncompromising sense of dread. This is a great movie.    \r\n\r\n10/10",

Aguirre is one of his very best films, only behind Fitzcarraldo in my book, and an unforgettably gorgeous, eerie experience. Herzog's poetically slow pacing and the way which he films the overgrown nature dwarfing his characters was a clear influence on Terrence Malick, but the themes and moods of Aguirre are often more in line with Coppola's Apocalypse Now. This is a dark, strange descent into insanity, filled with grotesque humor and oddball poetry. Klaus Kinski is a disturbingly perfect fit for the titular character. His performance is almost comically intense and bizarre. \r\n\r\nI could see myself boosting Aguirre up to a 10/10 rating on another viewing - yes, this is that good, and made even more weirdly fascinating by the insane complications Herzog and Kinski faced while shooting. Look them up, it's impressive that even with such crazy things going on they still turned out such a great film.",

It took me awhile to re-capture after Werner Herzog's \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" and I have finally figured them out. The film is about an explorer named \"Aguirre\" (Klaud Kinski) who had was on trek in South America (the Amazon Jungle and its tributaries so I assume mostly in Brazil) and his continuous descent into madness. It is one of two bizarre foreign language films I have seen in the past several days (the other being Ingmar Bergmann's \"Cries and Whispers\"). The characters are fat and ugly, mean, sloppy, desperate, mental, likely consumed with body odour, especially Aguirre, and yet it is hard to believe anybody could like a film with characters obtaining such bad qualities. It is very likable, involving, and very good for that matter. This odd characteristics add to the goodness of the film along with the Amazon scenery and rivers. I would have liked it to be in Spanish rather than German since these characters originated from Spain, but luckily, this problem is very insignificant. It does not take away from the film. If viewers have seen \"Apocalypse Now,\" there are recognizable bits that had influenced the Francis Ford Cappola film. I also felt this film was influenced itself by Akira Kurosawa's \"Throne of Blood\" which was also about a leader's descent into madness. I would say this a great film!",

In the end Aguirre, the Wrath of God as he later come to calls himself, finds himself as a victim of his own tragic illusion. The film, like Stanley KubrickÃ¢(TM)s 2001: A Space Odyssey is mostly a visual and musical experience where only like thirty five minutes of the movie have dialogue. Something really quite interesting about the film is that it was shot on the location of the actual expedition and when you see the acting in this movie you can see how hard it was for the actors to fight the difficulties set by this location. Knowing this fact it made me look at the film deeper just to see how hard it was for the actors and trust me just by watching the beginning of movie you can tell it was really, really though for them. As far as the costumes go they are all great, they actually do look like they were taken from a museum and used just for the film. The script is perfect as well as the directing. The only thing I actually had a complain about was for some of the audio editing where sometimes some of the music played by the Indian slave can hardly be heard.

The Peruvian highlands that descend into the Amazon basin are luscious and incredibly dangerous and the Amazon is a character unto itself. The script is minimalist and the characters are only loosely based on historical figures. Kinski is good for his role as the mad conquistador although if he had had his way he would have played it even more like a maniac, but Herzog reeled him in. Anyways, he thoroughly dominates with an alternately brooding and crazed performance. This film is cited by FFC as a visual influence for parts of Apocalypse Now! for obvious reasons.  Still I think it's a bit overrated. It seems to be a darling of most professional movie critics, and I always tend to view this sort of consensus as suspect. It's good, it has haunting incredible imagery, but it's not this idyllic epic that it's often made out to be.",

Soon, they come across great difficulties and Aguirre sees his chance and takes charge of the expedition. The question then arises, will his quest lead them to El Dorado, or to certain destruction?\n\nWerner Herzog and his visual achievements has been on my list for years, but I have never managed to see any of his movies until now. I would say that \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" is part madness and part genius. HerzogÃ‚Â´s documentary style shooting and the obvious difficult situations he managed to put his actors through, is intriguing for sure. However, at the same time the very unpolished result makes it partly humourous as well, which was not the idea I reckon. Kinski is solid and intense as Aguirre. He is Aguirre. \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" doesnÃ‚Â´t deserve a 5 star in my opinion, but HerzogÃ‚Â´s very unique way of directing gets a 5 star rating from me.",

As Aguirre continues on his mission, he slowly begins to develop a madness for power and usurps the power harbored by his leaders to guide himself and his crew to the supposed riches of El Dorado. Kinski plays Aguirre in almost surreal manner--Aguirre walks as if he is weighed down by a heavy burden, a burden that is not just the power of leadership but also the weight of greed and madness.

He was a Spanish conquistador. Aguirre, The Wrath of God, is his story. Under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro, Aguirre and other fellow conquistadores, along with a group of Indians they have captured, are in the mission of finding the mystical land of El Dorado. Aguirre along with other 39 men were sent to go deeper into the jungle and find the land. Aguirre then decides to rebel, to find the land by themselves and become the great lords of El Dorado. But many complications arisen. Aguirre leads the men into a bloody and hard quest to the land. \r\n\r\nI had heard alot of this film before watching it. I have heard people call it a masterpiece, I have heard people call it the greatest German film, I have heard people say this film is near the top of the greatest films of all times, I have heard people say Klaus Kinski was brilliant and that Werner Herzog is a genius. I had heard many things about this film, but yet I hadn't seen it befre today. And now I have finally seen it, and I finaly was able to confirm if all the fuzz was true. And was it? There's alot to think about but it certainly lived up to its fame. \r\nWell, I wouldn't call it to be near the top ten of the greatest films of all time (though it is certainly in the top 30), or I wouldn't call it the best German film, but it certainly was very impressive. \r\nTo start with both Kinski and Herzog live to their reputation. I would like to speak about Kinski first and his wonderful performance. Kinski was very impressive. He didn't only become his character, but he while being Aguirre suffered the transformations and situations he had. Aguirre was some crazy son of a bitch... That scene where he pushed the horse was just nuts! And the ego he had could make his head explode! And he wouldn't let anyone go against him, even though he was wrong, and I think he knew he was wrong, he just didn't want to accept it. \r\nAnd Herzog's direction. I like the focus of the direction, how he pulled the movie off. I liked how he focused on everybody and their doings before getting into the real action. He made a very good job with the direction. The slow pacing and the atmosphere, it was just amazing. I liked Herzog's vision, I liked how he worked. I'll try to see more of his films (though I think I've already seen some). \r\nI think people already know that this film was a big influence on Apocalypse Now, but I would like to say it. It is clear how it did, the whole scenes on the rafts on the river and the Indians on the sides, shooting arrows ocassionally, it is clear influence on Apocalypse Now. I just wanted to point this out, I dont want to make Apocalypse Now look less original or that this film is superior or anything, I just wanted to point that out. \r\nAnyway, Aguirre The Wrath of God did live up to its reputation. Werner Herzog's direction combined with Klaus Kinski's excellent performance makes this one great film. \r\nMy score for this film 93%.",

Well, I finally got to see Aguirre, The Wrath of God and now I kick myself because I should have done it long ago.\r\n\r\nThis is a visually spectacular movie. Filmed in Peru, all the majesty of the Andes and the rivers that flow through it is showed not just as something beautiful but as a physical opponent that the conquistadors need to oversome to survive.\r\n\r\nAnd that survival is always in doubt. Gonzalo Pizzaro(Alejando Repules) leads a group of Spanish conquistadores into the jungle in search of El Dorado, the famed City of Gold. But the jungle is no friend to gold seekers and soon the expedition is bogged down in the mud and overgrowth. So Pizzaro sends out a smaller group, including the brooding Don Aguirre(Klaus Kinski),on rafts downriver in search of supplies and the ever elusive gold. \r\n\r\nMisadventures happen to the conquistadores as they head downstream, and none of it was good. Morale starts deteriorating and this gives the ruthless, and ultimately megolomaniac, Aguirre his chance to take command of the expedition. He does this first by installing a puppet leader then later takes full command. His megalomania ends up being his, and his fellow explorers, final undoing.\r\n\r\nWerner Herzog creates a brilliant tableu of beauty (the jungle environment), greed (the lust for gold overshadowing reason), claustrophobia (danger from the natives, the river, starvation and themselves) and the lust for power (Aguirre's thirst for his place in history). If you research this film, Herzog lost himself in the filming as well, repeatedly threatening Kinski to keep filming at gunpoint. And this was his first film with Kinski! Obviously it did not damage their relationship as it continued another 15 years.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie might not be for everyone, it certainly has its place in film history. If you are a film fan, it is one not to be missed. As for me, I just should not have kept it waiting so long.....",

They are led by Pizarro and are searching for El Dorado \"The City of Gold\". Amongst them is Brother Gaspar de Carjaval a missionary in charge of bringing the word of god to the natives, and Lope de Aguirre a disturbing and rather cruel professional soldier accompanied by his daughter.\r\nPizarro's column soon finds it impossible to continue and the decision is made to send out a group of about 50 men under the command of Don Pedro de Ursua. Aguirre, his daughter, Brother Gaspar, a nobleman named Guzman and Ursua's mistress all form part of this group.\r\nThe group set out on rafts down the Amazon but soon run into trouble and end up losing some men and the hands of unseen natives. After this Aguirre openly rebels against Ursua's authority who is then wounded. The mutiny complete Aguirre proclaims Guzman emperor of El Dorado which they have yet to find.\r\nAs they continue down the Amazon more and more of the men are killed by native arrows as is the new Emperor.\r\nAfter about a month the men are scared, exhausted, starving and delirious. Aguirre keeps them going but is gradually veering into insanity himself.\r\nOne day the natives attack and all the survivors are killed by their arrows including Aguirre's daughter and the Missionary.\r\nAguirre then completely loses his mind and proclaims himself The Wrath Of God and is last seen standing alone amongst all the corpses of his companions.\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated by Brother Gaspar, the missionary supposedly seeking to convert the natives but who also seems very keen on getting to The City Of Gold.\r\n\r\nThe direction was excellent, the enormity and pending danger of the Amazonian forest are captured extremely well. Many of the shots are so incredibly powerful and well executed I wanted them to go on forever. \r\nThe pacing was somewhat strange: there is long and beautiful shots of running water yet when something important happens it happens very fast and can easily be missed. \r\nThe gradual deterioration of the minds and the conditions of the group is fascinating to watch .\r\nThe omnipresent threat of the \"Indians\" was very atmospheric and just adds to the overall atmosphere which is poetic yet haunting.\r\n\r\nThe plot was very strange, it starts out as a quest for El Dorado but as the film progresses you get the sense that it is more of a struggle against nature to survive.\r\nA thing that struck me often was the absurdity of the conditions and the way of life of these spaniards, they wear armor and carry pikes, they hold trials and sit on makeshift thrones, they are waited on by servants, all this while there life is in danger and their chances of survival would be considerably greater if they adapted to the way of life o the natives.\r\nTheir formality and constant signing of decrees and annexing of territories all seemed so out of place and strange.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is sparse and often rather cryptic, apart from the useful narrative of the Missionary. The shots of the Amazon and the jungle are far more eloquent than the words of the men. Even though towards the end some extremely memorable dialogue can be found such as:\r\n-\"Anyone considering desertion will be cut into 198 pieces.\r\nThen trampled upon until he can be used for painting walls\".\r\nOverall the dialogue is original and poetic yet completely faded out by the wonderful visuals.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack was excellent from the beginning to the end, I especially liked the native music played by the slave. The piano and voice music used during certain scenes really adds a lot of emotion, such as the hanging scene.\r\n\r\nThe acting was very good all around, of course Claus Klinski was amazing but I also thought that Del Negro did a very good job as the Missionary. Klaus Klinski performance is good but not overly remarkable at the beginning of the film but by the end when Aguirre has fallen into complete madness he steals every scene with his outstandingly intense performance.\r\n\r\nThe characters were all very well developed and pretty much all unlikeable, even Brother Gaspar who represents the Church is unlikeable man who cowardly sides with Aguirre even though he knows he's insane.\r\nThe characters all slowly descend into madness and despair and the nobler men are soon killed off by the other who are hungry for gold.\r\n\r\nOverall this is an amazing experience and I'm looking forward to seeing it again very soon. This film has it's share of flaws but personally I was spellbound, I found it hard to take my eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended for Herzog fans, even though this film will not be to every ones taste due to it's strange story and trippy direction I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for anything different from the usual stuff.\r\n\r\nCinematography   9/10\r\nActing          10/10\r\nSoundtrack      10/10\r\nPlot             9/10\r\nScreenplay       9/10",

            "content": "\"Aguirre, der zorne gottes\" est un film essentiel, il a inspirÃ© entre autre \"Apocalypse Now\" de Coppola et mÃªme \"The New World\" de Terence Malick, des conquistadors venus dans ce qu'ils appellent le nouveau monde (y'a quoi d'nouveau en fait ? Puisqu'il y avait dÃ©jÃ  des gens !!!) pour trouver le fameux el dorado, un petit groupe se dÃ©tache et poursuit l'expÃ©dition en mer, parmis eux, Done Lope de Aguirre, qui a un sÃ©rieux complexe de superioritÃ©, va mener le groupe Ã  sa perte dans sa recherche dÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©e et obsessionnelle, et l'ennemi proclamÃ© indiens qui surgit de nulle part, mettant Ã  mal le petit groupe. Pendant une partie du film, on le voit comme un documentaire, peu de dialogue mais des images parlantes, criantes de rÃ©alisme avec une voix off qui explique ce qui se passe. On assiste Ã  la montÃ©e en puissance et en folie de Aguirre qui place un fantoche comme leader avant de prendre sa place Ã  sa mort, et la suite on la connaÃ®t, Ã©tonnant de voir que dans un si petit groupe, on retrouve le fonctionnement d'un pays entier, et c'est toujours d'actualitÃ©. Film qui traite aussi de la folie, le rÃ©alisateur arrive Ã  nous mettre dans la peau des personnages surtout au moment oÃ¹ ils croient apercevoir un bateau perchÃ© dans un arbre, est-ce que c'est le cas, est-ce qu'ils dÃ©lirent ? C'est cette immersion qui rend ce film passionnant, avec aussi, des attaques venues de nulle part, la lente dÃ©liquescence du groupe terrassÃ© par la faim et tout Ã§a pour servir les desseins d'un megalo qui promet la fortune si tout le monde le suit comme un mouton. Klaus Kinski est impressionnant dans le rÃ´le titre oÃ¹ il est comparable aux pires dirigeants d'une nation oÃ¹ rien n'est discutÃ©, tout est approuvÃ© sous peine d'Ãªtre rejetÃ© voir exÃ©cutÃ©. Grand film Ã  plus d'un titre, mÃªme si les films oÃ¹ un peuple dicte sa conduite Ã  d'autres me rendent malade, quand ils sont bien faits et qu'ils ne donnent pas de leÃ§on dÃ©mago, je dois le reconnaÃ®tre !",
