When the men arrive, they are not welcomed by the backwoods locals, who stalk the vacationers and savagely attack them in the woods. Reeling from the ambush, the friends attempt to return home but are surrounded by dangerous rapids and pursued by a madman. Soon, their canoe trip turns into a fight for survival.",

            "content": "Rich in challenging themes and unthinkable moral dilemmas, John Boorman's Deliverance is the harrowing story of four men who embark on an ill-conceived canoe trip down a treacherous river in northern Georgia, confronted by dangerous rapids and unimaginable horror throughout their journey.  Filled with meaningful dialogue (\u2018Sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything') and iconic moments (the spirited Dueling Banjos scene), Deliverance is an adventure movie like no other, a film that cemented Burt Reynolds star status and confirmed the considerable talent of Jon Voight.  On top of the star power, Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is stellar throughout, especially the shallow focus shots early in the movie.  While not always easy to watch, it is a movie that needs to be seen.",

The film is also quite spine-chilling especially the most infamous scene in the film. Deliverance is indeed a terrifying and chilling adventurous tale on how the strong will survive.",

Whereas this must have been just another exploitation flick when it was released in the seventies, nowadays it's regarded as a thematically rich take on the damaging psychology of rape and how it's perceived in society, the dangers of machismo and the American culture war. Personally, the film walks a too fine line between just being a survival thriller and a sophisticated drama in my book. While its depiction of the complex power dynamics between men and the infamous rape are excellent, I find that most critics have gone too far in adding additional substance to it when it's not really there. The second half is particularly straightforward as this survival tale in a harsh natural landscape that, although superbly edited, directed, acted and shot, did seem a bit implausible and overly dire in many of its scenarios.",

The film is a living nightmare and one in which the characters go from a relatively relaxed carefree mood to one in which their survival and fates are all up in the air.  The film is most famous for a particular scene involving the rape of one man by another (a deranged hillbilly out hunting) and is a powerful and extremely disturbing sequence that will stay with you long after you have viewed \"Deliverance\".

Yes, there are themes that stand out, such as the brutal process of self-discovery concurrent with running the gamut against the savage trials of nature, yet this is merely an intimation of a deeper meaning that I think can only be felt rather than understood. Boorman certainly makes deliberate decisions relative to story development that contribute to a truly one of a kind film-viewing experience, such as eschewing traditional plot structure including definitive beginning and endpoints, thus creating a sense of a living, evolving film that flows continuously like the river navigated by its protagonists. He places a striking emphasis on ambiguity, heightening a deep sense of unease relative to uncertainty and disorientation. Haunting images fleet across the screen, such as a mass exhumation of coffins in a soon to be flooded out cemetery and the towing of a solitary church along a country road. Utilizing such strange patchwork elements, \"Deliverance\" provides tantalizing suggestions of its thematic depth without fully giving the game away, leaving us in the midst of a graphic, disturbing, and undeniably galvanizing film experience. You will continue hearing the nagging plucks of the banjo long after the duel is over.",

            "content": "The movie that made Yankees and urbanites shake in their loafers, spawn countless parodies and stereotype a gigantic region of people, Deliverance is a harrowing tale of four \"fish out of water\" (or more accurately, four Atlanta businessmen very much in uncontrollable water) and their struggle for survival. The \"dueling banjos\" scene is such a lovely way to start the film, which makes you think we're going to get more mountain wholesomeness \u2014 couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, our crew of Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voigt), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) realize they are out of their element and not welcome in this Appalachian corner of Northeast Georgia \u2014 well, except for Lewis, who is our \"return to the Earth,\" machismo survivalist who is probably more at home in Rabun County than DeKalb or Fulton. I've really had to ponder this film and a few of the directions the plot takes (I'm aware it's based on a book). Lewis getting sidelined for the third act was surprising, but I actually thought it was effective in completely changing our expectations for our protags' fate \u2014 you think, as long as they have Lewis, they'll be ok. On the other hand, I hated whatever the hell it was they did with Drew. He just jumps off the boat to his inevitable death? For what? Guilt not that he even murdered someone in obvious self-defense, not that he voted against not going to the police, but because he helped bury a body of a rapist?? That's ridiculous. Moreover, it made no sense to me that the group thought he was shot. Maybe have a tree branch crack or a hunter's gun go off contemporaneously with him diving into the water, but don't have it be this stupid. Yes, there's the rape scene we've all heard about long before we ever watched the movie \u2014 no one is being taken by surprise here. It's brutal. Hard to watch. In fact, I found it surprising that it didn't seem to mess with Bobby nearly enough \u2014 in the end, he seems to make the best out of the whole group! The production is infamous for not insuring the actors and having them perform most/all of their own stunts, which makes it even more impressive \u2014 Jon Voigt really climbed that cliff. The use of banjo in the score and the gorgeous shots of the river and mountains make it an aesthetically pleasing watch \u2014 the deformed inhabitants of the area, not so much. It's a must-watch for cinephiles, if you can stomach ass rape.",

The way it is filmed, written, paced, all provided to the raw grit feeling that was left with me after I watched it. The film's work is not polished, and not quite compiled together in a smooth and seamless manner. But somehow this uncut, rugged nature of the film gives the story's dark concepts an added value that hit me hard as a viewer. Among these dark moments in the film, take the guitar-playing character Drew, when he falls from the boat and disappears into the churning water. There is no music, the camera keeps it's distance, and the moment is shrouded over by the sound of the river. It is in those moments, that the untouched emotional simplicity of the movie gave me a feeling that I've heard so many others recall when they saw this film, feelings of discomfort, shock, and realism. I believe this to be key characteristic to this film's great 50-year legacy.\nThe raw style Deliverance makes its name for does unfortunately have it's shortcomings. The film's simplicity continues to the story's very final moments, an area where the director and the screenwriter of the movie had an opportunity for blonde-mustache character Ed (for example) to offer a conclusive reflection to the horrors and hardship he saw and did. \nIn conclusion, I think the film takes a firm side on the spectrum to the amount of explanation a director should provide his audience with, whether to make a movie that guides the viewer through the story's meaning, or one that only reveals its true value after a strong reflection by the audience. Whatever a movie critic may think about that choice though, I think few can deny having the lasting memory of this film that I have had.",

Legendary director John Boorman (except for The Exorcist 2, what the hell was that?) utilises an all male cast, a very difficult novel to adapt to the big screen, breathtaking cinematography and amazing landscapes and creates a story of survival, violence and a man's psychological state when he is pushed to the limit, in a way similar to Peckinpah's controversial Straw Dogs, which came out the year before. The story concerns a quartet of city men, Lewis, Ed, Bobby and Drew, who plan to make a canoe trip to fictional Kahulawasse River before the surrounding area floods due to a dam. After a run in with the locals (the famous Dueling Banjos scene) they settle for the night near the river. The next day they decide to split up, a desicion that will leave them permanently scarred for the rest of the movie and their lives. Bobby and Ed are captured by two hillbillies who... rape Bobby (infamous rape scene here). Luckily, Drew and Lewis show up and manage to kill oone of the two. After that unfortunate incident they have to return to civilization through the rough and treacherous river. The screenplay, carefully written by author James Dickey, the dynamic quartet of actors and focused, tense direction by Boorman make every scene unforgettable and gripping, to the point where you want to look away but you are so enhanced by the carefull pacing that you can't. Even though I have some issues with character development and the glorification of violence, sexualised or not, I highly recommend watching this man VS nature story. However, it is not for the squeamish. \nSqueal like a pig.",

            "content": "I'm a firm believer that films don't need excess blood and gore to be disturbing or shocking.  Those sensations can come across purely by how the intense sequences are executed.  'Deliverance' excels in that aspect.  For a movie that's nearly 50 years old, it's pretty brutal in parts.  It's both a survival and rural odyssey through the Appalachian mountains that is heavy with moral dilemmas.  Thanks to some fine performances, the weight and burden of the justifiable homicides in self defense come across clearly.  Even if you have every right to save your life in the face of a guaranteed you-or-them threat, the situation can very well still haunt you.  On top of that, these characters being outsiders in a small mountain town does them no favors.  I noticed some parallels to 'Bone Tomahawk' in this film.  We have a group of guys making their way through unknown territory, surviving against cruel and sadistic savages, and one of our guys suffers a leg injury much like one of the titular characters in 'Bone Tomahawk' (although his was already there at the beginning of that film).  Not a carbon-copy influence, mind you, but it reminded me of that film nonetheless.  'Deliverance', despite expectedly dated imagery and some pacing issues in the first half, ends up being a really good and effective film that I do indeed recommend.",

            "content": "This is everything that a thriller should be as it's plot and character development are minimal but the individual scenes play out with such tension and horror that even though we know so little about these men we just want them to survive. Director John Boorman would later settle into making sentimental pictures like Hope and Glory (1987) and Queen and Country (2014) he proved that he has the ability to stage action scenes and capture emotions uniquely. Obviously nothing that came out in 1972 was going to be able to compete with The Godfather (1972) but this film and The Emigrants (1972) round out an excellent Best Picture lineup with the exception of Cabaret (1972).\n\nFour men head to hillbilly country in the north of Georgia to spend a couple of days whitewater rafting at the local river before a dam is built over it. The enigmatic and forceful Lewis Medlock, Burt Reynolds, leads the group while occasionally clashing with everyman Ed Gentry, Jon Voight. Accompanying them are the kind and well meaning Drew Ballinger, Ronny Cox, and the shy Bobby Trippe, Ned Beatty, who will each face issues of their own. Their trip initially goes well as they enjoy their experience of rafting and get along well but after a horrific event they end up killing a local and decide that they must hide his body instead of confessing. Following this decision they go to increasingly extreme measures to hide their secret and after an accident they are left injured and fighting for their own lives.\n\nThe much spoken about rape scene in the film is still shocking 47 years later as Beatty gives such an affecting performance and the scene is filmed without feeling exploitative. We understand why these men have strong motive to kill the man who has raped their friend and we feel their burning anger against these people who are both idiotic and absolutely terrifying. Fortunately it is not just this scene that makes the film gripping as the sight of a heavily injured Voight climbing the side of a cliff and them trying their hardest to survive in the rapids cause us to hold our breath. The film is not just there to titillate with explicit imagery but stretches itself to portray the fear and hysteria that this sort of event could inspire in a group of relatively ordinary men pushed to the limits.\n\nDiscussing the film is difficult because it's story is very simple but what is contained inside the individual scenes impresses and stuns with it's attention to detail. Importantly the performers seem completely committed to their roles as Voight even did his own stunt work in the film. All of the emotions that the audience feel cross his face as he is our conduit into the situation lacking the ruthlessness of Medlock or the moral purity of Ballinger. Beatty is fantastic as always with some of the most memorable moments in the film as he is instantly likable and we are devastated by the horrors he faces. However it is Cox who really stands out as the kind, caring Ballinger who cannot stand for the actions of the rest of the men and the dueling banjos scene alone should have earned him an Academy Award nomination. Everyone in the cast gives committed, finely tuned performances deserving of more attention than they receive.\n\nPerhaps the film drags on a little too long as we spend a seemingly unnecessary amount of time with Gentry as he returns home but the film is mostly well paced and at just 110 minutes it will not leave anyone bored. The film is aware of how thin and simple it's plot is and doesn't pretend to be anything more than a tense thriller but what a tense experience at that. Fans of the genre will surely enjoy it but even someone like myself who prefers romantic comedies and family dramas will find something to appreciate in it. Like most great pieces of entertainment it has mass appeal and people of all ages can sit down and enjoy the experience of watching a couple of men descend into hell despite their innocent intentions, we can all sympathize with these men.",

Reminds me of Easy Rider a bit. The look that little banjo playing boy gives is haunting. \n\nThe fact the actors did there own stunts while canoeing is impressive. Those rapids aren't huge but there no joke either. Makes me respect the movie makes it all the better. Just like I called it, things got real, real quick. That scene with the hillbilly's was pretty terrifying. Things got really uncomfortable really fast. That was insane. I don't know why Drew freaked out all of a sudden. Like he's the voice of reason all of a sudden. Just bury the fucker and be done with it. Fuck him. \n\nWhat started out as an adventure through the river, quickly turned into a living nightmare. That reveal where you see the arrow really did piece his throat was crazy. This turned out to be a pretty serious movie. It's kind of tormenting that now he has to live with this secret and can't tell anyone about what happened. It's going to haunt him now forever. Pretty grim and bleak movie. \n\nReally great movie!",

            "content": "Director John Boorman's cinematic masterpiece is at once an exciting and harrowing thriller, while also a fascinating meditation on the nature of civilization and human nature's more primal instincts. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox plan to get back to nature by canoeing down the fictional Cahulawassee River before it's damed up and flooded, marring it's wild natural beauty. These four cityfolk run the spectrum of macho outdoorsman Reynolds to the soft \"born salesman\" Beatty. On their trip, the four find themselves running afoul some seriously creepy hillfolk (which is putting it mildly if you've seen the film or know what happens). Without spoiling anything, the four are pushed to their limits both by nature and the menacing mountain men. \"Deliverance\" was based on a novel and adapted by it's author, James Dickey. Thematically, the film most interesting in that it doesn't solidly land on one side or the other when it comes to whether civilization or the primitive is more superior to the other, but instead the story finds it's strongest character in Voight, who falls solidly between not being too civilized or too primitive. The theme of encroaching civilization weakening our stronger primal elements is something that would have been perfectly aligned with director Sam Peckinpah, who was Dickey's first choice for director for this film. Boorman is an fine director (\"Point Blank\" \"Excalibur\" \"The Emerald Forest\"), but I can't help but image what kind of a viscerally resonant film Peckinpah would have made, combining the most interesting elements he explored in \"Ride the High Country,\" \"The Wild Bunch,\" and \"Straw Dogs.\" Also of note is the gorgeous photography by Vilmos Zsigmond (\"The Deer Hunter\" \"Close Encounter\" \"Blow Out), outside of some poorly done day-for-night-photography during a cliff climbing sequence. Overall, \"Deliverance\" is a smart film that engaging on both a entertainment and intellectual level. A true classic, even if it might have been better with Peckinpah at the helm. FUN FACT! Bill McKinney, one of the scary hillfolk, used to have an official website with the URL http://www.squeallikeapig.com/",

What follows is a shocking scene of the assault of Bobby by a couple of locals and the murder in self defence of the attackers by Lewis by arrow.\nWhat follows is an hour or so of Survival Of The Fittest scenes as the group contemplate their next moves in disposing of the body, covering their tracks and getting back down river to the 'safety' of their cars and home!\nOf course it isn't as simple as that what with some questionnable locals who are set to lose their land and towns because of the dam project.\nThr film features a musical score reminiscent of Ennio Morrocone's themes from the Dollars Trilogy, an unforgettable \"feudin' banjos\" scene as Drew duets with a local blind boy with a banjo.\nThe sexual assault of Bobby is of course shocking but the resultant story is edge of your seat stuff.\n\"Squeal like a pig.\"",

And John Boorman; the director, has done a tremendous work on executing this tensed tale and has offered the palpable yet essential eerie tone to the feature. The performance is decent in here; nothing out of the park nor to be question upon, by the protagonist Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds in his supportive role. \n\nDeliverance is free from any law or terms and is surely ahead of its time, and the credit goes to the director who had the guts to pull off such concept.",

I was aware of the most famous and disturbing scene of the film, but I never suspected that was the harshest part of the whole thing. I thought that was the start of the terrorism that would be rained down on the main characters throughout this film, but instead it's a psychological thriller. The movie isn't about \"what are we going to do\" instead it's about \"what have we done.\" That's not to say that the film was less thrilling than I expected, because fear and regret can be just as terrifying. It had me on edge through the rest of the film because I kept wondering what would happen to the protagonists next, and are they even protagonists any more. I was hoping there would be another significant confrontation in the film (perhaps it's rooted in my innate desire to see a proper resolution to every story) but the movie had other ideas about how it would wrap things up.\n\nI was bit surprised, because I thought Deliverance was a big Burt Reynolds starring role, but the real lead of the film was Jon Voight. I was glad that was the case, though, because Voight had more complexity to his character, while Reynolds and the other two leads were a bit one-dimensional. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is how they used the actors themselves steering through the rapids. There were probably a few shots where stunt doubles were used, but by and large it was clearly the actors themselves wielding the paddles. This kind of authenticity and realism is so rare nowadays that it's nice to see they committed to it so completely back then. Another interesting aspect of the film was how it used simple banjo music to create an unsettling atmosphere. Dueling Banjos is such a fun and cheerful song, and it feels that way at the beginning, yet somehow as the movie goes on there's an ominous feel to that same tune. Deliverance is the kind of movie that I can say I'm glad I saw once, but I never need to see it again.",

THIS at the very least was proof that he at one time actually had chops and could act.\n\nThe scariest aspect of all is that this goes on all the time and we just don't know about it.

            "content": "Deliverance Review and Analysis\n\n\"Deliverance\" is a 1972 film that was directed by John Boorman and written by James Dickey based on his novel.  The movie tells the story of four city slickers from Atlanta taking a canoe trip on a river in the backwoods of Georgia before the lush landscape is ruined by a dam project.  During the trip they are forced to confront the treacherous nature of the backwoods as well as battle against two violent mountain men in order to escape their increasingly perilous situation.  \n\nIn looking on this film it is hard to believe that it actually came out 44 years ago.  The reason is that the cinematography and directing of this movie is gorgeous.  The main reason for this is that the movie is directed a lot like a documentary with it containing little music for most of the movie and the way in which John Boorman frames many of his shots and edits.  This style of directing makes the movie feel visceral and helped me feel like I was watching something that actually happened.  This feeling is further helped with it being shot on location and the four leads rapid river scenes being actually performed.  On top of that, every actor in this movie is completely believable in their role.  Burt Reynold's macho attitude fits perfectly within the role but the real performance comes from Jon Voight who slowly evolves from a timid city slicker, into someone who slowly embraces the primitive nature in the way that Reynold's character had already done.  \n\nThis is also one of the few movies where I would say that the violence is actually realistic. When Roger Ebert reviewed this film years ago he claimed that the film \"was a fantasy of violence rather than a realistic consideration of it\" this likely came about by his interpretation that Dickey was trying to \"[tell] us something about the nature of man, and particularly civilized man's ability to survive primitive challenges.\" While that argument could certainly be made, I have a hard time believing that that was the film's primary objective.  \n\nIn the context of the movie I believe it is about the line between the violence of civilization and the violence of nature and how it may be more blurry than it first appears.  This is reflective in the violent actions of the film since many of them are committed with the use of primitive tools.  The only type of homicidal violence that may have not been committed by the bow and arrow is during the death of Drew who may or may not have been shot.  Drew's death is a symbol of the blurred lines between a violence of civilization and the violence of nature since in that case how he died was completely unclear.  If it was by the gun the fault would be civilization, if not then it was nature that killed him.  Bobby's rape scene furthers the point since he is told by his captors to \"squeal like a pig\" in order to blur the lines of Bobby being a man and Bobby being a helpless animal.  The point is furthered by the rape itself which on the one hand is violence committed by men that can be seen as an hideously intimate action but at the same time is the use of something that is only natural as a weapon.  There are further examples of this throughout the movie which I believe continues to help elevate this movie beyond the simple machismo-style fantasy violence that Roger Ebert perceives.  Instead, the violence is used to paint a portrait of how civilized violence and natural violence is more blurred than most people think therefore disproving his point that it is not a realistic consideration of it.  \n\nOverall I would say that \"Deliverance\" is a movie that I would highly recommend to film buffs like myself.  It is a movie that truly came out ahead of its time and it reminds me heavily of what modern movies are like today.  The story is fantastic and contains several layers and themes beyond the primary one that I explained.  The directing and acting is phenomenal and the scenery is just plain gorgeous.  I give this film a 5 out of 5 rating but I wouldn't recommend it to people who get easily queasy.",

Utilising long takes to create an atmosphere of discomfort and a near complete absence of music to emphasise the desolation, the woods have rarely seemed so creepy in the daylight. In his best moments, Burt Reynolds echoes the late Marlon Brando in his heyday, with a sly grin and cocksure machismo, and the supporting players all bring something to the table. The film works with subtlety and suspense, eliciting shocks by developing a sense of dread and not with cheap jump scares. The ending is the weakest part of the film, feeling rushed and somewhat tagged on, like the filmmakers were forced to create a hasty d\u00e9nouement rather than leaving the men's fates and mental states undetermined, which would have been more powerful. It has many standout moments, among them the iconic duelling banjos and squealing like a piggy, and while its muted nature renders it a tad boring at times, it still works as a tense thriller and an examination of the dark side of human nature.",

By the time Hollywood was through, the south gave the nation presidents like Bill Clinton and not one but two George Bushs plus totalitarian fascists like Newt Gingrich\nand Jesse Helms. Deliverance is the implausible story of a group of men taking a raft ride down a river in the deep south and being accosted every step of the way by the locals. Natives of the backwoods south are portrayed as inbred simpletons whose violent natures are beyond any sort of restraint. None of the protagonists give any thought of contacting local authorities, who can only be assumed to be \"libs\" in cahoots with the \"good old boys.\" Of course being on a raft on a river in the woods isn't any excuse, surely there is some house near the river with a telephone? No Hollywood tells us, everyone is a mass murderer who is armed to the teeth.",

THIS at the very least was proof that he at one time actually had chops and could act.\n\nThe scariest aspect of all is that this goes on all the time and we just don't know about it.

However, there are some downsides. As I said before, the film doesn't do a great job of getting it's message across. It tries to make a statement about civilization, but it never really goes anywhere with it. And the ending is lackluster. It just ends.
