Thevenot (Paul Frankeur), his wife Simone (Delphine Seyrig) and her sister Florence (Bulle Ogier) arrive for a dinner party at the house of Alice S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (St\u00e9phane Audran) and her husband Henri (Jean-Pierre Cassel), only to learn that they were mistaken about the date. In director Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surreal fantasy, the six bourgeois friends repeatedly gather for a dinner that never quite arrives.",

Initially, the meal is postponed due to a simple misunderstanding, but soon things escalate to unforeseen military maneuvers, police intervention, and a deceased restaurant manager, among other things.  Luis Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a scathing indictment of France's rich and powerful, a surreal satire that is unmistakably the work of Bunuel, the master of surrealism.  Cleverly written and constructed, it is as good as anything Bunuel ever directed.  It won't be for all tastes, granted, but for anyone who likes to be challenged by a film, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie should satisfy their appetite.",

The pacing was near perfect, with much of the plot action creating the impetus for the very next scene, allowing a natural flow to some of the most bewilderingly unnatural circumstances. The acting was spot on as well, and needed to be to pull off many of these increasingly absurd scenes. 8.5/10\n\nNYT 1000 #278",

            "content": "I think this is quite an interesting look at French 'society' - which they call the Bourgeois - which apparently has quite a lot less class than English 'society'. In England we call them boiled onions and it is fit only as a stock for making soup, in France they call it French Onion soup (although they probably just call it onion soup over there) and serve it as a meal, or worse they take quite disgusting food like frogs and snails and call it fine cuisine. It is this kind of attitude which makes everyone hate the French, Bourgeois or otherwise. France makes artists and England makes gentlemen (traditionally), not the other way around it would appear.\n\nThe characters are not really individuated and representative only of themselves but where they are symbolic of something else - archetypes. Here showing the various kind of people the writers presumably believe the Bourgeois to consist of - be it the half hedonists that just want to fuck, eat great food and live in a beautiful place, or the distinguished ambassador who believes himself to be a kindly socialist but actually is lecherous towards young ladies who want to kill him and murders people at dinner parties,  the rather unimportant man who has nothing whatsoever to offer except advice on how to make dry martinis and his drunken wife who is even less of a contributor. Although this is obviously all an incredibly sardonic slash at Bourgeois society for me personally there is nothing here that would distinguish the class as any worse than any other. No doubt the writers would have us believe that the working classes who, if we are to portray them in the same vein, f*ck mindlessly like animals, get blind drunk on trash to fight and swear at each other, stab each other to death in the gutters down some quiet street and see art and culture as a worse enemy than fascism as somehow more real and admirable. The problem here is not with one class and not another - it is with all classes. In fact eating good food with \"herbs from the garden\", knowing how to make a nice dry martini and enjoying a good f*ck is not something I would single out as an object of criticism.\n\nI long ago realised politics causes many problems, will solve none and yet is still necessary. Therefore where before I had strong political leanings I now think about it no more than is necessary. But we are in the role of film critics, not political commentators and so should be looking at the Charm as a film. It did have some interesting bits. I like the 'play' dream, largely as I could understand it - showing how their dinner parties are all a show and nothing is really authentic and also the bishop becoming the gardener showing how even the church works for the rich. Some bits were a little more out of place like the lieutenant in the cafe, or the army showing up and the sergeant recounting his dream, it seemed strange but added interest and we could maybe drag some meaning out of it if we really worked to. The overall message of their dreams, I guess, was that the rich have all this paranoia, dissatisfaction and suffering  but that is not really something that is bespoke to the upper classes and quite honestly the lower classes need to change their ways just as much. This film had a complete lack of poor people - except where they invited in the chauffeur to drink as if to watch a monkey in a zoo.\n\nI wonder if the arrests at the end hark back to the French revolution?\n\nSo although from a straightforward point of view the characters are paper thin and the plot lacks depth completely, this is another one of those films that is not art for art's sake but the director has some other message he wants to get across - here it is largely political and mostly about class distinction. And that message is also paper thin and full of holes from a philosophical point of view but we must allow people to express themselves in a way they see fit though we do not have to buy into their message, no matter how convincing and sardonic it is at first look. As a message or critique of life life it would be getting a very low score from me and some of those characters I would not even criticise too much, certainly not based on class or somehow worse than some of the working class archetypes, if one wants to f*ck and eat good food from the garden and make good cocktails so be it there are worse pastimes. The left wing message borne from hate for society people is tiresome. However, as a film it had some interest 6/10.",

And of course you recognize my story as this film.  And perhaps for that reason this has remained my favorite non-English language film. Bunuel simply rocked my world with this one as life certainly does imitate art. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard during a movie as I was right there on screen among those dinner guests.  Perhaps Bunuel knew, on some non-linear level of existence, my story and filmed it, thus art imitated my life.  This is MY story, this is my song, my love letter to this film.",

Regardless, it's still a funny film, a socially-focused surrealist comedy that revolves around the premise that, regardless of the bizarre circumstance and jagged, incomprehensible story, it is of paramount importance that these people not be able to eat a meal together. Before ZAZ would commercialize the format with mile-a-minute jokes in the ensuing decade, Bu\u00f1uel used the distinctive style of humor to create a piece of social criticism that is all the funnier due to its bizarre structure. I can't help but feel that the language barrier has prevented my from enjoying the full experience that this film has to offer, though. (4/5)",

I guess the rich and powerful never really get to eat, is Bunuel's message here. Bunuel, being someone who was against the rich and powerful, found a way to almost mock and ridicule the bourgeoisie to the point of satire. I can say without a doubt that there has never been a film made like this one. All the interruptions during the main story line and the ridiculous occurrences that happen throughout the movie would make anyone nowadays turn off the movie immediately. One must have patience and not question anything at all when watching this movie.

Also Bunuel interrupts the main story again and again with several secondary storylines. That's the simplest way to describe the film and this movie, which contains a simple plot as you are envisaging now , assuring you of one thing, that you will be dragged through a 'seriously what was it all about' situation at the end of the movie. And that's where the simplicity of the story is gonna deride you. In those secondary clips, *Spoiler* \\ Several times throughout the movie the six main characters would be shown just walking along a paved road in the middle of nowhere. Here is my interpretation about that, because those clips should be understood since they hold a significant connotation, I suppose. Those scenes illustrate how weak and worthless they are without the lower class people surrounding them , they feel lost, they are not even able to interact with each other. Or Clips are used to make the transitions between other scenes or could be a dream. Who knows? /\n\nNo one is going to make a statement proving that only his interpretation is valid other than his name is Luis Bu\u00f1uel. There might be many interesting and valid interpretations given by different viewers. Because Luis Bu\u00f1uel is one of the world's most significant Surrealists in filmmaking and he also believed in leaving the viewers to their own individual interpretations. Surrealism is probably the best answer when an entire movie is based on interpretations like this ..\n\nOnce again, Hello ARTHOUSE + SURREALISM movie fans , Download or get your hands on a copy somehow!",

Luckily it had three of my favourite French actors from the period, in Bulle Ogier (just check out 'Maitresse' if you don't understand why), Delphine Seyrig and Fernando Rey (for the two 'French Connection' films alone)--even though for a director of Bunuel's strength, any actors could have sufficed. It's the ideas that stand out most triumphantly.\n\nIt's most known for being Bunuel's Oscar-winner for Best Foreign Language Film, but its OTHER nomination is what's almost neglected when people talk about him. Yes, they talk about Bunuel the director, or (from David Thomson) Bunuel the photographer, but people never realize his two nominations for the Calanda, Spain-native were never for director, but for writing (with another nod for his swan song, 'The Obscure Object of Desire').",

He'd moved to France and with help from screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and producer Serge Silberman created films like Diary of a Chambermaid (1964) and Belle de Jour (1967) which were hits internationally. Then he did this, which was a savage return to the surrealism of Un Chien Andalou (1927). The film has no plot so to speak of, but it's connected by a series of dreams, all revolving around a group of people Monsieur Th\u00e9venot (Paul Frankeur) and his wife Simone (Delphine Seyrig) and her sister Florence (Bulle Ogier). There's also Henri S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and his wife Alice (St\u00e9phane Audran), and they're joined by foreign ambassador Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey). It follows their attempts to have several dinner parties together and outside forces preventing them from doing so, like a nearby army base firing at the house, and everyone getting arrested for no reason. It's very surreal, and you don't get films that leave everything unexplained like this anymore. But it's well filmed, and amongst it's fans were Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, John Ford and Robert Wise. The film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film too.",

Alfred Hitchcock considered him the best director of all times, which is why he fits nicely in my study of Hitchcock films.How can a film be both absurdist and overtly realistic? A combination of zany wit and a teaspoon of class struggle make this movie one of my all time favorites. It really rips off of the screen, and makes sure to leave a lasting impression in the mind. The only downfall is that the English subtitled version does a shoddy job of translating the numerous bon mots in the script.

One day all the friends gets an invitaion to dine with a general, and the days before the actual diner three of our friends dreams that they are all at the party, and all kind of unusual things happens.

            "content": "9.1/10\r\n\r\n            There's something that's always bothered me about Hollywood movies, yet it's something that I never knew bothered me until now. The thing that irritates, troubles, and challenges me is the fact that almost all Hollywood films - good or bad - must have a point; they must make sense. They have a narrative that's genuinely easy to follow, they usually tend to have characters that we like and can relate to. I don't mind this, but then again, it's like I said; it bothers me the slightest bit, and that's good enough for me.\r\n\r\n I bring this up at this moment because Luis Bu\u00f1uel's \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" does not make sense; and it almost doesn't have much of a point beyond existence. It's a peculiar film that is meant to confuse; but through trickery, not through muddled screen-writing. The filmmaker must enjoy seeing us scratch our heads with puzzled faces; and he must like it every time we do it. Bu\u00f1uel is known for repeating himself in some of his movies, but only because people like this quality about the man.\r\n\r\n         Now, \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is about a group of bourgeois acquaintances who make several attempts to sit down and enjoy a nice dinner. The first attempt fails because they arrive at a time when the meal had not been planned or prepared. The second attempt is also not a success because the manager of the building which they would eat in had just passed away, that very moment.\r\n\r\n Man, I could go on-and-on about how many times this grand dinner fails to ensue, but I won't spoil too much. \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is a dish best served cold. You shouldn't know too much or too little about it. Hell, the only thing I personally believe you need to know about it when going in is that it's about people who sit down, multiple times, to eat, but never actually get down to it. \r\n\r\n  Throughout the film, there are some fascinating talks and depictions of dreams. Within these dreams are ghosts and voices that taunt, but cannot be heard. I loved the scene in which a speaking solider tells the dinner guests of his dream, in which he walks a lonely city road, but cannot find anyone who he had wanted to see. There are many complications with these characters throughout the movie, although few of them are actually characterized as many would hope they would be.\r\n\r\n But this is not your average movie. In fact, no surrealist film should be. Bu\u00f1uel is a master when it comes to recycling ideas and even premises, or styles, and making us interested all over again. His fans will love this film, and maybe, just maybe, so will newcomers. It's fascinating, and it's often times funny; and sometimes even startling. You know you're watching a one-of-a-kind film when the dinner guests find out they're on a stage, acting in front of an audience full of people, although the sequence later proves to be nothing more than a dream. \r\n\r\n   Look. There's not much else I can say for this movie. It is what it is; well-written, well-directed trickery. The surrealism works, although it's not as extreme as I expected it to be. The visuals are not what matters here; what matters here, is ultimately, what the film wants to do and how much of that it accomplishes. Some may argue that it's not perfect, but I have a good counter-attack for that one: how is it not? The film is interesting, perhaps even intellectual. It is confusing, but decidedly so. It could not have been made any other way, and I openly love it as it is. This is a perfect movie; one of director Bu\u00f1uel's best. See it because it exists, and because it's as good as it is, and there's really no other reasons beyond those.",

This is the first full-length film I've seen from the legendary surrealist/satirist Luis Bunuel (having seen only his notorious short Un Chien Andalou), and it does make me want to see his other work. I guess the quickest way to describe this movie is that it feels like what would happen if David Lynch's movies became a lot more watchable and funny.\n\nThere is and isn't a plot to speak of. The movie focuses on six characters, a bunch of French upper-class nitwits (well, one of them is an ambassador), who keep trying to sit down to dinner together, but keep getting interrupted by increasingly bizarre circumstances. Some of these interruptions are really funny. There are also random interludes where some supporting character who has not been seen before and will not be seen again tells everyone about his creepy dream/memory. The movie is also continually playing with us in terms of its levels of reality - at one point, I think, we are seeing what the movie tells us is a dream, within what surprisingly turns out to be a dream, which itself turns out to be in another dream, which itself turns out to be in another (I think). It's like Inception, but without any logic or rules. You could subject the movie to intense analysis to try to sort all that out, but I think to do so would be to miss the point, as the movie is probably honestly just messing around.\n\nThe cast is excellent. The one actor I recognized was Fernando Rey, who had played the French drug dealer in The French Connection the year before this movie. He was really insufferable in a villainous way in The French Connection, and really insufferable in a hilarious way in this movie. The rest of the cast is extremely good at playing annoying, petty-bourgeois types. \n\nThis movie won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for its year, and was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay, an impressive achievement for a film that a) is foreign and b) has no true plot. It did deserve those, though, I think. The movie just has this unique feel to it; I'm willing to bet there's nothing else like this except for other Bunuel films. You never find a movie that can at once be funny, creepy, satirical, and boldly in defiance of normal narrative structure all at once. While it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud sense for the most part, it is very funny in a bemused, wry-grin sort of way. I definitely have to explore more Bunuel movies now.",

People that belong to the  Bourgeois society, when portrayed in a darker light, can be the most irritating of film characters, but when took on stage to forcibly look at their own shortcomings that they hide with their material excesses, can be one of film lovers' secret pleasures to watch on celluloid: Let the self-obsessed hypocrites be deconstructed by some unknown force. But Bunuel, although making the film to be a major attack on the particular social class, did not finish the film laughing along with the audience; But more of like postponing the punchline of an insult joke. As shown in the film, when it's a dream, \"kill them all!\" and \"humiliate the bastards!\" can be some of the most recurring of proletariat battlecries, when fantasy fades and reality sets back, \"absolve them of their sins\" more like. Maybe having them miss some of their lavish lamb chops and caviars is enough. Surrealist film at its top form.",

I think my favorite scene was most likely when everyone gets shot, and one is hiding under the table, then he reaches up to get a piece of lamb even though he will be discovered as well.  This just spoke about the movie the most for me.  The bourgeoisie are people who see themselves better than everyone else, but still have needs and when they do the needs must be filled.  They are selfish.  One of the girls seems like she might be down to earth, but there is a scene where one of the men invites their driver in to have a martini.  The driver takes a quick chug, and when he leaves they talk behind his back about how he drank it incorrectly.  The girl fights back for him, but only says that he is uneducated.  These people believe that you must live in society's standards and not your own way.  The more acceptable you seem in society then the more successful you are.  However, even these people have dreams where they try to actually sit down and have a dinner, but they can't even do it here.  And there are scenes where they are walking straight down a road, with apparently no where to go.  Bunuel used his writing as something fun.  He would do anything he wanted to drive his points home.  In this way he reminds me of Gilliam and Lynch.",

            "content": "Luis Bunuel's \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" hardly resembles what you'd call a typical movie. It's structure is anecdotal, and it therefore comes off as a series of surrealist short films. These sequences could stand on their own - they're simple stories involving the obscure lusts and temptations lingering underneath the facade of manners. To Bunuel, the idea of a bourgeoisie lifestyle is contradictory to our animal instincts, and he has no problem making fun of some of the absurdities we carry out in an effort to remain \"civilized\". \n\nThe plot is quite simple: six bourgeois friends are trying to sit down and have a meal together. Each time, however, their efforts are thwarted. The wide array of obstacles include arriving to the host's house on the wrong day, finding out that a restaurant owner is being mourned in an adjacent room, and, eventually, finding out that their stale roast chicken is actually a stage prop. Things seem to get stranger as they progress, with some of the scenes in the last half hour being dreams within dreams. For instance, we hear of the horror story of a prison guard who comes back to kill. Then, of course see him: ethereal, bloody, and blue. And, at another point, a soldier recalls his childhood, which also involves the supernatural.\n\nI've only seen a few of Bunuel's films, but what i've found striking is how they're able to be critical without being angry or vengeful. The films i've seen all point fingers at the same social class of people, but each time Bunuel seems to identify with them rather than hate them. He realizes the absurdities, the inconsistencies, the hypocrisy, and the illusions, and he, in a way, embraces them. When, for instance, a group of soldiers fire on the dinner guests in a dream sequence, one of them takes refuge under a table. He then foolishly gives away his position by trying to sneak some food off of his plate - he can't help himself. While his ideas can be cynical, he's presenting them in such a manner that it's amusing and far from hateful. The films, no matter how dark, are comic and completely charming.\n\nLike \"Belle de Jour\" and \"Diary of a Chambermaid\", the film deals with sexual desires and fantasies hidden behind the illusion of grounded stability. There is a bishop who acts out his fantasies of working as a gardener for the wealthy, and we also see two hosts head outside to make love while they're expecting guests. When they arrive back in the house, dirty and picking leaves off of each other, it's the perfect contrast between \"civilized\" humans and ones driven by animalistic instinct.\n\n\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" is certainly an odd film that, at times, will leave you scratching your head. But it's such a welcome departure from more conventional films that strictly follow their structure. It's loose and playful, and thus it establishes a memorable dreamlike quality. I can't say I made sense of it all, but I don't know if that's the point. What matters most, however, is how humorous, charming, and inventive it is.",

If you love absurd situations with no continuity or logic, chances are good you will love this and are a Bunuel fan.  If you are still reading and do not fit into either category, the rest of this review is for you since both previously mentioned parties will have made up their minds.  A group of six aristocratic snobs cannot eat dinner.  That's it.  One time they sit down at the table and a passing army barges in.  Another time at a restaurant, they discover a funeral is taking place for the manager of the establishment.  Later on at another meal, they are all arrested.  Oh, and tales of a boy's mother's ghost telling him to poison his supposed father, piano torture (it makes sense if you see it), theatre performances and more round out the flick.  And none of it quite gels as female terrorists, dream sequences without warning and a gardening priest make their presences felt.  In anyone else's hands, this would have been disastrous but Bunuel shines as he mocks upper society, religion, the army and other ripe targets.  No one is safe, including the audience who is never fully aware of what is going on, and the result is an experience you will either love or try to immediately forget about (probably over dinner).",

            "content": "This movie is about people who perpetually show up for dinner and occasionally even sit down for it, but are never able to eat. They arrive on the wrong night, or are dismayed to find the dead body of the restaurant owner in the next room, or are bothered by military maneuvers. Dinner is the cardinal civil convention of the middle classes, a means of showing affluence and social grace. It also affords the aid of something to do and something to chat about, and that is a blessed comfort, not only because so many of the bourgeoisie have nothing much to talk about, and there is a vast lot of things they wish will not be brought up.\n\nMost movies make believe their plots are de facto and that we need to buy into them unequivocally. Comedies are sanctioned to be remiss in this case. Most of the films of Luis Bunuel, who made nearly 40, are comedies somehow, but he doesn't go for shticks and wisecracks, although it seems that way from a distance. His ironic sense of humor is more like a jeer, witty and caustic.\n\nThe humor in this absurdist film is in the way Bunuel barges in on the meals with the back-door goings-on that skulk below the facade of his deteriorating European nobility: irrationality, extramarital affairs, drug dealing, swindling, military coups, debauchery and the inertia of apathy. His main characters are politicians, the military and the wealthy, but in a giving state of mind he lays on a supporting character to ridicule the church, a bishop whose fetish is to disguise as a gardener and work as a servant in the gardens of the rich. This Oscar-winning head trip was Bunuel's most successful film. It was released in a year when civil anxiety was at its apex, the Vietnam War was in imbued blossom, and the upper middle class was a stylish aim of contempt. How contrastive to see it in 2009, when wealth is by and large longed for and coveted. The essential crowd for the film in 1972 viewed it as holding others up to censure; the essential crowd today will, if it is \"discreet,\" view it as holding itself up to censure.\n\nFrom the start, we are conscious of the way the characters behave themselves. They emanate their prestige, certain of who they are, and exhibit their class in society like a uniform. Seemingly austere Fernando Rey's tiny grandstander of an ambassador, suave and rather penetrating Stephane Audran's affluent lady of the house, Bulle Ogier's disinterested and alcoholic sister, all behave like they're performing a play. And highlight the bishop, played with an oddly passionate superficiality by Julien Bertheau, who shows up at the door in gardener's clothes and is disdainfully kicked out, just to return in his holy attire to \"explain himself,\" and be welcomed.\n\nThe misanthropic daydream is fractured into independent scenes, showing the dull face of the fashionable privileged and the appetites that crouch underneath it. A couple awaits guests for dinner. In the bedroom, they are bowled over by horniness. The guests show up. Now they cannot have sex in the bedroom because the wife \"makes too much noise,\" the husband carps, so they sneak out a window and vigorously screw in the woods. Then they creep back into the house, leaves and grass in their hair. Bourgeoisie civilities, Bunuel quaintly suggests, are the meagerest disguise for our primal capacities. Another instance: After soldiers blitz the dinner guests, a man evades doom by hiding under a table, yet gives himself away by gluttonously reaching up for the uneaten meat on his plate.\n\nThe film's story progression is blithely ruptured by Bunuel's methods. As women have drinks in a garden caf\u00c3\u00a9, a lieutenant walks over and begins a distressing account of his childhood. We see his autobiography in flashback. He wishes them good day and leaves. A dinner party progresses abnormally when the roast chickens are dropped by the servant and emerge as stage props, and then the curtain goes up and the guests discover themselves on stage facing an audience. Dreams entwine inside dreams, not due to the characters being baffled, but because Bunuel is entertaining himself by using such barefaced gimmicks.\n\nThis sardonic musing, co-written with Jean-Claude Carriere with quick wit and intellectual enthusiasm, is not grim or agitated, but mocking and amazed. Financed by the French producer Serge Silberman, Bunuel was finally at deserved liberty to satiate his far-ranging imagination, and the movie is free of any commercial or coherent conditions. Bunuel was contemptuous, though not disheartened. We say one thing and do another, yes, but that doesn't make us immoral, just human and, from his outlook, hilarious. He has been dubbed a depraved filmmaker, but the more I discover his films the more insight and affirmation I see, as well as a strong social awareness.",
