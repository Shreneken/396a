    "summary": "An expansive Russian drama, this film focuses on the life of revered religious icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoliy Solonitsyn). Drifting from place to place in a tumultuous era, the peace-seeking monk eventually gains a reputation for his art. But after Rublev witnesses a brutal battle and unintentionally becomes involved, he takes a vow of silence and spends time away from his work. As he begins to ease his troubled soul, he takes steps towards becoming a painter once again.",

            "content": "While certainly not devoid of beauty and of depth, \"Andrei Rublev\" seemed to me like a movie that is not in any way interested in telling the story that it chose to tell. It is meandering, stumbling, not coherent. This makes each singular scene strong on its own, as it must shine with its own light, unable to depend on what comes before or after it. But at the same time because of this the whole movie seems somehow to be less than sum of its parts. The overall plot is hard to follow even in scenes where we should know what is going on \u2013 while time of each scene is meticulously documented, place is not and some characters are not that easy to identify. I get that this is not the main point here, but this does not work, in my opinion, in favor of said main point, of questions about relationship between faith and creativity. Confusion detracts rather than allows us to focus. But the plot-line about the bell was beautiful. I can easily see it remade into a separate movie of its own.",

Turns out there is nothing to miss, because Tarkovsky tries his best to say nothing for three hours. The director stated it himself, this is not a story with a message, but an arthouse experience. Without any reasonable pace or coherence in the storytelling department, and weird nonsense sequences thrown here and there, the viewer is certainly left with a mere experience. And an awful one, if such viewer happens to not care about medieval Russia. This is of course my outrageous opinion, coming from a heathen yet to be enlightened, unlike most reviewers here.",

            "content": "Incredibly grand and surrealistic shots that Tarkovsky is able to pull off in this movie. Those aerial shots are beautiful. This movie has a similar vibe to \u2018The Seventh Seal', I'm really digging it. This is a very interesting time that Tarkovsky chose to place the move in. It's kind of like Medieval Russia. Goddamn, Tarkovsky really is the master of patience and slow shots, but ,am are they visually stunning and gorgeous. I mean you can pause the movie at any point and just put it in a frame and hang it up on a wall. I love the dialogue on wisdom between the old Greek guy and the priest when he first arrives at the church. He mentioned in much wisdom there is much grief. And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. They hit extremely hard. Why are these so true? \n\nThis movie's incredibly interesting because not only does it teleport you to that point in time in history, but it also shows us a world in which we've never ventured to. It's really interesting to see how everyone who was a painter, or wanted to be a painter, was painting religious things solely. Portraits of Jesus, or paintings of angels and Christian symbology. Wow, that pile, or should I say wall of stacked logs was impressive. I've never seen a pile of stacked logs like that before. Lmao! I love that line that Theophanes the Greek said about Foma, \"He should be beaten every Saturday, like a dog\". That's so random but hilarious. Idk what it was, but it seemed like the Medieval times was a dark time all around the world. It seems like religion had a big part in that. \n\nWhy is everything so weird and ominous when it comes to Pagans? Lol. That whole sequence with the naked pagans was so ominous, especially with that unsettling music. Very interesting nonetheless. I think that whole experience with the Pagans helped to open up Andrei's mind, helped to broaden it to more possibilities. Wow, that turned dark really quick with that eye-gouging scene with the Turks on horseback. That's so fucked up! They took away the one sense they needed in order to make art. Brutal, that's horrifying! \n\nWtf now there's Mongolians?! What's with all this violence and raid all of a sudden? Dude that whole pillaging sequence of the village and church was crazy as fuck! It reminded me of \u2018Come and See'. All the chaos and brutality. Oh my god!! They poured boiling water down his throat and then got dragged by the horse. WTF?!! Damn this movie took a dark ass turn. \n\nWow, that was incredible how they made that bell. And out of silver! All the hard labor that went into it, the planning and then the hoisting of it. I mean that thing was huge! It must've weighed at least equivalent to a pick up truck. All amazing to watch. See, he could have shot it in color! Why the fuck didn't he shoot it in color?! Wtf man?! He probably thought, oh its a dark time and therefore it must reflect visually with black & white. Man fuck that shit lol. \n\nThis movie surprised me with the amount of humor there is in the beginning. Watching the movie, it almost feels like a dream. It's pretty surreal. We're basically seeing the life of an artist during the 15th century. It's incredible since there's not many movies that do it quite like Tarkovsky. Yeah I'm convinced that Tarkovsky movies are a one and done sort of ordeal for me, unless I'm in the right mood. It kind of turned into a dark, somber sort of depressing movie towards the second act. Yeah, this is one I have no interest in watching again. Maybe I'd use it as reference for inspiration with shots and cinematography but I mean that's about it.",

While the narrative can be confusing and the running time is exhausting, the film is filled with visual wonders, typical of Tarkovsky and equaled by no one.  Shot in stark black and white, the movie is high-lighted by lengthy takes, long tracking shots, and elaborate crane shots.  While Andrei Rublev will undoubtedly confound and puzzle viewers at times, its creativity will reward those patient enough to wade through it.",

If you don't have a taste for that atmosphere you might not like it so much, but I'm mesmerized by it - the steppes, the rivers, the dress, the depth-of-field shots, the slow pans. All the performances are excellent - can't pick one or two but I'll mention Kirill and his deforming envy, the jester (the actor Rolan Bykov gives a clinic), and Irma Raush is very brave in her role. The slow pace and slow development, mainly through dialogue, are part of the attraction for me and not unlike an Ozu film's.\n\nI just watched it for maybe the fifth time. The other times I rolled with it, not paying too much attention to the history. This time I did a little homework ahead and now I know the story better; I hope I don't like the movie less next time!",

And I doubt something more profound to explore Andrei Rublev's themes will ever grace the big screen.\n\nRight now I'm at a loss for words, a proper review is on the way, so I'll just say I would give it 6/5 stars if I could.",

First, there are lots of horses, though I worried about the health of some of them, especially the one that fell awkwardly down the stairs. Second, the images in this movie are beautiful and enigmatic, which is standard for a Tarkovsky picture. In those terms, I would still say this might be the least strange film of his that I have seen. Third, since the structure is episodic, rather than ruled by a narrative thread, it feels natural to like some episodes better than others. Half of them I really liked, others felt like they were there mainly to re-introduce characters (Silence, for example), since all except one are shown in the final episode, about the bell, which funny enough is the only one with any sort of dramatic tension and also my favorite. Fourth, it really pays to read what you can about this film after you've seen it. I guarantee there are things you missed that would deepen your appreciation of it. It's dense with histories, myths, allusions, and everything else.",

I was tired and the hypnotic quality and languid opening pace of Andrei Rublev put me in a right placid state. I was ready to fall asleep.\n\nBut.\n\nSomewhere around chapter 4, the film just opened up as if the frames around the screen just melted away and I fully and wholly transported into the film, it was the kind of movie magic you only read about and rarely undergo; instead of falling asleep, I woke up into the dream world of Andrei Rublev.\n\nI absolutely loved it. There's not a lot I need to say about the film, and its place within Tarkovsky's oeuvre, about his poetry, about the lead actors, the Kurosawa-esque Tartar raid, the incredible segment with the bell, all of this has been written about more elegantly and prosaically than I will be able to do right now. \n\nBut I will say that when Andrei chose to utter his final words, and the film shifted from black and white to colour, I was almost in tears, sure that I had witnesses something else; the magic of cinema.

Andrei Rublev has a lot going on in the film, and there are some quite active moments, so it didn\u2019t quite bore me as much as I expected. He still takes his time, and loves to linger on a shot for much longer than necessary, but this movie didn\u2019t have the stillness that I feared. One thing that I hate, and I see in many artsy films like Andrei Rublev, is the use of unclear symbolism and visual metaphors. I don\u2019t pick up on that kind of thing well, and when it\u2019s something as obtuse as random horses showing up in different scenes, I find myself getting annoyed rather than intrigued. One big example is the opening scene, which might be the most baffling opening of any film I\u2019ve ever watched as it doesn\u2019t seem to tie into the story at all, but I\u2019m sure it does in some metaphorical way. Andrei Rublev is divided up into chapters which worked for me because it gave me good opportunities to stop the DVD periodically and do something I found more interesting before diving back in. However, I felt the movie lacked a good pace, because it was chopped up with these weird time and location jumps. I couldn\u2019t connect the dots well to where Rublev was or what he was doing. I also found it terribly hard to differentiate one character from another. They all look so drab and have few distinguishing characteristics. And the story brings people back frequently, expecting you to know who that is and what they did before. Thankfully, I kept the Wikipedia plot description open the entire time I watched the film and that helped keep me on track with the story. It\u2019s kind of odd that a film about a painter who is responsible for all the dynamic and colorful art we see at the end is told in such a bland black-and-white. The shots are clearly well-thought-out and could be stunning in full color, but Tarkovsky likes his palate full of grey. (At least it wasn\u2019t the sepia he used in Stalker.) The oddest thing about Andrei Rublev was that the chapter I found most fascinating was the final one about the bellmaker where the titular character is just a bit part. This felt like a full film in itself, and I was astounded by some of the work they put into recreating the complex bellmaking procedures. It\u2019s not something we think about all that much in our industrial age, but there was so much intense and complex labor necessary to construct things of that magnitude. But, overall, Andrei Rublev remained yet another Tarkovsky film that did little to interest me.",

It captures the viewer and puts them in a state of awe and wonder, that I have only experienced twice before: Once in Dreyer's \"Passion of Joan of Arc,'' and then Herzog's \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God.\" It's on that level of greatness. It is dark but beautiful; exhausting but worth it in every way\n\nThe film is about a 15Th century Russian artist named Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsin). Set in medieval Russia, the film is divided into seven different chapters that spans twenty-four years. He struggles through great spiritual turbulence, and then awakening. He witnesses many atrocities being done onto people; mostly during a brutal Tarter raid where men, women, children and animals are tortured, raped and murdered. Andrei commits what he sees as a horrible sin when he kills a Tarter to save a young girl from being raped. He then loses his passion for art, becomes a Monk, and abstains from speaking for several years.\n\nI was horrified by some of the images and sounds of this film. Seeing what human beings are capable of makes you question the nature of humanity. While watching the film, I wrote down in my notes \"why are we so cruel?\" But don't let these scenes be a deterrent from seeing this great film. Yes, they are hard to sit through; but you'll be glad you did once you get to the end.\n\n\nThe film's ending is about as beautiful as any I've seen: the screen turns from black & white to color to show us the beautiful paintings from the actual Andrei Rublev -- who was without a doubt a great artist. His paintings, and how the film presents them in the form of a montage will possibly move you to tears.\nHere we see the work of a man who has been through spiritual and mental torture; and witnessed much physical torture of others---to the point where he does not even flinch when screams are heard. He now has made peace with his suffering, through his art, in which his emotions were from those terrible days were finally expressed in full form. It was as if the entire film was one long breath, and the ending was an exhale of emotions.\n \n\nFilms for me are similar to dreams. I've had countless throughout my life but only remember a small percentage; an even smaller percentage sticks with me -- and becomes a part of who I am as a person; \"Andrei Rublev\" is one of the very few films to which this applies.",

Overall, like one of his artistic compositions in a church, the separate plot chapters combine to create a film greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nThis film is much more accessible than \"The Mirror\" (1975).

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky has gone down in the history of cinema as being the most important Soviet director in the second half of the twentieth century.  His 1966 film \"Andrei Rublev\" has been considered the \"most historically audacious production in the twenty-odd years since Sergei Eisenstein's 'Ivan the Terrible.'\"  It was intially banned by the Soviet government for being too experimental, too violent, too frightening and too political to be realeased and was repressed for five years and not officially shown in the Soviet Union until 1971.  It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969 but due to pressure from the Soviet Union it was shown out of competition.\nMany different versions of the film survive due to many producers, politicians, and distributers demanding the 205 minute original cut to be reduced.  Citing the film's negativity, violence and nudity as things that should be cut.  Criterion released the original 205 minute cut in the mid-1990's on laserdisc and later on DVD in 1999 advertising it as a \"director's cut\" despite Tarkovsky's preference for the 186 minute cut.  The transfer for the laserdisc was actually sourced from a film print director Martin Scorsese had acquired while visiting Russia.\nAndrei Rublev was an icon painter for the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church in medieval Russia.  The Russian Orthodox Church had canonized Rublev as a saint in 1988 and celebrate his feast day on January 29.  Not much is really known about his life and Tarkovsky's film only uses his life and what is known to make a grander statement about goodness in a world full of evil.\nRublev experiences doubt, regret, guilt throughout eight episodes in his life.  The film isn't linear, nor does every vignette feature Rublev.  The film takes the idea that you can understand the time period through the life of a man.  Princes at odds with one another over territory and constant raids by Tatars.  A very challenging film to watch and disect, but a beautifully directed film.",

With this stunning epic, he crafts a grand portrait of Andrei Rublev, a medieval Russian painter. The film is steadily paced, slow, and it takes time for the story to unfold, but things start to pick towards the middle of the film, and there are several interesting and engaging segments, which are divided in seven parts. This film never saw a proper release when completed in the 60's, as Soviet authorities deemed it too religious and they took it upon themselves to cut plenty of the footage out of the film. I enjoyed this film, and I thoroughly enjoy big, ambitious films that are grand, take risks and are memorable. This is superb filmmaking, and I believe it is one of the finest foreign epics in cinema. Brilliantly constructed, directed, acted and shot, Andrei Rublev is a grand picture that is purely and simply, masterful filmmaking. Andrei Tarkovsky is what I would call an acquired taste, his films are a bit hard to get into, but once you do get into them, you're just so involved at what he accomplishes with his camera. I would say he was the Russian equivalent of Stanley Kubrick, because he is simply an artist, his vision and ideas and one of a kind, and though this is my second film of Tarkovsky's that I have watched,  the first being Solaris, which for me is his masterwork, and a masterpiece of Science Fiction. His visionary storytelling is what makes him unique, and he tackles big, ambitious topics that are terrific entertainment for film enthusiasts that are looking for some of the finest \"art\" films in the cinematic medium.  Tarkovsky's crafts a solid picture that has a great story, and since it's divided in parts, some viewers might find that a few segments are better than others, and that's understandable. However as a whole, this is a satisfying, and truly unique viewing experience, and we get to see a director who is at ease with such grand ideas of storytelling, and in the end, we get an experience like no other, and for true film lovers, we couldn't ask for any more.",

            "content": "Andrei Rublev (1966) - 9,5\n\nMasterpiece from Tarkovsky.\nPeriod film set in the Middle Age period loosely based on the life of the artist referenced by the title, one of the most important painters to ever live in Russia. This film is dense and quite nuanced, probably unfair for me to describe its essence in few words because I feel I still haven't dissected all its substance, I want to see it again soon. Very briefly, it seems an essay about the roles and relationship of Art and Faith in that particular socio-religious construct, about the character of a true artist and his endurances to remain truthful to oneself no matter what happens in one's life, the implications and symbolisms can be extrapolated to a personal and universal scale. Unlike \"Solaris\" and \"Stalker\", \"Andrei Rublev\" does never feel like it's dragging its pace, there's always something happening worthy of attention so, fortunately, no unnecessary torture. Thank to this and the cinematic accomplishment I feel easily emerged in this film, the other 2 are somewhat delicate and fragile in this aspect.\n\nThere's just one thing that leaves me cold, I miss some emotional engagement, this aspect very much contributes to the charm and appeal of a work of cinema at least for me. But Tarkovsky works aren't gifted with appreciable degree of sentimentalism (probably judged unnecessary in light of the director premisses) there seems to be a barrier separating the viewer from the characters preventing us from predicting rich/profound emotional cores and relations, his films are relatively cold, emotionally austere and distant holding the viewer in a perspective where it's easier to critically analyse the events than to feel like one is part of that world and is experiencing the human interactions in first hand. The acting is competent but not very deep. Can't really critique but it's very apparent to me in \"Andrei Rublev\", there are several opportunities for potential development of a character or group of characters emotional canvas, but just when this seems to happen or is about to, there's a shift of attention to another subject. Seems like this is inherent to Tarkovsky cinematic language and I noticed this on his previous 2 works as well, not distracting per se, just a particularity of Tarkovksy intellectual stance that affects me in his movies and can either bore or cause fascination or just make me feel emotionally unsatisfied, depending on the movie. Very noticeable when comparing \"Andrei Rublev\" and Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\", a film it shares substantial thematic gist with. Bergman has great generosity of feeling and emotion without becoming cheesy but Tarkovsky in contrast seems distant, almost inert.\n\nThis is one of those things that could leave a lot of people bored or unimpressed with \"Andrei Rublev\", but paying attention to the intellectual nuance and great cinematic artistry at display the reward more than overcomes the lack of emotion and fully justifies the movie as it is. This Russian director makes very personal cinema, he doesn't flash the juice in our face we have to look for it, otherwise it's hard to figure out what makes his movies singular.\n\n\"Andrei Rublev\" is technically impeccable, which is amazing considering the difficulty and complexity of moving forward all the logistical resource needed to lift a movie of this scale. Camera and cinematography work are top notch and I already have an idea of Tarkovsky style, the black levels are quite poor but I still like the picture very much, the sound work has the hallmark of Tarkovsky as well, the voices up in the mix to highlight the dialogues a peculiarity that requires just a bit of familiarization, the scenarios are commendable and contribute to the epic scale of the movie. Everything is so well crafted and directed that despite Tarkovsky tendency to put me in a distant and analytical position, I feel engaged in that believable and authentic world as if in a dream. Without a doubt a major work of cinema. I love it and highly recommend!",

The short squalid lives of those living in this time seem authentically depicted and their horror and sadness undoubtedly influence the monk/artist (or this is what we are meant to believe).  Rublev even gives up making art (and speaking) because it seems pointless in a world so tragic, but he has his faith (in art, not religion -- although the two are intertwined, presumably for both Andrei's) restored through witnessing the fantastic rendering of a huge silver bell, another piece of creative achievement.  I saw a cut of about 180 minutes but longer versions do exist; they all assuredly include scenes of a Tartar/Mongol invasion, a pagan mayday-like nighttime ritual, an early balloon flight, a minstrel's shenanigans, and lots of trudging trudging trudging and querying querying querying.  Tarkovsky is deeply serious but his focus on detail and the intensity of his scrutiny are transcendental indeed.  It must have been a magnificent campaign to mount it.  This may not be my favorite of his films but I give it 5 stars.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDERI RUBLEV [1966/1969]; Rated as one of the top Ten World Films in an Opinion poll conducted by the Members of The European Academy of Film & Television in 1995; Andrei Tarkovsky's 1966 historical Bio-Picture about the Medieval Russian Icon Painter Andrei Rublev is a film worthy of its legacy. Loosely portraying the life of Rublev; Tarkovsky's powerful film despite being made in 1966 was only screen to a select few until being officially realised in 1969. Despite being made under a largely strict Atheist Regime, the film depicts its main character struggles with his faith and talents as an artist within a historical setting. With equally stark Black and White cinematography similar to what was seen in IVAN'S CHILDHOOD [1962]; ANDERI RUBLEV is a captivating film. \n\nPLOT; Set between the years 1400 to 1423 ANDERI RUBLEV tells the story of Rublev in an episodic format. Opening with the story titled BUFFOON set in 1400 and closing with the story titled BELL set in 1423; the film depict Rublev's hardships and trials. From the separation from his mentors like the great Theophanes the Greek, doubt with his artistic ability, the hardships of frequent Tartar raids on the Russian landscape, and more importantly due to the raids doubt with his faith. \nTHOUGHTS; Tarkovsky's loose depiction of the life of a famed religious icon painter Andrei Rublev is a rewarding cinematic experience.  One of the Great Russian directors' most bold undertakings; the historical setting, the vast sets, the sight of multiple extras, dramatic sequences but all contained with an intimate drama, ANDERI RUBLEV   is a brilliant historical epic. Despite the trappings of a typical Historical Epic, most of the films focus is upon the trials and tribulations of Rublev. Portrayed vividly by actor Anatoly Solonitsyn as Rublev, the depiction of a historical figure in this film comes across as believable. Unlike other Historical Epics, Rublev is depicted as a person who is a very flawed but rather human character. \n\nTarkovsky and Solonitsyn's depiction of Rublev shows the character enduring the pain of doubt and disbelief, both with his faith and his artistic ability. Rublev's doubts about both of these things are brought upon by the separation from his mentors including Theophanes the Greek. With the pain of loneliness and isolation haunting Rublev; the major turning point of the film is during the story of THE RAID set in 1408. In that sequence depicts the brother of Russia's Grand Prince betraying his nation by allying himself and his forces alongside the Tatar forces, the nation's sworn enemies. Together the Prince and Tatars lay waste and commit a massacre in a major town. The raiders then also lay waste to a cathedral and slaughter the worshipers. After surviving the massacre Rublev and killing a fellow Russian, undergoes a vow of silence in response to his doubt over his faith and talent in response to witnessing such destruction and partaking in a sinful action. With the characteristic of doubt makes the main character seems more human, which works in this films favour to create a believable and realistic depiction life of Medieval Russia. \n\n Also the depiction of Rublev's struggle with his celibacy as well comes into focus as well. During the story of FEAST set in 1408; Rublev and his associates are out in the remote woods when Rublev separates from the group. Rublev comes across a Pagan ritual where the entire village adults run through the Forrest naked charged with underlying sexual tones. Rublev is captured by two of the pagans who tie him up; that is until a female Pagan fascinated by Rublev allows him to leave. Before she unties Rublev She kisses him, which leaves Rublev in more doubt about his faith and human desires. \n\nOverall with its stark Black & White Cinematography, Strong lead performance, it's deep and poetic depiction of one person's struggle with their human flaws and witnessing humanity at it's worse; ANDERI RUBLEV   is a near masterpiece. Tarkovsky's depiction of life in a historical setting is a rich and rewarding cinematic experience. It is no surprise why it was labelled as one of the top Ten World Films. So I have no doubt I will have to revisit time and time again; it is a great film. 9/10.",

Andrei, used to believe on human values and credits humanity flaws such as ignorance, not after invasion and seeing the deep cruelty committed by mankind, loses his faith on human and inclines toward Theophanes the Greek, who dedicated all of his art to the abstract notion of God and did not seek any praise or feedback from mankind since he saw it pointless.\nAndrei, now find no point in doing anything, since everything is transient and will be forgotten due to this characteristic of the man: ignorance. He does not see any point in portraying God where \"God\" and churches have become a mean of controlling people and this control over this \"God\" is overtaken by cruel masters and is exchanged between them through the most inhumane events of all, war and rape and trait. Having the better church makes the masters to make the art creators blind.\nAnd when his art is destroyed he finds himself wasted. And makes an owe of silence for the rest of his life, decides not to paint, until the bell maker event.\nHere at the end, when people deep inside yearn for the sound of dumbbell, for the glimpse of God when everything is vacated completely from his presence, when the faith of the people is narrowly depend on just a ring of a bell, he finds his answer: 'it is not him or his art that should be remembered; his art is a mean to remember the people of the high values they have inside, even for just a brief moment', and this is how his art becomes eternal: the concluding scenes of the movie portraying Andrei's art in color.",

In doing so, Rublev focuses on specific stories that mold the life of the protagonist, who, both curiously and wisely, takes a backseat to the events, since to Tarkovsky these events are of paramount importance.

From this moment on, I consider myself part of the club!\n\nAgainst all odds, Andrei Rublev is a mesmerizing and profound look, not really on the life of a man but on his ideas and ideals.\nIt's a philosophical/theological study told through some powerful images, connected through the presence of one man that shaped inspired people for centuries to come. As I found out, it's not very accurate historically but it's more about the underlying timeless themes that are discussed in the medieval context. The period setting also gave Tarkovsky the possibility to depict impressive scenes of medieval life. The Tartan raid and the making of the bell are prime examples about this period and I think his decision to film (almost) everything in black-and-white was genius. It underlines the natural bleakness of the Middle Ages very well and serves the film to great purpose (I had similar thoughts about The Seventh Seal - also a theological study by a master director).\n\nAnyways, the whole idea of telling a man's story through vignettes that sometimes don't even have him as main characters is, in most cases, the better way to do a biopic. It's more lively and interesting and historical inaccuracies are easier forgiven by audiences and critics than in a straightforward chronological biopic. It can get very abstract though and in some scenes Andrei Rublev also stumbles on a thin line to obscurity - but then, the ordinary medieval life scenes take it back on the ground.\n\nThe next awesome film in the portfolio of Andrei Tarkovsky.",

Both were perfectionists, both relied and encouraged a certain level of over acting in their performers, both made two science fiction pieces.....and they get more tenuous.......\r\n\r\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHCKrusk5SQ&w=425&h=349]\r\n\r\nWhilst Kubrick kept a careful distance from the emotion and sometimes the soul of the characters, Tarkovsky paints their innermost thoughts through wrought faces, through symbolic imagery, frantic body language and long, long silences.\r\n\r\nSo whilst comparing the two against one another can be dangerous, skewing your opinion against one or the other, it can be useful to consider the two differing reflections of the same thing. 2001 sits alongside Solaris with ease whilst, to a lesser level, Andrei Rublev can be a good companion piece to Barry Lyndon. Watching one, it is nearly impossible to not recall the other.\r\n\r\nBoth focus on individuals, both span decades (something film does badly, as a rule), both show episodes of their protagonist's life to demonstrate the whole, both have grand scores, both are baroque and bleak in their imagery and both are set against a backdrop (of a worlde gonne madde) of violence and unrest.\r\n\r\nLyndon is a study of greed, base lust and malice whilst Rublev focuses on faith, artistic creation, sin and torment. Both do it well.\r\n\r\nRublev (for those not up on their fifteenth century, Russian icon painters) is a fifteenth century, Russian icon painter about which little is known (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Rublev). Tarkovsky has seemingly extrapolated a tortured soul from his works, which we see before the end credits. Rublev is a monk, eschewing worldly pleasures for a simple life of religious fulfillment and artistic creation. Unfortunately, fifteenth century Russia is a brutal place, subject to raids from the Tartars, ruled by feuding Princes, struck by famine and cold.\r\n\r\nRublev speaks rarely, embracing a vow of silence for a large portion of his life, he looks and listens to the violence and poverty around him. Using it to produce sparse, ascetic, almost uplifting paintings. We see Rublev watching a Jester criticise the church and state with satire before being led away by soldiers, stumbling across a pagan festival, being a victim during the sacking of Vladivar within a cathedral he has decorated and other scenes Tarkovsky imagines influenced the artist within him.\r\n\r\nCreative (and wholly made up characters) pop up to symbolise creative freedom and indeed the lack of it, a man launches a hot air baloon whilst people decry him as a devil for example. Rublev is beset by visions; the crucifixion on a snow covered hill, a prince putting out the eyes of an artist so he can work no more and  crucially, a vision of his mentor Theophanes, who appears to Rublev whilst he sits in the ruins of Vladivar Cathedral, Rublev talks to him and at one point stares into the camera whilst railing against the idea of the truth as if speaking directly to us, centuries in the future.\r\n\r\nTarkovsky ( with wonderful cinematography from Vadim Yusov) makes every image a lesson in expressing the scene, fifteenth century Russia looks authentic and populated by fake people and stories give the film a dreamlike (nightmare) quality, slow motion is employed to heighten the horror of every day life.The violence is more shocking than say, Hostel, because of the context, eyes are cut out, men are tortured with fire, horses fall off scaffolding (then get stabbed), women are raped and it's clear that life expectancy is short.\r\n\r\nAndrei Rublev is a film that will reward repeat viewings, slowly unveiling it's layers of subtle meaning and undercurrents through almost perfect use of sound and images. Like films are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe horses are lovely too.",

Too experimental, too frightening, too violent, and too politically complicated to be released officially, Andrei Rublev has existed only in shortened, censored versions.This film after watching the full vision was truly enlighting.This ilm is pure beauty. It is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. It is, as with all Tarkovsky movies, a statement about the director himself - about his own doubts, angst, and guilt, and his own redemption in art and in God. Soif you like any of these films, if you like philosophy, poetry or nature, I recommend you to watch this great film. A great film.Just remember that this is a fine Tarkovski film. It is as good a film as any of his for introducing new filmViewers.Sould approach it with the proper mindset, however. Their objective should be to experience the film and their reaction to it. Obviously, interest in Russia around the 13th century will probably not hurt appreciation. While the film is, in its totality, different from most films, the individual scenes are not weird- no strange camera work, no sudden introduction of esoteric symbols, just fairly honest attempts to record an individual person's impression of what viewers today might find to be unusual experiences.",

This was better than Ran, however. I looked up the historical context afterwards and that helped a lot in the way of understanding it. I recommend doing that first. It does also have a few nice visuals (collected in the menu of the new box set).

Challenging in its length (the uncut Criterion version runs at a whopping 205mins!), and challenging in it's story. I won't pretend to have gotten everything in the movie or to understand all of it. But I don't think his film wants or at least needs you to understand all of it. I think it's just a serious of snapshots from a man's life, told in motion, in a very visually poetic style, probably somewhat dramatized for effect in places. Like a miniseries shown all at once. \nIt isn't all hard to follow though. For most of it, it's easy to follow what's happening, it's just not always clear why. Like I said though, complete understanding isn't necessary all the time, I mean think about it: This is a Russian film about Icon painters and monks and takes place in the early 1400's. Try keeping up with that.\nI actually found the film to be a very easy three and a half hour watch. The aforementioned visual beauty of the direction and cinematography gives you something amazing to look at almost all the time. And the story is usually very interesting. I won't say it doesn't have its slow spots or scenes that are a little trying with how long they drag on, but a scene in which some people attack a church both has a very Kurosawa feel and is just plain impressive on its own merit, with hundreds of extras sometimes in a single shot. \nAnd a scene at the end of the film, which doesn't have a lot to do with Rublev, is so amazingly done and fascinating it makes sense the whole film seems to build towards it: Men come to a village in search of a bell caster to cast a bell for the Prince for a new chapel, the bell caster's have all died of the plague and only a boy in his teens is left. The boy convinces the men to let him cast the bell, claiming to have been given the 'secret to bell casting.' They reluctantly agree to let him helm the task, which is such an undertaking it nearly kills him, and the scene when the bell is done and everyone's about to see if it will ring is suspenseful and tense, as the Prince will kill all involved, including the boy, if it fails to ring.\nThe making of the bell is an amazing sequence and seems like a larger than life task to film, but it is done with complete realism and skill. \n\nI can't recommend this movie to everyone because it's long, in Russian, in black and white and sometimes hard to follow, but it's also a great artistic achievement and a more entertaining experience than you might think.  \nThen again, you just rent it and skip to the bell casting scene. That's okay too.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky is considered, along with Eisenstein, the greatest Russian director ever. I had seen masterpieces by Tarkovsky (Ivanovo detstvo, 1962), but also artsy, pretentious movies completely dull and impossible to understand (Zercalo, 1975). But Rublyov is considered his greatest achievement, so it was with anticipation, but the feeling that I would need a bag full of patience, that I sat last Sunday for 3 hours to watch it. Well well, this movie is something indeed. Ok, but let me warn you that it will only serve for those who are prone for this genre of films, for those who can see Fellini or Godard, for those who are not disturbed by what is not exactly straightforward, and, of course, are very keen on the artistic value of film. For those, Rublyov will be one of the films of a lifetime. For me it was a good experience, but not that sublime, although it mesmerized me many times. At least it was understandable, and not pretentious. On the contrary. It tells the story of Russian 15th century monk turned painter Andrey Rublyov, but it doesn't really tell it. Well, at least not in the conventional sense. We don't see him painting once, nor even picking up a brush. The movie is a series of set pieces introduced by credits such as \"The party, 1408\" or \"The bell, 1422\", that show an event in the painter's life, which he watched or took part or just passed through. There are scenes where he doesn't appear, and in the end we just see him walk by. Actually the movie is a social portrait of an era, it dwells more on the famine, cold and war infested Russia of the middle-ages, and on the feelings that creates on the inhabitants, Rublyov included. It can be fierce, as in the invasion of the Tartars, it can be gentle, delicate, humble, heroic and mostly philosophical, but it is always beautiful. For me the most striking thing was the depth of the image (every scene has incredible background work at real locations with many extras) and the fantastic composition of the black and white photography. Rublyov's inner demons are revealed by the conversations he has, unconnected from one scene to the next, then at a point he takes a vow of silence and the images do it for him, but unfortunately, as I said, the movie more than often changes to side characters and situations (such as the bell construction) and loses its thread. I will not call it dull in its three hours, but actually it reminded me of Lean's \"Ryan's Daughter\" of 1970. An incredible epic fantastically photographed, but which sometimes stays off topic more than it should. Every camera shot is a work of art, that is for sure, and the movie ends up being not a story, but a piece of poetry, a work of art in itself, which uses Rublyov as a connecting point, but that does not make much effort in sticking with him. At last, after three hours, the last 5 minutes are a slide show of his paintings, with balletic zoom and ethereal music, which throughout the movie was an asset. Also Anatoli Solonitsyn, an actor in his first movie, was a very insightful Rublyov and an amazing find for the role. For me it was not better than Ivanovo detstvo, but watching it I came to understand why Tarkovsky gained, justifiably, his status of cinema master.",

To sum this up is rather futile. The fact is, it needs to seen to be understood. \r\n\r\nIt was a little difficult to get into at first, but after an hour or so you get into a flow. Once you do you are able to revel in the world Tarkovsky has made and truly appreciate the struggles and lives of Andrei Rublev and the people around him. The last hour was certainly the most captivating of the entire film.\r\n\r\nAs with most of Tarkovsky's productions, your eyes will not be bored. The gorgeous black and white photography is essential and only makes the closing scene that much more mesmerizing. The length will certainly turn many off, as a spare 205 minutes is rare to come by, but separating it into segments makes it easier to stop and come back to later on. Believe me when I say that you will be rewarded for sticking this out until the end...",

He was a genius director, and in terms of his directing and storytelling skills, he was the Stanley Kubrick of Russia. It's long, yes; but totally worth it.

The film is broken up into seven 'episodes,' which do not always follow Rublev, but are essential to the background of his story. Although often very slow-paced for a typical viewer, at 3 hours and 25 minutes, the film packs quite a lot of information in. Many of the cinematic sequences speak for themselves without the aid of dialogue and the portrayal of life in 15th century Russia is stunningly accurate. Solonitsyn's portrayal of Rublev is mesmerizing, aided by other brilliant actors like Lapikov, Grinko and even Nikulin, to name just a few. Tarkovsky succeeded at making a truly moving and poetic film, a feat that many other popular Russian directors could only dream about.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's epically repressed film about the great fifteenth century icon/fresco painter Andrei Rublev is a challenging piece of cinema by any standards with fragmented storytelling, a violent if liberal portrayal of history between the Slavs and Tatars, frequent biblical recitations, and signature laborious camerawork. Threaded through the 205-minute feature is a thematic progression of artistic inspiration and endurance; Andrei Rublev accounts the man's periodic trek across Russia, showcasing events at the turn of the fifteenth century to the spring of 1424. Divided into seasonal chapters, the historic epic is an artistic collaboration in the greatest sense of the term, because it is not only a commentary on the work of its crew but also a testament to the architecture and art of the century as the product of a large unit of physical and spiritual forces. However, while a significant portion of the film dwells on the cooperation of a unified mass, the film depicts the brutality of nature, struggle with disease (the plague) and the clash between religious devotion and lawless paganism. The latter is a feud rooted in a fundamental cultural divergence and the idea of serving God versus pillaging fellow man.\nOne of the most striking aspects of Andrei Rublev is Tarkovsky's unique modus operandi and penchant for long tracking shots. The director definitively uses a lack of editing to simulate immersion and intensity; a revelatory moment frequently commences at a close-up and then gradually zooms out to reveal the magnitude or breadth of a situation. Most notably during the last fifteen minutes of the film, the camera closes in on a young girl amongst a group of villagers watching the erection of the bell tower and ceremonial ringing of the bell. As the bell begins to chime, the camera pans left toward a woman in white (as a religious symbol), then follows her as village commotion begins. There is a subtle cut is to a lone Boriska sitting on the ground while the bell's reverberation permeates the entire landscape, and the camera gently pulls back to a wide-angle to reveal hundreds of celebratory people gathering around the tower. This entire sequence is exemplary of Tarkovsky's methods, because it demonstrates the devotion to one that is equal to the devotion of many. Instead of predictable individual close-ups of principal subjects, Rublev, or the tower's chief instigator Boriska, Tarkovsky favors a more objective outlook, as he intends to showcase an omnipotent eye. This can also be seen during the battle between the Slavs and Tartars in \"The Raid\" in the autumn of 1408; the lens maintains distance from the decisive action at medium-long shots to preserve a single, overarching point of view as the entire battle is under judgment by God.\nAlthough the film is technically credited with the use of black and white and color as many of Tarkovsky's other works like Solyaris and The Mirror, only the last eight minutes of Andrei Rublev are shot in color, which exist almost like a separate narrative or abstract of Rublev's life through the fine details of his paintings. The sequence is reached through a delicate tilt and pan to the embers of a dying fire, which then seamlessly dissolves into a redish-orange surface of a mural. The initial materialization of these colors is symbolic of passion and the integral forging of the bell tower; while the closing frames do not directly concern themselves with the former 197 minutes, they are solely the inspiration of Andrei Rublev's work. Interestingly, as not one scene in the black and white portion showcases Rublev physically painting or developing his artistry, viewers are able to witness the culmination of his passion, influence and style in the vibrant and devout closing moments. The extreme close-ups of religious icons paired with Gyorgy Ligeti-like choral music indicate unrelenting god-fearing piety. \"The Trinity,\" his most representative and famous icon, is appropriately showcased three times in the closing sequence, depicting the three angels who visited Abraham at the oak of Mamre in the book Genesis. The film essentially resolves on the fixation of \"The Trinity\" as a divine representation for the father, son, and holy spirit, the prevailing theme in Rublev's life and work.\nIn his Criterion essay, Jim Hoberman discusses Tarkovsky's epic as one of the first Soviet films to treat the artist as a seminal world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia's historical identity. It is Rublev's presence that is rather unconventional, then, in a film designated with his own name, as he is occasionally only a witness or entirely absent from unfolding events. Instead, Rublev is more of a spiritual link to the episodic nature of the film on both a literal and metaphorical level. Because Rublev exists as a secondary character in certain instances, it allows audiences to actively search for meaning much as the characters are themselves. In the second act from 1405-1406, Kirill, a wandering monk and acquaintance of Rublev, seeks to counsel Theophanes the Greek, another painter of icons, but Kirill is eclipsed by Rublev himself; in a jealous rage Kirill subsequently denounces the religious community and proclaims his allegiance the secular world. However, as he discovers there is nothing for him there and ends up a starving soul, in the winter of 1412 he retreats into the arms of the monks at the Andronikov Monastery to seek atonement and repentance. Along with Kirill's defiant self-quest, the everlasting biblical recitations also play a strong role in the identity of Rublev and Russia's history, serving as reminder of the presence of God as well as evil, which manifests in the destructive paganish Tatars and the bubonic plague.\nIn a miraculous turn at the conclusion of the black and white portion of the film (in 1424), Rublev is inspired by the artistic revelations of Boriska (who succeeds in crafting a bell while lacking his father's proclaimed secret) to break his vow of silence and console him, emotionally stirred to the point to undertake his destined profession as a painter again. Prior to this sequence, Kirill, after retreating from the \"secular world\" and pleading for mercy even fails to shake Rublev's resolution. When these scenes are juxtaposed, it seems that Tarkovsky suggests that the artist is only truly inspired by the trials and tribulations of another divine vessel; Boriska's miraculous achievement restores Rublev's faith in the earthly world. In cinematic terms, Andrei Rublev teaches audiences the value of ingenuity and the pursuance of personal response and interpretation of one's environment. As an ironic and unintentional commentary on the immediate censorship of the film, Tarkovsky has said, \"art would be useless if the world were perfect, as man wouldn't look for harmony but would simply live in it. Art is born out of an ill-designed world.\" Similarly, a tumultuous fifteenth century Russia faced political and religious persecution as well as the severity of weather and disease, which all helped to shape the foundation of Rublev's artistic vision and perseverance.",

A great art film should have mass apeal and encourage those who are not fans of art films to open their minds to the world of introspective cinema. \r\n This film, brilliant as it was at times, almost put me to sleep and I'm a fan of Tarkovsky, Russian history and black and white cinema. This leads me to conclude that its parameters pertain only to a very specific audience and would not be appreciated by most film goers. Nonetheless, this is a very important film historically and is somewhat of an essential for fans of Russian cinema.",

I think it succeeds in many areas; as always with Tarkovsky, every short is like poetry; filmed in gorgeous black and white and in the stillness that is so prominent with his movies. The events were never uninteresting. But this movie feels SO LONG. It's three hours and twenty-four minutes, but feels like an eternity because of the pacing. Not much happens, and I feel like all we get at the end is Andrei Rublev  understanding that people need art to be inspired and pleased and returning to painting his icons . I suppose the payoff was a lot less than I'm used to, especially from the guy who is behind such mind-blowing endings as Solaris. So, all in all, this is well-done, but pretty uneventful.

A 3 hours 15th century sprawling epic, telling the saga of Andrei Rublev, a Russian painter, living in the middle of Tartar's invasion in Russia. Religion is a strong theme here, all along the story it seems that Rublev is being struck with temptation after temptation, from witchery & paganism to questioning the existence of God himself. This movie itself's full with symbolism (yeah, i know the horses, even Rublev himself), and even that i haven't fully understood the meaning of the overall metaphors in this movie, but the story itself already glued my eyes to the screen last night from beginning til the end (And that was 1 am, and i didn't feel sleepy at all !). Beautiful cinematography (how come you don't call it stunning with scenes like Andrei & Danil conversing in that flower plain AND Andrei & the ghost of Theophanes talking to each other inside the church when finally snow falls from the destroyed ceiling of the church ? fucking awesome !), it seems that you can printscreen every scene from this movie and hang it on your wall. The use of music's just perfectly handled (when Rublev is in the middle of that pagans doiing their rituals in the river, the music is just eerie).And the final scene in colour showing his paintings, simply haunting. Overall, i wish i understood all symbolism of this movie, so i could give this a solid 10, maybe after another rewatch (Which i'm definitely going to do).",

Some people actually claim that this film represents for Russian cinema what \"War and Peace\" represents for Russian literature. I'm not sure whether this is true, but I'm quite sure that the film is a milestone in world cinema and probably Tarkowski's first film where he finally was able to show his full potential. It is a loosely based historical drama that actually tackles the idea of art's survival and relevance in face of harrowing historical circumstances. How he was able to get this past the Soviet censorship in the late 60's is beyond my comprehension. I think this film should be shown as an example of a film as a true manifestation of art and how far we are these days from this type of sensation in world cinema. And one more thing...

There are also great parallels where the government ruthlessly persecutes pagans while Russia is invaded by Pagan Tatars. \n\nAlso there is the struggle of the monks and the monks who seek to utilize their gifts but struggle with depression, greed, and envy of others.  There are difficult scenes to see on here especially the invasion of the Tatars who rape, pillage, and kill animals.  Read the wiki about this movie so you have some sense to how they shot some of the scenes, but it still does not help in seeing a horse killed that was going to die anyways.  \n\nAs a Christian, this movie had a profound effect on me and the symbols are those that all Christians struggle with no matter where it takes place in history.  This is now on my Amazon \"wish list.\"  \n\nFinally, it is interesting that a movie like this was made during the Soviet control of Russia, but it is not surprising it did not play in Russia.

The Russian Censors were opposed to some of the more violent scenes and cut the film down to Tarkovsky's dismay (the whole film revolves around an artist's struggle to keep his own artistic and spiritual faith in turbulent times, to say that Tarkovsky saw some of himself in Rublev's struggle would be an understatement).\n\nThe fictitious story of Russia's most beloved Icon Painter is split up into 7 sequences, starting off with a prologue that involves one man's attempt to ride a hot air balloon over the vast Russian Countryside, only to plummet towards the Earth after a shortish distance (we never find out what happened to him). It then charts our hero Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn), as he leaves the safety and comfort of his monastery to work with Theophanes The Greek (a prominently elder icon painter), a fact that is accepted by fellow monk Danil (Nikolai Grinko) but not by the jealous Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) who leaves the monastery on his own (he even beats a dog to death offscreen in a fit of violence).\n\nAfter crashing a Pagan festival disrupted by soldiers, Rublev has an artistic crisis when he finds himself unable to paint The Last Judgement in a Church because he doesn't want to terrify people. Once he gets the idea to paint a feast, his paintings and the Church are destroyed in a raid which even causes Rublev to kill another man (causing him to take a vow of silence for his sins and to quit painting).\n\nThe penultimate sequence of the film is memorable to say the least, as a bellmaker's son convinces the powers-that-be that he is able to cast a gigantic bell, as we along with Rublev witness the meticulous planning and building of this rather large bell that is one of the great movie-within-a-movie moments in history.\n\nI'm too tired to say more about it, it's just a masterpiece on the human condition and an artist's struggle to keep his humanity during inhumane times.",

The glacial pace and monotone Russian dialogue during the deliberate first half have a kind of narcotizing effect. We follow the life of young priest and icon painter Andrei Rublev as he experiences the ugliness of 15th century Russia under the oppressive yoke of Christian Orthodoxy. For the first 90 minutes or so, we sculpt his character in all three painstaking dimensions using episodic chunks of narrative. An early encounter with a drunken jester removes his sense of humor, then an apprenticeship painting a chapel with Theophanes the Greek teaches him how to prepare art on an epic scale. Another priest in his seminary becomes envious and rejects all art and literature to become a worthless vagrant wandering the \"secular world\". In rich, deep focus anamorphic black and white, few other films are able to capture both existential despair and the great beauty in its high contrast. \n\nThe second half is when \"Andrei\" becomes truly great. We learn of a twin brother, a prince, enforcing the Orthodoxy with the help of barbarous Mongolians. The stunning sequence in which the two brothers' fates happen to collide is horrifyingly violent even today. Surely there was no PETA equivalent in the Soviet Union. The dichotomy could not be more extreme between the Brothers Rublev, yet their level of faith in God is one and the same. As Rublev adopts a \"holy fool\" and begins a vow of silence, there is further symbolism and duality. His religious torment stands in the way of creating art, as there is no more awe in God's Work, only sickness and despair. More allegories abound for a solid 3 hours and 15 minutes before a stunningly beautiful conclusion that literally bursts with life and color and awe. That this was only the second of Tarkovsky's seven feature length films does not detract from its quality. His creative stride is in full force in every last frame.",

This is a film about the malleability of artistic inspiration as well as the impossibility of truly understanding another's creativity. Tarkovsky is interested not in the products of artistry but in the inspiration behind them; the film is filled with small, humble human encounters which work like puzzle pieces in the life of Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky does not ask us to sympathize or reject these occurrences but instead asks us to put down our defenses and let them wash over us. The film is the most unpretentious of \"biopics\" because it is the only one that never pretends to know the life of its subject. Facts are replaced with guesses, and while most of the story is probably fictitious there is a real truth in its framing. After all is said and done, the subject of the film becomes  irrelevant. The film simply becomes a perfect document of human perseverance and a suggestion that the strange way human beings live together, for better or for worse, never changes- it is only the way we deal with it that does.",

I've always considered myself a big fan of him but I've never truly loved any of his films until this. From beginning to end,he puts across some of the most awe-inspiring and beautiful images you'll likely ever see. Vadim Yusov really went above and beyond with the cinematography. It's no surprise for a Tarkovsky film to be technically perfect but this was truly something else. The story is masterfully handled and is broke down into crucial periods of Andre Rublev's life except the prologue but it still deals with the themes of the movie. It also doubles as a look into 15 century Russian history. That might sound kinda boring when you think about it but it's anything but. Tarkovsky paints a realistic and endlessly interesting portrait of Russia during it's chaotic progression into what would become the Tsardom of Russia. I especially liked how stressed the importance of creativity and faith was during this time which was what the movie was essentially about. All in all,this is one of the most impressive and wonderful films I have ever seen in my life.",

Uniquely among artist biopics, there are no scenes of the hero at the easel and we don?t see his work ? in radiant colour after three hours of black-and-white ? until the very end of the film. Indeed, Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn) tends to fade into the bearded, weatherbeaten crowd (for much of the running time he?s under a vow of silence) as various holy fools command attention. If Tarkovsky?s intense argument about God, talent and the human condition is as chilly as the steppes, the pre-CGI widescreen spectacle, depicting crowds of people and animals, is often breathtaking: the screen fills with Kurosawa-like action as Tartars sack a cathedral or a mad waif bosses a more experienced crew as they forge a church bell.",

            "content": "this film, made up of several disjointed episodes, tells a story of Rublev, the monk, who lived a very complex life.  Rublev was also a painter-an artist- who studied with master Rudonevsky at the Holy Trinity, but he lived at variance with those teachings.  Rublev got to see the world through his master's eyes only at the end of his life that he lived in his own way.  Therefore,experience, is one of the poignant central themes of the fim that the viewer learns about here.  That experience-wisdom, if you will, is impossible to pass on to others or learn from others as a person must learn to live on his own. No one can inherit experience or wisdom.  \r\nRublev experiences a lot of pressure in life, but an artist cannot work under ideal conditions.  I think that art would not exist if everything were harmonic and poetical in life.  Tarkovsky, himself, used to say that art would be useless if the world were perfect, as man wouldn't look for harmony but would simply live in it.  So Rublev's art in the end of his life was born out of an ill-designed world and the search for harmonic relationships among people, between art and life.\r\nYes, it is a much longer movie than one can bear to watch and it, probably, would not sell well.  It did not sell well.  But then again, if cinema is art, such thinking is absurd.  Such a film will never be seen by the masses, as most good films are not.  This film is not simply to be viewed- it is to be studied",

            "content": "Not necessarily my favourite film, but I fully understand when people call it the greatest film of all time.\n\nAndrei Rubyov is a 15th Century Russian iconographer who becomes famous for his skill and is asked to assist Theophanes the Greek in Moscow in decorating the Cathedral of the Annunciation. This leads him to a personal commission for painting the Last Judgement in Vladimir. While in Vladimir, a twin of the Prince cuts a deal with the Tatar and Mongolian hordes and the town is ransacked. While saving a \"holy fool\" from rape and/or murder, he is forced to kill and decides to take a vow of silence to repent for his sin, and with it, cease his work. It is only after witnessing far later a young teenager cast a bell for the new Prince, lying that his father passed the secret of bell-making down to him, and succeeding only with faith and personal resourcefulness, does Rublyov break his vow and decide to continue painting icons, the bell's first rings seemingly a sign from God.\n\nBut the film is not really about Andrei Rublyov - for much of it he is only an observer. Tarkovskiy's film is a grand portrait of Medieval Russia and explores a great many things. Orthodox Christianity plays a large role in the film, as well as paganism and the seemingly amoral secular nobility who vie for power. There is a great deal of violence and suffering in the film and it is surprisingly violent for a Soviet film in its depictions of torture, murder and animal cruelty - but life in medieval, pre-Tsar Russia was cruel.\n\nThere is much realism and authenticity in the world shown on screen, but with it too there is shown a beauty that Tarkovskiy is always so adapt at bringing forth, if not personally creating. The violence is never without its counterparts, but there is also never a complete peace.\n\nRublyov is a man of great humility and love, who struggles to show God in his paintings rather than just paint people in scenes. When he is tasked with creating the Last Judgement, he ultimately refuses for he can not bear to scare the parishioners with the sights of Hell and Satan. Theophanes debates him on this at one point, arguing that men are ignorant, stupid and wicked and they need fear to keep them on the path of purity and faith. Creative forces indeed takes many forms in this film. His friend and colleague Kirill is plagued by greed and envy and Rublyov's skill tests Kirill's faith. Another artist leaves Rublyov's group when he sees that no work is being done on the Last Judgement, and goes off to persue his own commissions, get paid for them, and serve God no matter the subject matter. \n\nThough Rublyov saves a mute girl from rape by killing a Russian in the horde, she eventually joins the Tatars and becomes their leader's eighth wife. Though he condemns a pack of pagans for their un-Christian worship, it is a pagan who sets him free and attempts to seduce him with \"beastial love\". All through the film there is anger and cruelty paired with love and redemption and the film's final message is one of hope. In all things there is good and evil and from this comes ambiguity, but also the oneness of all things - the omnipresence of God. You do not have to be Orthodox, or a Christian, or religious at all to appreciate this film. At over 3 hours, it is quite daunting, but it is an experience no one should forgo.",
