    "summary": "In Berlin in 1931, American cabaret singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) meets British academic Brian Roberts (Michael York), who is finishing his university studies. Despite Brian's confusion over his sexuality, the pair become lovers, but the arrival of the wealthy and decadent playboy Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) complicates matters for them both. This love triangle plays out against the rise of the Nazi party and the collapse of the Weimar Republic.",

All of the confusion in this society is juxtaposed with Isherwood's own sexual confusion; and how this plays out with his odd, on/again off/again relationship with Cabaret nightclub singer Sally Bowles.  Liza Minelli's performance is here is legendary; as is the Kander/Ebb score.  Highly recommended.",

Characters don't break out in song in mid-dialog; the musical numbers occur where they would in real life - on a stage that's part of the story, not THE story.  Apart from the title song, I can't think of any other number here that's become a \"standard\" in the past half century.  I didn't hate it but I didn't love it, either.  Yes, it launched Liza's career and it broke some old Hollywood taboos, but it wasn't All That and a Bag of Chips.  So, it's a \"Meh..it passed the time\" and I can scratch this \"classic\" off the cinematic bucket list.",

Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an outwardly ambitious but inwardly insecure performer at Berlin's Kit Kat Klub.  The film is set in 1931 at the onset of the Nazi movement, a stark contrast to the hedonistic entertainment provided in the burlesque theater.  The film also has great performances from Marisa Berenson, Joel Grey and Michael York, as well as some fantastic musical numbers. The only downside is the sporadically inconsistent editing, many scenes consisting of needless quick cuts that disrupt the flow of the film.  Otherwise, it a great film that needs to be seen.",

She is the reason this film is a All Time Classic Musical & All Time Greatest in general. She takes the solid acting and makes it phenomenal overall. The songs are the second highlight of this film there all memorable, never forgettable, and always tie in to what is happening. The Cinematography is excellent and changes from low key during story scenes and becomes very dynamic in the songs and it never feels out of place. The editing is also extremely well done also smoothly moving between song and story and vice versa. The only issue I had with this was the story while very interesting felt like it was underwhelming and I would have like to have seen the Nazis take a bigger focus although I get why it was done that way and it feels like it can lose focus sometimes in the middle and slow the otherwise well done pacing.

            "content": "Having seen this only on the small screen, this is my first cinematic experience of Bob Fosse's 8-times Oscar-winning musical film, including his Best Director win, which only lost out for Best Picture because another iconic classic, The Godfather, pipped it to the post five decades ago. Mono soundtrack aside, this is absolutely glorious and magical and after 2hrs in the wonderful company of Liza Minnelli's star-making turn as the brittle survivor Sally Bowles, Michael York's understating performance as the vulnerable but knowing Brian Roberts and Joel Grey's sexually liberating Masters of Ceremonies, my overwhelming reaction is how incredibly well this film has aged. Based on Christopher Isherwood's stories (note: plural), which were inspired by his own personal experience in Berlin before the WWII, Jay Presson Allen's episodic screenplay (where arguably side/supporting characters vanish and reappear as and when needed as its focus remains firmly fixated on the main couple), is primarily a love story between two champagne-swilling, pleasure-orientated characters living in the peripheral of society against the background of Germany's then political upheaval and the rise of Nazism. It's therefore a film of contrast and juxtaposition, as quick snapshot-like edits insinuate meaningfully while Kander and Ebb's songs are tightly interwoven into the fabric of its narrative to comment or foreshadow what's happening on-screen. Fosse's execution still feels entirely contemporary watching it now, and the film has lost none of its charms – stupendous performances and choreography blend harmoniously into each other while the melodically infectious songs have now attained classical status; or impact – 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' remains an eerily prescient and relevant warning and never have three little words like 'so do I' possess such power and significance as they did here. The definition of something which has stood the test of time.",

            "content": "A glorious and delightful musical for the ages.\n\nIconic director Bob Fosse's magical direction for his romantic musical Cabaret (1972) is resplendent in his elegant grandeur and peerless visual prowess. Fosse's dance choreography alone is some of the most versatile and creative steps ever laid down for a musical, let alone his perceptive direction that subtly depicts the free love of old Germany pre-World War II with a playful heart. Fosse's direction is loving and sincerely cares about these outrageous characters. Fosse delivers dazzling dance choreography, nuanced direction, passionate romance, subtle storytelling, salacious material, hilarious jokes, biting satire of Germany's burgeoning fascist Nazi regime, and cute character quirks. No wonder Bob Fosse instantly became a beloved director after Cabaret! I've never seen anything quite like Cabaret.\n\nWriters Jay Presson Allen, John Van Druten, and Joe Masteroff came up with simply wonderful jokes that are edgy, fresh, progressive, and delirious fun. The touching story has raw character drama that's genuinely emotional as well as hilarious absurdist humor all over Cabaret. Combining Cabaret the play with a book into a viscerally delightful musical film is quite brilliant. You can see some influence from Marlene Dietrich's Morocco and Blue Angel to stories like The Great Gatsby in Cabaret. Yet, Cabaret's influence goes on to inspire The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Showgirls, Chicago, Burlesque, Madonna, Lady Gaga, countless others. It's avant-garde in the best ways with a fresh perspective on old values and new complex feelings.\n\nLiza Minnelli is adorable, sultry, funny, charming, and dazzling in Cabaret. Her lead actress role gives funny comedy, moving dramatic acting, fierce singing, and daring dancing. Her turn as the  erratic and erotic Sally Bowles is an iconic femme fatale on her own terms. She flirts, jokes, and parties her way into your heart. She looks like she's having so much fun compared to Martin Scorsese's dour and depressing New York, New York. Cabaret is simply Liza Minnelli's shining starlet moment. She is perfect.\n\nMichael York plays stuffy English gentleman Brian Roberts with a bisexual twist that's shocking and fun to watch. His romantic chemistry with Liza is out of this world. Joel Grey's Master of Ceremonies at The Cabaret is hilarious. His every line and dance move is a raunchy riot! Fritz Wepper's German gigolo Fritz Wendel with a need for a rich wife is so hilarious and likable. He's as great as Michael York in my opinion. Marisa Berenson is lovely and charming as Jewish heiress Natalia Landauer. Helmut Griem's curious Baron Maximilian von Heune is a sizzling delight on his own.\n\nDavid Bretherton's editing is brilliant as he juxtaposes the cruelty of the Nazis with sudden tongue in cheek musical numbers. Cabaret is a full 124 and yet it feels like a fast 30 because it never stops moving.\n\nGeoffrey Unsworth's gorgeous cinematography uses lights behind Liza to create a silhouette and has characters surrounded by shadows or reflected in mirrors. Every shot feels beautiful and creative with a visual brilliance just as impressive as the acting and musical performances. Hans Jürgen Kiebach's art direction is dazzling with recreations of 1930's Berlin, Germany right before World War II. I love the graffiti on the walls and shady brick buildings everywhere. It feels moody with stellar production design that does not feel too stagey with eerie lights cascading down on everyone.\n\nComposer John Kander's boisterous music is both lovely and playful with plenty of lively energy and variations. I love the cute songwriting from the Broadway musical that is given a new life that will last forever with cute and clever lyrics alongside Kander's vivid musical imagination. Cabaret has some of the greatest musical songs ever, in all honesty. Charlotte Flemming's burlesque costumes are sexy and playful with a whimsical nature besides being provocative. You can see where The Rocky Horror Picture Show got their lingerie for Tim Curry from besides actual nightclub acts.\n\nIn conclusion, Cabaret is a brilliantly crafted picture and exhilarating musical that will always feel timeless.",

Also for a musical, I really can't see myself revisiting any of the songs in this movie, but it also might be because it's not really my type of music.

The film is an artistic classic with its imagery and depictions of the rise of fascism in 1931 Germany alongside the gritty bohemian life at the Kit Kat Club. Gender, sexuality, and flamboyance are explored at the cabaret even in this 70s version in a way that is both subtle and bold all at once.",

            "content": "Whilst the multitude of films, documentaries and dramas on Bob Fosse are all great, there's nothing quite like watching the actual product to see what all the fuss is about. 1931, the end of the roaring 20s, the last gasps of Weimar and the creative outpouring that springs from human beings making sense of a world of mechanised death and pandemic. It's a tipping point moment and Fosse colours the piece with brownshirts, swasticas, clean cut Arian youth to whom the future belongs and the communist symbolism of other simple solutions to complex problems. It's the foreboding of oncoming Naziism that dominates, with the growing unease of the Jews whose purgatory is beautifully written in the relationship of Natalia and Fritz whose wealth and Protestant masks won't spare them and the oncoming sanctimonious violence shown in the mirror images of the beaten doorman and executed dog lying dead as a symbol of a passing better age. The character of Baron Maximilian von Heune is fully realised and gives the tragic tell of 1933; great fun, champagne swilling, bisexual up for everything chap of the absolute Prussian blue blood who doesn't understand that his class' birth and power isn't a match for the Nazi zeitgeist, who won't just accept a few minor government positions and do their bidding versus the communists. \nIt's the essence of cabaret itself that things are not what they seem. The supposedly pure are evil, the degenerates warm, the powerful weak and the weak strong. It's told through the eyes of Brian who doesn't understand anything about Berlin but discovers these things through the journey. We know it ends as badly as anything can but that doesn't negate the positivity in the people and construct at the centre of the drama, and as we come out of lockdown, remember:\nWhat good is sitting alone In your room?\nCome hear the music play.\nLife is a Cabaret, old chum,\nCome to the Cabaret.",

            "content": "Cabaret follows parallel stories, as the freewheeling Sally Bowles finds her exciting, spontaneous lifestyle gradually slipping away amid internal conflict in much the same way that the bustling life of Weimar-era Germany sees itself slowly poisoned by hate and anti-Semitic propaganda. Minnelli brings to life a wonderfully conflicted character whose story is compelling in its treatment of women both for its target setting and its year of release. That said, the secondary romantic subplot in which a Jewish man passing as Protestant woos a wealthy Jewish heiress feels almost childishly simplistic by comparison to the undercurrents of rising fascism and the relationship between Minneli's Bowles and the two members of her love triangle; it's seldom touched on and never explored sufficiently. The film contrasts a stunning vibrancy in its musical performances (brought to life chiefly by an immensely watchable performance from Grey, who was rewarded with an Oscar for his effort) with a stark cruelty from initially brief moments that gradually grow in intensity, until even Grey's charismatic Master of Ceremonies finds himself infected despite \"leaving his troubles at the door\". Apart from the roots on the stage, it's strange to characterize the film as a musical; Cabaret is a straightfroward drama in which music is a crucial element, but does not feature in the manner of typical musical theatre. I love the characterization of the cabaret itself, with theatre depicted as a sort of eternal presence and a reflection of humanity; intensely fluid, radically subject to changes in tastes, and far from infallible.

Unwittingly, perhaps, this echo gives voice to a symbolic symbiosis and ideological continuum between, on the one hand, parties in the sense of social gatherings for personal ends and parties in the sense of social organizations for political ends, on the other. Elsewhere in the film, with rapid edits intercutting between the stage and the street, Fosse illustrates the relationship of bodily violence—how else to describe the contortions of the dancers?—gaudy decadence, and exuberant obscenity that connects the two parties, the entertaining and the institutional. \n\nThe implication is the overbearing, overdetermined tautology that «the party is the party», exalted to the extent that either is exclusive, the vulgarism of the one undergirding the civic acceptability of the other, like a jester to a king (or an effete emcee to a chauvinist führer). In contrast to the puritanism of America (where the film was originally rated X on account of its frank queer themes), nowhere is this coincidence of seeming opposites clearer than with the Nazis, the vulgarity of the Volk matched only by the rigidity of the Reich. The movie stages the inherent ideological contradiction in perhaps its most famous and effective scene, as an idyllic country air sung by a handsome Hitlerjunge slowly yet effortlessly and practically organically transforms into a raucous military march—showing how, in its own perverse way, the party swings both ways.",

The dancing, the showmanship, the performances, the depiction of a once carefree and bohemian city slowly sliding into an era of oppression and brutality. Liza Minelli is the acting standout, capable of both infectious wonderment and a powerful lust for life, while also capturing the characters lowest moments with absolute sincerity. Joel Grey is also excellent, giving us some of the biggest and brightest facial expressions ever caught on film, and represents many of the jolliest scenes in the film. It takes a likeable love story, turns it into a love triangle, and frames all of it against a backdrop of escalating tension and racial prejudice. The film slows down considerably when it gets into the 2nd half, and its feels like many important scenes have been cut out, meaning plot threads, such as the aforementioned love triangle, end with little to no resolution. The same is true of the editing, with numerous scenes cutting away like the editor chopped the film at the wrong place. But these issues aside, Cabaret is still a film I'd recommend to anyone interested in musicals or the time period. It's fun, brilliantly acted and made with obvious passion.

            "content": "\"SCREW MAXIMILIAN!\"\n\n\"...... I do.\"\n\n\"..... so do I.\"\n\nIt's early 1930s Berlin as the Nazis begin to take over Germany as American Kit Kat Club cabaret singer Sally Bowles meets a lodger, an English language teacher, that will be staying in the same building as her. She falls in love with him but soon discovers he's gay.... and eventually finds out he's bisexual.\n\nThis is quite a movie. Almost TOO much to handle in one sitting it's so different. It's such a jarring movie to watch that I got confused at certain points and it's all because of it's killer style.\n\nAnd the style of this musical is.... it's not exactly a musical. Bob Fosse and company took out all the \"book songs\", the songs where characters sing to EACH OTHER and only left in the songs sung in the actual Kit Kat Club. So what this means is all of the musical numbers are 100% diegetic. Nobody breaks into the song in the middle of a dialog scene, the dialog scenes are dialog scenes. Michael York who plays Brian... doesn't sing a note in the movie. The only characters who do sing are played by Liza Minelli and Joel Grey and they only sing in the Kit Kat Club.\n\nSo basically this is a musical for people who hate musicals. And that's really what it was in 1972. Movie audiences hated musicals by the time they got out of the 60s. Movies were about realism and not escapism anymore. Which is weird when you think about it. In the 50s movies were all about escapism and yet times were good. Times got bad in the 60s and 70s and audiences don't want to escape anymore.... doesn't exactly make sense to me but it's what happened.\n\nAnd so Bob Fosse made a musical that HAS loads of lavish Broadway-style musical numbers and yet it comes off as a totally realistic movie. And THAT would probably be why he won the Oscar for Best Director for this movie among other reasons. And while I would have voted for Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather that year... I understand the voters' decisions.\n\nLiza Minelli is incredible in this. She has a dual role essentially. She has this dramatic side of Sally, the dialog scenes, this love triangle she's in with a German aristocrat and Brian.... but she also has to have the musical side as the cabaret singer... and she does both brilliantly. And of course that's why SHE won an Oscar for this movie. It's great watching Wizard of Oz for the first time with Judy Garland and then seeing her daughter in another iconic musical with Cabaret. They're both amazing performers.\n\nJoel Grey won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for playing the Emcee of the Kit Kat Club and... beat out all 3 nominees from The Godfather... he beat Sonny! And of course I wouldn't have voted for him in place of someone from The Godfather... but he was pretty damn good. Unlike Sally we never see this guy OUT of this club so he's always in musical mode. And his character singing these songs is such a great contrast to the dramatic side of the movie. You have these moments where the songs reflect the times in the story and it's this genius moment where the Nazism on one side of the movie comes together with the lavish musical side and it adds up to something pretty wicked.\n\nLike this bit where we have the girls of the Kit Kat club doing this number in lingerie... and suddenly we see the Emcee is in drag among them. And they're wearing this bowler hats and towards the end of the number they all bend the edges of the hats and they look like that Nazi style helmet and they all start goosestepping across the stage. That's something you don't see in every musical.\n\nAll of the songs by Kander and Ebb are great, it's tough to get Mein Herr out of my head after this movie.\n\n\nThere's one song, maybe Kander and Ebb did it I'm not sure.  But we have this scene like a picnic in the German countryside.  And this guy starts singing what seems like a sweet song about youth and how tomorrow belongs to him.... and we pan down and we see his has a brown shirt and a swastika.  And then the people start singing along.  And it's clear this isn't a sweet song, this is a song about the Nazis trying to take over the world.  Now that was a brilliant and disturbing scene. \n\nAnd the movie ends with this note that while the story's over... I mean... it's the early days of Nazi Germany so... the world is about to hit a cataclysm. Again... not the note you expect a movie musical to end on.\n\nBob Fosse trying to make a musical for an edgier 1970s movie audience ended up succeeding admirably. That style where all of the songs are given a cinematic context that doesn't come off as phony is a style I wish EVERY musical found a way to use. The LACK of this kind of edge is why I thought Oliver! sucked ass most of the time. It's why Chicago is a personal favorite of mine. Totally using the Fosse cinematic language, in that movie the musical scenes are done as fantasy/dream scenes, which are brilliantly done.\n\nLike I said it's a lot to take in in one sitting but Cabaret is a hell of a movie.",

She was completely miscast, and Liza did Liza, not Sally Bowles.  Watching her try to act in this movie is painful.  Sure, she sings the songs fine, but it's as if she didn't read the script or get the depth of this story.  She doesn't serve the story or the character in the least bit.  The musical number \"Cabaret\" was the worst part.  Sally sees her entire world crumbling around her, and there's Liza, dancing and singing like she doesn't have a care in the world, and mugging it for the audience...ughhh.  Sally needs to have more depth than a 24 year old Liza Minelli did.

            "content": "When a respected film critic like Peter Bradshaw calls this film the greatest musical of all time I go into seeing it with high expectations and that was why I was so disappointed when a found a film devoid of pleasures. I was also aware of Liza Minnelli via the great reputation of her in this role as phrases like ‘iconic' were thrown around willy nilly when discussing her. I found her to be a bad actress in this role as she lacked the ability to transfix me when she wasn't singing and appeared to be playing a version of herself while her singing and dancing was underwhelming. This is not one of the greatest musical films of all time as Singin' in the Rain (1952), One from the Heart (1981) and The Blues Brothers (1980).\n\nThe film concerns the lives of young British student Brian Roberts, Michael York, who moves to the Weimar Club in 1931 and becomes friends with nightclub performer Sally Bowles, Liza Minnelli. Their friends, gigolo Fritz Wendel, Fritz Wepper, and wealthy Jewish woman Maria Landauer, Marisa Berenson, fall in love but are held back by his questionable motives in marrying her and the fact that she is Jewish. We see Bowles go through highs and lows as she performs at the Kit Kat Club and delights audiences but in her personal life goes through ups and downs and eventually has an abortion after an affair ends. The Nazis sweep the area as anti-Jewish sentiment increases and Bowles and Roberts lose their innocence.\n\nThis is one of those films where you are meant to be utterly charmed by the quirky, infantile female lead who immediately enchants our male lead, usually a moody writer, only to participate in a lifestyle of hedonism before his eyes. Unfortunately I was not charmed by this film's lead as she seemed frustratingly empty and lacking in wit and intelligence for a woman who supposedly attracts the attention of all of the men she meets. Minnelli does not have the bright screen presence of a Julie Andrews or a Debbie Reynolds and struggles to make us feel anything but annoyance for her character as her face seems constantly over expressive and she doesn't have the singing or dancing ability to bring this wispy character to life. I am also shocked that Minnelli managed to win the Academy Award for Best Actress when up against Liv Ullmann in The Emigrants (1972) who would have been the deserving winner in 1972. She is surrounded by a cast who have even less presence than she does as York is utterly unconvincing as the lead character, Berenson is best when she is standing still and looking like a portrait subject as in Barry Lyndon (1975) and I don't understand any of the love for Joel Grey.\n\nThe film as a musical also doesn't really fill it's requirements as while it contains 12 songs I don't remember any of them having just watched this film and all of the songs performed on the stage blended together. As stated before Minnelli's voice is not particularly appealing as she doesn't inject any of these songs with any of the passion and fire necessary to make them exciting. I felt as though I could have seen these performances on any street corner featuring mediocre buskers. I have been told that the point is that Bowles is a bad singer but if that's the whole point then I would have liked one scene to set this up and then I would have liked to see an actress who can actually play a character add depth to this person beyond her bad singing. When I watch a musical I want the songs and the performances of them to impress me and have me remember the songs after I have finished watching the film, this movie did not achieve this and therefore I see it as having failed in it's ambitions.\n\nIt is clear by this point that I would not recommend this film and I am shocked by it's fantastic reputation when it is such an empty production that is charmless in how it goes about telling it's dull story. This should not be considered a classic film.",

The death of the Hollywood musical - profoundly political and humanistically tragic but made quirky and fun by chorographical genius Bob Fosse.\n\nIn 1972, the death of the glamorous musical occurred. Bob Fosse's Cabaret became a mainstream hit, and people realized that singing in public (in a world that was becoming morally complicated) just doesn't happen very often. So Fosse did the unthinkable and trapped one of the best collection of songs ever written (By Kander and Ebb) inside a cabaret club in Germany, where the Nazi ideology was slowly but surely arising. It's hard to choose a musical number in Cabaret that isn't madly catchy, perverted and fun, but the most powerful moments in the film come from songs that deftly mix tragedy and comedy. Liza Minnelli's final \"Cabaret\" song is desperately sung in such a way that suggests she is putting on a smile for the show while her heart breaks in secret. The fact that she sings about Chelsea (the same place her mother Judy Garland died) is just fundamentally wrong (I think it shows in Liza's fish-eyed gaze) but helps Liza to nail the song perfectly. However, the best moment in the film is unquestionably Tomorrow Belongs to Me. If you have ever been put on the spot to express some form of patriotism but hesitated, then you can relate to this moment. The scene is so beautifully shot and the song is so beautiful, you wouldn't think it's a Nazi call to action at first. The sad fact is that the Nazis wrote pretty songs like we do, and had political campaigns like we do. I wonder how many of you would have stood up for the song out of respect or because of peer pressure if it was your country? With these sorts of themes, it's no wonder that Bob Fosse's Cabaret killed the American Musical. One of the few songs in Cabaret (the play, not the musical) that wasn't endlessly depressing I actually used in my wedding. No, it wasn't Two Ladies. It was \"Married\", a clowny song that suggests life isn't that bad and marriage isn't that scary. \"For you wake one day, look around and say, somebody wonderful married me.\"\n\nWhat I Learned: Taught me that singing and dancing is a tragedy; that we find our own reasons to be happy. We entertain ourselves amid terror, tragedy, and our own kind that we can never trust. Helped me to understand how gullible people really are. Also, had the song \"Marriage\", which my mother sang at my wedding.",

Their interactions seem rather cold, though, as if they didn't even like each other all that much. There could be more going on that I didn't see, and it might be obvious if I watched the movie again sometime.\n\nThe odd thing about this film is the addition of the B-story. I can't figure out why this separate romance between the Jewish couple was even in the movie. It seemed as if they were simply there as a reminder of where and when these events take place. \"See that persecuted Jew? That's because the Nazis are starting to take control.\" Those scenes weren't bad, just irrelevant.\n\nIn fact, throughout the film it felt like they couldn't decide how much they wanted to reference the Nazi threat. At times it almost fades into the background but later it would seriously impact the stars of the movie. I don't know if I wanted it to be more important or less, or maybe it was perfect as it was presented. As you can see I'm still puzzled by Cabaret and have conflicted feelings about it.

It's a musical without the sticky sweet dispositions of its sentimental peers.  Without its superior soundtrack, it would, nonetheless, remain to be a tragic period drama of the highest quality - it's an astute piece of work whose puncturing storyline, whose soul-baring lead performance, arguably blur out its swankiest elements.  It's the first musical I've ever seen (besides that 1979 Earth-shaker) in which the characters don't seem to be performing in stagey spectacles because they enjoy it, because they want to entertain us.  They're performing to survive.  The show will, at some point, stop.  But for now, it must go on, or else their realities might really sink into their psyches and destroy them.\n\t\"Cabaret's\" subversion of musical givens is the thing that has made it so much a part of the public conscious.  Though we might envision Liza Minnelli's Sally Bowles, fitted with a top hat and cheap black lingerie, before we think of its downer of a plot, and though we tend to gravitate toward the grand finale rendition of its titular song instead of reliving its devastating social commentary, it doesn't so much feel like a musical as it does a darkened masterwork that just so happens to feature a hell of a lot of music.\n\tIt's an unparalleled experience that marked for the comeback of Fosse, a cherished theatrical director whose \"Sweet Charity\" (1969) bombed at the box-office, and it's the film that solidified Minnelli's rep as a star that could live up to the expectations set by her extraordinary mother.  \n\t\"Cabaret\" is set in 1931 Berlin, where decadence runs amok, where sexuality is fluid, and where the misanthropic Nazi party is slowly gaining momentum.  Considerable time is spent in the Kit Kat Klub, a hip local joint that utilizes aspiring talent as a way to divert tourists and passersby.  \n\tWith its many shows hosted by an unnamed but endlessly boisterous emcee (Joel Grey), the brightest aspect of the club is Sally Bowles, a bubbly American singer who dreams of someday making it as an actress.  With magnificent stage presence and a sometimes intimidatingly unfiltered personality, she seems destined to become a star - but a young woman living in such a cruel world doesn't always have it so easy, which is why the inclusion of two men, who don't quite understand her, could lead to her downfall.\n\tOne of them is Brian Roberts (Michael York), an intellectual Brit in the process of earning his doctorate.  The other is Maximillian von Heune (Helmut Griem), a charming baron.  Sally and Brian meet through his moving into her boarding house; Max insinuates himself into her social circle and sweeps her off her feet through material seduction.\n\tA love triangle is the last thing Sally needs in her already torrid life, especially one in which the men interested in her might also be interested in each other.  Of the two, though, we prefer Brian, who is sharp, a little selfish and a little sad, but is nevertheless considerate of Sally and her stability.  A conventional conclusion appears to await them, despite his sexual ambiguities.  But an explosive setback, paired with the rising Nazism in Germany, only leaves personal land mines in their paths.\n\tAnd while tragedy is generally not so welcome in a genre that prides itself in its ability to make its viewers feel good, it seems just about right in \"Cabaret.\"  As it unfolds, introducing itself as a showy romp only to shift gears toward three-hankie misfortune, we find ourselves in the presence of a film with a lot more in mind than mere engrossment.  It's a musical that possesses performers that continue to act as they sing and dance - behind their smiles, we can still see the effects of the messy personal live of their characters.  It's a historical piece wise enough to avoid overtly recreating the horrors of its time, characterizing menace and hate with gradual subtlety that shakes us in the way it builds until it becomes distinctly unavoidable. \n\t\"Cabaret\" never forgets its period setting - it likes its style and its costumery, but it doesn't skimp on atrocity, either - and it never takes the abilities of its ensemble for granted.  Minnelli, delivering an iconic performance, captures the spirit of Sally with such persuasion that she doesn't much seem to be a fictional character.  She could also just be well-written (Jay Allen's screenplay is, after all, masterful), but Minnelli is so good that we are never able to see Sally as anything but a vulnerable figure.  Her loud mouth and her infectious swagger are all a part of a front in need of maintaining.  Breaking it would be cataclysmic.\n\tTerrific, too, is Grey, who won and Oscar for his performance and who is not much more than an embodied narrator.  Starring in some of the film's best musical moments, he's pivotal in defining the movie's ascending feeling that, no matter how well one entertains, societal evil is not something that can easily be stopped.  York is understated as a love interest whose eloquence loses its flash as his own doubts radiate; Griem is damaging as a playboy so self-involved that he can hardly tell that his actions do, as a matter of fact, have ramifications.\n\tBut Fosse's direction is \"Cabaret's\" finest component.  To make a movie as aesthetically complicated as this one seem seamless takes incredible dedication and perception.  His fostering of cocksure song-and-dance sequences (\"Maybe This Time\" and \"Money, Money\" are highlights) and his determination to portray genuinely effectual scenes (the chilling performance of \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" will never lose its malevolence, and Sally and Brian's break-up is an outstanding showcase of acting) make \"Cabaret\" so much more than your typical musical - it's often been recognized as being the \"last great\" one (whatever that really means), and it more likely has to do with the way it emotionally moves us than it does with its music.  \t\n\tComparing its artistic characteristics, though, is not completely necessary in distinguishing \"Cabaret\" as the masterpiece that it is.  It's a tour-de-force, a marrying of varying types of performative perfection.  Its freshness is still unprecedented.  Maybe it is the last great musical, but only because so few are able to top it.  We've had some good ones since.  But none have matched in their poignancy, their power.",

The film strikes a masterful balance between in-your-face frivolity and sensual subtlety, but it's power lies in the looming sense of despair that hangs over its tragi-comic characters.\nLiza Minnelli is marmite in the movie world, and admittedly an irritating screen presence, but that's precisely what makes her so perfect to play Sally Bowles. Minelli's squeaky sexuality and Michael York's crippling conservatism culminate in a hot and cold double act to die for; one that always leaves us wanting more.\nThe plot is an amalgamation of Broadway musicals, novels and plays, but Fosse makes the movie his own through sharp edits and anti-theatrical stylistics. Visually, narratively and symbolically speaking, Cabaret is cinematic gold: a tinderbox of enduring images and endearing characters.",

            "content": "It is very important to note that Bob Fosse's 1973 masterpiece is in no way a traditional musical. Push the Broadway play to the side. This is Film Art at it's finest. \n\nInspired by Christopher Isherwood's 1945 semi-autobiographical book, \"The Berlin Stories\" a very successful Broadway play was created. But in the early 1970's when Fosse decided to translate it to film --- he approached it all from a dramatically different way. With the writing skills of Jay Presson Allen secured, the Broadway Musical became more of a Film With Music. Fosse was most definitely concerned with the female lead character, \"Sally Bowles\" and her steadfast rebellious notion of \"Divine Decadence\" -- but with film he could take the \"metaphorical\" to a more literal exploration of Berlin as it was slipping toward the unspeakable horrors of Nazism and The Third Reich. With Geoffrey Unsworth serving as Cinematographer the film seamlessly slides from what we see being presented on the stage of the seedy Kit Kat club to the quickly approaching realities outside its doors. Fosse captures a culture which is at once \"progressive\" as it is \"unaware.\" \n\nMichael York is \"Brian\" who serves as a fictional idea of writer Christopher Isherwood. Newly arrived to Berlin, he is eager to explore what he perceives as more free culture. As curious as he is, he is not quite ready to accept his own sexuality. The complexities of sexuality and love are as core to this film as are the catastrophic doom that most seem to view as a temporary reactionary group of nuts. The very real threat of Fascism and its consequences are ignored. The main characters of Cabaret are too distracted by their carnal desires and reverie to be bothered. \n\nFilm Culture has forgotten that Liza Minnelli was once a respected artist. She did it all: Actor, Singer and a very accomplished dancer. Sadly, her privately struggles have taken over the way she is now viewed. There are very few moments when an actor is this perfectly matched in her role. Liza Minnelli gives a truly amazing performance. It is an erotically-fueled study in self-absorption merged into self-loathing. It seems as if \"Sally\" is always in audition mode. She is a tragic and heartbreaking character. And Minnelli literally \"becomes\" this character for the entirety of the movie. Equally impressive is Joel Grey who manages to not only serve as \"our\" master of ceremonies but creepy monster who is all too eager to lead us into darkness as much as to the technicolor musical numbers on the stage. Both would receive Oscars for their performances. \n\nIt is also interesting to note that this was the year of The Godfather. While it won best film --- best director honor was given to Bob Fosse. It with hindsight that we realize that this was one of those rare moments the Academy Awards got it right. Godfather was the stronger film, but what Bob Fosse was able to achieve in Cabaret is far more challenging and important. If you've never seen it, you need to. This is an essential film.",

            "content": "This film may look like it is just a lot of fun, and it is, but there is also a very dark undertone to it all and the longer the film goes on, the more it corrupts. 'Cabaret' is a mesmerising film that is truly an experience. \n\nThe way this film starts is very smart and it very easily draws you into its world, the songs are all memorable and are excellently choreographed, but of course they are as this is Bob Fosse we're talking about, they also come fully alive and jump out of the screen. The film is funny but in a rather cynical sense, and the characters are well written and smartly developed, the acting is also fantastic. Joel Grey might seem like he isn't in it enough but he makes his presence known and really stands out; and once more, the male actor from a stage production is in the film adaptation and wins an Oscar with the female lead not even being in the film adaptation but at least this time the female lead won as well! I felt like she wasn't in the film enough and that she didn't really have enough musical numbers but in those numbers she, like Grey, make their presence known. And, hey, Maggie Smith won the previous time Minnelli was nominated and now it's the opposite, funny how it all works out like that. \n\nI never have any expectations when I watch a film but when I saw promotional images of the film I did think it was going to be a balls to the wall, rush of a film where you feel, the good kind of, exhausted by the end of it, the kind of feeling found in 'Moulin Rouge!'. I thought it'd stick two fingers up at the establishment or 'the man' as it were, but, in its own subtle way, it kind of does, given the smart themes it tackles. Also, when I first read the synopsis I thought this would be a club that was oppresses by the Nazi's and they would have to secretly work their way of it behind the scenes. \n\nI am a little surprised in the direction this film went though, if someone were to show me a screenshot of an hour into this film I'd be surprised at where our characters end up. I understand the point of those scenes as it reveals some key details, even if it looked like poor Brian was a third wheel from just what we are shown, it just ultimately felt like those scenes could have executed another way as it seems like they're pointless after they are over and how that character exits. The side characters were a nice addition and help compliment the theme as well but I just didn't feel like it was all that necessary either, considering how fast that story wraps up. \n\nThe film ends the way it began and it leaves us rather suddenly on an ominous and sad note. It goes quiet all of a sudden and it's very effective, I found myself just watching the silent credits and taking in what just happened and how truly depressing it is to know what will happen next. I was thinking the ending was going to be rather sudden with everyone getting killed or something, but the smart and subtle way this carries its story and perfect ending, it does it fantastically. \n\nThis might sound negative but that's honestly because I loved everything else and simply can't say anything more than that, this is a groundbreaking, hugely influential and dark film. It's funny how this and 'The Godfather', two films seemingly on totally opposite ends of the spectrum, went up against one another at the 45th Academy Awards. I remember reading a review of this film saying that 'The Godfather' had already won Best Picture, as well as its other two wins, before it was even made, and while I love that film and the next two parts, from the outside looking it, it does look kind of strange for this to win as much as it did and not the highest honour as well as its Writing nomination, it's still a rarity now. Still, 1972/3 were good years for Fosse as he had won quite a number of awards all across the board. Bob Fosse knew exactly what to do and he has made an excellent film, he probably isn't appreciated as much as he should be, but everyone knows his works even if they don't know his name. Like the rest of Fosse's work, this film is indeed hugely influential as the musicals of 2001/2 that helped revitalise the genre feel hugely inspired by this; even if by that point, some of the unique things about this had become clichés at that point, but still this is a classic for a good reason.",

The acting is really good. Liza Minelli and Michael York are both brilliant. The rest of the acting is really good, it's the best part of the movie. The direction is rather good, the dancing scenes are all really good. The editing and cinematography is really good. The scene where the man is beaten in the street, intercut with a dancing scene is fantastically edited. Unfortunately I have quite a few problems. Liza Minelli while she did give a really good performance her character was so unlikeable, she was really rude and just didn't shut up, she also SPOILER ALERT gets pregnant and it's unsure wether her boyfriend got her pregnant or if it was a one night stand, that just annoys me as she is very unfaithful and just down right annoying. The main two male leads however were really good and made the scenes with Liza bearable. This film unfortunately is actually quite boring. There's this big portion to do with love that is just so dull and uninteresting. There's also this really creepy man who is part of the dancing who looks like pee wee Herman that is so creepy. However all the nazi stuff is handled brilliantly. There's one fantastic scene to do with a Hitler Youth singing that is just brilliant Overall this is a decent film with fantastic aspects about it. See it if you want but in my opinion it is no masterpiece. B",

            "content": "I just had the privilege of seeing this in authentic film projection at the Cinéma Odyssée here in Strasbourg (first time I've been to that cinema), and man was it a unique experience. They show a lot of other classic films, so I'll definitely be going back there many times in the future.\n\n\"Cabaret\" looks great, with some of the best lighting effects I've seen in a film. The Oscar-winning cinematography is astounding, with intimate close-up shots and epic wide shots framed underneath the performers at the Kit Kat Klub to give them a sense of grandiosity. No wonder this film's cinematographer was Geoffrey Unsworth, the guy who shot \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\n\nMy favorite technical aspect of \"Cabaret\" is the editing, with an assault of fast cuts during the musical numbers to show the expressions on people's faces in the crowd as well as the entertaining and somewhat scary faces that the emcee (Joel Grey) pulls. On pure speed and energy alone, it's the most impressively edited film I've seen since \"Whiplash\".\n\nIts best scenes are certainly the dance numbers at the Kit Kat Klub, in which the emcee and the film's main character Sally (Liza Minnelli) perform weird and wonderful ditties set to annoyingly catchy music. Both won Oscars for their performances; Minnelli absolutely deserved it and I can see the love for Grey too.\n\nThe actual story has very little to with the Klub, though the musical numbers are loosely linked to the story's themes. The movie, like the stage play it's based on, is set in Germany in the 1930s, on the eve of the rise of the Nazis.\n\nCentral character Sally is a dancer at the Klub who aspires to be an actress, who falls in love with Brian (Michael York), a professor staying in the same building as her. She teaches the stiff Englishman how to love while he teaches his two young German students (Fritz, played by Fritz Wepper, and Natalia, played by Marisa Berenson) how to speak English. Fritz and Natalia of course become romantically involved as well, but their relationship is complicated since she's Jewish and everyone around them seems to be repeating Nazi propaganda like a mantra.\n\nThere are, of course, complications with Sally and Brian's relationship, also. She's wooing a rich baron, Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), and Brian is afraid she's being unfaithful. Things only get more complicated when Brian, too, falls for the Baron, leading to one of the most intimate shots in film history as the three, drunken and dancing, gather around and touch their heads together in a circle.\n\nThe story is intricate and full of themes that were ahead of their time such as bisexuality and abortion, but everything gets a bit too dry after a while and the film takes far too long to wrap things up. The musical numbers are certainly more exciting and deftly paced than the dramatic scenes, and had the film been a little less indulgent with all of its themes and character arcs it could've been half an hour shorter and even more effective.\n\nThe often strange juxtaposition of the songs and the drama is also a bit confusing at times, and I kinda felt like I did while watching \"Inherent Vice\", except this time I knew what was going on, but couldn't quite figure out why it was being included. Like \"Inherent Vice\", this film might benefit from another watch at some point in the future to see things from a better perspective. This isn't too big a complaint, though, and I think this is a film that any fan of musicals and/or of great cinematography should see.",

            "content": "I never really liked Liza Minnelli. There, I said it. But there is something about her wide-eyed, innocent arrogance that makes her click as Sally Bowles, a dubious supporting character from Christopher Isherwood's \"Goodbye to Berlin\" who somehow became the center of attention in \"Cabaret,\" its musical adaptation. But even without her unrestrained performance--which feels like a blessing half the time and a curse the other half, but is never unremarkable--this would be a top-notch film musical. The direction (by Bob Fosse) is impeccable, even if he does rip off his own \"Sweet Charity\" for a few moments. Every little piece of music and even the tiniest little detail does something to propel the narrative forward in a way that few other directors have ever consistently managed, from the dinginess of the cabaret to the varied levels of enthusiasm expressed by its cavorting dancing girls, from the beautifully edited opening number, \"Wilkommen,\" to the intercutting between a mock boxing match inside the club with a brutal Nazi assault outside. Fosse's choreography is similarly flawless, captured in a vibrant and imaginative way by master cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Michael York and Helmut Griem shine as much as they can with so much of the spotlight hogged by Sally, but the real attraction in the cast is Joel Grey as a sly, devious, tantalizingly mysterious Emcee who invites us into a world that we know will shortly become a very dangerous place. And through the dazzling music, gorgeous design, cinematography, and innovative editing (dare you not to feel a chill at the quick cutaway to the Emcee towards the end of the Nazi anthem \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\"), we know it without having to be told. A credit to the musical genre and quite possibly one of the best-directed films of all time.",

And there is no denying that it does, but it's still a lazily written one which doesn't have too much depth or originality as one may have hoped. The story in Cabaret plays second fiddle to its flash and rarely touches upon its Nazi universe, deciding instead to play it relatively safe and change it to being a love story between a nightclub performer and an academic. It tries to have serious drama in its subplots, but they are so barely touched upon that it doesn't even seem like the filmmakers should have bothered. Really, Cabaret is a simple love story underneath glitz and glam, but at least it is a good one.\nCabaret is a very flash musical film. It has a lot of vibrant musical numbers with attractive stars, and so as a musical film it does the job. As a story set during WWII, it doesn't explore the setting enough and simply plays it off as a casual commodity, and the central love story between the protagonists is rather pointless because it doesn't really go anywhere and then suddenly ends abruptly at the end of the film with nothing left for it. I couldn't help but ask myself what the point of the entire love story was, except that so the film could stay within the context of being a musical film. But really, it just doesn't have the best story. Fans of classical Hollywood musicals should be able to appreciate it, but viewers looking for something more than a glamourously formulaic musical have other places to go. The subplots don't really add anything to the story either because they aren't really explored all that well or justified for being actually present.\nBut for what it's worth, there are a lot worse musicals out there than Cabaret, and at least it doesn't over-glamourize itself. Thanks to Bob Fosse's Academy Award winning direction, Cabaret finds a certain sense of restraint which protects it from becoming as much of a cheesy film as it could have if it was mishandled. It keeps itself focused on the characters and on being a small scale story which is gentle and easy to watch without being excessively lighthearted. Cabaret actually does put some meaningful drama into the story and examines the relationship between a young American Cabaret singer and a bisexual Englishman. Thanks to a script which stays true to the play very well, Cabaret brings across the same characters from its source material and supplies them with a lot of strong dialogue.\nAnd visually, Cabaret is great. While it doesn't explore its historical context all that well, its visual depiction of 1930's Berlin is very believable thanks to the fine scenery and production design which gives it a firm sense of realism, as well as the fact that the characters all dress in appropriate costumes. It is all captured with a lot of nice cinematography and plays out against a strong musical score, and the visual and auditory aspects of the film combine to form a lot of flashy musical numbers which should please fans of the genre. So Cabaret is a film that knows what it can do and does it, even though there are a few areas where it could have improved itself.\nAnd thanks to the efforts of a tenacious cast, Cabaret is a rounding success.\nLiza Minelli is a terrific lead in Cabaret. The character Sally Bowles is truly the role that she was born to play because as well as emphasising her natural talent for dancing and singing as well as her subtle sex appeal, it really gives her a great character. Sally Bowles is a woman with ambition to really prove herself to the world and achieve her dreams, and that is precisely what Liza Minelli is actually doing in the role. Thanks to her beautiful singing voice, her ability to dance without fear and the fact that she can do all that and act out her character at the same time, she proves to be absolutely perfect for the role. Liza Minelli puts on a magnificent stage persona for the character during the flashy musical numbers, and when she is engaging in her character's complicated romantic relationship, she takes a step back and puts a lot of humanity into the role. Liza Minelli manages to create two key personas for the character Sally Bowles and nails both of them so well that she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role in a really deserving victory. Liza Minelli is one of the best reasons to see Cabaret, and she is the most joyful asset of the film.\nMichael York also gives a terrific performance. Although not having the most deep character, Michael York's natural English charm makes him a likable lead, and his ability to interact with the other cast members makes him a likable character to the rest of the crowd also. And his chemistry with Liza Minelli has a certain sense of truth to it. The passion between them feels genuine, and it is because both actors are dedicated to each other. And it makes Michael York really come off as a romantic. Michael York's ambitious charm makes him an ideal casting decision, and he delivers his lines with thought and honesty which results in a fine leading performance.\nLastly, Joel Grey is memorable in Cabaret. With an appearance which has him looking like Charlie Chaplin in a John Waters movie, he makes a memorable impact. And from there he sinks into his gleefully over the top energy as the Emcee in Cabaret. His character is essentially a commodity that Cabaret wheels in when it needs some glamourous silliness and fun, and Joel Grey takes that knowledge and runs with it, injecting flamboyance into the film which is like a mix of vaudeville slapstick and The Rocky Horror Show. Joel Grey's supporting performance in Cabaret is funny and entertaining in a silly way, and I mean that in the best manner of speaking.\n\nSo although Cabaret has an imperfect story and lacks sufficient explanation of its historical context, the charming performances of its cast and the musical energy of the film all shine under the direction of Bob Fosse.",

            "content": "The pursuit of happiness, enshrined as a right in the US Constitution, is one of the greatest motivating factors in all of human history. It can also be one of the biggest distractions. CABARET, from the musical by Kander and Ebb and directed by Bob Fosse, is sort of an examination of this through the historical lens of late Weimar Germany as it succumbed to Nazism. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, a dancer/singer at the Kit Kat Club who has dreams of becoming a famous actress; and Michael York is Brian Jordan, an English philosophy student who is in Germany for cultural enrichment and to make some money. Both of these tragic figures are the conduit for the audience, with Sally being the fantasy side of things and Brian being the reality. As with CHICAGO, although a little less so here, the musical numbers don't just move the story along (all while being organic) but also comment upon it as well. This, for me, is what sets Kander/Ebb musicals apart from the rest. Nazism begins as a mere nuisance but, as the film progresses, becomes more of a presence (and present threat). This is mirrored in the pacing of musical sequences which are initially spaced out a little sparsely but become more frequent as the film goes on. From an interpretive standpoint (and this is just my opinion), this implies (through the nature of what a cabaret is and entails) that our willingness to be entertained and distracted, even if only temporarily, is what allows political extremism/tragedy/etc. to insidiously take hold. No scene in CABARET is more chilling than when the young Nazi starts singing (what I think is) a folk song, and his audience gradually joins in with him. In fact, this entire musical is filled with pathos of varying types, which is why I think it's so effective. The cabaret is a metaphor for the ways we try to mask our pain, to find happiness, but it often comes at the expense of our dignity. From a technical perspective, all of the performances were solid with special marks being given to the leads. However, Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies was just as entertaining, perhaps the most so as his role provided dramatic and musical unity to the film. He was also simply hilarious to watch. There was also dynamite editing, choreography, lighting, etc., making it a sort-of ancestor to the music video. If there's one complaint I can levy, it's that the film takes a little too much time to get going, although once it gets into gear it doesn't let up. All things considered, CABARET is a stunning accomplishment that still holds relevance in this day and age of disillusionment with the political establishment. I'm a little hesitant to draw parallels between the America of today and the Germany of then, but it's a little disconcerting to feel like the only thing keeping us from making the same mistakes is that we've never suffered the abject humiliation that Germany suffered at the end of WWI. On a more positive note, CABARET exists as a testament to the power of entertainment, and definitely deserves its status as one of the best musicals ever put to film.",

We never see him out of his MC persona, but do see two layers to his performances.  As the host of an interwar Berlin burlesque, he is on one level-and perhaps for him it is the only level-an entertainer for Nazi fat cats and wealthy Yanks and Brits on continental vacations.  But art imitates life, and we can also see, perhaps all too plainly, how the songs that the MC presents are mirroring events in the world outside the club.  The Nazi party's growing boldness is displayed through rapid cuts between mob violence in the streets and the MC's cartoonish goosestepping on stage.  The unusual love triangle between Liza Minelli's hopeful actress and her British and German paramours has its telling parallel in the song \"Two Girls.\"  Most shockingly and ambiguously, the MC lampoons anti-Jewish miscegenation laws by romancing a person in a gorilla suit and asking why society should stand in the way of their love.  Would the Nazi party view this routine as an endorsement of their policies, since the idea of a human and a gorilla in love is patently foolish, or would they understand that the fool MC's question had truly moved the audience in spite of the veneer of absurdist comedy?  The music of \"Cabaret\" underlines the plot points in very bold strokes, but it works because everything is so unabashedly theatrical.  Matching Joel Grey's achievement and far outshining a weak turn from Michael York, Liza Minnelli gives a great performance, particularly in the songs \"Mein Herr\" and the title tune.",

My very first Bob Fosse's film, certainly the film gained its classic fame as the biggest winner of the Oscar in 1973, with 8 wins (including BEST DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTRESS and SUPPORTING ACTOR) and nearly usurped the BEST PICTURE trophy from THE GODFATHER (1972, 9/10), if it had been so,  it would be inflicted with much notorious backfire in the film history, but the film itself is an unerring gem among the undying musical genre, my first viewing is a thoroughly exultant experience, and cut and dried, it's on my guilty-pleasure list. \n\nIt is my first Liza Minnelli's film as well, the cabaret's \"international sensation\" Sally Bowles, an innocuous vamp, Liza grants her role a disarming vitality and quaintly resembles a bobbed Anne Hathaway doppelgänger, not only radiates her grandeur in rendering her doughty-yet-alluring show tunes (she is born to do it), her portrayal of Sally personal life is equally (if not more) affecting, her doe-eyed naivety and unrestrained zest for life, for love, for fame elevate her character as the master of her own fate, her sacrifice may not gain concurrence from motley views of life, but a full obeisance to her independence and pluck is duly earned. \n\nMichael York, behind his gawky effeminacy, plunges himself into a more contentious venture, Brian Roberts, his character's bookish bi-sexual temperament is a provocative taboo on big screen (like since ever) and the implicit ménage à trois temptation (with Sally and the suave Helmut Griem, whose gentrified debonair is utterly irresistible) has been simmering to the perfect temperature, undergirds a manifestation of initiating a sex-liberation wave (germane to the 70s era while against the Nazi-rising milieu in the film). \n\nThere is a subplot dealing with a bromide of a down-and-out German guy's infatuation with a rich but prude Jewish girl, there is an ironic twist near the end, however never quite manages to steal the limelight from Sally and Bri, but Marisa Berenson's placid performance is still worthy of backslapping (the dichotomy of women's images is a trifle stale though). \n\nJoel Grey, as the so called \"Master of Ceremonies\" and won an Oscar (against three fellows from THE GODFATHER), serves only as the performer in the film, no clear attachment with the plot, his musical set pieces are burlesque, risqué but entertaining to the bone, with a strenuous mimicry of German accent, it is a hard-earned honour, although I don't understand how Al Pacino could lose at any rate. \n\nThe film drops its curtain right before the prevalence of  Nazi's atrocity, the ending with the vague reflections of Third Reich audience occupying the place has sublimated the materialistic razzle-dazzle onto an eerily ominous scope which the film has no interest to tamper but the audiences will intuit what will happen next. A great windup, neat and potent!",

It's an absolute triumph of a film that contains such ambitious camera angles, they would look most appropriate in a full scale epic, but the fact they are mostly used in tiny rooms such as an apartment and a dingy Cabaret club gives the film a feel of greatness in a small place and gives an enormous feel of ambition to the film. And it's a delightful surprise that on the outside, the film looks like a pretty good happy-clappy jazz musical, but is actually a great realistic,contextual piece on what went on in the underworld of Berlin before the war.",

The cabaret she sings in represents all she wants life to be: easy sexuality, relaxed morality, eternal youth, and a place where her dreams are safe from the realistic skepticisms of the outside world. The dramatic irony is that we recognize the growing power of the Nazi party means that her fantasy is not to last. We don't need to see what beomces of Sally to know that she's doomed herself. \nFosse's ingenious staging practically makes the camera one of the dancers, invigorating the musical asides that colour the subtext of the narrative. Strong performances abound besides Minnelli's legendary turn. Michael York makes a sympathetic protagonist and audience surrogate, while Joel Grey's manic master of ceremonies drips with uncontrollable Vaudevillian panache.",

Joel Grey is fantastic as the over the top Master of Ceremonies and Liza Minnelli is great as Sally Bowles. I realized in watching them why playing a role over the top can work; it's because both of their characters are naturally larger than life characters, that going the extra step up works for them, and they both deserved their Academy Awards. Michael York as Brian Roberts is worth mentioning; he was so good that at times I forgot he was Basil Exposition from the Austin Powers movies. That, of course, was a joke but he still did a great job. His character was well handled from a writing standpoint. You actually did feel for what he was going through; at first being a loner in a new land and being constantly in a state of confusion and then as his relationship with Sally begins his jealousy of Maximillian. I love how the music isn't there to just serve the plot. Besides being entertaining to watch, they connect to the actual plot and it works very well in my opinion. If there's something I have to complain about in romances in movies, it's the lack of chemistry. In this movie, watching the chemistry between Brian and Sally is just fun to watch; it's so cute and real it's enjoyable to watch. As I mentioned earlier, the scenes in the cabaret are extremely entertaining, especially with Joel Grey and occasionally Liza there as well. The film also know how to act in certain scenes. It knew how to be ridiculous in the cabaret scenes, and when it was being dramatic, it was natural; it wasn't forced at all. In the \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" Nazi part, it was clever irony there. The film, however, is not without it's issues. The chemistry between Fritz and Natalia was rather underdeveloped (by the way it was very tragic to see her dog dead on her porch) and kinda thrown to the side, the fact that Brian was helping with English lessons and that he was translating a book for someone was kinda thrown away, the fact that he had gotten the shit beaten out of him by the Nazis but in the next few scenes seems perfectly fine, and the fact that Brian is bisexual is thrown away as well. Although they were issues, they didn't keep me from enjoying the film. The overarching theme of the Nazi Party I thought was well handled; again, it didn't feel forced when it was happening. As for the ending, it was so weirdly handled, but it fit the tone of the movie so I didn't mind it that much. Overall, I honestly have to say that although I'll need to watch it a second time to make sure, Cabaret might be my favorite musical.",

However, pic is too often content to settle for a rather humdrum storyline, and many of the musical numbers are far from memorable and add nothing to the story. A subplot involving a Jewish heiress adds little to the film and perhaps over-emphasises the Nazi backdrop, which might have worked better had it hung like an unmentioned specter over the proceedings. Some scenes suffer from a similar lack of subtlety, such as one in which a Aryan boy corrals a sympathetic crowd with a nationalistic tune that soon has many amongst them on their feet and singing along; though it initially appears to offer a perverse reflection of a similar scene in Casablanca, it's let down by a few rather heavy handed touches, such as Michael York's obvious proclamation that they won't be as hard to suppress as his friend Maximillian seems to think.",
