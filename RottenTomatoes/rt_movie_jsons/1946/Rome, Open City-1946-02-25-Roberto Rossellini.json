This Italian neorealist picture has too many plot points and characters, but at least their development is pretty strong and the directing from Rossellini was excellent.",

Set in Nazi occupied Rome of 1944, members of the Resistance desperately try to escape the German army, knowing that capture will lead to certain torture and probable death.  It's a compelling story from the get-go, thanks primarily to remarkably well-developed characters, characters filled with courage, principles and humanity.  While the first part of the film is filled with intrigue and suspense, the second half is something else altogether and is unforgettable in its impact.  Rome, Open City is a film that is worthy of the praise bestowed upon it.",

            "content": "This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It truly shows the struggle that happened when fighting fascism in Italy during WWII. Utilizing characters of different political ideologies and backgrounds, such as Manfredi being a communist atheist and Don Pietro being a priest, was a brilliant move to showcase the themes of unity that is required to fight the oppressive systems of fascism. It shows the impact had by children as well. As a piece of art, it was also cinematically beautiful, with its close shots and mid shots, giving us a more personal show of the characters, making the audience become more drawn in to them. What also makes this film enjoyable for the audience is how relatable and real the characters were. As a neorealist film, it does a spectacular job at making this film as real as possible, even though it does make it clear that the Nazis are the villains and the Resistance are the heroes. This is a tale of good vs. evil, and it tells us that we must be unified in order to defeat fascism, which is a theme I believe to be important, even today.  Overall, this movie utilizes cinematography and characterization in a truly genius way to show the audience that Manfredi, Pina, and the rest of the fighters are truly fighting for a just cause, and they must do what it takes to ensure freedom, going to any length to fight the evil that is the Nazis. In a way, I'm glad that it made this struggle be a blatant good vs. evil, not making the Nazis sympathetic characters, I believed that to be a smart move on the director's part. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to anyone that enjoys Itlaian cinema.",

Man that Anna Magnani is a catch, what a woman. I really liked her in The Golden Coach. Fantastic movie! Interesting character this priest guy. He seems to be doing tasks and helping out the Resistance group in Italy. Wow, that Marina, the cabaret dancer, looks incredible. She can model no problem. The shape of her eyes are very interesting, very pretty girl. \n\nWow, the kids seems to be little freedom fighters blowing up that gas tank in the rail yard. So funny how as each kid got to the door of their house, their father would immediately smack them across the face yelling at them asking where they've been. So crazy how the priest hid the mp40 and bomb under the old man's sheets lol. Great stuff. Well that took a pretty dark turn. I wasn't expecting Pina to be shot down like a dog on the street. That was dumb on her part, she shouldn't have ran after her husband. Wow, this Marina chick is selling out to the Nazi's just so she can fill her empty void with meaningless material things. Bitch. She's also kind of getting brainwashed with that drug that German girl is giving her. \n\nI really liked what that one German officer in the fancy lounge area was saying. He was very cynical but also very realistic and almost on another level of consciousness then everyone else. He basically said that we Nazi's all were good at is killing, killing, killing and that we're gonna burn in hell for what we've done. Corpses lying across Europe. He went on to say that the Nazi's are a weak race compared to the other Europeans who would rather die than sell out and talk to the Nazi's. \n\nWatching these old movies where the subject matter has to do with Nazi's or the holocaust or WWII made me realize how ballsy directors were back then to make films that ridiculed or made fun of the Nazi's, basically made a satire out of them. Showing how stupid and pointless bullies they were. Very insightful and very well done war thriller movie. A very dark and stark reminder of how ruthless and evil the Nazi's were. But the movie also shows us how weak the Nazi's were and how strong everyone that stood up against them was. I like how the final shot is the kids walking away holding each other. A statement saying how they are the future and they are the ones that can change things for the better. Very impactful movie.",

A masterpiece that deserves a greater degree of recognition among modern American audiences. (4.5/5)",

I wonder if Rogue One took its cue from this film - I see similarities with how the Empire destroys all the heroes, and we are left with only the hope that the next generation of youth will stand up to the evil.  But the youth here don't look hopeful, they're downtrodden, beaten. \n\nI like the one sardonic Nazi officer who gets drunk and blasphemies the whole Nazi effort.  This displeases our lead antagonist, who persistently tries to remind him of the uniform he wears.  But the officer continues, accusing this whole master race effort of nothing but violence.  \n\nYears before Hitchcock did it to Janet Leigh, Rosselini shocks us by killing off the lead in the second act, or as he calls it Part 1 - Anna Magnani's Pina is gone, and we are at a loss to wonder where the film goes from here.  The narrative continues with the rebels and priest, and as disappointing as it is from a narrative perspective, it is telling us something about the nature of this Nazi cruelty.  Experiencing them is not experiencing anything you want.  That's for Indiana Jones, a needed escapist hero for our culture, someone who can fight back against all odds.  But we see how impossible it is, how outnumbered, outranked, outgunned this society is.  They are at the behest of weapons pointed towards their hearts at all times, and there is no mercy.",

            "content": "Open City initially presents an ambiguous view of the Church. The first Church representative we meet is the sexton who genuflects before joining the looting of a bakery. This hypocritical moment seems to be mocking not only the sexton but also the performative nature of Catholic reverence. The Church's main official, Don Pietro, is presented as a comical buffoon. He is introduced trying to keep up with the children while they play soccer; he ineffectually blows his whistle before the ball finally lands on his head. Moreover, he is incapable of exerting any control over or gaining the respect of these children. Later, running an errand for the Resistance, he acts prudish, worrying over the placement of a statue depicting a saint and a naked woman. Although he is in the midst of a serious and important task, his religious beliefs cause him to worry over an insignificant detail.\n\nIn contrast to Don Pietro, the portly middle-aged clown, are the young and handsome communists: Francesco and Manfredi. These two men are who the children aspire to be. The kids roam the streets wreaking havoc and referring to each other as \"comrades.\" Pina sheepishly admits to Manfredi that she believes in God, and her main defense for her desire to be wed in a church is that it is preferable to being wed by a fascist in town hall. As it turns out, the atheist Resistance fighters embody what the people hope to be. The Church is a present force, but a largely incompetent and ridiculous one.\n\nThe Church gets redemption, however, in the final moments of Open City. Don Pietro refuses to relinquish the Resistance fighters, despite their lack of religious beliefs, and expresses an enlightened note of tolerance. Meanwhile, Manfredi's torture is reminiscent of the martyrdom of Christ, supporting the idea that religious ideals are powerful and relevant to the time frame of the film. At Don Pietro's execution, all the children who previously showed him no respect come out to mourn him. As they walk away, they are framed against a landscape of Rome, which prominently shows St. Peter's Church. Though the Church has flaws and weaknesses, Rossellini is establishing it - specifically in the form expressed by Don Pietro - as the bedrock of Italian society.",

He gains assistance from a kindly and collected priest who also runs a church. Their stories intertwine with a widowed woman who is just about to be remarried, a beautiful girlfriend, and a Gestapo office who is intent on stopping the resistance. After one tragic event everything continues on a downward spiral. The fugitive Manfredi as well as the priest are betrayed. Don Pietro must look on as the other man is brutally tortured to the point of death. Next, Gestapo try to use the priest's own beliefs against him and yet he will not yield either. He too then faces a fate just as horrible. This film at times was brutally realistic and it is perhaps one of the most moving films I have seen. We do not normally think of the struggles of Italians during WWII since Mussolini was allied with Hitler, however much like the French or even Germans, they faced tremendous danger and hardship. Furthermore, it humanized the Italians in my mind a great deal. This is the first film of the war trilogy that I have seen and now I want to see the other two.",

That upon reading about some of it's film's history on Rottentomatoes.com or on imdb.com, director Roberto Rosellini had some struggle with it's shoot during the years of 1943 and 1944 and is hailed as a classic neo-realist film which says to me \"Rome, Open City\" is more appreciated for it's behind the scenes than for it's storytelling when the story is way too simplistic, when it's easy to portray how bad Nazis are in any film, with the only difference that this may be the first film to have done it with a Italian setting using actual locations.  I feel that films are resonatingly effective if Rosellini showed how Italian Liberation Army finally took full control before punishing their betrayers than to show a film about some of the resistence's defeat.  I will point out that if anybody want to see how evil Nazis can become, get it from the masterpiece fictional film 1942 Casablanca, since some of the same stuff shown on this fictionize film is somewhat echoed on \"Rome Open City\" which is also fictional and are both the same, except that one has a better ending while this one does not!\r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4",

            "content": "Quoting : \n\nRoberto Rossellini's Roma, Citt Aperta (known in English as Open City) was one of the landmark films of the 1940s on several levels. Aesthetically, it was one of the first major works of Italian neorealist filmmaking and perhaps the single most influential example of the style. Historically, it was among the first postwar European films to gain a significant audience in the United States, opening the door for a greater appreciation of international filmmaking in America. And politically, it was a work of tremendous bravery. The screenplay was written by Roberto Rossellini in association with Federico Fellini and Sergio Amidei while Rome was still occupied by German forces in 1943-44. Rossellini began filming in secret, using scavenged film stock without sound equipment, shortly before the city was liberated in June of 1944. Several key members of his creative team had been active in the Italian resistance movement. With its rough, documentary-style look, multi-layered narrative, and a cast that mixed amateurs with actors who didn't look like film stars, Roma, Citt Aperta captured the harsh and unforgiving textures of real life as few movies of its time had dared. It set the pace for Italian Neorealism as an influential postwar film style that combined outdoor light and location shooting with non-actors, a focus on simple stories of everyday life, and a concern for the poor and for social problems. Roma, Citt Aperta shows the lives of a group of people living in Rome during the Nazi occupation, after the Germans had declared it an \"open city.\" Anna Magnani plays a woman in love with a member of a resistance group; in helping him, she risks not only her own life, but also that of her unborn child. Aldo Fabrizi plays a priest who aids the anti-Nazi cause and pays dearly for his activism. Marcello Pagliero is an outspoken communist who runs afoul of the Nazis. And Harry Feist plays a German officer who has taken an Italian lover, but whose affection for Romans does not run especially deep. While Roma, Citt Aperta shows flashes of the melodramatic sentimentality that would mark much of Rossellini's later work, it still rings true as a chronicle of a city under siege and as the genesis of a powerful new film style whose influences include such later filmmakers, among many others, as John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, and Spike Lee. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",

When most people think of Italy during WWII, they think of Mussolini and bunch of Axis soldiers, since Italy was associated with Germany and Hitler, at least that is what I think of. I never realized how much Italian citizens suffered during that grim period of time and Rossellini brought insite and existence to this past serious issue. \"Rome, Open City\" is a magnificent film, and it looks real, with some great acting and powerful photography.

The content and handheld camera work give the authentic feel synonymous with Neorealism, turning the conventions of the Hollywood WWII drama's on their heads'. Anna Magnani carries the film and its emotional core long after she is gone from the film. Despite being a classic, the film does have a few flaws. Rossellini's attempts to combine Neorealism and melodrama fall flat. In particular, the use of a score takes away from much of the realism at work. The Gestapo villain and the female agent are nearly cartoonish in their caricatures'. Other than these elements, the film stands up as an important piece of filmmaking that remains moving and effective.\r\n\r\nCheck out my film blog Cinema Enthusiast!\r\nwww.cinemaenthusiast.com",

En ésta, la capital de Italia es víctima de esta ocupación y desde luego que se vuelve un juego de malos malos vs. buenos buenos (algo no muy neorrealista a mi parecer) sin embargo la película más que mostrar esta guerra de bien vs. mal se mete más en explicar la naturaleza humana y lo que todos hacemos al estar en situaciones tan difíciles y extremas como la guerra, y esto incluye llantos, risas, bodas, nacimientos y juegos de niños.",

            "content": "Open City\r\nIf you like WWII dramas as I do, then this story set in Rome will be of special interest to you.  It is very down to earth and well acted--humorous in some places and horrible to watch in othersmuch like life itself. Some have dubbed the movie the beginning of Neorealism in Italian film making. It is different and well worth a look-see, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe action is said to take place in 1943, some time after August 14, 1943, when the Italians capitulated and declared Rome to be an \"open city,\" i.e an undefended city, under the terms of Article 25 of the 1907 Hague Regulations on Land Warfare in order to prevent its destruction by bombing raids and door-to-door combat.  This left the German Army, Gestapo, and SS in charge of Rome.  Apparently the film was actually shot in 1944 as the latter forces had begun to pull back up north.  The filmmakers used filched equipment and at key junctures cast members dressed in uniforms that had been swiped for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAccording to the story, the perpetrators of a home-grown resistance movement are in the process of being routed out by Gestapo agents in collusion with local Fascist sympathizers.  Lest we forget, just because Italy was a member of the Axis powers it did not mean that everyone in that country went along with Mussolini and his band of cut-throats.  On the contrary, the Italian people, i.e. both Catholic and Communist partisans alike, were united in a life-and-death struggle for their very survival against a common enemy who did not hesitate to use physical and psychological torture against its victims.  This is well portrayed in the film.\r\n\r\nThe movie was shot entirely in black-and-white on several different kinds of film.  The quality of the picture throughout flickers between more or less shades of contrasting darker and lighter tones which only heightens the tension of the events portrayed.  Action sequences have been spliced together in editing to form one cohesive story line, joining what appears to be actual in-the-moment footage with several scripted interludes.  For example, watch closely the complete execution portrayed of the Roman Catholic priest Don Pelligrini after he is convicted of treason; it almost looks as if there were two different people used as the priest and one of them indeed lost his life.",

La historia de estos personajes se vera entrelazada cuando Manfredi se refugia en casa de Pina para que los oficiales nazis no lo encuentren. \r\nEn esta cinta, considerada por muchos como la real inauguraciÃ³n del Neorrealismo Italiano, Rossellini muestra de gran manera una historia que habÃ­a vivido meses antes y en un guiÃ³n de Ã©l, Federico Fellini y Sergio Amidei, la historia de varios habitantes de la Roma corrompida por las tropas alemanas, y crea, con imÃ¡genes duras, realistas y sin exageraciÃ³n a la real Roma, una desprotegida y con la bÃºsqueda de la libertad, basada en el apoyo de todos sus habitantes; ideas muy alejadas a las romas de gladiadores que ha acostumbrado Hollywood. AdemÃ¡s, Rossellini logrÃ³ captar la emociÃ³n en los actores y en escenas muy bien hechas, sobre todo (SPOILER) en la que Pina corre hacia su prometido Francesco gritando cuando este es arrestado, una escena brutal en la que se reÃºne la magia de la cinta (Â¡Francesco! Â¡Francesco!) (FIN DE SPOILER).\r\nLas actuaciones de Fabrizi, Magnani y Feist son muy buenas, aunque su labor no fue tan difÃ­cil como la de los demÃ¡s, ya que ellos sÃ­ eran actores profesionales y los demÃ¡s no. Y aunque no eran profesionales, el resto del reparto realiza una buena actuaciÃ³n, sobre todo la del pequeÃ±o (en ese entonces) Annichiarico quien se roba la cÃ¡mara en las escenas que aparecen, ademÃ¡s de ser pieza clave en la serie de sucesos en la cinta, logra imprimirle un gran sentimiento poco usual en muchos niÃ±os que no hayan llevado su vida para la actuaciÃ³n.\r\nLa direcciÃ³n de fotografÃ­a de Ubaldo Arata es una buena combinaciÃ³n en blanco y negro de la cÃ¡mara documentalista y la de ficciÃ³n, con escenas que parecen grabadas en realidad y no en cine, esta es otra caracterÃ­stica del Neorrealismo Italiano.\r\nLa mÃºsica de Renzo Rossellini, hermano del director, contiene grandes piezas que sirven para mostrar la angustia, el misterio, el temor mostrado en la cinta.\r\nOtro aspecto a destacar y que es clave en el neorrealismo italiano, es que la cinta se filmÃ³ mayoritariamente en exteriores, mostrando las edificaciones de la Italia de la Posguerra.\r\nUna cinta clave para la cinematografÃ­a italiana que ningÃºn cinÃ©filo debe dejar perder.",

In the film there is a priest who helps the Italian resistance.\n\nThis film is one of the early examples of an Italian neorealism film. While current scholars tend to consider this film more melodramatic than neo-realist. Despite this, it has many of the notable characteristics of Italian neorealism - the film focuses on ordinary people; it has a loose, episodic story structure; the camera style is simple; there is an emphasis on emotions rather than abstract ideals; etc. While I suppose this is a decent example on neorealism, I was rather disappointed in this film. The only other neo-realist film I've seen is Bicycle Thieves, an outstanding film, and I was hoping this film would be of similar quality. While I suppose it did a good job at what it was trying to do, I just didn't care about the story at all. The only thing I liked about the film was a stretch of a minute or two which led to the iconic shot of one of the main characters being shot.\n\nI should comment that the current DVD releases of this film are terrible and this could have contributed to my poor opinion of the film. There were large portions of dialogue in Italian and German with no subtitles making the film quite difficult to follow. Criterion is working on a release of the film which would almost certainly do a better job with subtitles. Perhaps the film is worth a rewatch at some point.\n40/100\nF",
