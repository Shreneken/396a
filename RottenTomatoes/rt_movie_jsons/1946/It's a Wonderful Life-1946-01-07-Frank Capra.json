            "content": "George Bailey is the protagonist of the story. He's a very ambitious person, living in the small and boring town of Bedford Falls. He works in his father's building and loan firm and dreams of traveling around the world, but everytime something comes up and he is unable to leave Bedford Falls.  He and His whole family are in trouble because a lot of money has gone missing and George is blamed for it. When in reality the money was stolen by the evil Mr Potter, who is known as the richest and meanest man in town. On Christmas day he contemplated committing suicide because he thinks everyone would be better off without him. George's whole life is then shown through flashbacks to see just how he got to that place. He's desperate and doesn't see a way out and just as George is about to jump off a bridge, Clarence, his guardian angel, shows up and shows George what life would have looked like for everyone if he hadn't been born. \n\nThe main theme of the movie is coping with failure and success in life, but there are also many components of love, family, friendship, and Christmas.\nThe main message of the movie is showing how one person can make a difference. Sometimes it is the lack of perspective that causes people to forget how much impact they have on others lives. Great evidence of this is a quote that comes at the end of the film when all is well again.George embraces his family under the Christmas tree and suddenly he finds a Mark Twain book with a message from Clarence that reads \"No man is a failure who has friends\". What this scene shows is how good relationships with friends and family are what truly means to have success in life.\nMost of the movie is a little demoralizing and seems to go against the message of the movie and how everyone is more successful than they think, because through out the movie nothing seems to work out in Geroge's life. Everytime the opportunity presents itself he chooses to help other people instead of following his dreams even though he's punished for it. It isn't until close to the end when George realizes how much success he has had in his life as he looks at how many people he has helped. \n\nI saw this movie for the first time with some friends that wanted to watch a Christmas movie. And we saw \"It's A Wonderful Life\" , an old black and white movie. It was an emotional rollercoaster, never before in my life had a movie made me laugh, feel angry, and tear up so much.\n\nThis is my favorite movie of all time, I've probably seen it more times than anything else. Although it's a very old movie, it is a timeless masterpiece. George Bailey's story of trying to pursue his dreams and feeling like a failure because he hasn't  accomplished his goals is something that is very relatable and has spoken very personal to me has I have tried to make a difference in the world The moral of the story, which is how everyone can make a difference, is something that I believe can inspire any kind of person, so obviously I 100% recommend this movie.",

However, when misfortune calls and he is faced with financial ruin and considerable legal problems, a guardian angel is sent to save him from his fate.  It is a touching and timeless story of redemption as one man comes to terms with the significant role he has played in the lives of others.  At the risk of committing some sort of cinematic sacrilege, it takes far too long for director Frank Capra to set up the story for the ultimate pay-off and there are a couple of scenes with some horrible jump cuts, but overall, warts and all, it is a rewarding viewing experience for the whole family.",

            "content": "It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clich\u00e9d, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.\n\nVisually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.\n\nFinally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers?\n\nOverall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

The film deserves Its reputation and is truly a masterwork that is so realistically human and filled with every type of emotion we have as humans. What a wonderful and beautifully shot film that's looks gorgeous on blu-ray!

The message is timeless as well. Very Unique story structure as 85% of the movie is devoted to the first act which I have never seen in another movie but it oddly works wonderfully and makes the ending carry that much more weight. Jimmy Stewart (My favorite actor of all time) is phenomenal and is character is one of Top 5 Favorite Heroes Of All Time for his relatability, selflessness and sincerity. Never does the film feel self righteous, cheesy, or overdramatic as a lot of films around this time do. It truly feels modern. Mr. Potter is one of My Favorite Villains of All Time for his heartlessness and greed, representing the worst of humanity in juxtaposition to George who represents the best. Even though this is watched mostly around Christmas this is so good you can watch anytime of the year and feel happy. The Final 5 Minutes will make anyone tear up with tears of Joy. One of the Best Endings I've Ever Seen.",

George Bailey's personality irritated me a little bit, he's a guy who always puts money on the second plan, but it's impossible to be this way in a capitalist world, especially after the Great Depression or World War II. And Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who's portrayed as the villain, is the actual voice reason of the film, alongside Mary (Donna Reed) and Clarence (Henry Travers). The film successfully doesn't contradict the messages \"life's worth more than any money\" and \"'money doesn't buy happiness' is a lie\". Despite looking antagonistic, they're, in fact, complementary. The movie is essentially George's journey back to reality, even though he was never out of it. I think a more appropriate expression would be \"put his head in the right place\". Oh, and the ending is undeniably heartwarming. And I got where \"Sesame Street\" picked up the names Bert and Ernie, hahaha!",

It goes from deep depression to happiness thanks to the fantasy of Christianity, which begs the question why this guy warranted angelic intervention compared with others - especially considering the recency of WW2.  This is the least of its problems.   The film has not aged well.  The problem is it clearly has American audiences of the late 1940s in mind and one imagines the storyboard looking like a collection of Norman Rockwell paintings.  The combined effect is a fantasy belonging to a fantasy-view of American society - filled with Christian white people and the American can-do myth.  It's appalling.",

            "content": "It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clich\u00e9d, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.\n\nVisually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.\n\nFinally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers?\n\nOverall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

In fact, the movie's vision is that of a dark-edged world in which heroes are necessary.  George discovers his existence has saved his community from the cruelty of robber barons and more importantly, from its own greed and shortsightedness.\n\nMade just after the war, it was a favorite for both leading man Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra.  It is easy to see why.  There's a delightful song and dance sequence, visually witty moments like the dance floor that converts into a swimming pool during a feverish Charleston competition, and a sophisticated dialogue.  Stewart gives the performance of a lifetime.  Alternately affable and bitter, he is the. movie's little man hero.

Unfortunately, in real life self-sacrifice, especially excessive self- sacrifice, does not necessarily result in gratitude from those one had sacrificed for. They might necessarily take your actions for granted and in fact might regard you as a slave, which all too often happens in real life. Once your purpose is served, the sacrificer is discarded and forgotten, or even despised. And that, alas, would have been the far more credible ending.",

It takes longer than I would've predicted to get to 'the event', but it's very much worth seeing the journey that comes before - as we see the arc of James Stewart's George. It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.\n\nStewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).\n\nI did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.\n\nWholesome. Not that it, evidently given the average rating, needs to be said by someone like me, but: I'd certainly recommend this.",

The setting: It's Christmas...snow everywhere, although, Scrooge has been relegated from the main character down to the mean swindler Mr Potter, George Bailey's epiphany at the end of the movie is almost identical in it's jubilation to the spirited Mr Scrooge at the end of A Christmas Carol. \nI wouldn't say it carries the same depth and integrity as A Christmas Carol and as a film, very dated in it's social predicament of the 1940's but still a very watchable and emotionally fulfilling movie.",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n12/21/18 \n\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life Review \nIt's a Wonderful Life teaches us a lot about life with teaching us how to go about living our lives such as with improving our lives. It's very relatable with having characters that we can relate to particularly the character of George Bailey. James Stewart tops this off with an excellent performance. It does however have a fair amount of flaws.  \nIt's a Wonderful Life is about a down on his luck businessman who looks more at the negative aspects of his essence rather than the positive aspects of his essence. He looks at the negative aspects so much that he contemplates suicide however an Angel from heaven named Clarence saves him from doing so. \nGeorge has plenty of financial problems with the town he lives in Bedford Falls and this comes from a bank owner by the name of Henry Potter who not only wants to do whatever it takes to own everything in Bedford Falls, but also wants to do whatever it takes to own all the money in Bedford Falls even if it means enabling people to live poor in slums. Mr. Potter reminds us of our selfish side or can relate to anyone who's just flat out selfish because he's willing to do whatever it takes to make himself satisfied, and it's said or believed that this is the only way to have fulfillment in life, but we don't have to always be selfish in order to have fulfillment in life we can be selfless, and this is what George Bailey represents. \n\tGeorge saves his brother Harry from drowning which leads to him giving him his money and this leads to him playing college football and shooting down many fighter planes and saving men from a transport during World War 2, which also leads to President Harry Truman awarding him the congressional medal of honor, and what this teaches us is that we can change the world for the better by being generous. George also gives out loans to good friends of his such as Violet and Tom and this instills us that we should be more generous than egocentric if we want a friendship to last for a long time or even forever. \nGeorge does another devoted act by using Potter's money to turn a graveyard into a town with tons of houses called Bailey's Park, and what this proves is that we can improve our lives by being noble towards others because it makes us more likeable and because it can enable people to be noble to you by improving your life. An example would be at the end of the film when all of George's friends and family end up giving his wife and kids money, they had left over because of how generous he was to them by giving them money. \nGeorge however looks at the negative aspects more than the positive aspects of his life with his financial problems and this leads to him forgetting all the good that he has done and pondering over suicide, and this leads up to his guardian angel Clarence showing him what the world would be like if he had never existed, which leads to the Bailey's Bros Building and Loan Association going out of business and his brother Harry dying at the age of 9 because he wasn't there to save him from drowning when he was a kid, and this leads up to him not becoming a war hero and receiving the congressional medal of honor. George's wife Mary has never married and perhaps this is because her one and only true soul mate was George, and what this teaches us that if we ever ponder or are about to commit suicide god forbid, we should think more about the positive rather than the negative elements of our lives and all the good we've done as opposed to all the bad that we've done or all the problems we've had.\n\tThe character of Violet reminds sophisticated and popular people of themselves because she's not only nice looking, but she dresses nice as well, and in fact there are men who stare at her as she walks down the street, and this reminds me of when the character of Ilsa in the film Casablanca walks in the nightclub with her husband Victor and men stare at her and the character of Renault comments on her beauty as does George comments on Violet's beauty in It's a Wonderful Life.\n\tJames Stewart really makes George Bailey come alive with his performance by adding lots of vigor, intensity, and strength to his voice especially in the scenes in which he has disputes with Henry Potter such as when he wants the people in Bedford Falls to live in decent homes rather than in slums, and when Mr. Potter offers him $20,000. He also adds a great quantity to his facial expressions exclusively during the scene in which Potter is talking to him in his office, and he squints his eyes as he looks at him as if he certainly despises him, and he looks down in shame when Potter tells him his weaknesses. There is also a scene worth mentioning when he gives George a very perplexed, shocked, and confused look on his face when he finds out his mother in other words his own flesh and blood doesn't recognize him in the world in which he doesn't exists, and during this scene there seems to be more emotions going on in his face than I can even describe.\n\tIt's a Wonderful Life despite these strengths has a fair amount of weaknesses such as with plot holes with it never being explained as to why there's a bunch of animals in the Bailey's Bros Building and Loan Association such as a crow, squirrel, dog, and owl. It's a Wonderful Life is also disappointing with the case that none of the other performances in it are memorable, and the only memorable performance in it is that of James Stewart's performance his performance is so memorable that we wish the other performances in it were just as memorable or more memorable. I highly recommend It's a Wonderful Life despite having a fair amount of flaws and give it a score of a 9 out of 10.",

I almost can't even believe they would think up something so original like that especially for back in the 50's. This Potter character is the devil. He's so greedy, unempatheic and only looks out for his money. Doesn't care about people. The perfect characteristics to make it as a cold hearted business man. \n\nIncredible how selfless and giving George and his family is. He had $2000 that he was going to spend with his wife vacationing and having a good time. But instead they used it to help the people get there loan money back. It's very inspirational this movie. And it's so unfortunate and frustrating that every time something wonderful is happening in George's life, Potter always has to stick his devilish hands and ruin everything.\n\nDonna Reed seems so sweet and charming. That scene where they had there honeymoon in the old house that they threw rocks at was very heartwarming and sweet. Amazing WWII footage that they used. Potter is the devil. It's because of people like him that people have to struggle just to make ends meet. It's why people end up being miserable with there lives. \n\nI love the concept of angels in this movie. The visual concept of angels as human form but also as galaxies and stars in the universe is really beautiful. The concept of being able to see what life would be like if you were never born was powerful and impactful. But also a nightmare as well. \n\nThat ending had me crying like a baby. My nose even started running. What a wonderful movie with such a timeless and beautiful message. Incredibly written, beautifully shot and impeccably acted. Undoubtedly charming, sweet and funny while wearing it's emotions right on it's sleeve. This movie just goes to show that you don't need to live a rich and expensive life to live a wonderful life. \n\nThis is officially one of my favorite movies of all time.",

The Potters of the world (ironic name that - what art thou but a maker of pots?) do not see human beings but only financial assets or burdens;\n\"to my father they were human beings - but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle!\"\nThe Potters do not show mercy when mercy is necessary, or compassion when it would be the right thing to do;\n\"have you put any real pressure on these people?\"\n\"Mr. Potter, these people have children.\"\n\"well they're not my children!\"\nThe Potters do not act in an honorable or even reasonable way;\n\"somehow I've misplaced $8,000 dollars\"\n\"you've misplaced?\" (he looks at his steward knowing it was Uncle Billy and not George who was at fault)\nThe Potters like to twist the knife once it's in, causing pain and agony towards others;\n\"Look at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me \"a warped, frustrated, old man\"! What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help....I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance...\"\nThose that pursue money, though, live in great fear too - fear of being found out, fear of not making the grade, fear of never having enough.  To measure all things by their financial worth is to be\n\"cooped up for the rest of your life in a shabby little office...\" \nto deal with the \"business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe...\"\nThe movie may seem a bit romantic, echoing that Beatles' line of \"all you need is love\" but it also seems to echo the older maxim from 1 Timothy that \"the love of money is the root of all evil.\"  \nGeorge Bailey, a good man with noble dreams, consistently chooses the honorable path of self-sacrifice; but surrounded by a world that views money as the only defining factor (the scene of the '29 crash for instance) he eventually becomes resentful, fearful, and desperate teetering on the brink of real despair and losing the vision that, rich or poor, his little family loves him.  It takes a near-death event and the intervention of a silly little angel to cleanse the doors of his perception.  \n\"There must be an easier way to get my wings.\"\nThus this is the quintessential Christmas movie - not b/c of the singing of \"Hark the Herald Angels\" or b/c of the setting at Christmas time or the snow or the little town charm, but b/c the birth of the Christ child in our own hearts is a perennial event.  Bedford Falls is the world stage itself and the actors play out the drama of the human heart as it perpetually wrestles with despair.  \"Behold,\" says the Lord, \"I make all things new!\"  And indeed, the birth of the Christ Child at this season symbolizes the cleansing of our own vision away from that enslaving view that the world is a shabby little town in which the only answer to life's questions is to acquire more money, more power, more worldly gain.  The Advent prayer from Revelation \n\"the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.\"\ndefies this dark vision and in a similar way George Bailey, having seen what the world without him looks like, returns in joy to his rollicking children, his drafty old barn of a house, and the love of his wife - only to find that no man is a failure who has friends.  Amen, come Lord Jesus.",

Yeah, I was surprised that the iconic finale doesn't occur near the very end but fortunately there was such a well-done buildup to it that I didn't even complain. The acting is great, Frank Capra's direction is great, the cinematography is great, is there any reason why this isn't considered a Christmas classic, despite no Christmas decorations showing up until we're near the third act? You easily sympathize with George Bailey. The guy wishes to travel the world but he never does and it ends up taking his toll on him since he's trying so hard to make everybody else happy he feels like its come at the expense of his own happiness. The movie does show that those acts of selflessness mean that, if it weren't for somebody intervening, peoples' lives could've been much worse. I doubt my review will stand out amongst anybody else's, which is why I find it impossible to say anything anybody likely hasn't said already so I'll just tell you this: you haven't watched It's a Wonderful Life? Well, then, what are you waiting for? Next Christmas? Just remember that the iconic moment doesn't happen until near the very end and most of the movie is buildup towards it.

I'll admit it, I am a little biased considering this is my favorite Christmas movie, but for very good reason. The emotion inducing dialogue executed by the great cast led by Jimmy Stewart just makes me ball my eyes out every time I watch it. It is so hopeful and is such a feel-good movie that makes you sad for a while then ultimately happy that there may just be people like George Bailey out there in the world. Still over seventy years later no other film has been able to surpass the quintessential holiday movie that is It's a Wonderful Life.",

It's based on the short story and booklet \u2018The Greatest Gift' by Philip Van Doren Stern.\nThis movie is why I always say the ending to a movie is the most important part. I didn't classify this as a Christmas movie, nor was I 100% invested in the story until the final act of the film. I loved it!\nThe film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his dreams to help others, and whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers). Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched, and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be if he had never been born.\nI honestly can't talk about the acting being good or bad, it was a different time back then and you really can't judge. I will say that I love James Stewart and I know what he can do and what he usually does. This was a different role for him to take on and he did a great job.\nThe story really doesn't pull you in, and it's not the most exciting. The movie does a good job at creating a protagonist that you are rooting for in the very beginning. You want George Bailey to succeed and travel around the world, but he always puts others before himself, until he feels he just can't do it anymore. The ending of this movie is brilliant and breathtaking. I found myself in tears by the end and it really captures that if you have friends you're never truly alone. I don't really consider this to be a true Christmas movie, being the ending is the only part where Christmas is even mentioned.\nOverall, the movie is a heartwarming story that should be watched at least once in everyone's lifetime.\n4/5",

            "content": "This was a major blind spot in my film knowledge as it is considered the most iconic Christmas film of all time, at least in the United States, and is frequently referred to in discussions I have had with other cineastes. One of my worries was that the film had been built up so much in my mind that it could not possibly match up to my expectations when I finally saw the film. I had enjoyed the films of Frank Capra in the past as It Happened One Night (1934) is one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made and the somewhat overlooked today You Can't Take It with You (1938) and in that way I did not like this film quite as much as I wanted to. It is a fine film considered on it's own merits but don't be too taken in by all of the hype as it may disappoint just slightly.\n\nGeorge Bailey, James Stewart, plans to leave the small town of Bedford Falls, New York to travel to other countries and then study but he is forced to stay after his father dies and he is forced to run the bank they own. He has met and fallen in love with former classmate Mary Hatch, Donna Reed, but his commitment to work and rivalry with the evil Mr. Potter, Lionel Barrymore, who drives up prices on property and intends to enslave the town leaves him feeling sad. When his brother, who was meant to take over from him, is married and offered a better job Bailey is resigned to the fact that he will spend the rest of his life in Bedford Falls. He is married to Hatch and has multiple children with her but struggles to keep the bank financially solvent and a blunder that his uncle makes leaves him broke and vulnerable to the possibility of criminal conviction. This leads him to consider committing suicide but the intervention of an angel causes him to appreciate what he has.\n\nI suppose the wonder of the film is that it is able to take dark issues like suicide and financial struggles and tie them into a film that is made to appeal to a wide audience of children and adults. The moral struggle that Bailey faces is genuinely difficult and most adults can relate to giving up many of the dreams they had as youths to take care of their families or responsibilities passed down to them. The pain of seeing another, young version of yourself, in this case Bailey's brother, getting to achieve the dreams that you had is also a painful moment that rings true. What Capra does that is so fantastic, as he does in all of his films, is balance these darker elements with light comedic moments of slapstick or cheesy verbal gags. There is also the sweetness of the central relationship between Reed and Stewart which buoys the film and while at times Reed feels like too much of a good thing we are willing to forgive this because she is exceptionally good as the ideal woman. There is somehow not the overload of sentimentality that exists in some of Capra's lesser films as there is a brilliant balance to this film and even the most cynical are likely to be won over by it's charms.\n\nStewart makes a warm, likable lead and is totally convincing as the family man but he also gets a chance to do some serious dramatic work here as he is convincing as a hardened, embittered man for a brief stretch in the film. As previously stated Reed is excellent as the dream girl with her naivet\u00e9 and total infatuation with Stewart in early scenes endearing us to her and her steady support only allowing our affection for her to grow. Barrymore is cast against type as he is the antithesis of Grandpa Martin Vanderhof and uses his persona as a cute, cuddly older man to shock the audiences and it is uncomfortable to find ourselves hating him. The only thing the film is missing is Jean Arthur but Capra does make sure to include Gloria Grahame playing to type as flirtatious floozy.\n\nMost will find themselves loving this film and it is a decent choice if you are looking to occupy two hours of time but as much as there is that is good about it I was never really wowed and it felt far too long.",

It shows in stark clarity that the greed engendered in the capitalist system ruins both the lives of its poor victims and the happiness of the exploiter himself, Potter, who (like, for example, Donald Trump) can never accumulate enough to be content. \n\nThis is not a feel-good holiday movie like something from Disney. \n\n\"It's A Wonderful Life is a movie about socialism and how socialist values can triumph over capital. It makes a more thorough\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\"though at times subtle\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\"case for socialism than any piece of American popular culture I can think of and it contains as many lessons about solidarity and collective action as it does about the kind of holiday morality we usually associate with it.\"\nhttps://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/04/its-a-wonderful-socialist-life",

            "content": "A holiday classic that is really a gripping drama about one's man's life.\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946) is director Frank Capra's masterpiece of humanistic drama. He revels into the simple pleasures of family, kindness, giving, and decency. While often played during the Christmas season, It's a Wonderful Life carries a timeless message of appreciating what you have in life. It remains a beautiful film and timepiece of how people can treat each other better just for the sake of doing the right thing.\n\nCapra's direction is marvelous. The black and white colors are so crisp and carefully lit with bright lighting around the faces and moody street atmosphere. There are multiple long panning shots down streets and around corners that remain impressive technical feats. The few special effects of fading a person in or out are seamless, while the heavenly framing device is a charming as ever. Capra knew how to depict a man's entire life scene by scene by showing only what was necessary to understand how this man came to want to end it all. The graduation dance party over the pool is as impressive a sequence as the memorable Great Depression episode is likewise.\n\nJames Stewart is the protagonist George Bailey, whom we follow closely from adolescence to adulthood. Stewart is fascinating as the relatable everyman. You like him and want him to succeed because of his decency, but empathize with his pain as it all comes crumbling down around him time and again. Stewart gives one of his best and most versatile performances in It's a Wonderful Life. From joy for dreams to agony for loss, Stewart displays everything he had.\n\nDonna Reed is similarly magnificent. She is as lovely and charming as any young leading actress, but so sincere in her love for George. You hope for her happiness and Reed demonstrates a playful, kind, loyal, and thoughtful wife as any man could hope to marry one day. Reed captures the magic of real love on film in It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nI really appreciate the many great supporting roles from the boy that portrayed the childhood George to Lionel Barrymore as the greedy and lecherous Mr. Potter. Thomas Mitchell is so sweet and fun as Uncle Billy like Henry Travers is so naively innocent as George Bailey's guardian angel Clarence Oddbody.\n\nOverall, It's a Wonderful Life is to be cherished as it is appreciated. It is a lively and entertaining film, but also particularly well crafted by the master Frank Capra. Give it a watch and see if you like it.",

Why has the film gained cult like status?\nIt stars James Stewart in the star role as a character George Bailey who has done good deeds throughout his life but now doubts his contribution to the world around him, making him contemplate suicide on Christmas Eve.\nA trainee angel, Clarence literally saves him and in a parallel time line makes George realise what life would have been like without his interventions.\nGeorge part owns a loan company which faces financial problems and the possible imprisonment of George unless $8000 can be found to pay off the shortfall. \nGeorge saves his brother's life for example in 1919. His brother as an adult is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the Second World War.\nWe see the actions of a greedy man Mr. Potter throughout the film. The opposite to George in helping the local towns population in owning their own homes. He comes across as an evil banker. Charging high rents for poor properties.\nIn the angel Clarence's parallel timeline the local town Bedford Hills is renamed Pottersville.\nThere is also a second story in the film. The angel Clarence is 'second class' and as yet has no wings. Saving George just may earn him his wings and elevate him to a 'normal' angel level.\nIn the end George's fate is saved as the townfolk raise the cash and Potter, who attempts to have George jailed sees his warrant ripped up.\nA feel good film with some excellent performances. \nStewart revelled in this kind of role throughout his film career.\nThe history of the film reveals copyright issues. Colorization issues as discussed and a top Christmas film that could really be watched at other times of the year.",

Jimmy Stewart was a fine actor, though not in this; Capra made some great movies (It Happened One Night, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Arsenic and Old Lace), but as celebrated as this is, this is not one of them.
