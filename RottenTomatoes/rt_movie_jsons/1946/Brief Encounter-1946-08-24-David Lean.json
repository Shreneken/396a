Two people who meet by chance come to realize they enjoy being together and what started as a brief encounter turns into something quite unexpected. Love perhaps, or maybe just two people who had been existing in the vacuum of consistent, yet unfulfilling lives. They come to the realization they can't allow their relationship to continue at the expense of those who love them, and the expense of reputation, and self-respect.  Their parting is interrupted by a boorish acquaintance who has no idea she is making their final good-bye less than either would have wanted.  As inadvertently as the relationship began it ended. No final kiss or words of endearment, Simply, forward march, lone and never forgotten.",

The you start to understand the quality and depth of the script, the acting and the story.  I had not watched it for years, then did one afternoon and felt compelled to watch it again immediately.  I now think it might be the greatest film ever made. The breadth of meaning is vast, which would be a ridiculous claim if the quality of words, acting and scope were not so supremely high.  The England it depicts has completely and utterly disappeared, so all we are left with is what in it is universal and timeless.  It is a superb account of the shared sufferings of human beings, even when they are living calm, peaceful and relatively prosperous lives. It is sympathetic to every character, yet depicts acute suffering amongst those who feel they have no right to feel any sorrow of any kind. So English of an old fashioned kind.  It is a masterpiece.  Coward's script s pure Coward, so much so that it occasionally sounds like a parody of his rhetorical style, but ultimately it works perfectly.  I don't know how such a now historically, technically and socially distant film can be so affecting and seem so relevant, but it does.  It is also beautifully photographed and gives us a wonderful glimpse into the world of our grandparents that really existed.  Top top film that makes the vast majority of \n the financial behemoths of our day seem like a pile of rotten rubbish.  I actually love the way they used to speak.  Nowadays people sound like inarticulate ignorant idiots, as if to boast about their worthiness, whereas then they spoke well out of respect for others.  Great film.

            "content": "While it might not be on the level of Lawrence Of Arabia or The Bridge On The River Kwai in terms of film history, Brief Encounter is a clear display of supreme confidence and talent from legendary director David Lean. A remarkably simple story of 2 souls crossing paths and becoming permanently intertwined, it throws up issues regarding class, social standing and what it means to truly love a person for who they are, regardless of their background. Celia Johnson, in possession of one of cinemas most expressive faces, relates a story, supposedly to her husband but more to herself, which she could have told entirely without saying a single world; her face tells us everything we need to know. Trevor Howard makes a perfect companion, playing a man far more sure of what he wants, while also being at the mercy of his feelings, which he wears completely on his sleeve. I feel like their falling in love happens to quickly and too soon, and that a little bit more of a build up would have made it more convincing. But when they profess their love for one another you really feel it, and it's not hard to believe that they would have given up their ways of life for each other, even if it would have been scandalous all those decades ago. It's a very talky film, and the dialogue is often so fast that you might struggle to understand what's just been said. Despite these niggles, Brief Encounter is a classic of British cinema for a reason, and just one of many influential projects in David Lean's enviable filmography.",

In the film Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, neither overly beautiful or glamorous, live quiet, satisfying, expected lives until they meet by chance on their commute in a train station cafe. There are no grand, over the top gestures - just a quiet, believable friendship that in becoming naturally deeper catches its players offguard. Unlike other stories of the genre and time, Brief Encounter doesn't judge its lovers. There are no evil consequences for finding something beautiful with someone who isn't their spouce, only the heartbreaking consequences of it happening to those mindful of their \"duty\" and (unfortunately?) overly cautious in following their heart. The lovers' only doom is to returning to their previously satisfying loves and lives. We all have given up something and look back on it with regret and Brief Encounter shines a light on that inner corner of each of us. The performances are beautfiul, real, and worthy of such an epic of the soul. An under appreciated classic!",

            "content": "A realistic romantic affair between married lovers.\n\nDavid Lean's romance drama Brief Encounter (1945) is like the original In the Mood for Love with its nuanced portrayal of a desired affair between unhappy spouses. I love how Brief Encounter is told from the woman's perspective as it feels rare to find a film willing to take female desire seriously as an act of emotional satisfaction instead of simply a sexual theme. The impossibility of their love feels all the more enticing as you really are rooting for them to run away and be happy, knowing full well it would be wrong. David Lean's direction wants you to empathize with the adulterers, so see how miserable spouses may feel in a potentially loveless marriage.\n\nOn this Valentine's Day, I've been feeling lonely and wanted to cheer up by watching something romantic and Brief Encounter destroyed me. David Lean captures passionate love and tender flirting in his most succinct classic at a brief 86 minutes. Brief Encounters is an emotional epic as it lets your heart swell to massive proportions with a hopeless romantic sentiment. I think Brief Encounter is easily Lean's best film alongside Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nCelia Johnson gives her leading lady Laura Jesson her best tortured performance that glows with affection for her new love, while also endearing you to her playfully flirty lady. Her character shyly starts to relate to a fun partner, who shows her real attention. Her big, dark eyes draw you, so that you gaze into them the entire film, while she narrates her short fling with a married doctor. Her narration is honest as she admits her conflicted feelings, while expressing how tiresome the gossiping women around her are with their hilariously incessant talking.\n\nTrevor Howard and Celia Johnson have nice chemistry with subtle acting as they must quietly interact, so as not to get caught kissing in each other's arms. Howard's Dr. Alec Harvey is fairly open about his growing love for Laura Jesson in these sincere admissions of adoration. I really appreciate how Celia Johnson looks down or her eyes shine with an inner flame because she cannot quite confess her passionate love yet. They are extraordinarily well cast too because they look like they could be any random stranger in the audience, who happens to stumble into one another.\n\nNoel Coward's writing is ahead of his time with scandalous subjects like infidelity and a woman having the agency to actually admit to herself that she's unhappy in her marriage. All the conversations are dripping with curiosity, sincerity, patience, fondness, and even lust. I think Coward bravely bursts with passion for such a taboo subject matter in 1945. Robert Krasker's cinematography looks like a film noir, but the crime is adultery. All the shadowy silhouettes and endless fog with Brief Encounter a mysterious atmosphere that intrigues you immediately. Charles Staffell's fog effects look believable as do all the impenetrable darkness cascading across this dreary train station. Jack Harris' editing is quite clever and creative with sharp cuts from memory to reality or fade outs to a singular romantic encounter of note. \n\nIn short, I highly recommend Brief Encounter for David Lean's precise shots and dreamily romantic atmosphere. Celia Johnson should have won Best Actress at The Oscars for her timeless depiction of natural romantic need.",

It\u2019s heartwarming and makes you feel good when two people who are meant to be together find one another in a film, and recognize it from the first moment they meet. But when conflict arises in the story, I need something more to ground their relationship than that intangible feeling of \u201cfalling in love.\u201d And that\u2019s where my big problem with Brief Encounter begins. This is a film about two married people that become smitten with one another, despite the fact that they have perfectly wonderful home lives with caring spouses and children. I want to make it clear that I don\u2019t think this is a far-fetched story, or that people are not tempted to stray in scenarios very similar to the one we see in this film. In fact, part of what I dislike about the movie is the way the desires of these two people develops, because it feels exactly like the kind of slow fade that leads to any number of bad decisions we all make. I\u2019m also not claiming that I\u2019m somehow better than the main characters. While I haven\u2019t been unfaithful in my marriage, I\u2019ve certainly made mistakes and have regrets. But that doesn\u2019t mean I get enjoyment out of watching other people show terrible judgement. What irritates me even more in Brief Encounter is that the movie attempts to justify the actions of the two lead characters by blaming it all on \u201clove.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just old-fashioned or if I simply have a different mentality about this kind of thing than the rest of the world. But in my opinion, there was never any love experienced between these two characters. What they shared was some lustful desire, but they pretty it up by labeling it love because that removes some of their culpability. In truth, the most loving thing that either of these characters do for one another is when the doctor leaves and moves away with his family in order to break off this damaging relationship. That\u2019s my problem with movies like this, it feels as though the filmmakers expect me to be heartbroken at the end, but I\u2019m actually glad that their tryst is stopped. The other weird thing that bugged me in Brief Encounter is the internalized voiceover. It felt unnecessary, and it was made even weirder because it was spoken like an interactive discussion when she wasn\u2019t actually talking to anyone. There simply wasn\u2019t much that I could care about in this film, and it makes me angry that infidelity stories like this or The Bridges of Madison County are presented as \u201cromances.\u201d",

When the man (Trevor Howard) eventually departs politely for his train, he presses the shoulder of the woman (Celia Johnson) and slips out through the door.  She then takes the train with her friend, who continues to talk incessantly despite her obvious signs of grief.  It's at this point that director David Lean first brilliantly utilizes an interior monologue in the mind of the woman.  This leads to these fantastic lines:\n\n\"This can't last. This misery can't last. I must remember that and try to control myself. Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long. There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore, when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully 'how silly I was'.  No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days.\"\n\nI was hooked from then on, and the film never let up.  Based on a play by Noel Coward, it's very well written, and very well executed.  The British production has an intelligent, indie feel to it, it's without major stars, and has nothing resembling the fanfare typical of Hollywood movies at the time.  Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 provides a fantastic score, with dramatic moments, and following the ebb and flow of emotions perfectly.  \n\nAs you can probably guess, the pair are involved in forbidden love.  After returning home to her kind but somewhat boring husband, who takes more interest in crossword puzzles than in her, she recounts the past, starting again with a brilliant bit of us listening in to her thoughts:\n\n\"Fred, dear Fred. There's so much that I want to say to you. You're the only one in the world with enough wisdom and gentleness to understand. If only it was somebody else's story and not mine. As it is, you're the only one in the world that I can never tell. Never never. Because even if I waited until we were old, old people and told you then, you'd be bound to look back over the years and be hurt. And my dear, I don't want you to be hurt. You see, we're a happily married couple and let's never forget that. This is my home. You're my husband. And my children are upstairs in bed. I'm a happily married woman - or I was, rather, until a few weeks ago. This is my whole world, and it's enough, or rather, it was until a few weeks ago. But, oh, Fred, I've been so foolish. I've fallen in love. I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people.\"\n\nIn telling the story, the film captures what it's like to feel yourself slowly but inexorably drawn to another person, even while knowing it's wrong, feeling guilt, and telling yourself that it can't go on.  Those early innocent moments lead to those with the subtlest of sparks, and soon the two are on each other's minds throughout the week, until they might meet again each Thursday.  It's honest, and far from tawdry.  The pair simply fall in love, and as he puts it, \"It's no use pretending that it hasn't happened because it has.\"  It's romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nLean gives us several fantastic scenes on the railway platform.  I also loved the one with Johnson running down the street in the rain, and another with the camera twisting to an angle as it slowly zooms in on her face when he's left.  The inclusion of the relationship between an older caf\u00e9 owner (Joyce Carey) and a night watchman (Stanley Holloway) is playful and fun, and helps provide a counterpoint to the main story.  There is a lot to love here, including a powerful ending.",

What makes this one of the best, if not best, romances of all-time is that Lean makes it so we know this is wrong but we want it so badly but we are left heart-broken and ashamed.

            "content": "Brief Encounter is perfect. It's heartbreaking in its honesty, a true representation of what it's like to be in love. Laura and Alec are two trains going different directions, and their time together during the overlap in their respective journeys is a lovely little encapsulation of why human beings love one another and how cruel it is to live a life where it's taken away. It's so perfect, in fact, that it's really not right that such a masterpiece should be discussed in the context of another, but since I watched this film due to its relation to Carol, I nevertheless spent quite a bit of its runtime thinking about the thematic choices Haynes made when he decided to incorporate brief elements from this film in his own and will do so anyway.\n\nBrief Encounter is not a subtle film because it doesn't have to be. There is no subtext, as the entirety of the story is communicated through Laura's inner monologue, thoughts and feelings laid out along with the plot. When first considering the inclusion of this film's beginning/end structure, I briefly entertained the notion that this was a mistake, a reimagining of a straight story used to communicate a gay one to an audience and a regressive bit of \"gay via straight signifiers\" filmmaking that limits so much of queer cinema. I quickly decided that that was idiotic and moved on.\n\nIt's obvious that, by deliberately choosing to reference this film, Haynes wanted to make clear the difference between gay modes of communication and straight ones, pointing to the similarities of the two couples' situations (forbidden love) while ultimately revealing that though society forces straight people into rigid structures that prevent them from attaining happiness, it does so to an unbelievable degree for queer people. This is true to the point that we have been forced to create happiness in the midst of oppression, subtle looks and touches communicating what we can't say out loud, each little signal an act of rebellious defiance against a system that hates us. Haynes is a postmodern director, and so he made his film the way he did to make a specific point: Carol incorporates bits of Brief Encounter in order to proclaim its own emancipation, to state that it will refuse to compromise for the sake of straight people, to show that we have to hide twice as hard as any straight couple, to make clear that we will always survive even when society criminalizes our very existence.\n\nBoth films are masterpieces, but for entirely different reasons, Brief Encounter specifically for the reasons stated previously. Carol, on the other hand, is perfect because it adds a level to what its predecessor was trying to say, taking the universal text of what came before and making it queer. That little act of bold defiance is one that might not have ever been done before, making the film just as vital as the work it echoes because ultimately, we're just as important as those that would like to snuff out our own brand of love.",

But only to the external observer: inside Laura Jesson, everything does.

It's so overwhelmingly naive in tone and cliche in plot, and if it weren't so well executed I would have found it cloying and unpleasant. As it is, Celia Johnson has enough pathos and reserve to sell the character. \n\nRachmaninoff's 2nd piano concert is maybe the perfect musical pairing for this movie.
