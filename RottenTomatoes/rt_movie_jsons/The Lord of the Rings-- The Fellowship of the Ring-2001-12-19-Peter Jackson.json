Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",

When it comes to fans of the Middle-Earth series (both movies and books) there is one thing most of us can agree on, that being that Peter Jackson basically did just as much for J.R.R. Tolkien's stories as J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This movie has aged amazingly well in my opinion, the VFX & SFX both hold up today. FOTR is the perfect first act to a three-part story while telling a fantastic and well-fleshed-out story itself, it has the perfect mix of whimsical and dark fantasy. It handles nine lead characters beautifully without taking from the primary story at hand, it gives each of its leads a moment to shine and gives most of them complete individual story arcs. If you're a fan of the books who's never seen the movies, a fantasy movie fanatic who's never seen the movies, or even someone who's read the books and seen the movies it's worth watching (for the first time or a rewatch). This movie trilogy is one of those rare occasions where something that should've been impossible became a colossal success, this poster boy of the heroes' journey shows what can happen when you are passionate enough about something.",

It's long but dense and very entertaining, with just the right mix of action, wit, pathos, and grand spectacle. Director/co-writer Peter Jackson and his production team bring Tolkien's words to vivid life, immersing us in a Middle Earth that feels at once fantastical yet organic and earthy. The location shooting in Jackson's native New Zealand is often stunning. The cast sparkles across the board, from Viggo Mortensen's reluctant hero, to Elijah Wood's curious and brave Hobbit, to Christopher Lee's menacing turn as the evil wizard Saruman. Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, a blustery John Rhys-Davies, and especially Sean Astin make great fellowship mates. Ian McKellen is just grand as the wise and weary Gandalf. But two of the best moments go to the women in this tale, Liv Tyler and the luminous Cate Blanchett. What sets this apart from other inferior fantasy fare is the gravitas of the story. Death isn't greeted with one-liners, but with fear and grief. Each loss in the journey is deeply felt. The victories--small and large--are thrilling. It's a sweeping epic, one that gets us engrossed and involved, and makes us anticipate the next chapter of this saga",

            "content": "The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension\nThe first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.\n\nI loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.\n\nSome films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.\n\nBut after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.\n\nIt is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.\n\nThe LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",

This isn't your normal blockbuster adventure movie. Peter Jackson's direction and camerawork makes the movie much more engaging and a much better movie than any normal blockbuster.

The ending leaves you satisfied but also wanting more. Most of the film is dedicated to developing the world and characters. The main plot point takes place at the middle of the movie where The Fellowship team up. I have never read the books, so I cant really tell which parts are additions and how good those additions are. All I can say is every part of the movie serves in world building, expanding the plot or character development. So even if there are any additions, they are most probably good ones.\n\nI should probably mention the score. It is one of the highlights of the film and one of my favorite movie scores of all time. The Shire tune is sweet and innocent. As the film progress, just like the characters the tune grows. The Fellowship theme is brave and filled with hope. Sauron's theme also fits his character. It is terrifying and commanding. The other movies also have some standout themes. The battle scenes are epic in every sense of the word. The CGI and practical effects are also really good and hold up after even 20 years.\n\nAlmost every character in the fellowship is a great one. Not every character has an arc, but not everyone needs to. Some characters change over the course of all three movies, which perfectly suits them. Boromir has a perfect arc. He is selfish at first, but at the end of the film he sacrifices his life to save the Hobbits. The editing, sound design and cinematography are also stunning. It's a really good film overall.",

Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.\n\nHowever, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.\n\nNow I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.\n\nAnd the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.\n\nIn conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Strap in and take on this 3 hour film with me!\n\nFirst thing to be noticed is the narration, and for good reason. Not only is it the very first part of the film, but it's seriously great! The accent and the expression adds so much to the tone of what begins to unfold before your eyes and it's truly wonderful.\n\nAlso, this costuming. Holy cow it's gorgeous I mean even the horses have dope costumes on. _ did not miss on these costumes I was blown away with every single character that entered the screen.\n\nWhile the CGI is quite laughable, the film is still visually stunning. Even when you realize that it's a green screen of the poorer quality, the image is still gorgeous. Cinematography is great across the board and I'm surprised at how much detail was added into all the aspects of this film. Let me say it again, this cinematography is GREAT. Some shots made my eyes widen, others made me audibly gasp. Beautiful.\n\nI would be lying if I said the choreography in the fight scenes wasn't insane. The fights (while repetitive) are awesome. Easily the most entertaining part of the entire film!\n\nAlso good Lord this score is magical! It would give me goosebumps at times and would make me feel unsettled at others\u2026 I love the way music adds to a film, and this score is a prime example of that. Totally blown away by this orchestra! As the credits rolled, I just sat and listened to the gorgeous music. Such an amazing OST.\n\nWhile the film is extremely dramatic and focuses on its dark parts a lot, it's not without comedy. There's a lot of \"nose-laugh\" lines and even a few laugh out loud lines here and there so it really does break the almost constant tension throughout the entire three hours. I love a film that can mix drama in with comedy (which is why I love Bong Joon-Ho so much) so it's no wonder I enjoyed this!\n\nI enjoyed it! It's emotional, it's action packed, it's gorgeous. I'm not sure why people give it 5 stars but hey films are subjective. I can't wait to watch the rest of this trilogy!\n\nAlso DANGGG that boy Gandalf is olddd and homeboy runs MAD fast! Dude needs to join the NFL or maybe start running the 800 in track",

            "content": "Well... I'm afraid that this movie is by far the most disappointing film that I've ever sat down to watch. I came in with the greatest of expectations, as I've seen countless amazing reviews, articles, and even been directly told of the praise that this movie \"deserves\". How it's \"better than the book\", \"truly riveting\", \"the greatest action movie to date\", and so on. However, I simply cannot agree with any of those claims.  I think Peter cheapened much of the story, even beyond that of what's expected from compressing 423 pages down to 178 minutes worth of film *I watched the theatrical version*.  Since this review is already getting very long I'm going to list out the changes that Peter made that I think were for the worse. \n-Merry was re-written to become a Pippin part 2, which is especially terrible since in the original story they were quite different. Merry starts out responsible and leader-like then has to deal with feelings of loneliness and usefulness. While Pippin starts out naive and mistake-ridden then learns to become responsible and valiant. \n-Elrond and Galadriel are very dislikeable. I could smell their superiority complex through my screen.  \n-Gandalfs already 'not perfectly' written pre-fellowship journey becomes even worse. Like why go to Saruman before safely escorting the Hobbit to Rivendell? Why not go help the Hobbit directly after getting to Rivendell? What happened to the letter?  \n-Aragorn and Gandalfs relationship is too mysterious. You don't see them interact with each other much, Gandalfs speaks of no importance with Aragon, and all that makes Aragorn's presence at the prancing pony even more convenient. Furthermore, why weren't the Hobbits more suspicious of him when they met?  \n-Nazgul nerfed? Why was Aragorn able to solo 5 of the Nazgul with nothing but a sword and torch? In the book, they quickly fled because they thought that Frodo had no chance at surviving the wound, but in the movie, they stayed to fight with Aragorn for a bit before getting chased out because Aragorn was destroying them. \n-The Gandalf v Saruman fight was maybe the worst fight scene I've ever seen from such a big movie. Force pushing each other around with sticks, how exciting. \n-Elves were just cringy, with the blurring filter and ugly language, it was just too much. \n-Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir were less explained. In the books Legolas comes to tell about Golums escape, Gimli comes to discuss Saurons offer to the Dwarves on the lonely mountain, and Boromir comes to find counsel on his and Faramir's dreams. But in the movie, they are just there because they are important figures in their kingdoms.   \nAlthough I have plenty of gripes with the movie I think it still did a fine job. I thought the production quality was outstanding, even for 2021's standards. I also like that Arwen became more prevalent in the story, although her being the one sent to help Aragorn and the Hobbits makes no sense but exploring her and Aragorn's relationship early on was a definite plus to the story.  So overall I don't think it's bad but it stacks nowhere near the original story and I can't believe that anyone can say otherwise, but I seem to be in the minority so maybe I'm just wrong.",

When it comes to fans of the Middle-Earth series (both movies and books) there is one thing most of us can agree on, that being that Peter Jackson basically did just as much for J.R.R. Tolkien's stories as J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This movie has aged amazingly well in my opinion, the VFX & SFX both hold up today. FOTR is the perfect first act to a three-part story while telling a fantastic and well fleshed out story itself, it has the perfect mix of whimsical and dark fantasy. It handles nine lead characters beautifully without taking from the primary story at hand, it gives each of its leads a moment to shine and gives most of them complete individual story arcs. If you're a fan of the books who's never seen the movies, or a fantasy movie fanatic who's never seen the movies, or even someone who's read the books and seen the movies it's worth watching (for the first time or a rewatch). This movie trilogy is one of those rare occasions where something that should've been impossible became a colossal success, this poster boy of the heroes' journey shows what can happen when you are passionate enough about something.",

            "content": "I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.\n\nAfterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.\n\nThe ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.\n\nAnd afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.\n\nThe movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.",

The acting is outstanding with almost every performer, and the emotion from shot-to-shot and scene-to-scene is carried out perfect in terms of consistency.  The Cinematography, CGI and Production Design are absolutely amazing (well, the CGI was for 2001) and the Musical Score and Sound Mixing are better than most movies I can think of.  It's an absolute home-run in regards to both its artistic and technical merits, and Peter Jackson's perfectly done Directing proves just how powerful it is when a filmmaker truly BELIEVES in the world they are creating.  And in all honesty, I cannot think of anything genuinely bad in regards to this film, in either cut (Theatrical or Extended), no matter how small.  It's easily one of the best Swords and Sorcery films ever made, and having watched it without reading the book first, I was absolutely enamored every step of the way, and when the characters underwent deep emotional losses, I was completely misty-eyed with them.

I got it as a birthday present, left it on the movie shelf to dust, and one Sunday afternoon my parents, brother, and I decided to give it a go. That's a day I won't EVER forget. Luckily, we decided to watch it weeks prior to the Two Towers release. It's just incredible how they're almost twenty years old, and they look as perfect and magical as if they were shot last year. Outstanding, timeless filmmaking.\n\nA book-to-film adaptation that could've gone so wrong just didn't. On the contrary. The result was a near-perfect (if not perfect) cinematic experience, overall. There's not one thing that's not perfectly told, shown, or exposed, from beginning to end. Hobbits, elves, dwarfs, men, wizards, creatures, monsters, and even a whole language, created by a man that convinced, not just himself, but the whole world (including Peter Jackson) that Middle Earth was real. A world so beautiful, and yet so dark, that will remain as timeless as its characters, adventures, and life lessons.\n\nA franchise I won't EVER get tired of watching, over and over again.\n\n*If you have the chance of getting a copy, physical or digital, of the 4K re-masters, they're totally worth it. The work they did is unbelievably good. The Dolby Atmos upgrade was amazing, too.\n\n*Watched the extended version; don't know if this was my first time since I couldn't recall some of the additional footage that's not on the theatrical version. Totally loved it. And as people say, once you go for the extended, you can't go back to the theatrical (and maybe they're right).",

A great start to the franchise.\n\n'The Lord of the Rings' is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.\n\n'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.\n\nI love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\n\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\n\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\n\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.\n\nVery eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.",

Like another fantasy epic, Dune, there are so many popcorn connections, with Wood, McKellan, Weaving, Mortensen, Lee, Blanchett, Bloom (swashbuckling as he does best), Bean (dying as he does best), and Liv Tyler... Liv Tyler... Liv Tyler...... and more. It's a veritable nexus in the popcorn universe. The cinnamontography and production value is second to none, weaving amazing CGI, sets, and costumes with the natural beauty of New Zealand. Its cool to see stuff from the Hobbit in this movie, like the Shire, Gollum, the trolls that got turned into stone, and some of the merry dwarves that travelled alongside Bilbo on his adventure (most of them are skeletal corpses in this one). Like the Dark Lord Sauron himself, Rotten Tomatoes has given us all dominions of power to review movies for them. Then, again like the Dark Lord Sauron, they forged the super reviewer status to rule them all. They don't realize what good it could do by giving us super reviewer status after literally hundreds of movies, and hundreds more to go. The power to save all people from shitty movies... it  calls to us... it is precious to us... and we wants it.... nyaaaagh!! RT, give us the precious!!!!",

            "content": "The Fellowship of the Ring originally released in 2001 and has stood the test of time. A brilliant foundation of the trilogy filled with spectacular landscapes, an epic musical score, and superb acting. \n\nFirst, for being a 3 hour movie (theatrically) it is paced quite well. It starts a brief history of the ring of power before turning to the quiet peace of The Shire. After Frodo and Sam leave the Shire, we get to witness some stunning cinematography throughout the gorgeous Middle Earth. Honestly it's like Planet Earth with orcs just absolutely breathtaking. Even the set pieces match the wonder of the world between Rivendell and the Mines of Moria. \n\nNow, what elevates great movies to master class can be the score. With the entire trilogy, Howard Shore crafted some of the most moving pieces of music to make their way into movies. Just listening to the soundtrack will take you on the journey of the Fellowship. Adding it into the movie just isn't fair to other movies. Perfection. \n\nThe Lord of the Rings would not be as good as it is without solid acting. A few favorites: Sean Bean as Boromir, Sean Astin as Sam, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Nearly 20 years later and I still cry on the floor when Boromir gives his life for the Fellowship. When Gandalf falls in the Mines and we all need a break to handle our emotions. Don't even get me started on the music in those scenes. \n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring is an epic that has aged like a fine wine. Cinematography, music, and solid acting are just the tip of the iceberg in this expertly crafted tale. If you've never seen it before it is a must watch. If you have seen it, then it's about time to watch it again. One does not simply find flaws in this perfect movie.",

The score (music) in the movie is not only terrific, but also matches the movie better than almost any movie I've seen. Coupled with beautiful cinematography and a few other elements, it helps create beautiful, sad, touching, inspiring, and heroic scenes in the movie. The VFX still looks good in most scenes and even in scenes where it isn't great, it's still not bad. Along those lines, the makeup is great. Watching it 20 years later, the orcs look like orcs and not men in makeup and costumes. As mentioned earlier, the cinematography is outstanding. All of the acting is terrific and the characters are very likable. Unlike most movies, there isn't a single character that I dislike in this movie. I could say much more but I'll sum this all up by saying that I think this is an incredible action/adventure/fantasy movie that has aged very well. 5/5.",

It's good high fantasy, which can mean it's a little whimsical and silly at times (especially the Hobbits and Elves). The slow-mo didn't age very well, but the CGI and practical effects still hold up really well for the most part. I was worried watching the extended version that I'd get bored, but I was glad to find I did not as the story is well paced and engaging. Though we did end up splitting it over two days.

There might be a bit too much exposition but I say to that you're being introduced to a whole new world and for films like these you do need a little more exposition than usual. This, in my opinion, is the best work of worldbuilding of all time and the whole trilogy has the best worldbuilding in my opinion from Gondor to the Shire to Mordor it just has an atmosphere from the score to the location/set to the acting and the costumes and the script it all contributes to the amazing atmosphere no other film can achieve. This has the best score of all time in my opinion and it is one of the most iconic and whenever I hear it I just get happy because of the happy nature of the song I clearly love it. I think this film has the most perfect cast of all time from Elijah Wood being Frodo to Ian McKellan being Gandalf to Sean Austin being Sam to Viggo Mortensen being Aragorn just perfectly cast. This film has some of the most iconic characters to like Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn they are so iconic even side characters like Pippin and Mary. On top of the iconic score and characters, you have so many iconic scenes like the, you shall not pass scene and many more. This film creates a sense of nostalgia for Gandalf it has something to do with wise people like you know them but you don't know them it,s weird and he is one of my all time favorite film characters along with Gollem/Smeagol. I love the cinematography and I don't know how they did the height thing with Gandalf and everyone else it might have been a green screen but either way it looks really good. I love the story so much at the base of it its just Frodo returning the ring to Mount Doom but they make it so much more complicated for the better of the story. This film really holds up with today's blockbusters and even better than a lot of them I like this trilogy more than the Hobbit as much do but I didn't think I would like this at all but the whole trilogy made it into my top three films of all time and that really surprised me even though I like this trilogy more the Hobbit trilogy will hold a special place in my heart. I don't know if this was shot on film but it looks really good it almost looks a little like the film they used for star wars. This film in my opinion has the biggest cliff hanger of all time. I swear Andy Serkis deserves an oscar by now he has such a stacked career and he does better than some actors working now with his motion-capture acting to the movements and the facial expressions he has to do for this and the plant of the apes trilogy. This film has so many memorable lines and iconic lines like the one Gandalf said to Frodo when he said he can't carry the ring he said \"All we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us.\" he is so wise. One of my favorite scenes of all time is the one when Gandalf and Frodo are having a heart to heart moment when they are stuck and dont know which way to go it is such a real scene and will stick with you till the end and that is where that line came from it. The action scenes really hold up with the action today and that is kinda surprising.\n\nI love the use of practical effects with makeup instead of green screening most it in this trilogy and I wish that they used practical effects in the Hobbit trilogy it would have made that so much better. The sound mixing and the sound design is amazing with all of the orcs and the creatures it still holds up with today's films. I don't think they could have chosen a better filming location than New Zealand it fits the Middle-Earth atmosphere. I love the subtle color grading in each scene from the night time sequences to the day it looks amazing. The script is amazing and one of the best in my opinion. There is so much character development in this and I absolutely love it. If there is one thing that got snubbed in the trilogy it was Elijah Wood's acting it is actually really good and everyone did the best. The editing is pretty good mixed with the score adds so much tension and suspense in each scene. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

I love this story and thought that Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of the novels was even better than the original source material, in my own personal opinion. This movie got so many things right, every actor in this whole movie was amazing, the script is exceptionally well written with emotional investment for every character, the effects were almost all practical with real actors and real sets that they built which all look stunning especially for 2001, and Howard Shore's score for this film is almost as good as John Williams Star Wars score, it is emotionally moving and has me in tears, it also really adds to the way the story plays out, Its almost as if each song is it's own little story even, I adore it and think that it is one of the best originally composed scores for a movie ever and Howard Shore is definitely deserving of the Oscar he received. Andrew Lesnie shot this movie perfectly, the way that the shots are constructed really speak to you and adds more tension to the story, he rivals Roger Deakons and he definitely deserved the Oscar that he won for this film. Elijah Wood has a career in acting thanks to these movies, and he is really good, Sean Astin is my personal favorite and he gives an amazing performance and I see him as good ol' Samwise Gamgee, I really don't understand how he didn't get tons of other acting roles because of this, he is so damn good I still can't believe it. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are both pretty good as well providing some good comic relief and great companionship to Frodo and Sam. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies have great chemistry together as the oddball BFF's of the group, I enjoyed seeing both of them, particularly together. Viggo Mortensen was phenomenal, he takes his role so seriously and he blends behind Aragorn so well, that I really believe that's who he is, I loved him so much in this movie. Sean Bean is a very underrated actor who performed very well for this movie, I loved seeing the struggle he had, he was fighting himself the whole time and you could feel that start to seep through with his masterful performance, this is perhaps the best performance of his career, his death is one of the most memorable and emotional deaths in cinematic history, it is played out perfectly and redeems the character of his previous faults, Boromir is one of my favorites of this whole trilogy. Ian McKellen was dazzling, he was so good I can't put it into words, he was the best written and acted character and he is iconic, he made Gandalf one of the most recognized and important characters in all of cinema. I love the entire mines of Moria sequence, it is so intense and exciting, the camera angles, the music, the gorgeous cinematography, and the great practical effects all contribute to an amazing action sequence that doesn't let up, and it ends with the very emotional \"death\" of Gandalf, I know that he comes back, but I still tear up every time. This movie is my personal favorite of the three and has no problems, I exclusively watch the extended edition and at three and a half hours, I never get bored and I still want more. This is a must-watch masterpiece of a lifetime that literally everyone should experience.",

            "content": "I have never read any of J. R. R. Tolkien's writings and my understanding of the story of The Lord of the Rings going into this film was very limited. Because of that I did find myself lost at points but the basic statements that the film made were enough to tether into and the likable characters kept me afloat as I attempted to remain engaged with the film. Knowing that there are two more films of considerable length to get through in order to complete this saga does daunt me but I enjoyed this film more than I expected to. The special effects and world building were great and although the wild shifts in tone take some getting used to the dark subject matter is dealt with better than in say Game of Thrones.\n\nFrodo Baggins, Elijah Wood, is sent off with the One Ring, an all powerful ring created by the evil Sauron, Sala Baker, to control humans, by Gandalf, Ian McKellen, after it's longtime owner Bilbo Baggins, Ian Holm, becomes enchanted by it. He brings his close friend Samwise Gamgee, Sean Astin, along with him on the journey and they are joined by Merry, Dominic Monaghan, and Pippin, Billy Boyd. They meet Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen, on their way to Rivendell and when Frodo is stabbed with a Morgul blade he is rescued by Aragorn's girlfriend Arwen, Liv Tyler. Meanwhile Gandalf is imprisoned by Saruman, Christopher Lee, who has become enthralled by the ring but he is able to escape on an eagle's back and join the men. Frodo is forced to continue his journey with the ring because he is the only person with enough restraint not to fall prey to Sauron.\n\nThe most impressive part of the film was it's production design and the innovative special effects used. The world the film is set in appears real despite the fantastical images that the book presumably asks Jackson to conjure. The sight of miniature Elijah Wood speaking to a monolithic Ian McKellen is fascinating and although the special effects used to show Sauron and the nature of Rivendell haven't aged well they are still admirable for the time. If this element of the film wasn't up to snuff then the film would be almost unwatchable but because the sights the film presents are jaw dropping I was able to accept the fantasy of the situation the film presents.\n\nThe story itself confused me and there was so much information dropped in during Cate Blanchett's opening narration that it would have been impossible to pick up on it all if you had not read the book. I will not penalize it for that because most people going into the film will have been fans of the book and already know all the backstory the various scenes we see but Jackson does a very good job at providing enough context to understand the scenes for the uneducated viewer. Personally I thought that the most interesting part of the film was the first half because it concerned the personal lives of the characters more than physical battles with fantastical creatures but I think that the film as a whole is fairly entertaining. The end of the film was unsatisfying to me because I felt as though it was the only reason that two characters existed but I suppose that was why there was a sequel.\n\nMortensen does a good job as Aragorn, he appears authoritative and charming in his role even though he is written as a near-perfect figure. The accents seem to be all over the place but I don't know if that is accounted for in the book and the cast do a very good job of playing broad characters with some humanity. Tyler lacks charisma as a love interest and although she works with terrible dialogue I would have appreciated a romantic heroine with more backbone. \n\nIf I am honest this can be a real chore of a film if you aren't into the source material and I would never have watched if I weren't trying to watch every Best Picture winner ever, the third film in the series is the 2004 winner. It is a film that you should see however if you want to watch essential cinema of the 2000s because it was a major cultural moment and made significant technical advances.",

The special effects team were highly skilled to use and twist special effects to match the needs of Jackson\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s fantasy. One of the great examples is how they used the special effects to portray the actors to be shorter than they actually are. For example Elijah Wood\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s height is 5\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)6 but in the movie he is portrayed as 3\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)6. Another example of the great special effects of the movie is the CGI on the creature Balrog which was made completely from computer graphics along with other creatures makes the monster and creatures seem real. The most prominent and best display of special effects and CGI is on the cursed creature Gollum. With Gollum the special team used new and various methods to make him look as real as possible. With the help of CGI and special effects Jackson has made The Lord of The Rings into a movie to remember.",

Example: \"Let's take a shortcut!\" \"A shortcut to what?\" [trips over, lands at the base of a tree and sees...] \"Mushrooms\" Twenty odd years later we take this film for granted but it was SO brilliantly done. Thanks Fran, Pippa and Peter!!",

Intanto parto col dire che \u00e8 la Trilogia fantastica per eccellenza, ormai divenuta cult, perfetta sotto quasi ogni aspetto. Ogni cosa \u00e8 resa al meglio e non ci sono difetti dal punto di vista tecnico; regia di Peter Jackson perfetta, fotografia bellissima e effetti speciali da paura. Le scenografie, le ambientazioni, il trucco e i costumi sono eccellenti. Le musiche e il montaggio delle musiche azzeccatissimi. Dal punto di vista narrativo nulla da dire anche perch\u00e9 non ho letto i libri, purtroppo. Il personaggio che pi\u00f9 mi \u00e8 piaciuto \u00e8 stato Samvise, interpretato da Sean Astin che \u00e8 stato semplicemente magnifico; senza di lui Frodo non avrebbe fatto tutto quello che ha fatto, il vero Eroe della trilogia, soprattutto nell'ultimo film (\"Il Ritorno del Re\"). Spettacolari anche Ian McKellen (Gandalf), che ha regalato diverse perle divenute cult, e Andy Serkis che ha interpretato Gollum, personaggio bello e brutto allo stesso tempo. Di grandissima potenza i dialoghi di Gollum che ha due personalit\u00e0, Smeagol (il suo nome originale) e appunto Gollum. Ottimi anche gli altri personaggi. Gli ultimi 50 minuti del terzo film sono di una intensit\u00e0 pazzesca, perfetti sotto ogni punto di vista. Tra i tre film ovviamente ho preferito il terzo ma son tutti e tre fantastici, trilogia UNICA firmata Peter Jackson.",

Peter Jackson and the two other screenwriters all wrote an amazing adapted screenplay bringing great detail from the book onto the screen. The direction given by Peter Jackson is quite amazing as he captures everything needed, directs large groups of people in some scenes very well and brings the story to life which is why he was perfect for the job. The whole cast is full of a lot of big and good actors that all do a great job with their roles giving great performances. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee and Sean Astin are all the main people who all were great for their roles and did them successfully.

The groundbreaking special effects  in the film definitely can't go unnoticed because it's visually outstanding and it's part of what makes the movie as good as it is.

The Ring was held by Bilbo Baggins for many years till he decided to give it to his nephew Frodo. The film begins with an old-fashioned storybook introduction, where they narrate the history of the Ring, which was great because I knew nothing about this trilogy. The film centres around Frodo as he embarks on an adventure with his companions, The Fellowship, to Mount Doom to get rid of the Ring. Throughout their adventure, the Ring visibly becomes its own character that is so feared, almost like a prisoner. An inanimate object possessed by an evil force is something you expect to see from a horror movie, but it evidently works better in this genre. The Fellowship is greeted by many creatures, terrifying for the audience but probably beautiful to the filmmakers. The movie is filled with scenic shots that seem to be too good to truly exist in this world. I would be more surprised if the backdrops are not shot in front of a green screen. It contains effects that I did not expect to come from a 2001 movie. I also noticed some kind of resemblance in its production to Game of Thrones. It is of a complex source material but is brought to life as clear as can be. On the contrary, it seems that they left the Saruman storyline unintended, but I could have blinked and missed something. The movie ends with a lot of despair yet so much hope. It does not really have a cliffhanger, but you will still ask \"what's next\". Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring beautifully brings to life a story that appeals not only to those who follow the source material, but also to those who do not, and will most likely continue appealing to future generations.\n\n---\nfollow https://www.instagram.com/movietvstance/",

Tolkien's masterpiece of a book so enjoyable in the first place. I'll first start off with how much I love Peter Jackson's directing style. To turn a book of that magnitude into a movie is just amazing. And on top of that, the way he did it was just... CRAZY! This guy had no business creating a Lord of the Rings film - he had no experience in the genre, he hadn't made a single blockbuster yet, and was specifically in the horror genre scene (apart from Heavenly Creatures). But man did he do it, and did it better than anyone ever could. Beyond just the directing, however, lies a scale that has never been reached before - and probably never will after. The world building is truly astonishing and breathtaking. There is just nothing like it. The writing is also fantastic, and so are the visuals. Man, gives me goosebumps just thinking about it all. Anyways, we also have the acting. Elijah Wood delivers on so many levels. Giving a young actor like him, such a huge role and then succeeding at it so well, is fantastic. Ian McKellen is captivating as Gandalf. He's both sincere and warm. Viggo Mortensen is intense, Sean Astin is moving and Cate Blanchett is magical. Sean Bean gives one of, if not his best performance ever, and the Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan combination is just purely fantastic casting. The costume design is also stupidly jaw dropping - it brings so much more realism to the screen. Sometimes I can't believe how great it is. The score is gorgeous as well. Howard Shore created a masterpiece. All in all, this film is spectacular in every way, shape and form.

            "content": "As a big fan of Tolkienian world, I precise that I'm going to review the extended edition movies. I obviously start with The Fellowship of the Ring, my favourite movie of the three, and I specify why: I found the novel too slow and a little bit boring, but this movie has been capable of gripping me and I appreciated that. A description of the plot wouldn't be necessary if one had read the novel, but let's write a bit about it. Frodo Baggins, a hobbit, receives a magic ring from his uncle Bilbo but according to the wizard Gandalf's researches, the ring is cursed, because the Dark Lord has put in it a piece of his black evil soul and everyone who keeps the One Ring will have a corrupted soul for ever. So Frodo has to travel with his friend Samvise Gamgee and his cousins Meriadoc Brandibuck and Peregrin Tuc. When they get to Elrond the elf's home and after a very long meeting, Elrond decides to make a Fellowship of heroes from different free Middle Earth's races: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pipin for Hobbits, Legolas Leafgreen for Elves, Aragorn II son of Arathorn, Gondor heir and Boromir son of Denethor for Men, Gimli son of Gloin for Dwarves and Gandalf as a guide. The fellowship has to get to Mordor and destroy the One ring in the only way it can be destroyed: by throwing it in the Mount Doom, a giant volcano in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. But during the journey Saruman the white, an evil-becomed wizard, attacks the Fellowship. At the end Sam and Frodo decide to leave the Fellowship and continue their mission alone, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to hunt some orchs who had kidnapped Merry and Pipin. Gandalf has died during a fight. As I've seen the extra contents of my extended edition blu-ray box, I can definetly say that we're talking about a technical masterpiece, but I have to complain about the screenplay: I know that Peter Jackson has made a 1200 pages book into a 150 pages scrrenplay, but in the novel there is an episode (the Hobbits meet Tom Bombadil) that isn't even mentioned in the movie, neither in the \"normal\" edition nor in the extended one. Anyway, even if Christopher Tolkien (J. R. R. Tolkien's last living son) is against Peter Jackson's work, I strongly disagree, because this big troupe has worked a lot and has spent bilions of dollars to make this movies and I think that this Fellowship of the Ring is the best Tolkien adjustements that could have been made. 4 and a half stars completely deserved.",

            "content": "The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and \"epic\" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.\n\nI don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.\n\nThere are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.\n\nThe second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.\n\nMy other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time.\n\n..but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read \"The Lord of the Rings\" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Silmarillion\" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in \"The Hobbit\" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.\n\nThose who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.\n\nOk, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.\n\nAs for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.\n\nThe actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried \"ranger\". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.\n\nQuite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25\u00a2 novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",

The movie makes me feel hopeful. As many moments as there were where the characters experience a lapse of judgment, such as Boromir coming after Frodo and trying to steal the ring just before the battle with the Orcs, Boromir proceeds to redeem himself by sacrificing his life for Merry and Pippin's, as well as declaring his loyalty to Aragorn as his king and their homeland of Gondor.\n\nThe movie made me think about how relatable these events and reactions are, as well as how there's a recurring theme between this movie and others like it. In one of the Harry Potter movies (I can't remember which one) Dumbledore says, \"We must choose between what is easy and what is right.\" I feel that the altercation between Frodo and Boromir is an example of that. One thing I found to be particularly interesting was that the ring wraiths seem to fear the elements. This is shown when Aragorn fights them off with fire, and when Arwen sends the rushing water after them after she rescues Frodo to bring him to Rivendell for her father Elrond to save him.\n\nI would have liked to see the special effects done differently. Specifically in the prologue scenes, there were moments where the effects stood out and didn't exactly feel to have cohesiveness within the scenes. I also would have liked to see slower dolly shots. Specifically in the scene where Gandalf and Frodo are talking about the ring and its powers, there were quite a few slow dolly shots used for suspense and reaction. I feel that they would have created even more suspense and a stronger reaction if they were slowed down even more, though maybe that's just the style that I'm used to seeing in films made for today's audience.",

But the spectacular grandiosity of it all invokes a feeling of nostalgia and awe at the fantasy elements and characters. A truly exciting start to the series. Rating: 83",

The Lord of the Rings trilogy is clearly a labour of love for Peter Jackson and everyone involved in this film from the acting, costumes, props, music, cgi and beyond. The film is able to take the most important parts of the novel and create Middle Earth on screen in a very believable manner, using the different languages from the books such as the Elvish languages and Black Speech and the landscapes and structures depicted by Alan Lee and John Howe. With such a big cast it's also an achievement that every main character is so well performed, fleshed out and memorable, with Elijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen's giving particularly great performances. This film has something for everyone whether you are a fan of the books or not, with a mixture of action, romance, humour and high fantasy that is a great introduction to the trilogy and builds excitement for the next film.",

I prefer the more complex and exciting storytelling of the likes of \"The Two Towers\" or Game of Thrones, but this is a nice, warm, and inviting film, that sets the stage well for the rest of the series (including the Hobbit films). I give it 3 1/2 stars for story, but boost it to 4 stars for all that it accomplished visually and in terms of film making technique. It is without a doubt a classic and groundbreaking film.",

The very talented cast definitely add that great sense of realism to the world, appearing ultimately convincing in their roles they play so ingeniously. The special effects were done strikingly well, with the monsters looking life like, especially because of the crisp direction. The action in this film knows where it needs to be to fit in with the captivating drama, and finally, despite this being a very long film, and being a very good film - I'd usually say this almost four hour film flew by in a breeze, but I could acknowledge that this film was four hours long and it felt four hours long to me, but I didn't want it to end.

Unfortunately for this movie it does have a book attached to it. The text is a war narrative and we don't really get that feel from the movie. In the film we also loose a lot of the heroism in Frodo as he is forced into and out of situations and is forced into quick decisions that he does not make in the book.",

This review may contain spoilers about the book and not the movie in order to give a fair review the book has to be mentioned.]\n\nThe movie was overall enjoyable with some clear great points and fails. To begin the positives of the move were not few which is a good thing in its own right but onto what those positives are. First was the fitting music and how it enhanced the experience of every scene it was placed in. Second is the CGI effects and how it really added to the depth of the story because of how well done the effects were. The final positive is that the camera angels and lighting where spot on for every scene. Now onto the negatives, to start the filmmakers decided to leave out the character of Tom Bombadil form the text. This being a negative in two ways the first being that film makers do not show that there is a living being alive that is able to overcome the rings power. The second is that the entire forest journey was cut out and that part of the story was so pose to set in the fear of being far away from home in the hobbits. The second negative is that the filmmakers overextended the love story of Aragorn/Strider and Arwen when it was only insinuated in the novel. The final negative is that when Frodo leaves the Fellowship his companions let him go instead of trying to find him and stop him like in the text. So, overall the movie was quite enjoyable but should be taken with a grain of salt as there are many inaccuracies in this film, but even so this gets a sold 3.5-4/5 stars from me.",

The story is a classic, which may be why this, the first of the trilogy, was so much more successful than most other films in its position. Even as this being so I did not find the movie all that great. I found it to be not as similar to the book as I would have hoped it would be. It excluded some important scenes and also included unnecessary romances and scenes. The special effects of the movie were well done in my opinion, the scenes were well depicted and most of the time very accurate. Despite the high stakes of being killed at any moments by anything evil the script keeps the humor and excitement alive in every scene. The background music and sound effects really brought the movie to life and made sure there wasn't a boring moment in the movie. All of the acting was spectacular and the actors really were able to become the character. I would recommend the movie to anyone who likes fantasy action or The Lord of the Rings books. It is very serious, so don't watch it with a big group unless that group is interested in the movie instead of socializing. The movie is extremely long, so if you refuse to dedicate three hours in any variations of division to one movie, watch the cartoon version. Overall Rating: 2.5",

            "content": "I could start off by claiming that all the characters in the Lord of the Rings are two-dimensional, with little depth, and hardly any character development. I could state how there is nothing interesting about some characters in the universe and they are all black and white with some having little to no motive. I could say that it's foolish to focus so much on the creation of orcs just for them to die an hour later in the film. But it's simply not the truth. Now let me begin by saying I truly love the Lord of the Rings films. I do. However, a particular problem within the trilogy is a lack in development of a large amount of characters.  Specifically within The Fellowship of the Ring I'm here to talk about one of the movies biggest flaws. With the lack of development of character in the films, one of the biggest crimes was killing off one of the most full-fledged characters in the first movie, Boromir. Why was it essential to kill this character fairly early on within the lore? What purpose does it serve to the story and overall arc? Why focus on the development of his character to kill him off so early on?\n\n\tBoromir was something of an exception to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In a universe where every character is regarded as good or evil, Boromir is one of the few in the gray area. His character is neither good or bad. His character has depth to it, it has struggles like the everyday man does. He is a good man who is struggling with the weight of his legacy within the fellowship. The ring sees this and prays upon it to tempt his will. It's something that makes him a 3-dimensional character, and one of the very first in the overall story. Though he was willing to do evil to get the ring, the ring was tempting him with a good purpose, to save his people. There are few people in The Lord of the Rings trilogy who experience the same kind of character exploration throughout their time on screen, needless to say how short his was. This is what makes Boromir such a greatly developed character, which is why it's bitter-sweet when his character meets an end.\n\n\tHis death is especially criminal to the character in general. As in the books Boromir's death occurs within \"The Two Towers\" rather than \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". Had they kept it true to the original text they could have interpreted more in the second movie, rather than spending a large portion of it waiting for the Ent's to decide if they would help the twins or not. There would have been more content within the storyline, and it would have kept a great character rolling throughout more than just one hour within the entirety of the films. This could have made him more of a key character. However, they decided to cut his character short and leave us departed from a great character sooner than what was necessary.\n\n\tSo what's the point of all of this, you might ask. As great a character as Boromir is, the flaw within the story is that his character is only within the story for a mere hour. And over this hour, this one character had more of a story to him than other characters such as Legolas and Gimli, who had been covered for 3 movies. In fact Legolas only had 37 lines throughout all three of the films, only one of these lines was said to Frodo. Yes, Boromir seems like a minor role when compared to others, however, the fact that we got to see all sides to Boromir within his struggle, and only seemingly generic stories, in comparison, from other characters who were panned through all 3 films, speaks for itself.\n\nThe lacking choice of character development, and where, is one of the trilogy's major flaws. Leaving your characters who were maintained through a larger amount of time underdeveloped and exploring characters who have minimal screen time is not ideal for the development of roles throughout the films. Underdevelopment in lengthier characters is a poor choice, especially when the time used on Boromir could have been used to expand on a larger character, maybe such as the twins, or even Frodo a bit more, learn more about Sarumon and his motives, etc. The character of Boromir should have been extended into the second film for the use of further content, which would also help extend the point of him being as developed as he was, and driving the plot to be more correct to the original lore.",

Cinematography is also flawless. It looks absolutely stunning and gorgeous and was actually filmed and shot in New Zealand so it's not all just CGI like everything nowadays. \n\nActing is amazing. Okay the acting may not be Oscar worthy but it's not because the acting is bad it's because Oscar worthy acting is not required in this type of film. The plot is very interesting and original and is also not a generic, boring and lame plot like we see rehashed in all the movies nowadays. The setting is beautiful and intriguing and has its own world called Middle-Earth. \n\nOne of the best things about this movie and series is it has its own world and culture. Every character, villain, enemy, language, culture, and race has its own unique background and origin created by Tolkien in his book. For instance, Legolas and the elves have their own language and lifestyle they live by. So do the Hobbits, Men, and Dwarves. Except not all of them have their own language but they do all have their own lifestyle. \n\nThe theme is a very inspiring theme. \"What is the theme\" you might ask. Well it's to fight evil temptations you deal with everyday and to ultimately win the battle with temptation and to always do what is good and right even with all the evil and temptation surrounding you. Lastly, and explaining how this movie could be better than ones like Godfather or Citizen Kane is all three of those are epic, inspiring, well developed, well executed, well acted, well directed, and very popular and beloved. \n\nBut why makes Lord of the Rings better than those? Well first of all it has a better score and probably the best score of all time. Also has better cinematography and design. But it all comes down to Lord of the Rings is just as good movie and critic wise as both of those but manages to be way more entertaining. Honestly it's jut more versatile because it can be just as epic, well acted, and directed but still be one of the most entertaining movies as well.",

The sweeping landscapes and excellent writing transports us to a world that feels mesmerizing and familiar, all at the same time. \n\nThe Fellowship Ring may not be the best of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it sure isn't far off.",

Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.\n\nI have been a huge fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' since I first read Tolkien's masterpiece in Middle School. I was so disappointed in Hollywood's first attempt to bring this classic story to the big screen---a regrettable 1978 animated version. I was absolutely thrilled to see that a live-action version was being planned for this year. But I was shocked to see how amazing Peter Jackson's version truly is! I loved this first chapter in the story of Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mordor! And the cliffhanger ending at the end of Part 1 is fantastic! I can't wait for Part 2!

Peter Jackson also did not include Tom Bombadil in the movie but he had an important role in the book.  Some of the parts I like in the movie was Peter Jackson's representation of the confrontation between Gandalf and the Balrog.  This part of the movie was almost exactly like the book, if not better.  I also liked how Peter Jackson kept the same nine characters for the fellowship and how he kept the same path that the fellowship took in the book.

And mostly I'm fine with that, as the first film is as faithful as you can hope to get, and the way the film brings Tolkien's vision to the screen could have been narmy, but luckily it provided us with a faithful and imaginative take on the work.\n\nMy overall favorite scene in the film is Aragorn's fight with Lurtz, which never happened in the original novel, and I'm saddened by that, as it contains some of the best choreography and has an epic feel to it that I feel it should have been in the original novel.\n\nIt's little diversions like this that make the film faithful but incredibly imaginative.\n\nOverall, this film gets a 9/10 on my scale.

I really shouldn't have used the word little because this is the complete opposite, the scale is huge, the adventure is huge and to be fair some of the creatures in this are huge. Fellowship of the Ring is of course based on the work of J. R. R Tolkien of the same named book and is one movie that is quite obviously popular among those who have read the book, adding to the fact this film is obviously fantastic. I don't feel this is quite absolute perfection but in any case it is a sublime piece of work and one that few would doubt is one of the very best still in the fantasy genre of films.\n\nPeter Jackson brings us his view on this quest and he does a fine fine job with guiding us through this story with a scope never seen before this came out. The thing about this that I feel captures so many peoples interest is the way in which it is just genuinely good fun and never goes too dark or too serious, it has moments of light hearted fun and even the odd time when you get a laugh out, splendid stuff. Jackson alongside Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh adapts a script that breathes what a movie like this should be done like, it gets the very most out of the action done in it and blends with the effects in a way where you don't get sick of the CGI or feel this is too fake, it turns out beautiful. The look this movie is given is also one major thing to mention about this just in the way the sets and the locations and even the costumes are done, it vividly brings to life Middle-earth in a way where it doesn't matter if you have read the books beforehand or after or ever, the movie is itself a work of epic proportions.\n\nFrodo Baggins is of course the central character of this and being played by Elijah Wood he comes across as brave in ways but also at times very vulnerable as well. If there is one stand out performance, well I wouldn't be able to pick, all the huge cast do a top notch job of bringing their respective characters to life and create these roles which they will forever be known for. One thing about casting I also really liked is the way in which the people behind this didn't go for massive names or try to even draw maybe just one massive name that would have ruined this, it feels better with a varied cast popularity wise.\n\nThis has one of the most engaging second halves I have seen and moves this movie up a little in terms of how I felt about it overall. The film I think also sets up the next two in the series really well, it shows us what might come next although never too much and that for me makes this a great link going into \"The Two Towers\". Peter Jackson a fan of the Tolkien's work brilliantly brings this storming onto the big screen and does so in a way that makes it very difficult to dislike, even those with an ardent dislike for the kind words used in this like Khazad-d\u00fbm will find it hard to not enjoy this movie, it is just too much fun and too much an epic movie. So yes overall The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one movie that will go down in history as a game changer in terms of technical achievements and truly brought on a new era of usage regarding CGI. It goes down in many lists as one of the bests and although I can't say I felt this to be your 5 star, 10/10 kind of movie, it is still terrific in almost every single way.",

The items that really make this film exceptional are the incredible sights of scenery, the legendary music, compelling characters, and a clever theme. I had a pretty good time during this. There really isn't a film alone in relation to this theme that could compare to even one of these three films (besides maybe the Hobbit series) It may be a long movie, but the journey has just begun. 3 1/2 out of 5, but the extra half is mostly for great overall film craftsmanship.",

The creatures and characters which were conjured up in my mind as my dad read The Fellowship of the Ring, complete with voices and gestures, will remain with me forever.\u00a0\n\nThis is the challenge Peter Jackson was left with in creating the first in his Lord of the Rings trilogy: the collective imagination of literally millions of fans, each one filled with different intricacies and opinions concerning characters, settings, basically everything involved in production design and being a director in general. With such a burden weighing on Jackson's shoulders, no one would have blamed him if he simply curled into the foetal position and sobbed when he actually bagged the role of director. But I'm sure I speak for fans, critics and the entire world when I say that I'm so glad that he didn't.\u00a0\n\nThe first in the sweeping epic of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring begins with the origin of the one ring; an object created by the dark lord Sauron in order to take over Middle Earth. After a battle sequence or two, we join up with our hero of the piece; Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire. After finding out that his Uncle Bilbo's magic ring is in fact the ring in question, Frodo is forced to undertake a journey to Mordor in order to destroy the ring once and for all. A fellowship of nine warriors is formed in order to help Frodo on his journey and the quest begins.\u00a0\n\nEven the synopsis above comes laden with backstory and explanation. What is a Hobbit? What is a Sauron? What is a Frodo? All these questions can mean that the film can become bogged down with explaining what the exact properties of Hobbit's feet are that they are able to never wear shoes or how exactly the Ringwraiths are able to survive at all. It is a credit to the script that none of this is explained, nor does it feel necessary to be explained. Even for a newcomer to Middle Earth, the escapist factor of the world onscreen is enough to dismiss any disbelief or need to find out how exactly shadow and flame combine to be a Balrog. Not only this, but the script also does a fantastic job of cutting out everything unnecessary in order to keep the storytelling lean. It also manages, while trimming the extra weight (in the form of things like Tom Bombadil), to keep the feeling of wonder that the books are so renknowned for. Many book adaptations can end up being driven by the story alone, allowing no time for the more emotional moments between characters and forgetting entirely to establish connections between them. Not so here, as every member of the fellowship is allowed their moment on the screen, from Boromir to Gimli, and all of them have their own distinct personality.\u00a0\n\nThis personality distinction can also be attributed to the perfectly cast ensemble. Every single character has their perfect corresponding actor to play their onscreen counterpart. J.R.R Tolkien, the books' author, actually endorsed Christopher Lee to be Gandalf (the two were good friends up until Tolkien's death), but despite this glowing reference, Ian McKellen was cast instead, Christopher Lee playing the part of Saruman. Looking at the finished product it's impossible to imagine the roles being reversed as the two are so perfect for their respective parts. The actors themselves do brilliantly. Viggo Mortensen is almost Eastwood-like in his understated effiency as Aragorn, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom make up one of the great double-acts of the pieces, the other being the hilarious Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as Merry and Pippin. In this we even get to see a little more range from Elijah Wood which is not as evident in the sequels, mainly due to his character's role later on. The standouts, despite the entire ensemble performing fantastically, are Sean Bean as Boromir who displays more talent than National Treasure would give him credit for and Ian McKellen as Gandalf. His performance is the rock that the film can stand on and he seems as though he's not so much visiting Middle Earth as he's been living there his whole life. The gravitas he holds and the empathy he evokes is simply astounding and it's not until repeat viewings that this can really be seen.\u00a0\n\nAfter having made limited successes like Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners, Peter Jackson stepped up to the plate in a major way in directing the Fellowship of the Ring. As mentioned before, the strain could easily have proved too much but from the very first scene it's obvious that Jackson is more than adept at handling a sweeping epic such as this. As he deftly move through the opening battle sequences and into the beauty and serenity of Hobbiton, Jackson's camera is rarely still, sweeping through the incredible locations and swirling around his characters in a beautifully choreographed dance. Every single shot counts for something and the bare minimum is obviously never enough in Jackson's mind. This is the more beautifully photographed of the three, despite the grandeur and spectacle of the Return of the King. Rohan storming the armies of Mordor is all very well but it's scenes like the Wraiths attacking the four all but helpless Hobbits on Weathertop which leave the most lasting impressions. Jackson's versatility is also on full display here as he moves through the autumn shades of Rivendell to the cold stone of Moria to the eerie blue-green of Lothlorien, every setting is perfectly captured by Jackson's lens. And does he know how to bring the fight scenes. Mr. Bay could take a few pointers in terms of how to shoot a battle scene, whether in the dark of Balin's tomb or the leafy surrounds of Parth Galen, every moment counts and every movement is felt, rather than the mindless slugging out of giant robots.\u00a0\n\nThe score of Shore also deserves a lot of the credit for fully immersing the audience in the onscreen world. Howard Shore's unmistakable tune is applied liberally throughout the film but it works perfectly every time. The themes and motifs which he includes according to character or even species is astounding. The nostalgia of Hobbiton is beautifully underscored with one of the more subdued peices of the soundtrack but the thundering main theme is as powerful and overwhelming as you would hope it would be and then some. It's no surprise that one of the four Oscars the first film won was for Shore's score (teehee).\u00a0\n\nIt's the complete immersion in the world of Middle Earth which makes this film so incredible. Despite the film's runtime being close to 3 hours long, even longer in the extended version, it never feels taxing to sit and soak up the breathtaking surrounds. Where some films can feel like a chore at two hours, it's almost impossible to keep from loading the next film instantly after finishing the first one thanks to the incredible power to entrance the film holds. The combination of flawless production design from props to locations along with the beautifully crafted story and faultless direction makes this film one of the greatest of all time.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe attack on Weathertop. Despite being comprised of far fewer parties than many other battles in the series, the terrifying Ringwraiths more than make up for it.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nAfter the bad taste that was The Frighteners, I come back to the series that proved to the world that Peter Jackson is a master of epic filmmaking; rivalling the likes of David Lean, James Cameron, and George Lucas. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released at the time where franchises were at their humble beginnings; standing along with films like X-Men, Harry Potter, and the new Star Wars trilogy. Out of all of them, it was Peter Jackson's film that came out on top, a film that demonstrates the ambition and scope of fantasy with seriousness and visual wonderment.\n\nThe film begins by showing the fall of Sauron, an evil figure that has forged the ultimate ring; a ring that possesses such power, feeding the envy and anger of the kingdoms around him. Multiple armies unite to stop him, which they ultimately do, and as Middle-Earth was on the brink of salvation, evil consumed the mind of its holder, extending the life of evil that should have fallen long ago. Then the ring was eventually lost and found by the hands of a simple hobbit; I wouldn't spend too much time discussing this as events that would unfold from here are covered in The Hobbit trilogy and the sequels of this trilogy. The ring acts as a clear symbolism of temptation, how it feasts on our souls, eventually defining our sense of existence. It is a brilliant concept by Tolkien, utilising fantastical elements to capture the imagination of its readers; and to see it translated here under Jackson's direction is simply fantastic.\n\nAfter recently seeing the final instalment of The Hobbit trilogy, it was a warm feeling to see the next journey unfold; this time carried by the hands and heart of another Hobbit, Frodo Baggins. His adventure here is more serious than the one Bilbo participated, with more at stake for not just the hobbit himself but to everyone around him; and Jackson lets the audience feel this heavy weight on Frodo's shoulders, we completely understand his journey will not be a pleasant one, one that would open his eyes to the beautiful world that surrounds him (which is what Bilbo experienced). Frodo's world is much dimmer, filled with unescapable evil, happiness only found in the deepest depths of Middle-Earth's heart.\n\nThough darker, there are still some beauties to be found in Middle-Earth, and Jackson makes every opportunity to capture it; just take look at the scenes taking place in Rivendell or the helicopter shots of the fellowship running across multiple types of terrain, it is simply gorgeous. Even the darker aspects of the film, may look gritty, but still captures that imaginative beauty that one would now expect from a fantasy film. It manages to capture beauty through natural elements, like mountains and grass, unlike Harry Potter and Star Wars which relies on more artificial elements in order to create that sense of beauty and imagination. There is simply nothing like the imagery of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nThe highlight of the film, of course, is its score. A score so memorable and emotionally touching that it never leaves the inner crevices of our minds. It is epic, standing near atop of the best musical scores every created for cinema. I am currently listening to Howard Shore's score as I am writing this, and I feel a sense of warmth that very few musical compositions could achieve; if only one could see me, they would see the welling of my teary eyes and the goose bumps that fills the surfaces of my flesh.\n\nThe cast in this film is amazing, with memorable performances across the board. There was a sense of excitement that filled through me as I saw each character from the fellowship being introduced. They capture their roles with such fun and commitment that it perfectly translates Tolkien's precious characters to life for audiences to take in and adore. Jackson wasn't after a star-studded cast, he was after actors that are a perfect fit for the roles; and neither cast member fails to live up to the expectation of Jackson and his audience.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful beginning of a beautiful trilogy; there is simply nothing like it. I cannot wait to continue and revisit the next chapter of the story.",

So out of curiousness I bought 'The Lord Of The Rings' Trilogy for Blu-Ray. I never seen the movies but I watch the first movie of the franchise 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' with an open mind. I got to say I enjoyed this movie as much I enjoy 'The Hobbit'. The story element of the plot and backstory is brilliant, original, and effective. I found myself entertained by the most of the film. There were some very slow parts of the movie that bored me and made me uninterested. The use of practical effect and CGI was great collaboration in this film. The sceneries of the movie is very beautiful and well detailed. The movie has extremely likable characters by their courage, personality, and role in the film. For that I like to credit the terrific acting from the whole cast. The actors gave their all in emotional situations and having real chemistry throughout! I had a problem of the dialogue of the film because some parts of it was lost and confused. I blame a little bit on the writers for this flaw. The movie has a very dark gritty feeling/tone throughout the middle and the end of the movie. Some of the choices of characters was sort of a problem for me throughout the movie. This is sometimes a case of movie when the writers never think of common sense in certain scenes of a movie. The fights in this movie is brutal and well choreographed! But the editing of fighting scenes are sloppy and choppy. Peter Jackson did an awesome job capturing the fantasy world in the movie and capture real imagination, which is good thing for fantasy movies like these. The score is soothing and beautifully played. And when ever it comes on in the background I always hum to it because it's that good. The sound editing of dialogue is a little weak but you'll get passed it. But when the action scenes occur the sound is booming and has great quality. I will love to say that I can't wait to see the next movie which is 'The Two Towers' whenever get the time to. To sum it all up, 'Fellowship Of The Ring' was a pretty good film. Not epic in my opinion but pretty close to it! I will loved to give this movie more credit but still I had some of the concerns of the movie with it's poor editing with sound and scenes. Also, I had problems with the script with character decisions and confusing dialogue. And, the movie has some slow boring parts to it that really drags. But besides my concerns this movie is really good in my opinion and is a well made movie. So for those and my previous reasons I will give 'The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring' an A- grading!",

            "content": "Say what you will about little people, but one thing is for certain and that is they can surely throw one hell of a birthday party. So the time has come as I review six episodic films for the next nine days. I know it seems like a bit of a squeeze, but with a little time and luck I can get through this in no time. Any who, author J.R.R. Tolkien went to his grave knowing that he written four well good fantasy books in his life. The books that I am referring to are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy which became one of the first fan bases in the 20th Century to have a huge following. It was not until long after his death that a long-time fanboy and director name Peter Jackson decided to make a film adaptation about it and the result is one to talk about for the ages. I mean sure it has been over ten years since the trilogies came out, but if you watch these films today you would realize that they are still mind blowing from the special effects to the casting. But perhaps I am getting a little ahead of myself here with this, so let's start this off right as I begin my own journey into the unknown and back again.\n\nWhere do I begin with this masterpiece? For starters, I absolutely LOVE the visualization and special effects that they put in here for this film. You watch this today and you would believe that this movie was done last year, when in fact it was over ten years ago. Peter Jackson does an astounding job adapting ninety percent of the dialogue from the book and into the movie and what's even better than the dialogue are the actors themselves. Who would have thought that a bunch of actors who played various roles from the eighties and nineties would be spot on with the iconic fantasy characters that they play that it just seems too good to be true. Also for two hours and fifty minutes worth of film it does not feel like it is drag on at all, because you are too involved with the story and the characters and before you even know it, it's all over for part one. Overall, I cannot find anything wrong with it other than a few nit-picks here and there that the film had to cut out from the book mostly because it would have gone way over the three hour mark. Which is why I HIGHLY recommend anyone out there to go see this if you haven't already and if you did, and it has been a couple of years or so, then by all mean re-watch this again.",

Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.",

This idea is reflected in his popular book series The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's epic trilogy, Lord of the Rings comes to life in Peter Jackson's movie adaptation. Peter Jackson was able to take the words of Tolkien and craft them into a beautiful movie that represents Tolkien's novel. \nTolkein grew up in Birmingham, England. When he was older, he received a degree in Anglo-Saxon and Germanic languages and classis literature. Shortly after this, Tolkien enlisted in the army and served in World War I. Due to illness Tolkien was released from duty and became a professor at Oxford (\"John Ronald Reuel Tolkien\"). One day while grading a paper Tolkien spontaneously wrote, \"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit (Tolkien).\" This was the first line of his award-winning novel The Hobbit. This novel was the first building block in the creation of the world of Middle Earth. It later lead to the creation of the Lord of the Rings. \nMost fantasy stories have no base, but Tolkien's story is rooted in reality. Tolkien was greatly influenced by his experience of fighting during World War I. During this time, he witnessed many horrendous things. Tolkien's utopian home was under threat by the malevolent Central Powers in Europe. These powers began to bleed into other European civilizations and threaten the lives of people who believed they were safe. The Central Powers are a parallel to the evil that exists Mordor. Similar to the Central Powers, the forces in Mordor are spreading across Middle Earth demolishing everything in their way. When Tolkien joined the army, he was deployed to the Somme River and participated in the deadliest battle in British history (\"National Geographic\"). Every day Tolkien was plague with brutal images of war. These images contributed to dark storyline of The Lord of the Rings. The war left a lasting impression on Tolkien and these events created the foundation for his future stories and provided him with the opportunity to supplement England's missing mythological past with his own stories. \nAlthough Tolkien's storyline was inspired from wartime events, he wanted to develop a set of stories that could represent England's lost mythology. During his years as a professor Tolkien studied the Anglo-Saxon time period of the fifth and sixth century. The Anglo-Saxons lived in England and they had developed an extensive set of mythological tales. The Anglo-Saxons were illiterate and they had to rely on verbal storytelling .As a result, most of these stories have been lost due to a conquest in the eleventh century (\"National Geographic\"). Tolkien's passion for this subject gave him the duty to create his own version of these lost tales. \nNearly forty-seven years later, after the first publication of the trilogy, Peter Jackson directed and wrote the film adaptation of the Tolkien's books. The overall plot of the three movies revolves around the destruction of the one ring. The ring was forged in secrecy by the dark lord Sauron (antagonist) and it was designed to rule all the people of Middle Earth. In order to save Middle Earth a fellowship was formed of nine companions: Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, Sam, Merry, and Frodo (protagonist). They are burdened with the mission to take the ring to Mordor and toss the ring into Mt. Doom to destroy it. \n\tUnlike other trilogies, The Lord of the Rings movies were filmed simultaneously over an eighteen month time period. This is unconventional for most movie series. Usually the first movie is filmed then the cast and crew return years later to create more movies in the series. This extensive time period allowed for the cast and crew to create three cohesive movies and attempt new, innovative filming techniques. For example, the films were the first to use a live motion capturing system. The crew used this system to create the CGI character Gollum. This allowed the actor Andy Serkis to add more depth to his performance of Gollum. Instead of simply using solely a voiceover for the character, Serkis was able to contribute the motions and facial expressions to this animated character (\"Bringing Gollum to Life\"). This process has now become widely used in many movies to create a more realistic performance. The extended filming time also provided the opportunity for the crew to fully utilize the beautiful scenery in New Zealand. The gorgeous scenery in the movie contributes to the creation of Middle Earth. The production team was able to merge the real scenery and CGI backgrounds to capture the essence of Middle Earth. \n\tThe music composer for The Lord of the Rings was Howard Shore. He is a widely popular music composer and has produced music for over eighty-eight movies. Some of his most popular soundtracks included The Aviator, Hugo, The Hobbit, and The Silence of the Lambs. The music he created for The Lord of the Rings remains his most well known piece of work. He has won four Grammys and three Golden Globes for The Lord of the Rings trilogy (\"Biography\").  To record the music score for the movie, Shore used an unconventional method. Movie soundtracks are now generated through computer programs. However, Shore used a lived orchestra and choir. Shore believed it was his duty to translate the words of Tolkien into music to accurately depict the books' story. While discussing the soundtrack Shore stated, \"It was a tremendous experience, translating the words of Tolkien into music (\"From Book to Vision\").\" To bring the story to life, Shore created many leitmotivs for characters and the places in Middle Earth. \n\tLeitmotivs were essential to convey the story in the movie to connect themes and ideas. One of the most iconic songs in The Lord of the Rings is titled Concerning Hobbits. This is song is used to represent the hobbits and their place of residency: the Shire. It has a jovial and lighthearted tone that composed of major chords that reflects the personality of the hobbits. Another leitmotiv in the movie is the Fellowship theme. The song is first heard when Sam and Frodo leave the Shire and start their journey. Only one line of the song is used in the scene because the fellowship has not been fully formed. As the journey progresses, the fellowship starts to come together during the Council of Elrond. This meeting was a collection of representatives of Middle Earth who were deciding the fate of the ring. At the end of the meeting Lord Elrond stands up and announces, \"you shall be the fellowship of the ring (Jackson).\" The Fellowship theme is then played in its fully formed version. This is the only time the audience hears the song in its complete formed. Through out the movie, the fellowship falls apart and the song begins to degrade. By the end of the movie, the fellowship has been split into two and the last remaining line of the song is echoed during the scene (\"From Book to Vision\"). These are two examples of the leitmotivs that represent the good forces in the movie. Shore also created leitmotivs that represent the evil forces. \n\tTolkien's story focuses on the struggle between good and evil. The music represents this struggle and Shore crafted malicious leitmotivs to counter the righteous leitmotivs. To produce this negative sound, Shore utilized unusual rhythms and chants from male choirs. For example, the leitmotiv for Isengard was written in 5/4-time measure to create an unresolved and uneasy mood. The ring is given several different songs to represents its evil. This ring has three leitmotivs: the power, the voice, and the evil. The voice of the ring was created using an all boy choir to provide a seductive and alluring tone. The power of the ring has a dramatic tone that was composed mostly of strings. This represents the enormous amount of power the ring possesses. Lastly, a chant is combined with a less dramatic version of leitmotiv for the power of the ring (\"From Book to Vision\"). This creates a very eerie tone. These leitmotivs were essential in giving depth to the evil of Middle Earth.\n\tThe leitmotivs in The Lord of the Rings were very important to convey the storyline. The score helped to create the mood of the scene and identify specific objects or people in the movie. The main theme of good versus evil came alive through the music. Howard Shore's unique music was able to create the culture of Middle Earth through music. \n\tThe Lord of the Rings quickly became a box office hit due to the combination of the movies innovate cinematography, music, and excellent cast. The three movies grossed over two billion dollars (Rotten Tomatoes). Overall, both critics and fans received the movie very well. Movie critic Michael Sragow stated, \"The Fellowship of the Ring is a movie masterpiece thrilling, passionate and wise.\" The Lord of the Rings trilogy has become a beloved favorite of many people and is regarded by the fans as one of the best movies of all time. \n\tThe Lord of the Rings trilogy is a timeless story of good versus evil. The story is accompanied by beautifully crafted music, amazing special effects, and talented actors. JRR Peter Jackson was able to bring JRR Tolkien's story alive and create an amazing movie. Tolkien once wrote, \"all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" Everyone should at least once utilize the time that is given to them and watch this astounding trilogy.",

            "content": "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\n\tLord of the Rings is part of a book trilogy that was also made into three movies. Fellowship of the Ring is the first movie out of the three. The movie came out in December 2001, is rated PG 13 and last about 3 hours. The setting for the movie is Middle Earth, which starts in The Shire and journeys through the land to Mordor.\n\tThe summery of the movie starts out with the hobbit Frodo. Gandalf the Grey, a great wizard, sends Frodo and his friend Sam on a long, perilous journey through Middle Earth. Gandalf sends Frodo to destroy the one very powerful Ring at Mount Doom, which is where it was created. Gandalf accompanies Frodo and Sam on their journey, along with several others including two men, an elf, and a dwarf in which they form The Fellowship. Together The Fellowship face great dangers on their journey to Mordor.\nThis particular movie is I would say not the best out of the three but it very important. Reading or watching The Hobbit will explain in greater detail of how this all started, which is the prequel of this series. Some may have to watch the movie two or three times to really understand what is going on, especially in the beginning. The history of the movie is short and can be confusing for the rest of the movie when not fully understanding what everything is about. To make the story flow better watch the Hobbit movies and then watch Lord of the Rings. Like almost all beginnings this first movie starts out slow but does pick up towards the middle. Other than the few minor details of what may not be the best, this movie is a great one.\nThe series Lord of the Rings is one of my all time favorite series. Fellowship of the Ring does a great job starting out and leading up to what will happen in the other movies. In this movie you learn who every character is and why they are of importance. Throughout the movie there is several battles with suspense like when you wonder what will happen to Gandalf when with Saruman, battle between the orcs and the Fellowship, and also what will happen to Frodo when he is the Ring keeper. There is also a love story within the movie which grabs the attention for romance, that way its not just action and battles. There is a great mixture of romance, action, suspense, and geekiness. The film itself was great with the effects and costume/makeup props. Parts of the movie have certain songs to specific scenes, like a dooming type song every time Saruman or the orcs appear and a more light cheery sound when The Fellowship journey in the open fields. The landscapes were fantastic, large and open like you would imagine the olden times. The characters are all very interesting and different because the story includes men, elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and orcs. There is also another character Gollum that has become the most popular among this series and is the one character many people know of even if they\u0092ve never seen the series. Gollum was once a hobbit but the ring transformed him into an unknown creature that has unusual long life. He also has split personalities so throughout the movie he refers to himself as Sm\u00e9agol or Gollum and the two are very distinct. The orcs are all costumes and makeup which when viewing them up-close, it took many hours to perfect. The battle scenes of the movie were perfectly laid out and you fell as if you\u0092re there in the fight. Stunt doubles did great in the battles and the actors did a phenomenal job in really capturing their character. Each one really had there own personality in the movie and there\u0092s not a character that is disappointing at all. The ending of the movie was a great place to leave off for the next movie, ends in a small cliff hanger but it does lead right into the next movie which is a great transition. The producers wrote a fantastic movie and took their time creating this masterpiece. They took every aspect of the book and created it to life. J.R.R. Tolkien did a great job writing this series and the people who made this movie happen really captured what the book has laid out.  Even though the movie is long it is worth watching when alone or during date night. Out of everything, I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is truly a great movie that you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored.\nIn conclusion, I would rate this movie around 4-5 stars. Great story line, awesome character development, and the set up of this movie was fantastic. I highly recommend watching this movie along with the rest of the Lord of the Rings and also The Hobbit. Its like a bag of chips, you cant just do with one! If you are looking for something different to watch other than just the Michael Bay blowing things up or the sappy love story movies, then this is the best one for you.  When watching this movie, it takes your attention to really capture the full story line and to understand it. J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic author and this is a great movie that really represents what the book is about.",

            "content": "A lot of film lovers have that one movie that inspired them to work in movies or made them fall in love with movies. For a lot of people that movie was Ben-hur due to the epic film making and a classic revenge story with Religious undertones, for others it was Star Wars(1977) due to the advancement in special effects at the time, mine is without a shadow of a doubt the fellowship of the ring which i believe is hands down the best movie of this epic trilogy. Now this is the only trilogy out of all the so-called great trilogies(Star wars,Indiana Jones, Toy story, The dark knight trilogy) that I view as one very long movie.But if I was forced to choose a favorite this would be mine because I think the Two Towers drags a bit(hey it's expected since it's the middle chapter) and I felt exhausted after watching the final 40 minutes of Return of the Kings. But in all honesty these are just nitpicks, because when the movies are so great you really don't have anything bad to say that might have lessened the movie going experience. I remember going to see this movie as a 9 year old and it was when I saw the opening scene of this movie that my life changed forever, for the better of course ;). The way the movie introduces the story is astonishing. This movie features some fictional places such as the shire that you wish were real. The soundtrack is perfect and completely captures the themes of the movie- friendship,mystery,hope,loss. A lot of people do not talk about the acting of this movie which is a shame because I think it's very good. This movie made me fall in love with New Zealand(I bet tourism sky-rocketed after this movie) and I really want to visit their country someday.There were about 50 consecutive minutes that just contained the best scenes of the entire trilogy in my opinion from moria's door, to the sea creature, to balin's tomb, to the battle of balin's tomb, to the belrog, to the \"death\" of Gandalf, to the music of the scene, to the reaction of the aftermath, to the beauty of New Zealand, great scene followed by a great scene, followed by another great scene etc.You also have to take into account that this trilogy was filmed back to back,so the risk that the studio took was huge I believe that the lord of the ring trilogy not only is an achievement  in movie/movie making but an achievement in life in general.I will forever cherish the trilogy and It will be continued to be seen by generations.Of course I'm going to give this movie a 5/5",

The characters are all wonderfully put together. Frodo is a good hero in the sense that he does take his responsibility if reluctantly and never gives up on his duty. Sam is the most loyal best friend any hero could ask for, and Sam remains by his side throughout the series. Gandalf is wize and powerful and one of my personal favorite characters. The villains aren't fantastic for the most part, but that's because the real villain is the Ring. That's how we see more of what Sauron's personality was. Saruman is another good villain and is the perfect example of a hero turned to the dark side perhaps even better an example than Darth Vader. The effects in this movie are amazing, and the story is enough to keep you interested for the long running time. Like it or hate it, you'll most likely have to watch this one at least twice.",

            "content": "\"FRODO AND THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL\"\n\n- 'Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring' is a 2001 epic fantasy film from director Peter Jackson (King Kong), based on the first volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel trilogy with the same name. A visually stunning fantasy adventure, perfect to the littlest detail and highly recommendable. I must say the books are too long for me, but this movie could have kept on going. It's that good. With the amazing talents of Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Ian McKellen (X-men Trilogy), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violence), Sean Bean (Game of Thrones), Orlando Bloom (Kingdom of Heaven), John Rhys-Davies (Indiana Jones films) , Hugo Weaving (The Matrix Trilogy), Liv Tyler (Armaggedon), Christopher Lee (Star Wars prequels), Cate Blanchett (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), Ian Holm (Alien) and Andy Serkis (The Prestige) as Gollum. A must-see film! \n\nAn ancient ring is given to the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Wood) by his uncle Bilbo (Holm), who found it years ago in the cave of a creature named Gollum (Serkis) during one of his adventures. Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) senses that this ring has unspeakable power, wanted by the forces of evil. Before seeking advice from his fellow wizard Saruman (Lee) Gandalf sends Frodo and his friend Sam (Astin) away to an Inn where he will meet them. Along the way the two hobbits are accompanied by their neighbors Merry and Peppin and followed by nine dark horsemen. At the Inn they meet the lone ranger Aragorn (Mortenson) who helps them fight off the pursuers. But when Frodo is injured, the group has to let him go with the beautiful Elf princess Arwin (Tyler), who takes the hobbit to her hometown. \n\nThere Frodo awakens with his friends by his side. Gandalf has also showed up, but brings bad news: Saruman has joined the army of darkness who wants to claim the ring. During a special council Frodo accepts the quest to go to the land of Mordor to destroy the ring in the fires of mount Doom.  A fellowship is formed as his three friends, Gandalf and Aragorn join him on this dangerous journey, as well as Legolas (Bloom) the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf (Rhys-Davies) and Boromir the Human (Bean). The group will need to pass through Mines of Moira and the woods of Loth\u00e9rien, home of Lady Galadriel (Blanchett). Will the Fellowship succeed?",

Far too often in the LOTR series I think the story builds up these great idea's or characters and them lets me down whenever something big is supposed to happen.\nFor example: The Ring Wraiths.  Great name...great design..great backstory and they do a good job of showing how afraid of them everyone was.\n\noh...let me put it out there that I never read the books and I think any discussion of the books is irrelevant since I'm watching a movie and that's what I'll judge it by. Back to the wraiths..\n\nI LOVED these guys and couldn't wait to seem them flex their muscle (or bone).  In the first movie, a big wave in the river washed them away.  After such a build up, the wave was a little anti-climatic.  The wave wan't all that impressive either.  I'll call that a flawed execution of the idea (water will get rid of them).  There was also a scene where they came upon the hobbit in a derelict tower and I don't remember anything cool about  it (I need to rewatch these films I agree..it's just I've never been interested enough to spend that much time again).  And finally at the end of the film during the big battle scene it looks like we're going to get to see them do something really cool and what happens? The wraith gets killed before he ever does anything cool.  Let down again!\n\nGandalf?  HAH!  I love the idea of the most powerful wizard and he certainly looks the part but aside from one scene where he was swinging his stick and knocking bad guys around, what giant magical things did he do?!  He made his staff into a giant flashlight?!  That's it! I waited hours upon hours to see him make a big flahslight?!  Huge let down!   Yes the Balrog was cool and he has a great line in the scene but we don't get to really see what makes Gandalf so magical.  \n\nI've got more but I'm sure no one will read this.\n\nI want to add that I am shocked by how much I absolutely love the 2 new Hobbit movies (Hobbit and Desolation of Smaug).  Hell..I give those films 5 stars.  Love them and I can easily say that I think Desolation of Smaug is the best of all these films.",

If I'm quite honest the action isn't actually that great. The scenes in the mines (or tombs) are by far the best however the time spent in riven dale and others on the quests are just plain boring. Some of the dialect can also just be pointless in these scenes. I think the casting is fantastic however. Ian McKellen a standout alongside Viggo Mortensen. I understand the characterisation behind the hobbits and how there place in the story is to be our own, far from home, against all the odds, great courage, fear. However Frodo and his shire compatriots are just too winy. I find Frodo in particular just irritating. The score, the stores, its directing and certain tension building is undeniably brilliant and worth all its accolades.

            "content": "When little-known director at the time Peter Jackson decided to create an epic film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's timeless Lord of the Rings books, stakes were raised extremely high, especially when Ralph Bashki's animation version of the story was an epic disaster back in 1978 (though I never watched it) and when it was decided to film the trilogy back-to-back-to-back. Thankfully, when the first chapter of the film trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released in 2001, it was an epic smash, winning 4 Academy Awards, 13 total nominations including Best Picture, which is rare for a big blockbuster. Jackson's LOTR trilogy were game-changers in the fantasy genre, and The Fellowship of the Ring begins this great franchise off with a ginormous bang, leading up to an strong epic cliffhanger that definitely made audiences begging to see the sequels.\n\nIn the world of Middle-earth, hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) gains possession of a mysterious magical ring from his mysterious uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm). When it's revealed that the ring is the One Ring, a powerful ring formally owned by the fallen Lord Sauron, Frodo, along with a band of heroes, known as The Fellowship of the Ring, leads into an epic quest to the fires of Mount Doom to destroy the ring and defeat Sauron once and for all before he regains possession of it.\n\nJoining the Fellowship includes Sean Astin as hobbit (and Frodo's personal friend) Sam, \nDominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as comical hobbits Merry and Pippin, Ian McKellen as wise wizard Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortenson as ranger Aragorn/Strider, Orlando Bloom as bow-shooting elf Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as the humorous dwarf Gimli, and Sean Bean as the suspicious human Boromir.\n\nAlso appearing in this epic masterpiece includes Hugo Weaving as wise elf Elrond, Liv Tyler as Aragon's elf lover Arwen, Cate Blanchett as beautiful elf princess Galadriel, Christopher Lee as the villainous wizard Saruman the White, and Andy Serkis as the mysterious creature Gollum.\n\nJackson created the world of Middle-earth on film via filming in the lovely New Zealand, and it's gorgeous. Had Jackson chosen to create this incredible fantasy world via green-screen or by Hollywood backlot, then the film definitely wouldn't have worked as great as it was. The cinematic shots of New Zealand landscapes are jaw-dropping and amazing to look at. Also the visuals for this film, created by Weta Workshop, are also amazing. Weta brilliantly manages to combine CGI and practical effects in the most astounding way possible, CGI for things like cave trolls and a demon called \"The Shadow\" and practical for Orcs and the Urukai. Whatever Jackson and Weta did, this is visual filmmaking at it's finest in the 21st Century.\n\nConsidering it's a fantasy epic, each scene presented in this film sounds like it could have happened in real-life. No there wouldn't be magical rings or hobbits or dwarves or elves, but the thought of a ruthless ruler returning to power and attempting to destroy the world is actually a scary thought. Jackson brilliantly combines fantasy elements and reality and, with the excellent Tolkien source material, creates a wonderful fantasy epic. I was also impressed with the action sequences as well, with my personal favorite being a sequence where Gandalf confronts \"The Shadow\" in a really dark and scary mine controlled by Orcs, hollering \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\". Other strong sequences are the opening battle scene during the origins of the ring scene, Gandalf's epic battle with Saruman, Arwen's fight against evil hooded figures, and the finale with the Fellowship in action against Saruman's created Orc army, the Urukai. In three hours, Jackson has created the ultimate fantasy experience without overdoing it on heavy action.\n\nThere's a huge heavy cast involved in Fellowship of the Ring, and each one involved did an amazing acting performance here. Elijah Wood is excellent as Frodo and shows dedication to one who wants to defeat evil. Other noteworthy performances include Viggo Mortenson as exiled heir Aragorn, who excels the most in the excellent action sequences, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, who's performance was Oscar-worthy in emotional depth and pure awesomeness, and veteran actor Christopher Lee as Saruman, the wizard assistant to Sauron.\n\nAnd last, Howard Shore's score for this film is spectacular. There's loads of exciting themes here, from the fellowship, The Shire, the ring, Saruman, and even one for Sean Bean's Boromir character. The score definitely deserved it's Oscar win, due to how strong Shore's cues are and how emotional Shore puts into his work.\n\nIt could have been a disaster in the hands of an amateur, but with Peter Jackson at the helm, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is that epic of a fantasy film, with perfect acting all around, stellar visuals, a great score, and Jackson's approach to the world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings franchise is that rare book-to-movie franchise where there's detail and perfection in every way mentioned, and Peter Jackson is a modern genius filmmaker. The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent beginning, and the franchise has only started.",

            "content": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring review\n\nI have always viewed the Lord of the Rings trilogy as the incarnation of the word epic. It is bathed in moments that will pull out a tear rout of even the manliest of men just by a monologue, a part of the soundtrack, a victory in a battle, a moment were friendship shines. It will make you cheer for the main characters and join them in their journey. I could talk about this masterpiece (yes I refer to the trilogy as one experience) all lifelong, so I will do my best to summarize my feeling in these three parts. My username is pablo2896 in IMDb and Pablo22in Metacritic by the way, so you can visit my three reviews. So let's get to the first one, the first movie. The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of a young hobbit who is put in an overwhelming quest to rid his land of evil. And for me this is one aspect that makes me tear up a bit, the fact that one so small can squeeze out so much courage from himself. And this is no other than Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. Elijah does an amazing job acting as the main character. So the movie starts with a prologue explaining the founding of the one ring and how its master was defeated long ago. This clearly shows you what sort of a jaw dropping ride you are going into. It shows the amazing achievement of the special effects and the scale of these films. Then we are introduced to Frodo (Elijah Wood), this hobbit lives a perfect live in The Shire, a town were these hobbits live, eat and smoke weed (yes they even say it in the movie). His uncle Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) has carried the One Ring for a while, this entity that is consisted of the other half of the soul of Sauron, the evil bad guy. So he leaves it to Frodo who is then given the (almost) impossible task of taking it to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place it can be destroyed and by doing so, vanquishing evil. And in the mean time Sauron sends his nine wraith to find this ring and kill everybody who goes in their way. Easy, right? Gandalf a powerful wizard, played by no other than Ian McKellen who perfectly portrays you the wisdom, the charm and the power of this conjurer, swears to protect Frodo at all costs in this journey and they take Sam with them, played by Sean Astin (who's incredible acting and character I will describe in my third review) Frodo's gardener with them. In their journey they meet some characters like Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and no other than the badass Aragorn who 's actor Viggo Mortensen plays it amazingly, he is able to make you know he is a badass. So to summarize that part this movie has some of the best character developments I've seen in any movie. In the elvish sanctuary Rivendell they form the Fellowship of the Ring, which is consisted by the six characters I mentioned up there and three more, Boromir (a man), Legolas (an elf) and Gimli (a dwarf). Sean Bean, the actor who plays Boromir, does a good job in setting this character's conflicts and desires for the Ring of power, but it portrays his honor and loyalty also. Legolas and Gimli I thought would be more like filler characters but you feel interest for them and you connect to them immediately. The same can be said for Merry and Pippin. From Rivendell they embark to their destination, Mordor the Land of evil. God, I have to talk about the montage of the Fellowship traveling. It is an epic compilation of amazing landscapes and hair rising soundtrack. This is where I really felt the epicness of the movie. By the way this was pretty much the half of the movie, the buildup. So was it a typical long boring buildup? No, not in its least. They encounter dangers like spying crows sent by Saruman, an evil wizard who sides with Sauron at the beginning of the movie, and a treacherous storm (also sent by Saruman, what a dick) in the middle of a dangerous mountain which forces them to take another path, the Mines of Moria. Gimli explains to them that the dwarfs will welcome them in there but he's WRONG. They get there and the place is a graveyard, a graveyard made from dwarfs! So to summarize it they get trapped in there (blame the giant octopus) and now have to get across the dwarven city. Warning: EPICNESS! They soon find out they are not alone, and no other than Pippin (fool of a Took!) wakes up every goblin infesting the mines. This leads to an awesome battle were you are cheering for the Fellowship while it slays goblins and a cave troll! They escape and make a run for the bridge of Khazad Dumb with an army of goblins on their backs and an awesome score which is beyond epic. But they realize something else is in those mines. A Balrog. A foe so powerful, only Gandalf can defeat it. They get to the bridge and the wizard faces it. In the most epic moments of the film he takes it down but unfortunately he goes down with it. You feel the loss yourself at this moment, seeing everyone in pain. In the rest of the film they more awesome characters like Galadriel and lose some like Boromir. Another thing that I love about these movies is the fact that no one is obligated to follow Frodo to his destination. They do it for friendship, one of the most important values in these films alongside honor and loyalty. I'm reaching the limit of words here so to summarize everything, 10 out of 10! Amazing.",

But evil forces such as the traitourus Wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) armies of Orcs, Goblins and Trolls and even the Ring itself with it's seductive qualities will do anything to stop them in thier tracks. \n\nFrom the opening speech that tells the audience the history of the Ring, right up to the powerful cliffhanger of Frodo and his best friend Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) leaving the group to destroy the Ring, Director Peter Jackson and his co-writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens manage to bring J.R.R Tolkien's world to life thanks to the sweeping use of cinematography of New Zealand to give Middle-Earth a massive scope and Grant Major's impressive production design of locations such as the countryside villages of Hobbiton, the beautiful nature-friendly Elf homes of Rivendell and Lothlorien and the dark forboding caves of Moria brings artist John Howe and Alan Lee's visualisation of Tolkien's world into a believable, yet fantastical reality.\n\nThe desision to only focus on Frodo's quest, though purists may disagree, was a smart one as the story itself gives a lot of room in the development of it's characters.\n\nAlthough Frodo himself is a good wide-eyed innocent forced into an unfriendly world, it's the characters that surround him such as the wise, yet kind wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), the areformentioned Sam, the powerful elf-lords Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the members of the Fellowship themselves such as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) the destined saviour of the humans of Middle-Earth, the elf prince Legolas ( Orlando Bloom) and the Dwarf warrior Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) and the world building of Middle Earth itself that makes this film such a joy to watch.\n\nOverall despite some dated CGI in terms of how it blends in the amazing  practical and model work, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing experience that few films of this century have topped and is a great start to the greatest fantasy story of all time.",

The acting is overwhelmingly solid throughout the entire cast and the scope and design of the world which the films are contained is phenomenal. Now, onto The Fellowship of the Ring... The first installment of this world-class trilogy is the worst overall. Where the cast splits off into different quests in the second and third film, they all remain together in the first, creating a relatively one dimensional storyline amidst the multifaceted world. The story is one that every man, woman, and child should know by heart, as it really is that incredible.

Howard brings all of the epic moments from the movie to life through the art of music.\nTo tell the story of LOTR, the cast of the movie was required to do much more than just act but had to tell an epic story of human struggles and emotions, ranging from anger to joy to sadness which spanned over 10 years for the cast and crew. The acting in this movie is beautiful, and nearly flawless. The characters are fleshed out and believable, the relationships are hypnotising, and it is as if the audience experiences everything and is part of the ensuing adventure.\n''Our people, our people. I would have would have followed you, my brother... my captain... my king.''\nThe casting drew together a small group of seasoned veterans, including Christopher Lee, Ian McKellan, and Ian Holm, giving the film a solid backbone mixing experience with life and vitality. The other characters are also played out beautifully, especially that of Sean Bean's Boromir. The relationship between he and Mortensen make the story of the movie all the more real.\nThe part where Boromir is dying and Aragorn is comforting him is one of the most emotional and tear inducing scenes ever captured upon film.\nAs is Gandalf's ''You shall not pass!'' struggle against the Balrog; His fall into darkness will make you cry when the music combined with the drama hits you.\nSean Astin and Billy Boyd also deliver sound performances, but the most unique aspect of the film is the relationship between Sean Astin and Elijah Wood. Seeing the making and the Extended Version, it is much easier to understand, but Astin forged a friendship with Wood during filming, and this was able to make the close bond of the two in Fellowship even more real and powerful.\nIn 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for. Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back. There are no slow spots, just one climax follwed by another.\nFrom the opening backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, it will capture your soul. The romance between Aragorn, mysterious ranger of the North, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is fantasy romance, timeless and eternal, will capture your heart.\nThe story, sets, costumes, score and sound effects are so rich, you'll see the film many times to absorb the beauty of all. The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey. The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness. The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medieval & the fantastical, but more important, they're also functional & practical. The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic and folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but succeeds in eclipsing or rivalling their work in Howard Shore's own style and uniqueness.\nIn conclusion and in essence, Fellowship & LOTR can be credited as many things, because it does something incredibly challenging and does it exceedingly without flaw or exception. Peter Jackson had to adapt from a series of books, he had to capture Tolkien's unique World from his books, he had to deliver a vivid and real world full of gritty earthy fantasy, and it required its cast to deliver brilliant performances full of emotion, relationships, and conflicts.\nThey all succeed. Fellowship won 4 Oscars for it's Cinematography, music, make-up and effects.\nWatch Theatrical or Extended Versions both are perfection.\nMasterpiece.\n''One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.''",

This movie - which does not quite reach the same epic proportions as the following two - is in fact my favourite for that very reason.  While the fellowship is all together, and the director isn't just throwing all these different (some would say too many) stories at us, there just seems to be a certain intimacy, with which we are not accompanied with so much into the broader-scaled sequels.  There are many moments in this film that genuinely terrify, as well as bring to the brink of tears, and Boromir's death/redemption still remains my all-time favourite scene in all three of the movies - which, of course, is saying quite a lot.",

Anyway, the story is about the Dark Lord named Sauron who created special rings that grant different powers for different people. Sauron also created the most powerful ring known as the One Ring which contains the power of invisibility, the holder can never be possessed by Sauron and can also control the other rings. The ring is lost and goes into the hands of Gollum played by Andy Serkis who owns the ring for 500 years and then loses it until it is found by a hobbit named Frodo played by Elijah Wood. And the rest of the movie is just three hours long of fighting and talking, I don't know what the fuck that was about, I didn't care. Other characters and actors who are in this film are Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Liv Tyler as Arwen and Christopher Lee as Saruman.

            "content": "The Lord of the Rings is a landmark in the fantasy film genre. Here, director Peter Jackson took the daunting task of adapting a highly revered epic trilogy, into a grand-scale film trilogy. Many were nervous when the first chapter in this trilogy was released. Many were wondering if this was going to be a letdown, or even worse, an epic disaster. As it turns out, it was far from either. This is a movie that gets almost every aspect of the book right, while expanding the limits on the what is achievable through film. Yes the movie has terrific special effects, but those would all fall flat if it weren't for superb storytelling, and dedicated performances. Its almost as if the entire cast had a strong love for the original material, and gave it their very best to bring their character to life. \r\n\r\nUnlike the Harry Potter movies, this movie doesn't feel like its bound to any book or tale, but instead it feels as if it is bringing an original world to life with homages to J.R.R. Tolkian's work. From the moment you first see it, you are immediately drawn into Middle Earth and the many stories it has to offer you. Peter Jackson seamlessly melds visual effects, with gorgeous real life landscapes to create the visual marvel that defines Middle Earth. Also noteworthy is Howard Shore's musical score. The score is everything it should be; intense and epic, yet never overwhelming. If not for the score, then the movie would be far less effective. Combine that with awesome cinematography, and you're in for quite an experience.\r\n\r\nLOTR succeeds in bringing a unique world to life, but it also succeeds in telling an imaginative tale. Jackson combines creativity with intellect in how he approaches every scene. Despite the almost 3 hour run-time, I never felt bored watching this movie. Although its successors live up to the high standard this movie set, I still prefer The Fellowship of the Ring for focusing less on battle sequences, and more on its groundbreaking take on fantasy storytelling. If anybody reading this review has not seen this movie, I highly urge you, even if fantasy isn't your thing, to take the time to watch this masterfully done movie. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "The first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a masterful piece of cinema. In case you didn't know, this trilogy takes place in Middle Earth, a mythical land and is about the quest to destroy the One Ring. This movie follows Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. Hobbits are people that are happy and are no more than fantasy to the world of men. This unlikely hobbit bears the burden to carry the ring to the fires of Mount Doom with a fellowship behind him.\n All the important aspects of the book were filled into the movie appropriately (minus Tom, who I didn't really care about). The prologue was crucial to the entire trilogy which introduced you to the world of Middle Earth and the peril Sauron faced. Then it got lighter and showed the world our main character was in, the Shire. This sequence was a happy scene and personally I wouldn't mind living there the rest of my life. The scene highly contrasted with all the dark tones that were to follow for the rest of the trilogy. \nLet's talk about the cast. Every single role was filled in with perfection. Even Liv Tyler did a decent job as Arwen (though her deep voice s kind of creepy compared to her normal voice). Frodo and Sam have a great chemistry between each other which makes you care for them. Ian McKellen really shows the pain that Gandalf has gone through for the last two thousand years. Viggo also steals the show as Aragorn with his ferocity but also his nobility towards his friends. Sean Bean gives Boromir the nobility that Aragorn has, but also throws in the potential dark side that leads him to temptation. The characters Legolas and Gimli are side characters, but will be expanded in the next two films, especially their friendship. Most of the villains feel omnipresent that their shadows always lurks in your mind, even if they're not in the scene. Christopher Lee gives his best performance of the 21st century playing as the twisted Sauraman. He is the face of evil in this movie and Lee gives him the charisma and evilness to the character. \nThe soundtrack is amazing. It's bold, grand, and epic. That's why I bought the Complete Recording because it's that good. Youtube the Shire theme, or the fellowship theme, and that just says it all. The visual effects are obvious outdated, but at least the miniatures still hold up. The effects also lift the story that couldn't be done 30-40 years ago.  For rewatchability, I just watched it for about the 15th time, and although I appreciate it as an art form, I can't enjoy it because you lose all the suspense from them just walking. \nThe themes of this movie are extremely apparent after you watch the movie. First off, the temptation of the ring. It messes up all kinds of people, even those who are noble. Nothing can resist its appeal and will be lead into darkness. Only those who don't seek any power in any form and are mentally strong can resist the ring but even then they will eventually succumb to the ring as it will to Frodo. The ring is the personification of evil. Another theme is endurance. The Fellowship experiences a lot of setbacks, including losing a few of the members and the suffering they endure. Frodo then, grows into despair and asks why he has it and why it can't be anyone else.Frodo learns though, that he must move on. As Gandalf simply puts it, \"All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.\" The greatest theme of all though, is friendship. Frodo and Sam are loyal to each other, as is the rest of the Fellowship. They would sacrifice their lives for each other in order for the mission to succeed, or for others to live.\nIn conclusion, The Fellowship of the Ring is a great adventure and action movie that keeps you in the edge of your seats and you just can't wait for the next one.",

            "content": "The Fellowship of the Ring is not a perfect film, it certainly has its flaws with the script and some of the acting, but even with those flaws, it is outrageously entertaining and thought provoking. This is really a technical marvel with painstaking detail, beautiful photography, and brilliant editing. Peter Jackson does a terrific job of creating middle earth, he knows that this is a separate fantasy realm, and does a thorough job of making this world not really resemble our world at all. However, the film's ability to engage you comes mainly from the characters, their actions, their characteristics, and what they say. The photographer, Andrew Lesnie, knows this, and shoots the film in close and personal shots of the characters typically alone in the frame; this allows us to view the characters as individuals united on a quest for a common good. Although, the editing by John Gilbert, is also a technical achievement, as he does a great job of allowing the characters to say what needs to be said, yet he never leaves a single shot on the screen for too long, which amps up the pace of this 3 hour long film. The technicality of this film takes us back to Hollywood's classic films like The Wizard of Oz, or Gone with the Wind, but the acting and the script could at times need some work. Overall though, the script and acting is fairly good. The script succeeds at capturing the essence of the way these characters feel, and beautifully characterises each one of them, however, most of those characterizations come in the midst of an action sequence. And there are times where the script seems overwrought and overdoing the different form of speech, it becomes a bit melodramatic and almost ridiculous. As for the acting, there are some notable performances, Wood does a very good job as Frodo, Bean is good as Borimir, Astin is surprisingly great as Sam, but Ian Mckellen definitely gives the best performance as Gandalf. Mortensen is at times very good, and at others he is very bad, which is surprising for him, however, Bloom and Tyler are ridiculously bad, they are so melodramatic its laughable. But to finish up, despite its flaws, The Fellowship of the Ring is relentlessly entertaining and emotionally gripping, it is a technical masterpiece that succeeds in almost every area it was trying to succeed in.",

            "content": "For all audience who only cares about the morals of a movie, the Lord of the Rings trilogy might utterly disappoint you. After all, there seems to be nothing unique in the movie, and the only things noticeable are the splendid visual effect, immersive music, intriguing quest and then no more. Certainly the movie catches our initial curiosity and later our empathy, but every great movie can do this with ease. \r\n\r\nUnlike an allegory, the Lord of the Rings has no moral, or more precisely, it needs no moral. I dare to challenge anyone who claims that he can summarize the essence of our life, of this kaleidoscopic world we strive in. Indeed, our life can never be fully generalized, and there are simply too many aspects of it to start and end with. By definition, morals are summarized to deal with different situations and dilemmas in life, but a booklet of mottos is not equivalent to life itself.\r\n\r\nIt's the similarity the Lord of the Rings shares with our reality that makes it look somehow \"moral-less\". The Lord of the Rings is another reality, and I choose to believe in the validity of it. It reminds us of our childhood fantasy, of our unfulfilled dreams at night about adventures toward the unknowns and impossibles. One by one all boys have once dreamed about conquering the devils, subjugating the uncivilized, and maintaining eternal peace for the world. All those objectives resonate with the theme of the Lord of the Rings. Perhaps the Lord of the Rings could be a dream of another old boy, and that is the writer J.R.R Tolkien himself.\r\n \r\nThe Lord of the Rings needs no moral because it's yet another reality. What makes this movie so extraordinary is all its vivid portrayal of a familiar kingdom. We may initially feel distant from and untouched by the characters, but their choices in life have already made a shift to our mentality. The movie subtly prompts us to make decision in our life, like the whisper in Fredo's mind, but it could both encourage and desert us. We don't need to call the Lord of the Rings a \"must-watch-trilogy\" for everyone, yet we're deeply aware that watching it might make a difference to our daily, shire-like life, or perhaps even a greater difference in our also daily, but rather adventuresome dream.",

It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.",

For the first 200 pages or so they just traveled from point a to point b while eating along the way. Peter Jackson eliminated a lot of the traveling and added more epic fighting scenes. Most of the time when directors try to change a lot from the source material it doesn't work (Harry Potter). Peter Jackson made huge improvements on the other hand. For example, in the book Gandalf spends a chapter explaining to Frodo about the travels of the ring. In the movie they just started off with an epic battle scene to show what happened.\n\nThe one slight problem I had with this movie was that Frodo complained a lot. Yeah that's a pretty minor gripe, but when his friends need to help him out constantly, and he makes that annoying whiny sound it gets a little frustrating. The casting is all very well done with my favorites being Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Sean Bean as Boromir.

If you go into these three movies without ever having read the books, you would likely call it awesome and a bunch of other praises. However the fact remains, I am giving this is a balanced review.  Which means I have to point out the weaknesses of this trilogy.  Jackson tends to use foot note characters and places an awful lot. Arwen was a footnote in the fellowship of the ring and that is where she should have stayed, instead we ended up with one giant pointless love story which took away from the book a great deal. The FOTR was not about any love story, it was about frodo obtaining the ring..and starting his long ordeal.  The problem here is that there was no reason to have a lot of silly filler added to something that did not need it, this is just one example of a number throughout the movie and throughout the trilogy. In the hobbit it's even worse. No wonder its score is terrible.  The spectacle of the movie on initial release is what probably got this movie a higher rating than it deserved, that and it's advertising. overall a decent movie, but if like me your a big tolkien fan having actually read the books, then your going to be in for quite a disappointment.",

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in stone palaces. Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die. One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne. \" Sauron (Sala Baker), the Dark Lord, was the creator of most of them, and thanks to his knowledge were also created that retained the Three Elves, though never touched or defiled. But the rest of the rings were subjugated under the power of the One Ring, with which Sauron the Maia meant to dominate Middle-earth. Through these rings Sauron corrupted their owners, facilitating their armies conquered Middle Earth. But did the Last Alliance of Men and Elves troops defeating the evil Sauron. It is in the final siege to the Dark Tower in Mordor, where Sauron lost the Ring in the hands of the son of the King of Gondor, Isildur (Harry Sinclair). He could destroy the ring, throwing it to Mount Doom, but before doing so he changed his mind and decided to keep it for himself. Indeed, it suggests that the Ring has a will and can corrupt the owner. Isildur was slain by Orcs in a river, and the Ring was lost in the bottom of it, until a hobbit named Smeagol (Andy Serkis) 2500 years found him later and took him deep inside a mountain, keeping it for a few 500 years, although it was distorted and corrupted in mind and body by the power of the Ring and turned it into a creature called Gollum (Serkis). But finally the Ring left him to be found (apparently this was not the \"intent\" of the Ring) by Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), the Shire, a hobbit bound for the Lonely Mountain, as narrated in the novel The Hobbit, published prior to The Lord of the Rings.\nBilbo kept the ring for almost 60 years without knowing his true nature, and thinking of him as a mere curio that allowed him to become invisible when worn. Moreover, although he did not know, the ring gave him a strange longevity. During the celebration of his birthday No. 111, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) Bilbo pressed to leave the ring, and at the strange and aggressive attitude Bilbo, becomes suspicious about the true nature of the Ring. Gandalf persuades Bilbo to deliver the ring to his favorite nephew (and protagonist of the story) Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Gandalf advises Frodo then be careful and keep and keep secret the ring as he travels to Minas Tirith to investigate.\nIn their research, Gandalf discovers that the ring is nothing less than the Ring of Sauron. He returned to the Shire and sent Frodo and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), his gardener (who then are added Meriadoc Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd).) On a trip outside the boundaries of the Shire to prevent the ring is found by enemies. In this instance the film is guessed that Frodo must destroy the ring. Frodo Gandalf goes to Bree while hurriedly goes to Isengard to consult the head of his order (The Istari) Saruman (Christopher Lee). Frodo reaches Bree with peers and discover that Gandalf has not arrived yet. Later it was revealed that Saruman betrayed him and imprisoned him in the tower, but Gandalf manages to escape with the help of Gwaihir (although in the film does not reveal his name or the fact that he was an old friend of Gandalf), the Lord of the Eagles. In Bree, Frodo and his companions know Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), rightful heir of Gondor Human kingdom, but which appears to them as a Ranger called Strider D\u00fanadan. With your help evaded ring spectra or Nazg\u00fbls and continued their journey to Rivendell. After many adventures and Frodo was attacked by a Nazgul, which almost kills him, was saved by Aragorn and later by Arwen (Liv Tyler) who plunged to Nazg\u00fbls in a river with his magic, make it to Rivendell where Gandalf the Grey was waiting and thanks to the magic of Elrond, Lord of Imladris, Frodo is healed (though not entirely) from the venom of leaf Nazgul attacked him.\nRivendell also took place in the Council of Elrond (Hugo Weaving), where representatives of the races and peoples of Middle-earth, in which it was decided that the Ring had to be destroyed, but do involve venturing into the depths of Mordor to Mount Doom to throw in their fires, the only way it could be destroyed. Frodo took the mission, and promised to accompany the wizard Gandalf, Aragorn the heir to the throne, the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Captain of Gondor Boromir (Sean Bean and hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin. Together, they formed the Fellowship of the Ring. Rivendell is witness of their love Aragorn and Arwen, daughter of Elrond.\nPart of the trip involved crossing a mountain range, but could not do so due to spells of Saruman tried to go through the mines of Moria, Gimli's cousin's home. However, given the sad surprise that the dwarves were killed by orcs. In the end they succeeded but at a high cost: Gandalf faced a Balrog, and was dragged to the depths of an abyss, and dying to get to the bottom, after hours drop (although it is not known exactly).\nThen he passed through the forest of Lothlorien, where Galadriel the Lady of the Forest (Cate Blanchett) gave gifts to everyone and let them stay in his palace.\nFollowed part of the way by boat, but in one of his stops were attacked by Uruk-Hai orcs of Isengard, Frodo sent to capture, but not to give details that might motivate a betrayal, just told them to take all hobbits \"alive and intact\", on the grounds of an alleged weapon of war that these possessed Elven and kill the rest.\nFrodo had been attacked by Boromir who was corrupted by the ring, and decided the best thing was to continue his journey alone through a small breath of Aragorn. While trying to flee and the orcs attacked, Merry and Pippin his attention to Frodo could move away. The Orcs were taken, after killing Boromir who tried to save them. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli set off in pursuit. Frodo was in one of the boats, but Sam was surprised to leave, and urged him to let him accompany. With the search of Merry and Pippin, and Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor, the movie ends.",

Simply a MASTERPIECE full of adventure, action, friendship, and the beginning of the best trilogy ever made. The vision that Peter Jackson (director and writter) have of Tolkien's work is fantastic. Gives us a huge world full of magic and mystery, about to be the stage of a journey that will change the destiny of all forever.\nOn one side we SAURON, master, ruler of evil, demand for \"A RING\", a simple and small ring which is the source of his power. Long lost and found by a sinister and dangerous creature that loves the small relic of heart. What is lost again, and found the creature less improbable ... a HOBBIT (imagine an adult the size of a six year old), where they now have in their hands destination worldwide.\nThe actors in this film are simply a fantastic job, all embody their characters in the highest perfection. Ian McKellen embodies GANDALF, and the legendary sorcerer BADASS of film history; Vigo Morteseen the renegade king, Elijah Wood the LORD OF THE RINGS hiself, or in this case \"the ring\". And the entire cast does an excellent job, where everyone does their job in this epic adventure to save the world from the darkness of Sauron.\nWith fantastic scenery, an incredible maguinetude, a soundtrack that always differs from scene to scene and character to character, and an engaging story with unforgettable characters that convey feelings of love, friendship and partnership.\nA movie that I recommend to all people, full of pure entertainment, a film that will make you laugh, cry, and jump off the chair several times.",

The Lord of the Rings is arguably one of the greatest fantasy novels ever written and for a movie to set out and tell that beautiful tale is in fact impossible. Well so it seemed until Peter Jackson came along. Peter and the countless others that helped him actually managed to do it, they made in my personal opinion the greatest movie trilogy ever made and it all started with this one. \n\nPeter hits all the right spots every single time he goes for a long shot. The emotional stakes are so high and well paced you will have tears by the end of this movie. There is no holding back, thoes tears will fall eventually. The performances are so incredibly strong. These actors aren`t just playing their characters, they \"are\" the characters. A better casting choice is not possible to imagine at least not for me. Every line of dialogue, every sound, every expression, everything about the drama and screenplay is wonderful. The drama is untouchable, it`s simply perfect in my eyes.\n\nThe pure scale of Middle earth is presented in this magical and epic way that you never thought was possible but Peter, he has to have something special to be able to bring this world to life. New Zealand was the perfect location to shot this film. The world seems so vast and rich with nature. Everything from the wide camera shots of mountains and woods to the small details of Bilbo`s home are more than stunning. The word I`m looking for has not been invented yet but the closest thing I can say is masterful. The world building is also a huge contributor to the believability of this world. The history, languages, cultural differences between races, religions, it`s all presented in an amazing way. Middle Earth is beautiful beyond imagination, this movie presents that to you. \n\nThe action, oh the action. Where do I begin? First off the effects are blown out of the water. The make-up,  costumes, sets, CGI, choreographed fight scenes aswell as the pace keeps you engaged and amazed through out. I will touch deeper into the acition later in the the second and third film but I will say this: Balrog vs Gandalf will be put down in cinema history as one of the most epic scenes ever put on film.\n\nA tale so epic and unbelievable that you can`t close your eyes for hwat stands infront of you. This is the beginning of a very long masterpiece that is Peter Jackson`s adaption of The Lord of the Rings. Do keep in mind this review is about the extended editions which I strongly recommend as the best version.",

I'll bore people to death on this point but I still feel it owes a huge debt stylistically to the earlier animated film but that may just be because I was obsessed with that film as a child.  It falls short when trying to engage emotionally several times with the hobbits at times just seeming like annoying children, but this is minor criticism really of what is a high standard blockbuster.  Is that Peter Jackson making a cameo as they first leave the Shire by the way?  Pretty sure it is.",

Alexandria, to Wagner's operas. He achieved to mystify matter and matterialize spirit. The cultural profoundity of his work consists of a monumental subtext that can be understood as something even greater than a simple reference, cripticism, or allegory... Tolkien said his work was not allegorical but adaptable, thus, his work is more likely an \"archetypal initiatic path\". He always searched for the common lost myth of humanity. And he did it. Each line from The Lord of the Rings has infinite lectures, just because it doesn't refer to anything, concretely... but to all-at-a-time. (...) Mr. Peter Jackson's finest artwork has achieved the impossible and become the most essentially faithfull adaptation of the 20th century classic, becoming a timeless Master-Piece of the cinematic Art. This is the new Gone with the Wind, the new Lawrence of Arabia, the new Man who would be King, the new Wizard of Oz, the new King Kong. Also fascinating and unreachable visual bill. Hugely profound, incredibly emotional. Every moment of this film is a pleasure for the most refined sensibility. The best cinematic look since Dreyer's work. Outstanding. Among The Godfather, one of the greatest trilogies ever. Also great action. Dishly entertaining, beautiful, lovely for all the audiences. Not even the most pop-corn demanding public will feel unsatisfied. Spectacular. One of the best films ever!!!!",

Together they make up the Fellowship bent on protecting Frodo and delivering him safely. Peter Jackson's film is a very good adaption of Tolkien's world.

He wrote the books sometime after or during the 2nd World war. He was a linguist so he created his own language, which in the books is the elvish language, the creation of the language gave him the idea for the books. All three movies in the Trilogy are long movies.\n\nThe plot is that a hobbit named Frodo gets one of the powerful rings. He and his fellow companions have to get to Mordor mount doom which is the only way to destroy the ring. Also the story is about man kind to redeem their selves while the elves start to leave middle earth and while the dwarfs hid in their mountains.\n\nThe theme is to first illustrate J.R.R Tolkien's books. Also it is to entertain an audience there really wasn't a morel or over all meaning to the story, but to entertain by using action and plot to excite the audience. \n\nThe Fellowship had a lot of interesting shots and other editing tricks. For example there are several shots in the sky watching Frodo and his companions travel and when this was filmed they didn't have drones so they used a helicopters. Also when something dramatic happened there was a close up.\nThey used so many shots from a low angle, high angles,birds eyes, or Dutch angles. Also the director had iconic music the music made you excited and makes you want to be there. The director used shaky footage so you could feel like your in the fight.\n\n\nOverall the film had a great camera work and film production. I love the plot and the character development the actors are skilled and can act. I would recommend this film because it has great story it is exciting also the film composition is amazing.\n\n-PR (8th Grade Student)",

It is a completely immersive experience and a joy to watch as the story of Frodo and his band of fantastical friends set out on a quest to destroy the all powerful ring that will allow the evil Sauron to enslave their world for all eternity begins its first stage. The cast is stunning. Ian McKellen probably giving the performance he will best be remembered for and Elijah Wood acting his little cotton socks off. Ian Holm has always been a fantastic actor and as Bilbo, he is wonderful as is the far too infrequently seen John Rhys-Davies who makes Gimli a charming and loveable character. Viggo Mortensen is a perfect heroic figure and both Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler bring ethereal beauty to their elvish roles. The visuals are stunning with Peter Jackson making superb use of the stunning scenery of New Zealand to make the geography of Middle Earth seem simultaneously familiar and exotic. This is a beautifully crafted piece of cinema and the rest of the trilogy matched the expectations that this one seeded. Well worth seeing if by some bizarre twist of fate, you haven't managed to catch this one at some point.",

I think the best thing that stood out from this movie is the Score.\n\nLord of the ring is about a quest of a Hobbit, and his faithful companions who were trying to save the world from rise of an evil lord named Sauron, whose power is stored in a ring, a ring with a mind of its own, which found its way into the hand of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Woods).\n\nThe are many differences that can be seen between the book and the movie, from the merging of characters which made Arwen to be used more in the movie than she was in the book, to the exemption of some characters like Tom Bombadil and reduction of the role of others like Barliman Butterbur.\nBut regardless of these, which were mainly done to make the movie short and make the story more precise, like the forging of Narsil, which in the book was forged at the fellowship, but in the movie it is done in the last part (Return of the King), making Aragon\u00e2(TM)s rise to the throne more dramatic.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was a critical acclaim during its release and it was a box office hit, making over 8 times its production cost of 93 million dollars. It also won four of the thirteen Oscar nominations it got, the four were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.\n\nThis is considered the best out of the trilogy, and it can be found on AFI\u00e2(TM)s 100 movies\u00e2\u00a6100 years (10th edition) on number 50.\n\nPeter Jackson brought life into this movie adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien\u00e2(TM)s Lord of the Rings, the fight scenes were extraordinary, the dialogue are one to remember and the cinematography of this movie, is just exceptional, from powerful area views to shots that make you AWE at the magnificence of creation this is a movie for all to own on DVD.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "I've put off watching this film for years now. Now, after 12 years of waiting, I've finally been able to watch the first chapter in what can be called Peter Jackson's greatest success. In the first chapter of Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic, young Frodo Baggins (son of Bilbo Baggins, the protagonist in The Hobbit) has been called on an adventure. What starts out as a quest to find a safe place to hide a ring found by Bilbo long ago that contains massive power, soon becomes a quest to return it to where it was first made (Mordor) and destroy it before its original creator (Sauron) can get a hold of it. Let me just say that, regardless of the incredibly long length, I had a blast with this film! The opening prologue discussing the creation of the ring really envelops the viewer into the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien and filmed by Peter Jackson. There's no need to discuss whether the acting is good or bad because everyone brings their A-game into this film. The most notable actor among the bunch would be Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey. His performance shines the most amongst all of the actors, who also do phenomenal jobs in their roles. Also, I recently saw the Hobbit less than a month ago. I did enjoy that film, but there was a major issue I had with it. There were times when I was zoning out in boredom because of how lengthy the story was and how some scenes didn't really contribute to the film at all. Fellowship is longer than that, yet I was on board the whole way through. Sure, there were definitely scenes that slowed down and had me yawning. However, it wasn't done as much as in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I highly recommend that people see this film. It's a filmmaking triumph for Peter Jackson and I can't wait to see what the other two chapters have in store for me!",

For my money the weakest of the 3 partly due to it introducing the characters and laying the base for the next 2 - but it's a good film and a good start.\r\n\r\nSetting 'Frodo' off on his adventure to take the one ring to the fires of Mt.Doom so it can be destroyed and preventing 'Sauron's' wrath plunging middle-earth into darkness. So not much at stake really. There's not much more to the story than that but its simple roots create a series of epic conflicts, spell-binding plot moments and very interesting characters. The detail to the world is astounding and has inspired thousands of people to visit 'New Zealand'. Even to date the CGI still looks good and the whole world has an old world feel.\r\n\r\nIt sort of moves at a sluggish pace at first and could of benefited at the start with a bit of trim - there are some scenes that are meaningless and wouldn't have been missed. But after the first 40 minutes or so, it's jam packed with memorable scenes - 'Boromir's' death, Gandalf's famous \" You shall not pass\" and the first real encounter with the 'Ring Wraiths'.\r\n\r\nAt the time it was an awe-inspiring feat of film making and it should be looked at as a landmark moment. It may suffer from a few unnecessary scenes but it looks amazing and is full of quotable scenes and memorable moments.",

All facets of this movie have been taken to their limits - with top-notch acting, direction, effects and production, and even though I am a fan of the 1978 animated movie, this just takes things to a whole other level.

The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is an excellent fantasy adventure film. It's the first of three movies in the franchise based on the classic books by J.R.R. Tolkien.  The visuals and sets are spectacular including the shire and the lovely elf kingdom.  The special effects are top notch as well.  There's exciting battles and other action sequences and quite a few fun moments as well.  Fellowship Of The Ring has a few slow parts where it drags and may seem repetitive, it's also pretty long, as they all are, so I only watch them every now and then.  The story is epic and after viewing when it was first released in theatres, I could see why the series has such a following.  There are so many awesome characters, pretty many in fact, and other names thrown around from the past, it could be hard to keep track of all of them.  Great performances here from the ensemble cast including Elijah Wood as Frodo, the hobbit who sets out to destroy the ring, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the wizard, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, a would-be king turned ranger, Sean Astin as Samwise Gangee, Frodo's best friend, Liv Tyler as Arwin the elf, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the elf archer, Cate Blanchett as Queen Galadriel and Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins.  The film earned high praise and earned 13 Oscar nods including Best Picture.  The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is an entertaining journey and gives us a taste of things to come later on in the series.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: A-List Approved!\r\n\r\nyoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nfacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist\r\ntwitter: @WesAlist",

            "content": "This is one of those rare movies that actually surpassed my expectations. Of course I knew how highly regarded these movies were coming in, but I wasn't quite ready for the unbelievably epic movie that this is. It was a bold undertaking for its time, but Peter Jackson pulled it off perfectly in every area. Also, the fact that the movie has aged fairly well in the effects department is impressive.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it secret, keep it safe.\" With those words, Gandalf the Grey leaves Frodo Baggins with the \"One Ring.\" This One Ring could rule all of Middle Earth, if in the hands of the Dark Lord Sauron. In Rivendell, a home of the Elves, a council of the races still loyal to Middle Earth is called. They decide that the ring must be destroyed. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mordor, but he cannot go alone. He is joined by the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Frodo's Hobbit friends, Sam, Merry, and Pippen, and of course, the Wizard Gandalf. Together they form The Fellowship of the Ring, and set out for Mount Doom to destroy the Ring.\r\n\r\nIt's honestly impossible for me to think of a movie with a better cast then this movie has, starting with our two Hobbits, Frodo and Sam. Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins is the rock of the entire trilogy. Which is incredible when you remember that he was only 19 at the time of filming. Frodo is a round character who is just starting his development in this movie. Wood plays him with the emotion and courage that the character requires. Sean Astin plays Samwise Gamgee. While Astin is great in this, it's not until the second movie that we he really shines. But Sam is an easy character to root for, and Astin really brings him to life.\r\n\r\nViggo Mortensen headlines the rest of the Fellowship. Aragorn is another well developed character. Considering how little time Mortensen had before filming, it's impressive how he embodies the character. And like Sam, the best of Aragorn is yet to come. Ian McKellen also stars as Gandalf the Grey. It's kind of incredible that McKellen wasn't Peter Jackson's first choice, because he is flawless as Gandalf. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies play Legolas and Gimli. While both characters are pretty static, both actors make you care about them. In fact, Legolas is my second favorite Middle Earth character, bested only be Gollum. And rounding out the Fellowship is Sean Bean as Boromir. His performance is just right for the character.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast all perform well. Liv Tyler isn't given a whole lot to do, but she fits her character. Christopher Lee leaves an impression as Saruman, though his battle with Gandalf is kind of hilarious. Rounding out the cast with some nice performances are Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as Merry and Pippen, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond.\r\n\r\nThis movie is one of the most incredible visual experiences you'll see. Peter Jackson showcases Middle Earth in this first movie of his trilogy. The location scenes in New Zealand are stunning, with sweeping shots of mountains and grassy plains. But also the stage and special effects sets are wonderful. The vast majority of the effects hold up nicely. Just the whole visual aspect of the movie is pulled off perfectly, from the beauty of Rivendell, to the fires of Isengard.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson really hits all his marks when it comes to the epic fantasy action scenes. The early scenes with the Nazgul are more about suspense than action, but they keep you right on the edge of your seat. Then 2/3 of the way through the movie, we are given a mini-climax. The action scene in the Mines of Moria, starting with the battle in Balin's Tomb and ending with the Bridge at Khazad-dum, is one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. Then the movie is capped off with the action scene in Parth Galen. While this isn't the big finale that the second two movies have, it is still an effective action scene.\r\n\r\nOne other thing of note is the musical score by Howard Shore. It is not a stretch to say that it is the most complex and textured scores to ever be written for a mainstream movie. Shore introduces probably 10-12 themes in this movie alone. A few of which have become iconic, like the Concerning Hobbits theme and the Fellowship theme. His music greatly heightens the action and drama of the story, and he stays faithful to his themes throughout the entire trilogy.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a breathtaking start of my favorite trilogy of all time. The movie obviously has a terrific story, just the right amount of action, a surprising amount of character development, and endless visual wonder. Though it is a hefty 178 minutes, the story never fails to interest the audience. The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the definitive motion pictures of the decade.\r\n\r\n\"A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early; he arrives precisely when he means to.\" 10/10",

The other two films kinda get carried away with the CG and battle scenes, but this one focuses on the characters and the storytelling is a lot more interesting. The cast is superb led by Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, and Sean Astin. This is the one that should have won best film, not Return of the King. A great film that resides in my top 5.",
