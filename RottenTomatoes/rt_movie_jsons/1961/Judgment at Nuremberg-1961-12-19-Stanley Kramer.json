    "summary": "In 1947, four German judges who served on the bench during the Nazi regime face a military tribunal to answer charges of crimes against humanity. Chief Justice Haywood (Spencer Tracy) hears evidence and testimony not only from lead defendant Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) and his defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell), but also from the widow of a Nazi general (Marlene Dietrich), an idealistic U.S. Army captain (William Shatner) and reluctant witness Irene Wallner (Judy Garland).",

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg may feel like it is all too aware of its importance at times, and does feel intermittently melodramatic, but remains an important film for posterity, exploring the extent of retribution and compensation for a truly terrible act, where fault lies, and the individual personalities that lie behind it or were caught up in it in different measure. The film's masterstroke is setting up a delicate balance of characters whose backgrounds, perspectives, and guilt (even their own perception of their individual contributions to the war) are left shrouded in doubt - painted as real, but small indiscretions that contributed to a larger event that was only guided by a select few, like a house of cards or a champagne tower - before showing a devastating montage of true atrocities looming over the defendants and their excuses that is simply of a different magnitude, coming to bring it all crashing down in one fell swoop. Tracy's brow-beaten judge feels nuanced and well-realized, and Schell's award-winning take on the patriotic, pragmatic defense counsel is certainly vivid. That said, the slowly rotating camera whenever someone gives one of the film's many Oscar-baiting speeches is a bit much, and the final hour feels rather simplified that calls the film's entire direction in question, putting too explicit a justification for the action of Lancaster's Janning (and by extension, the entire German collaborator class). (3.5/5)",

            "content": "An engrossing courtroom drama for the ages!\n\nStanley Kramer's historical courtroom drama Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) is a poignant masterpiece of creative direction, brave writing, and daring performances from an all star cast! Kramer's direction features long held wide shots of the entire courtroom bearing witness to the difficult subject matter, devastating close-up shots for stirring emotional testimony, quick zoom in shots for dramatic emphasis, and mature slowly turning panning shots around a speaker to help hold the viewer's attention. For a film that's over 3 and a half hours, Judgment at Nuremberg barely feels like 2 hours.\n\nErnest Gold's music is magical only playing at very specific emotional moments or revealing cues to depict a certain American or German sentiment. Gold's score is highly effective and deeply affecting. I love Frederic Knudtson's stellar editing of splicing together real documentary Holocaust footage, post-war Germany's ruins, and the dramatic recreated courtroom drama. Judgment at Nuremberg feels swift and concise thanks to his editing. Ernest Lazslo's cinematography is fascinating as the courtroom always feels alive due to his moving camera placements, interesting viewpoints, and impressive tracking shots. Robert J. Schiffer's make-up is brilliant as several characters look older or specifically designed with subtle details that convince the viewer a certain actor is older.\n\nAbby Mann and Montgomery Clift's script is perhaps the greatest, most timeless, and utterly relevant screenplay ever written for film. Their words shake you to the core as you get every perspective with nuanced detail and honest viewpoints. The witnesses testify with shattering honesty and riveting emotion. The judges speak with clarity, earnestness, and dedication to justice like you desire judges to aspire to always maintain. The prosecutor delivers his evidence with swift justice and undeniable purpose. The defense holds steadfast to his principles and his client's innocence as far as they see it. All while Mann and Clift's writing demonstrates the genuine want of the German people to be perceived as innocent of knowledge or participation in The Holocaust. Judgment at Nuremberg asks the audience to imagine each perspective with an empathetic open mind and a realistic lens. Abby Mann and Montgomery Clift write Judgment at Nuremberg to convince every audience member that the Nazis were guilty of war crimes as well as crimes against humanity aided by a complicit, hateful public and an uncaring world.\n\nI have to commend Stanley Kramer for assembling one of the most apt casts of legendary actors and actresses ever to grace cinemas. Spencer Tracy is so humble, thoughtful, gripping, and entertaining as American Judge Dan Haywood, who is  designated to precede over The Nuremberg Trials with a fair hand and swift justice. Burt Lancaster starts out as the stoic sycophant named Ernst Janning, but breaks down in one of the poignant and breathtaking supporting performances you'll ever see. Judgment at Nuremberg is full of riveting side characters brought to life by great actors and actresses giving the film their full potential.\n\nFurthermore, Montgomery Clift is heartbreaking and tear-jerking as the simple witness Rudolph Petersen, who pours his heart out over the course of his cross-examination. Likewise, Judy Garland's witness Irene Hoffman Wallner will bring the tears as she expels all her character's pain out during her testimony. The use of real Holocaust footage will surely move you if these two character actors do not.\n\nBy the same note, Maximilian Schell arguably steals the show as German defense attorney Hans Rolfe. He passionately orates his client's side with a shocking zeal and ungodly lack of concern for the witnesses' feelings as he brutally cross-examines them. He is engaging, entertaining, and inspired in Judgment at Nuremberg. Schell earned his Best Actor Oscar several times over as he recites massive volumes of dialogue with a nuanced realism befitting a more senior actor. Maximilian Schell establishes himself at a first rate actor of the highest caliber just within Judgment at Nuremberg. Similarly, Marlene Dietrich is alluring in her charming charisma playing Mrs. Bertholt, while also disgusting the viewer as a remorseless liar making excuses for the countless Germans that stood by allowing Hitler's Germany to attain power. Dietrich's casting is intriguing as she was the greatest German actress of her era, playing a notable socialite and patriotic symbol, much like her own life. She is simply marvelous and unforgettable.\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Widmark goes full on prosecutor emboldened by the righteousness of his cause in sending Nazis to jail. His passionate opening speech and intense presentation of his evidence is all consuming as you can only look at him while he speaks. Would you believe Judgment at Nuremberg even boasts an early appearance from a young William Shatner with rare coherent delivery and striking charisma? Well it does as Stanley Kramer compiled many of the finest artists of his era for Judgment at Nuremberg.\n\nIn all, this film should be seen by all for its important messages and fine craftsmanship.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer's ‘message movies' tend to grate me with their puffed up self-importance, thinly drawn characters and belief that they are saying something novel but of the films he has made this is probably the most successful. This is largely due to the impressive ensemble cast he works with who make their characters appear vivid and full of life even when working with a subpar screenplay. Kramer's direction often gets in the way of the film as his showy camerawork and refusal to cut down certain scenes distract from the fascinating discussion of guilt in relation to war crimes and responsibility to the law. The film does earn it's Best Picture nomination as for a ‘prestige' picture it achieves what it sets out to do.\n\nAmerican judge Dan Haywood, Spencer Tracy, is assigned to prosecute Nazi judges who committed war crimes during World War II. The main defendant in the case is respected German judge Ernst Janning, Burt Lancaster, who is represented by Hans Rolfe, Maximilian Schell, who wants to defend the actions of everyday Germans through his defense of Rolfe. Controversial issues are discussed as sterilization and sex between a Jewish man and a gentile woman are brought to light through the characters of Rudolph Peterson, Montgomery Clift, and Irene Hoffmann-Wallner, Judy Garland. Haywood is forced to examine his own morality as he becomes close to wealthy German widow Frau Bertholt, Marlene Dietrich, who claims that the majority of Germans were not aware of the atrocities that occurred under the Nazi regime. When Janning rebels against his lawyer and claims that he is guilty Haywood is pushed to have him imprisoned despite an impassioned plea from Rolfe.\n\nThere are several points in this film when it feels like a television production for the HISTORY channel and most of these come when Tracy steps away from the courtroom to purchase a hotdog or converse with the charming Ms. Dietrich. I understand that the film, which is based on a play, was trying to expand it's scope and go beyond feeling like a filmed play but these scenes seem utterly superfluous and add to the film's already bloated running time. This is not to say that Dietrich and Tracy are not wonderful together but they feel like they are part of an entirely different film, one that could be quite entertaining on it's own, that is not given enough time to develop on it's own merits. Kramer would have done better to eliminate this plotline entirely and focus on the courtroom drama where the heart of the story lies.\n\nSchell won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the morally conflicted Rolfe and he does give an impressive performance, managing to hold his own against legends such as Tracy, Lancaster and Clift. He is full of anger and bluster as many acclaimed performances were at the time but when negotiating with Lancaster he displays a softer side and his final plea to Tracy, asking him to visit Lancaster, is a touching moment. Lancaster brings a unique stoicism to his role as his famously ‘cold' eyes reflect his character's tragic nature but when he does finally deliver one of many dramatic monologues in the film it feels like a cop out. One must accept that there will be big, dramatic, improbable speeches but it did get rather tiring after a couple hours seeing several thespians \"Capital A\" act their way through ten minutes worth of dialogue.\n\nTracy brings his usual gravitas to the role as we believe in him as an everyman with real concerns over whether he is doing the right thing. Widmark, in the least showy role, is surprisingly effective as his bland good looks and rigidity present him as a good foil for the more bombastic Schell. Clift chews the scenery in his one big scene and Garland fails to convince as Hoffmann, her tics and over the top style overwhelm the scenes. Clift and Garland's characters also seemed rather unnecessary as I would have preferred to have seen only one of them or had both of them cut out. Lancaster and Schell are the most interesting characters in the film and if all of the unnecessary star cameos were removed the film would be a great deal shorter and more impactful.",

On performance level, it holds up the expectation and delivers without flinching by great actors like Spencer Tracy, Maximilian Schell and Montgomery Clift.

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg is a masterclass in acting. There are so many strong performances here that singling out individuals could take paragraphs. I felt for each character and saw their point of view because they were all portrayed as realistic people with genuine motivations. While many of the German characters were played by American actors, I liked how they made the transition to English and just asked you to accept it without a lot of explanation. We get to experience the entire trial through the eyes of Spencer Tracy who is the chief judge presiding over the case. He takes in all the testimony as well as a lot of additional information he gathers from the people around him during the days of the trial. This allows us to walk through these events along with him.\n\nThe brilliance of the way Judgment at Nuremberg is structured is the fact that it lays out the case so you can see some validity to the argument of the defense. Its not easy when hes defending Nazis, but Maximilian Schell makes an impassioned plea that can almost sway the audience to mercy at least. They also use this film to show the political state of the world at that time, and the fact that there were legitimate reasons many people wanted these men to be found not guilty. Its a well-crafted film because it does all of this but it also forces the audience to view the horrible realities of the Holocaust. These scenes are awful, and made more uncomfortable because they used real footage of what actually happened in the concentration camps.\n\nI think what surprised me the most about Judgment at Nuremberg was that I never felt the length of the film. Ordinarily movies that are this long start to drag for me, but not this one. It flowed nicely and I never once lost interest. In fact, it strangely felt like they could have done more. This is so fascinating, and the moral questions it raises are so thought-provoking, I just want it investigated further. There was something about the end that felt abrupt and unsatisfying, almost as if the film ran out of gas. Perhaps it was the fact that I knew what the verdict would be since way back when I was in a history class. I anticipated the end, but I still think there could have been a more unique way to wrap things up. That being said, Judgment at Nuremberg is a strong film and it told a story that needed to be told, at just the right time for people to learn from it.",

            "content": "Outstanding film.  Star-studded with several fantastic performances.  Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way.  I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument - and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial.  Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments.  There are also so many brilliant scenes.  Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke.  The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars.  Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty.  The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to.  Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks.  Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching.  It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours.   Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk!  In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.\n\nAs for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law.  They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps.  At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich.  They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go.  If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?).  The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied.  Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize. \n\n I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking.  How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does - simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way.  It's the best of humanity.  How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end - intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked.  Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong.  Had the Axis won the war, I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be.  The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it's representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today - and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg 1961\n\nStarts with a German military song then the Nazi sign being exploded immediately following the song. The film begins in 1948\n\nThe film has a young William Shattner playing a captain. \n\nJudge doctors and other leaders since the major leaders committed suiside  \n\nHas Cornell Klink as a character. \n\nSherif from The Rifleman and showed up in many Western TV shows. \n\nIt has Judy Garland in it as a witness. \n\nThis film comprises of some of the best known actors of the 1960's. \n\nIn many ways this films tribunal reminds me of Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country with the translation scene. \n\nI think that the musical score suggest too much of a person before anything is told about the character. That is true of German wife who's husband was killed before this film started. \n\nI thought with the exception of the begging of the film where they had the translators speaking English for the Germans that the film is pretty boring for the most part on how the story was told. I think it needed more movement or cuts to be more interesting to be able to keep the audiences attention. \n\n\nThis film did not make sense what exactly the Germans were on trail until they presented the footage of Jewish concentration camps. Some of the statistics given in the film I was unaware of. \n\nI think that this film took far too long to get to the main point. It took almost half the movie before it got to seeing the footage of the Holocaust victims. \n\nI thought the ending of the film was interesting where they were all sentenced to life imprisonments by 1949. However by 1961 when this film was made none of the hundreds if German political prisoners were serving their life sentences. \n\nI also liked the perspectives given in the jail and by the rail staircase in prison at the end of this film. \n\nThis film brings up some interesting questions concerning doing their duty under Germany over the moral duty and where do you stand. The tuff questions. \n\nThis film also brings up how unaware the German people were of the Jewish Hollowcost. \n\nI think that this film should have been either been edited to be shorter or made into a short mini series. This film took a little over an hour to led up to what the purpose of the film was. I liked the opening and the last hour and a half of the film.  A large chunk of the body I feel just took way too long to explain and was boring in the way the story was told.",

Americans today are indifferent to Germany just like they're indifferent towards every country besides their own, unless the country has some kind of world news to report. People don't see Germans as Nazis anymore. Vladimir Putin was recently voted as most influential person in the world by Time magazine readers. Since Russia is getting so much positive attention I'm sure that effects peoples opinions about Germany too. My point is many scenes in the movie depend on the power of having Germany on trial for war crimes. Those scenes aren't as powerful as they would have been in 1961. But the movie is bigger than that. It's a movie about equality, forgiveness, justice, and it acknowledges that not only Germany was responsible for the rise of Hitler. It's an important and necessary film. Despite my lack of interested in the arguments, the conviction and power of every performance made it thrilling to watch. Especially the defense attorney and the German who stays quiet though most of the film. And seeing a young William Shatner was pretty cool.",

It is well shot, the plot is moving, and the acting is superb for any era and well beyond almost any acting in film today. The courtroom scenes are full of glowing performances but most especially the performances of Spencer Tracy as (Chief Judge Haywood), Burt Lancaster (as Dr. Ernst Janning), and Maximilian Schell (as Hans Rolfe) were quite simply stunning. Be that as it may, this movie is not for the faint of heart. The subject matter (judges accused of atrocities during the holocaust) is quite graphic and includes actual footage of concentration camps and extermination methods used by the Nazis upon their victims. I found myself hard pressed to keep my eyes on the screen while bulldozers shoved hundreds and thousands of cadavers into mass graves. Many of us, in these modern times, forget how truly awful it was. There are those among us who use terms like \"it's worse than what the Nazis did to the Jews\" to describe things as trivial and stupid as a parking ticket. This movie explores the question of justice versus law and how, sometimes, those two things can be exclusive. If you feel that you have a strong enough stomach to handle aforementioned documentary footage and you love a good drama film then I highly recommend this movie to you.\n\nP.S. Keep an eye out for a VERY young William Shatner as a courtroom aide!",

The story of the Nuremberg trials has been recounted many times on film, and I've seen quite a few films on the subject. Judgement at Nuremberg is the finest example of the trial. Stanley Kramer delivers stunning picture that boasts a great cast of actors, and the film has a wonderful script that captures the importance of the trial. Kramer directs a wonderful cast including Maximillian Schell, William Shatner, Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster.  This is a flawless drama, and a must see for those who love court room drama. The film captivates the viewer by the fact that that this is based on real events and it adds to the experience. I found this film to be one of the better reconstructions of the trials, one that felt more subtle than other films, which for me anyway, felt less over dramatic, which is necessary in order to make a great film. Using great performances and a great story, Stanley Kramer was able to pull off a memorable and engaging drama that still resonates today. If you love classic cinema, Judgement at Nuremberg is a stunning, well acted film that recounts an important part of history. This is the finest portrait of the trials that I have seen, and anyone looking for the definitive portrait of the trials should watch this film.

The political satire Kramer introduced seems have given us a guiding solution, but eventually, who could have stood firm like Spencer Tracy, or we are no more than another Burt Lancaster? Brilliant performance from Tracy, Marlene Dietrich and the award-winning Maximilian Schell, but the greatest accolade should be devoted to the grief-stricken Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland. Great drama on humanity.",

            "content": "Judgment At Nuremburg is a riveting and superb courtroom drama. What really makes this film shine is not only the superb performances, but also the phenomenal script that really raises many questions for the viewer to think over. It's definitely a thinking person's type of film that really makes you examine all the details before coming to a hasty conclusion about the actions of the men on trial. Are they innocent because they were upholding the laws of the administration? Or, are they guilty for upholding those same laws and allowing the war crimes to go on? Though it seems easy from that description, the film really takes the time to show that this case isn't a clear cut case of good or evil, but rather a grey area that raises many questions about what was right or not. It also raises questions about the guilt of other countries for turning a blind eye to what the Nazis were doing. It's a deep, compelling, and harrowing drama that makes you pay attention to every detail and makes you think about the various issues and questions the script brings up. It's a film that requires full attention and participation from the viewer to fully process the details. It's also a film that is still very relevant even in this day and age that should be more widely acknowledged and shown. It's an important film that also happens to be an under-appreciated masterwork. If you love a good drama, this is one that is required viewing, in my opinion.",

            "content": "Wow, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland and even a young William Shatner are but a few people in this $3 million period epic, so I think it's safe to say that Stanley Kramer knew how to save money more than he knew how to save on time. Yup, in case \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" wasn't overlong enough for you, well, this probably won't impress you, because I hear the original cut of \"World\" is, for some reason, about thirty minutes longer than this film, and plus, as overlong as this film is, it's a bit more worthy of a hefty link... apparently. I don't know what is up with everyone's ideas that courtroom dramas have to be really, really long, but hey, we've still gotten some pretty good, really long legal dramas, so it's only fitting that this, a film that is about as long as any legal drama, be good. Man, I can't help but think about how weird it is that Stanley Kramer did this sprawling, thorough study on the trials against the particularly high-ranking Nazi monsters against the merciless purging of millions of people in the name of anti-semitism, then followed it up with \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\". Hey, say what you will about the guy's taste in runtimes, he was nothing less than versatile, or at least I think he was, because this film and \"World\" are the ones of his that people remember, and even then, people barely remember this \"little\" number. It's a shame, quite frankly, because we should never forget any kind of portrayal of the terrible, terrible travesties against the Jews, especially if those portrayals are as long as this one, because, I don't know about y'all, but if I'm investing three hours of my life into something, I better enjoy and remember it. Well, as sure as sunshine, this film is worthy of your time, though not entirely, as this legal epic is guilty of more than a few problems.\r\n\r\nOpening up only on the first night before the first day of the Nuremberg trials, this film doesn't really feel the need to give you all that much insight into the stories of the characters who will be driving this epic-length character study, and sure, compensation for expository shortcomings can be found within meaty characterization and richly well-defined performances, yet development issues still stand, giving you little immediate information and leaving you to go somewhat distanced from the full human depths of the final product. It's fairly impressive how much this film is able to flesh out its characters in spite of developmental shortcomings, especially considering the limitations in storytelling sensibilities at the time, but only so much can be done to obscure lulls in exposition, and even less can be done to drive your attention away from lulls in atmospheric kick, because as firmly secured as intrigue generally is, there are slow spots, something that a film this bloated cannot afford to have. At an astonishing 186 minutes of courtroom dramas and more simple, less juicy talkativeness beyond the courtroom, this film outstays its welcome by a considerable margin, seeming tight in some areas due to its being so good at sustaining intrigue on the whole, but truly being nothing if not exceedingly overlong, with excess material and filler, and, of course, repetition. The film is three hours well-spent, but this is still three hours we're talking about, and as momentous as the thematic depth of this important and humanly rich subject matter is, the plotting structure concept itself is anything but sweeping enough to sustain a runtime that boasts this sprawling of a length, which in turn only calls your attention further to natural shortcomings. Really, the flaws just discussed aren't as severe as I make them sound, as expository shortcomings are compensated for more often than not, and the runtime is made generally comfortable by intrigue that also thins out the sting of the atmospheric slow spells, so what might very well be the most serious shortcomings of the final product are of a natural persuasion, because there is something very minimalist about this conversationalist legal drama, thus the final product was never to be as potent was it clearly wants to be, and the sprawling runtime that was to breathe more well-rounded power into this worthy subject matter ends up doing only so much more than bloat storytelling into aimlessness. No matter how aimless the film gets, it grips, but not tightly enough for you to feel exactly what Stanley Kramer clearly wanted you to feel, as there is too much aimlessness to this overlong and slightly undercooked dialogue drama to consistently sustain your investment. Still, on the whole, no matter how much it is shaken, your investment never slips so far that the final product finds itself unable to reward, for although flaws are difficult to deny when it comes to this overblown drama, strengths are abundant enough to compensate and attract, even on a visual level.\r\n\r\nShot completely in black-and-white, this film found enough visual shortcomings within its being lensed at a time with limitations in photographic quality, so don't go into this film expecting its visual style to be especially advanced for its time, but do expect Ernest Laszlo to still show that he, at least when backed by Stanley Kramer's sharp directorial eye, sure knew his way around a camera, playing with framing in an occasionally stylish and consistently intimate fashion, while keeping what lighting there can be deep enough to give a sense of grit, augmented by the limitations in coloring. Stylistically, the film is hardly killer, but it is impressive when you step back to meditate upon what is accomplished here, unless, of course, it's too difficult to see this film's stylistic strengths through all of the much more rich substance strengths, which you should have no trouble seeing through all of the shortcomings in storytelling. Again, the film is too long for its own good, going into aimless spells - occasionally exacerbated by atmospheric limp spells - that give you more time than you should have to think about how limited this film's story concept is when it comes to structural meat, and yet, no matter how limited this story is in dynamicity, at its core is subject matter that is very worthy, rich and all around intriguing, with the potential to be executed into the compelling legal drama that it, in fact, is at the end of the day, partially thanks to Abby Mann's script's which boasts sharp dialogue to keep intrigue from slipping too much when struck by all of the narrative lulls, as well as many areas of subtly genuine characterization that may not be able to fully compensate for expository shortcomings, but do an adequate job of earning your investment in the characters, whose depths are truly powered by the performances that were somewhat ahead of their time. Not enough material is there for everyone to be stellar, but if nothing else is surprising about this film, especially considering the dramatic limitations of the time, it's just how much this star-studded cast delivers, with most every member having his or her time to shine as distinguished and effective, perhaps even powerful forces who drive much of the human depth within this character drama, whose outstanding secondary performances include such much too briefly present talents as the strong Montgomery Clift as a nervous, unstable and all around traumatized witness, and a piercing Judy Garland as a woman whose faith in a Nazi she thought was kind goes crushingly shaken while she finds herself tortured with accusations of an illegal statutory affair with the Nazi in question, and whose more primary cast members command your attention throughout the film, with Spencer Tracy being charismatic as the trial's chief judge, and a then-up-and-coming Maximilian Schell being effectively convincing in his immersed and layered portrayal of an intense seeker of justice for the unjust whose passion grows to corrupt his understandable, if somewhat misguided intentions, while the great Burt Lancaster all but steals the show in his initially quietly striking and gradually intensifying portrayal of a guilty man who regrets the terrible crimes that he and his peers are accused to exacting in the name of love for their flawed country. The names just mentioned are but a few worth mentioning in this hefty cast of classic talents, almost all of whom deliver with onscreen inspiration that goes matched only by Stanley Kramer's offscreen inspiration, because in spite of his inability to fully compensate for the final product's shortcomings, Kramer does enough to flesh this story out with a subtlety and range that is surprisingly audacious, being unafraid to take what chances it needs to (This film even has the guts to shamelessly feature a sequence that shows the fainthearted audience of the early '60s footage evidence of what was going on in the concentration camps) in order to reinforce intrigue of both a human and legal nature. The film is too overdrawn, aimless and naturally thin to be all-out powerful on the whole, but the thoughtfulness that Kramer puts into the telling of this intriguing tale gracefully fleshes out depth and intrigue enough to compel you time and again, and craft a final product that overcomes, not necessarily its natural shortcomings, but its flaws enough to reward the patient.\r\n\r\nTo come to my own judgment, moderate expository shortcomings slow down momentum, though not as much as the slow spells and repetitious padding that reflect the natural limitations in this relatively thin story enough for the final product to fall short of what it wants to be, though not so short that you can't still appreciate it as rewarding, as there is enough attractiveness to Ernest Laszlo's cinematography, sharpness to Abby Mann's script, power to the performances within this star-studded cast, and audaciously intriguing thoughtfulness to Stanley Kramer's inspired storytelling to make \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" a thoroughly compelling, if naturally restrained dramatization of the Nuremberg Trials and study on how passion can intensely corrupt.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

However, Maximillian Schell is by far the standout because he is such an amazing defender of his country's honor throughout the entire film. He wants the Holocaust to be known and yet all the while he goes through the case with dignity even though the pressures are so great. For every intense moment the viewer is stuck in their seat and when the verdict comes it is hard to contain the emotion. This movie should be seen by all not only because it is great but it also chronicles an important event in history.

Stanley Kramer's three-plus-hour-long courtroom drama exposes a side of postwar Germany few know about, describing the trial of the four highest ranking judges of the Third Reich for their war crimes. Kramer, himself a corpsman in WWII, acknowledged the world had made up its mind about Nazis and presented Judgment at Nuremberg with a completely unbiased approach, allowing him to focus his efforts on keeping the camera in near constant motion to help keep his courtroom epic from falling into monotony. And it worked. The smooth panorama motions and quick zoom ins add an elegance that prevents Judgment from being another Oscar-bait yawn-fest, which is quite an achievement for a dialogue driven film with no rising action. The magnitude of the brilliance of Abby Mann's cracking screenplay and the immense ensemble performance cannot be contained in one review, so that discovery is up to you.",
