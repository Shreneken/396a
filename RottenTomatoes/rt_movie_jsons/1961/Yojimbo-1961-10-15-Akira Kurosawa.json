    "summary": "A nameless ronin, or samurai with no master (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), enters a small village in feudal Japan where two rival businessmen are struggling for control of the local gambling trade. Taking the name Sanjuro Kuwabatake, the ronin convinces both silk merchant Tazaemon (Kamatari Fujiwara) and sake merchant Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura) to hire him as a personal bodyguard, then artfully sets in motion a full-scale gang war between the two ambitious and unscrupulous men.",

I love Akira Kurosawa's direction, Toshiro Mifune's performance, unique story and creative landscape and production design. Overall, Yojimbo is one of the finest films I have watched.",

            "content": "his actions.\nThe editing in the film is another critically important element. Kurosawa's editing techniques grew more skillful as his works progressed; adding to Yojimbo's message, not interrupting it. Keiko McDonald notes that, \"At the very beginning of Yojimbo Kurosawa establishes the temporal setting of the film by the use of the subtitle: 'The time was 1860...the emergence of middle-class merchants put an end to the power of the Tokugawa Shogunate...'\" (McDonald 188). The film, while being in black and white, and before CGI became the norm, is much more simplistic. With the lack of technology, directors and cinematographers had to have even more skill in order to realize their ambitions. Subtitles were often used as a way of establishing a setting, leaving no room for misrepresentation. It's in the film's best interest that the editing techniques advance the story while showcasing the varying groups and characters current situation as well as their interactions with one another. In the case of Yojimbo, if the viewer were to solely focus on one gang, or Sanjuro, and then transition over to another, the complexity of the situation and the realistic back and forth between the opposing elements would be completely lost.. Instead we are given many transitions between the two with each event or information being spread around to the other and it creates a more fluid and complex film.\nThe editing ensures a temporal and spatial continuity that advances the story while conserving the emotional buildup through the film and come to resent the warring sides and support Sanjuro and his quest to trick the two sides. This is essential as the flow of the film is dictated by the editing techniques used and the sequences order and arrangement in the running time of the film. If you were to view a different scene first instead of in its placement within the film we would disturb the director/editor's, in this case both were done by Kurosawa, intention and throw off the particular rhythm of the film's progression.\nThere are many aspects that are involved in making a film and while there are many different roles to fill in order to bring a motion picture together. It's the director who ensures the right people are in these roles. Over Kurosawa's career he developed great relationships and worked closely with a select few people on a regular basis. For this reason, many of his films and the works that were produced, including Yojimbo, have warranted praise as pieces of art. We have looked at a few elements that were paramount in bringing Kurosawa's vision to life in his film Yojimbo and what made him really stand out as a director and as a true artist. The film Yojimbo is simply Kurosawa's decades of film making and refining of his craft put into a motion picture with a complex and interesting plot and distinctly unique characters. The world they live in may be of a different time and place, even a whole other culture than ours, but it's our relatable feelings with the struggles of daily life that make us really feel for the under privileged and resent the power seeking corrupt. It's these basic elements that really pull in the film's audience and lend a layer of emotional correlation between the viewer and those in the film. Together, with the great cast and crew, a director is truly able to forge an admirable work of art.",

The look and feel of this film are both completely authentic, which makes it age well. While the story doesn't do a whole lot for me personally, I still felt engaged by the movie because of its style and dedication to creating this world. Overall, it is not necessarily the best of the Kurosawa films I have seen so far, but it is still one that showcases the legendary director's abilities behind a camera, at least from a technical perspective.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's 1961 epic samurai masterpiece Yojimbo, is a story about a samurai with no master who enters a small village in Japan run by two rival businessmen. The samurai takes the name Sanjuro and starts a gang war between the two rivals.\n\nThe film mounts with tension as each second passes by, and builds up to one of the most stressful final confrontations I have ever seen. The film's organic use of natural elements like wind, dust and rain make each scene stick in my mind. The cinematography and visuals are simply amazing and deserve much credit. I don't know how a village in 19th century Japan should look, but the film's production design immersed me and made me believe that's how it was.\n\nYojimbo somehow takes an anti-hero character and makes him into someone I cared about. The writing is also great and there are genuinely funny moments for which I laughed. The film contains some very valuable screenwriting and moral lessons. It shows social disorder and corruption which is very much relevant today. Even with all this, the film manages to remain gripping and entertaining if you are looking for just that.\n\nIn short Yojimbo is essential viewing for audiences looking for any type of film. If you are looking to watch a film for a weekend, you must check out Yojimbo, even if you haven't seen many black and white classics before. If you want to understand key principles of writing and direction, it is a must watch.",

The score and Toshir\u014d Mifune's head with mountains in the background as credits roll\u2026 what could be better??\n\nAkira Kurosawa will go down in history as one of the best directors of all time. He's flawless in the realm of film and it's amazing to watch! The acting is phenomenal and it's proof of a good director who knows how to work with his actors. Toshir\u014d is stellar and I love his facial expressions, a true actor, something hard to come by nowadays. No wonder Kurosawa always worked with him, he's simply spectacular.\n\nThere's something so special about old black and white Japanese films that get me so engaged. Even with Seven Samurai (3 1/2 hours) I was into it the whole time. The sound design in these kinds of films are great too, whether a character is walking or eating, if the weather is windy or rainy, every sound effect is perfect.\n\nThe story is at times hard to follow. Maybe it's because I know little to none about Japanese culture but I was still at times thinking to myself, \"why in the world is this happening?\" Or \"what does that mean?\" The plot itself is great, I just think I lost it a little somewhere in the middle. There's simply so much that happens I was always just a tad bit confused.\n\nIt's no Seven Samurai, but it's good. It's great even, however not perfect. I love the sound design, the cinematography, the shift in scenes, the acting, and the writing. \"Well what else is there Daniel, why isn't this 5 stars?\" The film drags\u2014and not in a good way where I'm super excited to keep watching\u2014in the way of \"wow, there's still 35 minutes left??\" It's close to perfect and I would definitely watch it again, but it's just too slow of a pace. Although the last 25ish minutes really make up for it. It's action packed and has you on the edge of your seat. (Yes I sound very indecisive, I know.)\n\nGive Yojimbo a try! Akira Kurosawa does not miss and I can't wait to explore more of his filmography. If you like Seven Samurai, you'll definitely enjoy this. 9.5/10 from me!",
