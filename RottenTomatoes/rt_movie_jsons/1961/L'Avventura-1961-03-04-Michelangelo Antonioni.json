    "summary": "In Michelangelo Antonioni's classic of Italian cinema, two lovely young women, Claudia (Monica Vitti) and Anna (L√©a Massari), join the latter's lover, Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), on a boat trip to a remote volcanic island. When Anna goes missing, an extensive search is launched. In the meantime, Sandro and Claudia become involved in a romance despite Anna's disappearance, though the relationship suffers from the guilt and tension brought about by the looming mystery.",

            "content": "In Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, friendship and love are fleeting and dispensable commodities in the world of the wealthy and powerful.  When a group of affluent Italians anchor their boat to explore a remote volcanic island, one of the women inexplicably disappears.  However, what starts as a mystery eventually evolves into something quite different as the fianc√© of the missing woman seeks comfort in the arms of the woman's best friend.  Those expecting a film that neatly ties up all of the loose ends will no doubt be disappointed by the outcome of L'Avventura, but the film is ultimately a meticulous examination of corrupted human nature that features beautiful cinematography, interesting directorial choices by Antonioni and a great performance from the beautiful Monica Vitti.",

No story, no real character arcs, these people are just there on the screen. Far far away in a different galaxy. Now I see this as Antonioni's masterpiece (but just a tad slow) and a far better, more creative film than, say, his more famous and accessible \"Blowup.\"",

While it is paced somewhat slow, it takes some time to establish characters and their relationships, so I was ready to forgive the pacing. Then something happens and the film becomes a mystery. For a little while, it appears we are actually on the case of a missing person, and I was intrigued to see how this would be resolved. After a little while it becomes obvious that this is not what the movie is actually about, and we will never see resolution. I should have known, based on my past experience with films by Antonioni, that he‚Äôs more interested in exploring relationship dynamics than actually telling a satisfying story. Boredom set in and I became more disconnected from the plot with each passing moment. The characters aren‚Äôt interesting, and don‚Äôt do much of anything, so following them on their wanderings is tedious. The movie is terribly long, particularly when you consider how little happens. I think there‚Äôs more static shots and total silence than there is movement and dialogue. I find myself more annoyed by movies like L‚ÄôAvventura because they trick unsuspecting audience members like myself into thinking they will have a normal story structure, and then leave you hanging until the final moment when you realize the writer/director is actually giving anyone who wants a satisfying conclusion a big middle finger. He cares about Anna about as much as Sandro did, and for all of us curious about her...screw you! I also know I‚Äôll be in the minority on this, because the kind of people who would seek out L‚ÄôAvventura are the kind of people who like a film that values existential exploration over plot.",

Early in the film, before Anna disappears, she tells her fiance Sandro that she loves him, but while he's been away, she also realized that she's perfectly happy without him.  Later, when Anna has disappeared and Sandro is with Claudia, he talks to her about his work.  They are looking at huge Gothic cathedral, and he tells her how buildings of rich importance used to be built with the intention that they last for centuries.  Now they aren't even intended to last a decade, so rather than try and build things, he makes a fortune providing estimates on other people's projects.  The characters in this movie inhabit a world where the traditional values no longer apply, but they have been unable to forge any replacements, so they act out the hollow shell of old roles and spend their time seeking sex and entertainment.  Similarly, this film sets itself up as a traditional meaningful narrative, setting up a key character and then just letting her vanish.  The remaining characters act out the shell of a plot, trying to find her, but just drift off into the shell of a romantic plot.  I think it's a brilliant and rare example of a film's themes being expressed not just in it's plot but in the very form the film takes.",

            "content": "3  1/2 of 5 stars\n\nL'Avventura challenged my threshold right to the absolute brink of turning it off. It starts off wandering aimlessly, characters with no direction, nor any interesting qualities, besides obvious superficial attractiveness. Anna is unhappy in her relationship with Sandro. They go for a boat ride with her friend Claudia and others out to some volcanic islands. Nothing about these relationships is connecting. The photography is hardly inspiring. Why would anyone hold this film in high esteem? Are we waiting for something smarter than us? \n\nIt is just at half an hour in that I'm ready to turn the film off, something interesting happens: the main character, Anna, disappears. We know she's been unsatisfied, that it doesn't seem like her life is going anywhere, so maybe she's playing a practical joke to get a rise out of the others. But as the search continues, we start to wonder if she went to great lengths. The supporting characters now shift to the leads, something interesting that undeniably captivates me right after I was ready to stop watching. The film took a risk by having no objectives for half an hour, but now an odd group of supporting actors are thrust into the main task of getting the movie back; we care about them finding the thing we never cared about! There might be reverse psychology at play, that we're curious about finding why we were never interested to begin with.\n\nAfter the rest of the group leaves the island for the night, Sandro and Claudia are left isolated with one other, a chance for him to reveal his male urges and make advances towards her, which at first she rejects. He is persistent, perhaps driven by 'my girl's best friend' fetish, which lands him a kiss. The next day, a search party arrives, and she does everything she can to stay away from him. The first of two references to an abandoned city is made, the group realizing this is an archaeological site when they stumble upon an artifact.\n\nAfter they return to civilization, Claudia tries to disappear on a train, but Sandro won't have it, chasing her down. Make no mistake, Sandro is a horny man who is badly chasing an idea, and who will convince himself he's in love until he scores it. This film underscores the torment women undergo when subjected to pure sexual objectification. Claudia wants real love, thus she's willing to eventually go along with Sandro if his intentions are true. But there are other women, like the trance writer with the torn dress who's like a stenographer for the dead, an extremely attractive woman - she rather enjoys being a sex object men throw themselves at.\n\nSandro and Claudia's relationship continues to develop as they look for Anna, at one point arriving in a ghost down, the second occurrence of an abandoned city. The idea of this recurrence may have some reflection on the subject Anna, how she made us feel the first thirty minutes: an empty shell, abandoned within, no direction forward, only what is behind, which we know very little about. The camera is aware of this feeling, focusing on the city for moment above the characters, a slow push-in on a church through an alleyway.\n\nEventually, the tables have turned, Claudia head over heels for Sandro as he begins to cool off. Just like a man to finally get that lay, only to become slightly less passionate than his score. The film continues to explore horny hounds, Claudia the subject of mass leering in another town, her response opposite that of the reveling writer. She wants one man badly, and she's even become a little pathetic about it, desiring that he need her. Before he got laid, he didn't mind saying \"I love you,\" but now she can't get him to say it. The film highlights her self-disparagement accented by inferiority. Yet it also accentuates her desire to be free with someone, like she was with Anna, who may yet be her true lover. Her guard is down for Sandro, she sings and dances for him, only to be greeted by his lessened enthusiasm. \n\nTrue to the unfulfilled wishes of David Lynch, I root for the mystery of what happened to Anna never be resolved. You'll have to see for yourself how it all turns out, but regardless of whether or not she's found, we realize that the film we thought was about Sandro and Anna's doomed failure is about the challenge ahead for any possible future between Sandro and Claudia. Sandro is earthbound to male urges, and Claudia's doomed to the lust of all other men, as inescapable eye candy for the pleasure of an objectifying culture. Her love is weak, and underlying she knows it, but in this kind of culture, her identity can only be found in the protection of a male suitor. Perhaps her happiness was with Anna; there was plenty of flirtation between them. This society will never allow that kind of exploration.",

After seeing the film, I also had a good discussion with my friend and adult son, who were with me as well. \n\nThis movie struck me in a whole sense -- not through the intellect, but as a canvas of lost or confused people living life, with streaks here and there of genuine and intense humanity. The story is not meant to be held too closely to logical ideas, but it does make sense, overall. The intensity of the story comes from allowing the imagery and the momentary impressions to enter one's perceptions at a deeper level.\n\nWithout giving away anything, the last few moments of the movie drive home the human core of the story, and yet remains understated. As the director said in an interview, he wanted the audience to do some of the work in connecting with his film, and if the viewer does so, it is indeed a very rewarding film.",

Vitti has a unique erotic charisma, presence and a sort of mystifying beauty and everything that happens in the film depends on it. You simply can't take your eyes off of her. Within only a few minutes of seeing her, she becomes erotically stunning. As the film moves forward the viewer must decide if her character is actually concerned or curious. There seems to be a deception playing out. \n\nAntonioni finds ways to push a suspicious disappearance further way from the film's plot. What at first seems like an essential element for Vitti's character and that of her friend's lover eventually becomes nothing more than a back story. By the time the film drifts to its midpoint, we no longer care longer about the vanished friend, daughter and fiancee. \n\nThe primary concern becomes a possibility of love between Vitti and the \"worried\" fiancee. There is an ever unsettling feeling that the two leading characters hope  she is never found. The real kick-spin is that both have different reasons for wishing this person to stay \"vanished.\" It is an alarming shift of gears that doesn't really hit you until long after the movie is over.\n\nThe entirety of the film is fascinating and it all belongs to Monica Vitti who commands the screen in both a passive and demanding way. Cinematic magic.",

His characters experience profoundly tumultuous relationships that leave them emotionally crippled and overwhelmed to the point of paralysis, but they have no means of communicating their feelings with those around them in a way that might relieve them of their pain. Love is often like this, inner-fears and guilty instances of doubt going unacknowledged in order to enable the complacency; their infidelities are a result of this lack of transparency, and when they finally begin to understand each other, it's only after putting themselves through needless emotional abuse. Sadly, this is also true to life.",

I know I'm in a minority here, but I don't find this movie impressive on any level other than it's craftsmanship. Maybe I'll like it more in a few years but for now I find it wildly underwhelming.",

Before coming in, I scrolled through what films this director has made and it turns out he has made quite a few notable films; I just didn't know he directed them. I came into L'avventura expecting to be satisfied, and for the most part I was. But there are a few things about it that brought the film down for me, and could be improved through a little more understanding.\n\nL'avventura's screenplay was written by Michelangelo Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, Tonino Guerra. Both Guerra and Bartolini have worked on other films directed by Antonioni. I felt two things after finishing the film, curiosity and confusion. The film is essentially two halves, with the former focusing on the disappearance of Anna and the latter exploring the aftermath of the incident through the relationship that has formed between Anna's best-friend and boyfriend/fiancee, Claudia and Sandro. The first half of the film was really interesting, it got me excited and engaged all the way through it. This half of the film establishes it's characters and helps the audience understand the current condition of Anna and Sandro's relationship. I don't think it was intentional or not, but Anna was written in a way indicating that she might be depressed, due to the struggling relationship she has with her father and her boyfriend. This was only a theory that I thought of in my head, as a rationale for her actions. For all we know, she did it in order to start anew or maybe just to gain a bit of attention, this was what it seemed like she was doing with the whole shark incident. The search for Anna, I felt was very thrilling. I just had this urge in me to find out what exactly happened to her, and why she did it. This side of the film also some minor exploration with a bunch of characters that was with them on the cruise. They weren't important to the plot but they were a nice break from the drama between the lead characters. The second half of the film focuses more on the romance being developed between Claudia and Sandro, which I wouldn't really mind exploring but by the end of it, I was left really confused on what the reason was for it and what the writers wanted us to gain from it. But at the same time, I didn't feel it was an overall disappointment because I was left curious and wanting to go back and figure out what it all means; I'll come back to this film later after enough time has passed, in order to come into this film fresh again. This half of the film shows us the difficulty in being in a relationship like this, feeling emotions of guilt and sadness as they go on with it. Both Claudia and Sandro never gained any closure for the sudden abandonment of their beloved friend but yet they kept on forward into this relationship because I think they both internally needed each other in order to get through it, even if rash and impulsive decisions are being made from it. I'm not so sure on what to make of the ending of L'avventura, as it felt really ambiguous. I think coming back to this once more may give me a clearer understanding on what it meant.\n\nThe film was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. I am not very familiar with the style and ideas that are commonly found in his films as L'avventura was the first film I have experienced from the director. I was happy with the way he handled this film, as he truly captured the intimate feelings between the characters. I felt that the disconnection between Anna and Sandro was real and the spark of romance between Sandro and Claudia also felt genuine. It never at all came at me in a forced kind of way. I can't say that this film is the most romantic film I have ever seen, and I don't think Antonioni was trying to aim for that. I think he was focus was to try and have the audience care and understand these characters, making us ask questions like \"why would they be involved in a relationship with such a complicated circumstance?\" or \"what really happened to Anna and why did she just decide to vanish?\" because the director doesn't really give us any answers; he wants us to find it for ourselves and create our own theory on what the film means. As I have said before, I was more engaged with the events that has happened during the first half of the film rather than the events found on the second half because Antonioni made us feel like we were there also looking for Anna. He built up all this drama before the incident, exploring feelings, thoughts and intentions from Anna, therefore making me care about her. He was also able to create this layer of mystery on what exactly happened to her, and it stays intriguing because we never gain any resolution for it. The director made us feel like a failure for not being able to find her and we end up empathising the grief that the characters are in. The second half, aside from the romance, seems to explore the idea of desire. Though I cannot go really into it as I haven't fully understood what the intentions are of the director when it comes to that concept. We can see the theme of desire or lust through certain events, including the woman being followed and \"adored\" by men, and the looks that men were giving to Claudia when she stood alone somewhere. The sexual passion between Claudia and Sandro could also be related to the idea of \"desire\" but I need another watch to understand it. That theme of desire may also be related to Anna, as the film gives us clues of her being wanted or cared for, and seems to act out in strange ways when she doesn't get it. The film's pacing was good, though it could have been shortened by 10-15 minutes. There were just some scenes during the second half of the film that was important I guess in developing the character, but wasn't executed in a way that had me interested. The first half of the film moved very well, not wasting any time in developing it's characters and plot, always giving us something to latch onto.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Aldo Scavarda, who has worked on other films including Before the Revolution and Blood in the Streets. His work for L'avventura was fantastic, it looked really beautiful. The highlight of his work was found during the scenes on the island, which I am positively sure was shot on location. Throughout the film, Scavarda and Antonioni have composed shots that highlights or focuses both the foreground and the background, similar to what was done on Citizen Kane. The backdrops in this film are gorgeous, particularly on the island scenes, with clouds and the sun creating a beautiful painting. The second half also was good but not as beautiful as what was done for the first half of the film. Scavarda and Antonioni made use of this depth of field by having actors interact with the foreground and background of the scene, at times it made me think of Terrence Malick as I see it a lot from his films. The film also is presented in black and white which was an odd choice at first, because Antonioni would have had the opportunity to create some beautiful imagery but then I started to see why he decided to opt the black and white approach; it haves the audience be more focused on the internal feelings and thoughts between the characters instead of being distracted by the background and it's colors. The film also consists of a lot of close ups, though not very tight as Scavarda leaves enough room for something to happen on the back, which I thought was quite clever. Throughout the film, we could see slow pans from crashing waves or from something in the environment to the actors, I wasn't quite sure what the meaning behind it was but I thought it was really effective; though then again, it could be just an excuse to provide beautiful imagery.\n\nL'avventura's score was composed by Giovanni Fusco, who has also collaborated with Antonioni multiple times in films like L'eclisse and Red Desert. I found Fusco's score for L'avventura to be entertaining, particularly the main theme, as it's so catchy and fun. Though it does feel a tad bit out of place as the film's subject never seem to work well with that particular piece of music. The score that comes up throughout the film on the other hand was both enjoyable and effective. It only really comes up on moments where dialogue isn't emphasised or spoken, and is present more to move the film along and keep us interested instead of setting up the film's tone.\n\nThe film's acting overall was delightful with great performance from it's main three players; Monica Vitti, Gabriele Ferzetti, and Lea Massari. The first 20-30 minutes of the film's acting weight is mostly carried by Massari and she did a pretty good job. She plays a woman who seems to be in pain inside and as we go further along the film, we start to see more of her exterior being consumed in frustration. After her character disappears, the acting is then carried by both Vitti and Ferzetti. Both did justice to their roles, showing us layers to these characters that would have been difficult or forced if expressed through dialogue. It's the subtle things on their faces and actions that sell their acting, which is why a bulk of the film consists of close ups of these actors.\n\nL'avventura, for me, was short of being perfect but that may improve as time passes. The film leaves you intrigued and curious rather than being frustrated, and definitely requires multiple viewings in order to gain appreciation of the ideas that are found throughout L'avventura.",

Leave it to existential moral films of the 1960's, this being one of the grandaddies, to show us how miserable we end up being in the world if we don't break free of one another.  It's basically like if Camus or Beckett wrote Psycho - what happens when you \"kill off\" your main character half an hour into the movie - and then gave us superlative cinematography (seriously, this is an amazing movie to just look at at times, it's hard to deny Antonioni his eye at least) along with characters just a cut above Twilight folk.  It's a genuinely interesting film about decaying relationships, but it's never emotionally engaging, which is its flaw.",

            "content": "Before anything else, let me first, for the record, state that I love Michelangelo Antonioni's films. Be it the psychological enigma that is \"Blowup\", the mysterious identity thriller that is \"The Passenger\" or the marital woe-laden \"La Notte\", he has always been a hit to me. Without exaggeration, I consider him as one of the greatest auteurs of all time, and I'm not even halfway through his sterling filmography yet. So with that in mind, I went on to watch \"L'Avventura\", the first film in his informal 'Incommunicability Trilogy', with an expectation of being blown away once more. But alas, it has not happened. \n\nHailed as a cinematic work that has completely revolutionized the way films are structured and executed, \"L'Avventura\" is quite a disappointment for me as far as Michelangelo Antonioni and his films are concerned. But then again, maybe that is the film's point. After all, the film is a prolonged observation of emotional detachment, which is the same thing that I have felt while watching the film. \n     \nThough I understand where the characters are coming from, the film has still alienated me to high heavens. If perhaps that is Mr. Antonioni's ultimate intent, then I am impressed once more. If it's not, then maybe I deserve to be sentenced to an eternal cinematic damnation for not liking a film that everyone seems to love. But kidding aside, I think that \"L'Avventura\" is really that kind of film that is quite difficult to like but is easy to admire.\n     \nAntonioni, being the existentialist filmmaker that he is, is more concerned not with the film's literal mystery (the sudden disappearance of one of the characters) but with the emotional enigma that pervades throughout. The primary premise is simple enough: After the shocking disappearance of her friend Anna (Lea Massari) during a yacht trip, Claudia (Monica Vitt) suddenly finds herself trying to resist the urge of falling in love with Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), the man that's no less than Anna's current lover. But still, fell she did. \n     \nAll throughout the film, Michelangelo Antonioni finely questions the validity of the romance between Claudia and Sandro and invites us to witness the subtle awkwardness of it all. We see them kiss and hug in hotel rooms and on discreet street corners. We can sense that, somehow, they look fine together, but what about Anna? \n     \nAs the film progresses, Antonioni lays down the question of whether or not we should take Anna's disappearance literally or symbolically. Whatever our personal answers regarding it may be, it is quite evident that Antonioni has used Anna's sudden absence as a device to further explore the emotional uncertainties of the kind of love that mushrooms from such situation rather than as a shallow means to compel and excite. \n     \nDespite of its slow pacing, bloated running time and alienating characters, \"L'Avventura\" is still a seminal film that is worthy of great veneration mainly because of how it has changed the way how cinema can communicate such things as love, existence and the feeling of being lost. I may not have liked the film that much compared to Michelangelo Antonioni's other works, but I sure do respect it for what it has contributed to the artistic progression of cinema as a whole. By creating this film, Antonioni has proven that cinema has no limitations, that it is not necessarily all about the plot and the payoff, and that cinema can exist outside the four corners of a tightly-structured narrative; the shackles are no more.",

To any average movie watcher it's very long but to others it's defined as phychologically metaphoric because of it's subtle tones and long nuances when the Joan character goes missing, she became an important figure but as the film progresses she became less important since the two people who're supposed to be the most closest to her become affectionate to one another unable to grasp it's main reason for travelling around Italy in the first place because \"the missing person has possibly been sighted in different locales\" all over and around Italy.  The two investigate but end up finding nothing- they do however don't mind in experiencing their extravangant lifestyle.  It's made similar to films as \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"There Will Be Blood\" where viewers think that something is important but suddenly becomes unimportant.

With the exception on the people who feel that way, this film is a film that literally does not lack anything. It excels in a lot, especially it's stunning visuals, but it really doesn't lack anything. While Antonioni, to quote myself, \"dwells in the moment\", there are always emotions in the air.

Later on(and I've read this in other people's comments here as well) I found images and dialogue from the movie creeping into my subconscious; entire dreams would take place upon the island where Anna goes missing(often in monochrome), or I'd start to compare real life events to those that occur during the film. Did Antonioni plant subliminal messages within the movie? Probably not. It's more likely the masterful pace he employs here, coupled with the busy, deep cinematography is the cause of this. Notice how the backgrounds NEVER go out of focus, no matter how much is going on within the frame. Check out the scene about an hour and ten minutes in, where Sandro and the old man are talking in the middle of an extremely busy street; nothing blurs or goes out of focus, even when a tram comes in and out of the shot, nothing loses it's perspective, and as the scene ends and they walk deep into the shot we can see way past them and far, far into the distance.\n\nThis seems to be why the film has such a deep affect on the subconscious. The characters are deliberately shallow and are placed at the very foreground of every shot, yet the backgrounds are rich tableaux bustling with life. In the scenes on the island where Anna disappears, we see the main characters always in shot, yet in the background there is a feeling that something strange within nature itself is going on. The darkening of the clouds, the sudden mist upon the water, the rocks falling to the sea, even the sudden appearance of the old hermit character, all give a certain unease.\n\nThere's also the haunting feeling of the film, as Anna's friends begin, almost immediately to forget about her. Soon, they don't seem to care a jot about her, and neither, in a sense, do we. It's this feeling of loose ends and guilt on our part(for joining her so called 'friends' in forgetting about her so quickly) that leaves the deepest impression. The characters in this film are so morally shallow(the ending bears this out) yet they are the reason this film leaves such a strong impression on those who watch it, and who become captivated by it.\n\nI cant recommend this film to everyone because I know that the Hollywood Blockbuster has reduced most modern cinema-goers attention spans to almost zero. But if you fancy a challenge, or merely wish to luxuriate in classic cinema.....begin here.",

The opening half of the film revolves around a group of wealthy intellectuals on a private cruise, the attention focusing mainly on Anna (Lea Massarri), the enigmatic and depressed mistress of Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), a rich architect, and Claudia (Monica Vitti), Anna's best friend. They stop off by some large rocky islands in the middle of the ocean and, eventually, without any explanation whatsoever, Anna disappears.

Antonioni was less interested in conventional narrative and more in using a camera to capture the emotions and relationships between people who seem to have lost all ability to feel. It seems that repeat viewings improve one's outlook on all the films in Antonioni's 'incommunication' trilogy. I still feel very firmly that L'Eclisse, the last film, is the greatest, but L'Avventura is a clear masterpiece and one of Antonioni's finest works.",

            "content": "\"L'Avventura\" is a very unique Italian movie. Anna (Massari) invites her friend Claudia (Vitti) to come with her, her fiancee Sandro (Ferzetti), and some other pals to go boating. Anna and Sandro are bickering, and she is moody and unpleasant. When they land on an island, Anna disappears, leaving no traces at all. No one can find her, and no matter if she likes it, it seems Claudia is assuming the role of Anna with Sandro. Will she give in? \"L'Avventura\" is widely considered the breakthroughs of both actress Monica Vitti and director Michelangelo Antonioni. This movie was presented at Cannes at first, and at one time was booed(?), but people began to realize how brilliant of a film this was after it was released into theaters. This is, as well, the first of a supposed trilogy with Vitti and Antonioni, and continued with \"La Notte\" and \"L'Eclisse\". Though this considered the most boring, (which I agree, it isn't too exciting) I found it very artistic and well-acted. This movie was filmed on location in Italy and the beautiful, rocky island shown during the first half is gorgeous. Antonioni luckily shows you a lot. Then, when the film switches to Italy, you get to travel to rustic houses and cathedrals. That's definitely a plus, but still, the acting is spectacular. Vitti is wonderful as Claudia, and it's very easy to see why this movie made her a star. She handles every scene perfectly, and looks beautiful while doing it. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her movies, because she's definitely up there with Sophia Loren. Ferzetti is also great, and holds his known next to Vitti. You can feel how tortured he is not having Anna, but at the same time, you can tell is needs something. Both of these actors performances could be melodramatic, but they are natural. \"L'Avventura\" isn't the most exciting movie, but it really is beautiful, and could be liked by anyone that loved \"La Dolce Vita\".",

            "content": "The first Michelangelo Antonioni film I have seen, and now I'm dying to see more.  The emotions I got from L'Avventura reminded me of La Dolce Vita.  These people are stuck in life without knowing how to make themselves happy.  They have all the money they need to be happy but they can never find people to truly care about them.  At first it seems like this can't be the true moral of the story because Claudia cared so much about Anna.  And Anna's father cared so much about Anna.  When she disappeared off the island they had no idea what to do.  Claudia says later that she had wished she were dead.  It doesn't take too long for these people to move on.  Anna's father is already doing business deals and moving around without a care in the world.  Sandro, Anna's fiance, decides to pursue Claudia.  At first Claudia thinks this is repulsive, but she then goes along with it and wants him to tell her he loves her.  She knows deep down this is all fake, but she needs someone there for her.  This is why Anna escaped, and why we all thought she was crazy in the beginning.  We think she has so many people who love her, but she takes all of their love for granted.  No, she just knows the truth.  These people will betray her or forget about her within a few days of her being gone.  She needed to escape, to find people who could actually care.  And if not, she will leave and find a way to live life that pleases her.  Some complain that this film is about nothing.  Well, it doesn't have the conventional plot, but it reminds me of Fellini.  We are following characters instead of a story.  Anna is never found, nor do they even suggest what happens to her.  The audience can pick up fairly easily what happened once they sit and think about it, but it's not followed as a plot.  Instead we are following these characters that \"loved\" Anna at one time.  The cinematography is brilliant.  Every single second of this film is a piece of art.  I love the way that Antonioni brings side characters that last for a few moments to get his point across even more.  For example, when Sandro goes to the pharmacist to ask about Anna stopping by to buy tranquilizers, we catch what the pharmacist's marriage is like.  They have only been married for 3 months, and he doesn't mind going out in front of her and flirting with another woman.  This isn't harmless flirting either; he was obviously trying to pick her up.  It seems like in this film, everything fades or is fake to begin with.  Everyone is trying to fill a void in their lives, but no one knows how to do it and make themselves happy.  An undeniable masterpiece, and I can't wait to watch more from Antonioni.",

            "content": "L'AVVENTURA was director Michaelangelo Antonioni's first international hit, winning the Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Here a small of rich Italian socialites takes a boat out to a volcanic island. Anna (Lea Massari) quarrels with her fiancee Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), and subsequently goes missing. The police are brought in and divers scour the waters, but Anna never turns up. One would expect the film to develop as a whodunit, either revealing Anna to still be alive or putting the finger on the person responsible for her disappearance.\n\nInstead, Anna never shows up, and the film goes off in an immensely surprising direction. Anna's friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) is suddenly promoted from a background character to the very centre of the picture, with her interaction with Sandro driving the picture. While the film lacks a traditional plot, and in door scenes tend to be brief arguments between lovers, the main part of the film is held together with a series of long shots of landscapes. Appreciating Antonioni's style requires some work, but as in the lengthy late works of composers Morton Feldman or Toru Takemitsu, eventually the rewards come. The scenes of the ocean while the party is on the volcanic island are beautifully constructed and will have stayed with me after the film ends. Furthermore, becoming comfortable with L'AVVENTURA makes one all the more ready for Antonioni's later and longer film THE PASSENGER, which I think his masterpiece.\n\nAntonioni's casting of Monica Vitti was brilliant, for in a film that requires the female protagonist to stand as a witness to everything going on around her, Vitti's statuesque beauty is just the ticket. Esmeralda Ruspoli plays a ditzy young lady well, adding a touch of humour to what otherwise would have been a deathly serious film. And though the plot is untraditional, and the existential themes take a backseat to the composition, I'd say there is some closure, with Sandro's inner self stripped naked by the end.",

            "content": "Michelangelo Antonioni's masterfully directed, L'Avventura is a film that defies any standard genre.  We follow the Italian bourgeois to an island, where we watch them as they suffer boredom sunbathing on a yacht and swimming in the Mediterranean.  Then one of the girls goes missing.  But, interestingly enough, no one seems to care.  A haunting look into existential, post-WWII Europe, L'Avventtura-in its unattested visual style-explicates the consequences of living in a world without a moral compass and the impending isolation that one needs to fight in order to escape.   \n         Because L'Avventura relies on visuals to exposit rather than a dialogue driven narrative, it is to be expected that critics do not agree as to what this film is about.  But this may be going too deep from the start.  The great abstract painter Mark Rothko said Antonioni's films were, \"about nothing with precision.\"  L'Avventura rests not on its plot but on a thematic wavelength that the viewer is responsible for finding.  In another text, the critic Joseph Bennet asserts that the \"film exists because it is.  It does not think.  It does not plan ahead.  There is no drive, no line.  Every movement is a succession of asides.\"  Furthermore, it \"systematically subverted the filmic codes, practices and structures in currency at its time.\"  Although L'Avventura is a revolutionary film in it's structure and style, it is also profound in its honest depiction of a society increasingly isolated from one another.  Being in a war-ravaged post-WWII Italy, culture no longer had any interest in, \"God, love, morality, natural law and eternal order\" and had instead adopted the temporal, hedonistic, volcanic eruption-and subsequent burial alive-of sexual revolution, cynical indifference, and material corruption.  At Cannes Film Festival-where the film was initially booed-Antoioni declared, \"Eros is sick.\"  He argued that in the, \"absence of traditional moral restraints, an unbridled animal nature seduces sexual love and, more seriously, shipwrecks agape, leaving men beaten and mean, with no satisfaction, feeling mutually exploited and hardened, yet still filled with desperate yearning.\"  And here we have the character of Sandro.  The belief that traditional moral values had been usurped by the existential thinking of Nietzsche and the like had not given the desired expectation.  In the philosopher Peter K. McInerny's writings on existentialism, we find what could be the core of what L'Avventura is:\n\"Without God, there may seem to be no objective values, so that any action or way of living is as good as any other.  Without God, human history and our own individual lives are of no significance for the universe at large.  Nothing we do will have any impact on the immense and everlasting universe.  The individual feels alone and adrift.\"",

But it is the way everyone, i.e. the deplorable upper classes, treats it. They move on to the next thing, be it a fling with a ponsy artist or to attend a luxuriant dinner party, with considerable ease. The lack of humility in these characters are apparently the core of Antonioni's study (the moment when Sandro drops the ink on a young architect's drawing is a key point). Claudia is an exception up to a point. Unwillingly, she becomes part of this adventure. Her shortcomings are the tragedy of this film. And this is one of the most important reflections on life ever commited to the film world. In my opinion, it's understated power has never been surpassed.

What it showed was that films do not have to be structured around major events, that very little drama can happen and a film can still be fascinating to its audience. It also showed -- and this was harder for audiences to grasp (and still is) -- that events in films do not have to be, in an obvious way, meaningful. L'Avventura presents its characters behaving according to motivations unclear to themselves as much as to the audience; they are sensitive to mood, to landscape, to things that happen, but they also behave in routine and conformist ways. None of them, except Claudia (who had, in her words, \"a sensible childhood, without any money\"), seems to have much consciousness of the lack of direction that afflicts them. They are, to use a word very fashionable at the time the film came out, alienated. But to say, as many critics did, that the film is \"about\" alienation is to miss the point. The film shows, it doesn't argue. It convinces by the sensitivity and accuracy of its observation, not by heavy signals to the audience to think this, that, or the other.\n\nMore than any other film L'Avventura seems to define the spirit of a time in cinema when anything seemed possible and there was no territory into which it could not venture. (The more I think about it, post-war Italian cinema may be my favorite \"genre.\" It didn't succumb to any filmic conventions, and approached weighty subject matter with grace and elegance.) Above all what it seeks to capture is the world of fleeting emotion, feelings which are unstable and crystallize only momentarily in the camera's gaze. After L'Avventura, Antonioni did not look back. He made three further films with Monica Vitti --The Night (1961), Eclipse (1962), and Red Desert (1964) -- each time pushing further back the frontiers of what cinema could explore. It's hard to say which of these films is the best, but L'Avventura is the one that started Antonioni on his quest, and remains the one that most clearly represents the unique nature of his art.",

The original mystery disappears like Anna (played by Lea Massari) on the island  and seems only to be a device to bind Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and Claudia (Monica Vitti) together. But their inability to solve it while beginning an affair leaves them racked with guilt. \n\nIt is visually impressive like so many Antonioni films and the many lingering shots leave enduring images.

Proto-Hanekeing-off at it's most tiresome.\n\n I enjoyed the scene where all the men stare at the woman in the square, there was an uncanny cinematic flair in that scene (and the final one) that reminded me of Antonioni at a more advanced stage in his talents. The skinny painter's emo-bangs in his face made me laugh(some things are truly timeless). Here Antonioni seems still trapped between formal neo-realism and the glamorous alienation tales of his later career, and \"L'Aventura\" is the awkward middle child of this process. \n\nI don't mind the film starting out about one thing, and ending with another, but something like \"Gregory's Girl\" does a much better job of this. Tsai Ming Liang and co. have been having a fun and cinematically exciting time with these themes and ideas for some time now, and going back to \"L'Aventura\" now just feels like a step-down and an enriching experience from the past. This is a Euro-Art movie death trap, for the unimaginative and the bored. More later...",

The repeated shots of scores of men in the village publicly gazing at a single woman, capture the mystique that women have to men-- but also the very real, threatening power men have over women, and rape is literally a subject of the film twice. the film shows empathy towards its female characters, and in Claudia, the main character, Vitti and Antonioni create a character who functions as both a symbol of idealized femininity as well as a believable, often quirky woman struggling to understand for herself how to deal with men.",
