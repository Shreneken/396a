            "content": "Probably the greatest depiction of pool in a movie, not only because of its accuracy, but because it shifts towards a story so specific it opens the gates to treasures of drama. The performances are very convincing, and that includes the acting, the dialogue, the pool games in action, and everything else throughout. The Hustler was considered revolutionary in its time, but it still can be considered so today. It's a must-watch.",

            "content": "The Hustler isn't just one of, if not the single, greatest sports movies of all-time. It's just one of the great films ever made. Everything about this film is almost pitch perfect, from it's cinematography, it's tone, the direction, writing, acting, music, etc. Robert Rossen has made a certified classic and a movie that is must-watch for any cinephile at least once a year.\n\nThe best part of this film, by far, are the performances. In a film that uses limited sets and usually filmed in dark and closed pool halls, it's up to the actors to be at the top of their game, and the main quartet are certainly that. Paul Newman give a career best performance as \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, making the brash and headstrong pool shark a sympathetic character who goes through the entire gamut of emotions by the end of the film and has you questioning whether the end justifies the means.\n\nPiper Laurie as well, as Newman's counterpart and the one who quietly shapes everything about Eddie, is phenomenal as the equally flawed but equally sympathetic Sarah. She actually ends up with the most heart-wrenching and most important moments in the film, with her tender care for Eddie as he recovers from his injuries and her desperation and end thanks to a sleazy manager really hits hard.\n\nOf course, you have to focus as well on possibly the most underrated antagonist in film over the past 75 years in George C. Scott's Bert Gordon. There is nothing redeeming about Bert Gordon, nothing that makes a view think that maybe he's right in the end. He's greedy, slimy, manipulative, and only out for his own pocketbook. That point is never more clear than the sequence with Findlay (Murray Hamilton) in which he is able to anger Eddie enough to come back and win a substantial of money and then accosts Sarah and causes her demise. The slow diatribe that Eddie goes on throughout the climactic pool sequence going after Bert is cathartic not just for Eddie but the viewers as well. It's a well-written villain and Scott is perfectly sleazy for the role. If it wasn't for Patton, I'd say it was his best work.\n\nFinally with casting, we get to the mere presence that is Jackie Gleason. He's barely in the film, bookending the feature, but whenever he's on screen you can't look away. The big man dominates his screentime and is believable as the legendary shark Minnesota Fats. When he say \"pay up\" after being thoroughly defeated by Eddie, you feel for him, almost like he was just a slight speedbump for Eddie to drive over and get to his real target at this point, Bert.\n\nTechnically, it's incredibly vivid to watch and the way the cinematographer and Robert Rossen use lighting and shade is immaculate. The closeups of Newman alone in the pool halls are worth the watch, but the standout sequence is the final scene of Sarah. You see her broken and at her end through a mirror. Scrawling \"Perverted, Twisted, Crippled\" in lipstick shows how dark the path Bert has led Eddie on and the next shot of Eddie discovering her and Bert claiming ignorance is profound.\n\nIn the end, the Hustler is an incredible film experience and one that we can all learn form about the mentality of winning and whether we would take the steps to get to the point that we think we desire to reach. In the end, Paul Newman and \"Fast\" Eddie Felson is all of us. What good is reaching the mountaintop if all we did is lose ourselves and everything we love in the process?",

A well-written and excellently acted movie about a broken woman being unable to fix a broken man. A man obsessed with determining his own worth by how unbeatable he is at pool. Realizing far too late in life what was truly important to him. Selling out his soul to a person who thinks very little of him unless he is winning and earning money. That would've been enough for an amazing story, but it also tries to push through a very heavy-handed social hierarchy theme, which feels ridiculous when it's applied to something as benign as pool gambling. It's even more depressing when you consider that in the sequel decades later, it would turn out that Eddie, despite his defiance at the end, never managed to escape.",

We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.",

            "content": "The Hustler is one of those classic films with an all-star cast that I just don't find as incredible or groundbreaking as its reputation would suggest. The struggle of Newman's 'Fast Eddie' Felson is one that is rooted in deep character flaws; while he has the technical capability and talent to be the best, his nature forces him to push himself too far and fails to allow im to recognize his own limitations, often causing devastating results in his game as well as his personal relationships. But the romantic subplot used to demonstrate his faults is overblown and poorly constructed, with Laurie's Packard feeling like a one-note knockoff of the habitually drunk romantic interest archetype that seems to have pervaded theatre and cinema around the middle of the 20th century, when alcoholism substituted for personality from a narrative perspective. The film's big thematic statement is that it might not be wise to pursue goals recklessly and obsessively at the expense of those around you; okay? We're not exactly storming bravely into the unknown here, in a film that seems convinced of its own importance. What The Hustler does nail is the performances and the actual depictions of pool, with Newman, Scott, and Gleason each delivering sobering and entertaining work in equal measure. With this viewing, I'm of the belief that most of what this film accomplished was the reintroduction of pool to the mainstream, rather than breaking ground cinematically. (3.5/5)",

Fortunately they were largely met as all of the praise that people throw around was deserved with the gritty, tough tone of the film not relenting and the performances coming across as surprisingly naturalistic for the time. This is a film that will hopefully stay with me long after I have seen it with it's difficult messages about masculinity and the expectations we have of life. Unlike many films released in 1961 to great success this film has remained in the cultural zeitgeist and continues to be referenced in other films.\n\nAspiring pool hustler Eddie Felson, Paul Newman, works under the more cautious Charlie, Myron McCormick, and makes his way to a small town to play the famed Minnesota Fats, Jackie Gleason. He aims to earn $18,000 but his self destructive tendencies cause him to continue playing even when he has made that amount and he ends up losing all of his money. He parts ways with Charlie and strikes up a relationship with alcoholic student Sarah Packard, Piper Laurie, and the two live on money provided by her father. He spends his time trying to earn enough money through hustling to play Minnesota again and when experienced player Bert Gordon, George C. Scott, insults his character and then offers to sponsor him he takes him up on his offer. Packard is frustrated by Felson's decision as he has repeatedly faced punishment as a result of his arrogance while playing. She sleeps with the manipulative Gordon and commits suicide the next morning, pushing Felson to have an emotional breakdown and reconsider his cruelty to those around him. He returns to defeat Minnesota but agrees to step away from hustling altogether.\n\nThe most fascinating character in the film is Gordon who seems above everything but shows flashes of understanding just what a terrible person he is. He is cunning and calculated and both Felson and Packard are aware of this and yet both are conned by him successfully and he is able to extract exactly what he wants out of him. Seeing him mold and shape Felson in his own image is bizarre as the \u2018character' he talks is really a deep cynicism that allows him not to feel any emotions and use and abuse others. After the suicide of Packard, a woman that both men connect with to a degree, we see Gordon grow weaker and less embittered while Felson gains some measure of self respect. He sees what Gordon's behavior can create and works to distance himself from a figure so toxic and yet so alluring in his false confidence.\n\nFelson himself is one of Newman's most recognized roles and he plays him well as all of the attributes that prevented him from being taken seriously early in his career play into how Felson is not treated as a serious threat in the film. He has a smile that seems like that of an ignorant dope but much like Burt Lancaster he has cold eyes that convey an inability or simple lack of desire to feel compassion. In his interactions with Laurie he is particularly impressive as he seems to be sizing her up constantly and regarding her more as an object than a genuine girlfriend. Laurie herself was less impressive as she is serviceable in her role but there are times when you see her reaching for emotion and others where she goes so big that she verges on pantomime. Compared to the controlled vulgarity of Scott and Newman she seems to be overtly \u2018performing' and that takes you out of the film at certain points. Rossen was known for coaxing great performances out of actors and he was able to tap into the then unknown abilities of a young Newman.\n\nThe scenes of pool themselves are smartly not drawn out as we often get just a few shots of pool cues flicking balls over the table instead of extended sequences of them rolling around. Rossen knows that what we really care about is the emotion that goes into the games and so he focuses the camera on Newman as he experiences elation and then horror. He makes a lot of decisions like this that turn the film into the character study that it should be rather than a sports based drama that relies on plot twists.",

The tears are real as much as rotten the game is. But the director, Robert Rossen is concerned on both the aspects of this game, the up front razzle dazzle that can easily gather a crowd and the back stage drama that drives the fear in this high staked tense game. And let me start by the first game, the best game, of the film. Not only is it smartly calculated but also informative. For someone jumping in on this sport, for the first time, the baby steps are taken beautifully that marks both the magnitude and the rules of the genre parallel-y.\n\nAforementioned, the game or the onstage drama can never even be compared with the emotional conflicts that the broken lead couple goes through. Now so similar are these tracks placed that you find yourself immersed in them without telling apart what's the act or who is acting. Breaking down this game, analysing it, the commentary of Paul Newman as the infamous Fast Eddie is a sight to behold. Watch him fail, love, cheat and then fail again with a drunken voice and sober body language while playing, he makes sure he lives up to the title given by the crowd, Fast.\n\nEnters, Piper Laurie, her performance is as rich and powerful as her character. Not only can she empower him, but she gets to challenge the Fast Eddie and make him slow down. As a memory, she comes in and \"makes him up\" whispering and begging in one of the finest scenes of the film where mirrors are placed in front of each other, expressing to us, their interest and intentions, coming from The Hustler, you ought to note these things, trying to catch him out, you won't though.",

His black and white aesthetic helps smoke up the air with his dingy pool hall sets and sleazy cast of realistically tragic characters.\n\nRossen's direction leaves you with empty spaces of room filled with a few characters of magnificent presence. His shots hold on faces, hands, and cues to squeeze out all the tension of his shots with a horrifying suspense. I always felt uneasy watching The Hustler as you never knew what would happen.\n\nPaul Newman is gripping and upsetting as the hotheaded con artist \"Fast\" Eddie Felson. His quick wit and quick temper lead to tragedy of his own making. Newman plays the distracted, distraught, and forlorn loser turned professional pool hall hustler with an effortless skill. Newman makes Eddie look skilled as a pool player and affectionate as a lover. His frustration at being bested in pool is admirable, but Newman's troubled anguish at his equally relied upon relationship is the most convincing. Paul Newman was a cool actor, a funny actor, but also a realistic dramatic actor who characters always feel grounded.\n\nJackie Gleason is great as the calm veteran, whose experience gives him a patient terror. Gleason's massive Minnesota Fats is amiable, yet intimidating. His pool playing skills are cleverly formidable, but it's his cool calculated demeanor that makes Fats memorable.\n\nGeorge C. Scott is at his most sleazy and unethical as Bert Gordon. His gangster gambler is more reminiscent of the devil conning men into selling their souls, as Murray Hamilton's Findlay remarks to Scott. George C. Scott eyes up a room in a moment and glares at all the events taking place with a knowing presence that you cannot ignore. His performance is excellent and infuriating as Scott makes you love his likable blunt gambler, while despising his shrewd sleazy conduct.\n\nOn the other hand, Myron McCormick is endearing as Charley Bums. \"Fast\" Eddie's father figure is charming in an old hustler way with his honesty and sincerity towards Eddie. He gives it to Newman straight and you appreciate it, even though Eddie does not see the light as he does not heed Charley's warning.\n\nLastly, the most compelling performance other than Paul Newman's has to be Piper Laurie. Her alcoholic intellectual is a woman in despair. She's a strong woman dealing with despair, coping with past trauma, and hoping for something, or someone, better than she's got. I think Laurie captures what is so tragic about The Hustler's broken promise for an entertaining little hustler con. She makes it all so real as the consequences of \"Fast\" Eddie's choices are dealt out to her. Laurie is brilliantly charming and deeply disturbing to see a woman so hurt.\n\nAll in all, The Hustler is the perfect slow burn sports drama. The pool games are gripping and the humanistic drama with riddled with parables. I think The Hustler is worth seeing once.",

            "content": "I had a sneaking suspicion that The Hustler had really shot itself in the foot in the first act because they front-loaded the film with one of the most high-stakes thrilling matches of pool I've ever seen. It starts off brilliantly, with the cocky upstart played by Paul Newman and the calm professional played by Jackie Gleason. This entire sequence (which must have been at least 15 minutes) was so tense and exciting that I wondered if Netflix had accidentally jumped me to the final scene. The problem with The Hustler is that it does trail off significantly in the second act. I understand the need for the romance angle in the story, but it was really slow going for awhile, particularly when Newman's thumb is busted so no pool is being played at all. I also struggled with Piper Laurie's performance, because she didn't seem to have much range. She was either sober as a nun, or drunk as a sailor and it was obvious from the start of every scene which way she was going. However, once George C. Scott shows up, the class of the film cranks up to 11. He is just perfect and his interactions with Newman are fascinatingly complex without saying many words. Also, I was glad to see that all those slow parts paid off in the final act. While the opening was spectacular, it is almost surpassed by the poignant final game. The financial stakes might be the same, but there is a lot more subtext in this match. One last thing that I will say in favor of The Hustler is that it was remarkable how brilliantly they cut a lot of the actual pool. Clearly many of the shots were not done by doubles, but the actors themselves, and they were not easy shots either. That kind of attention to detail, and commitment to a role is always impressive. I think the overall experience of watching this film was good, I just wish it didn't have that huge lull in the middle which didn't include enough pool to keep me fully engaged.",

He wants to be one of the greats, so he takes his shot at the best player in the nation: Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  This is one of those movies that I had heard about, knew what it was about, but had never actually sat down to watch it.  There's no better excuse than the list to rectify gaping holes in my film education, and my wife and I took the time one lazy Saturday afternoon to watch this back in July.  Besides, Paul Newman is one of the coolest guys to have ever graced Hollywood with his presence, and he quite plainly doesn't make bad movies.  This is a really good movie, but it wasn't exactly what I expected it to be.  It starts off really fun, and the competition grabs you immediately as soon as he walks into a pool hall.  There are trick shots and the occasional bout of trash talk, and it makes you want to pick up a cue.  You can tell that our protagonist has his issues, and he may not be all that stable, but he comes off as more of a rascal than anything, and it is all fun and you can't wait to hear the next thing that comes out of his mouth, or see the next impossible shot he's going to attempt.  You're having such a good time, and then the movie brings you back down to Earth with the drama.  This man is a mess, and then he crosses paths with a potential love interest (Piper Laurie) who is as equally in need of an intervention as he is.  They're both alcoholics, and their negativity and bad habits feed off of one another.  It doesn't turn into a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, it just ceases to be the fun time that you were having up to that point.  Paul Newman has screen presence for days, and when he is talking, you pay attention.  I love the black and white photography, it really makes you feel like you're in a smoky pool hall with all of these characters.  When it takes a turn for the serious, you do start to feel the length, which is really my only nitpick in this 134-minute movie.  These are the messy lives of imperfect people, and it is easy to see why this has gathered the acclaim that it has.",

Great dialogue, great direction, plus great acting, cinematography and film score make this a great, timeless film.\n\nEddie Felson is such a trainwreck that it truly is impossible to feel empathy for him. He takes perfect opportunities to win and turns them into disasters. Perfectly self destructive behavior of the first order. So, naturally, he hooks up with Piper Laurie's character Sarah, who does nothing but drink all day. However, we quickly learn that Sarah has much more soul and humanity than Eddie could over hope to have.\n\nRobert Rossen's writing and direction are first rate. Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan's cinematography features beautiful compositions and great black & white contrast. One of the highlights for me was getting to see the cities, trains and places of that time. Kenyon Hopkins' jazz score provides excellent background for the sleezy goings-on.\n\nGiven what a great movie this is, it was so disappointing that Martin Scorsese turned Felson and the pool shark story into such a routine, mannered and just plain run-of-the-mill movie like 1986's \"The Color of Money.\"\n\nDefinitely skip that, but please see \"The Hustler!\"",

His demeanor is effortless throughout the movie whether its the confident swagger of a hustler, the ruthless efficiency of a vicious competitor, or the dejected slump of a man who lost everything. Newman along with a terrific supporting class demands attention and earns every bit of it as a man who's identity transcends the archetype of a hustler. He's a conflicted character study of a man who's passion possesses him. An excellent film.",

However, things are getting better, when Sarah (Laurie) being introduced to this male-crammed coterie, she lights up the screen instantly, a damaged cripple longing for a secure relationship, her chimera would eventually be shattered into pieces to cement her lover Eddie's (Newman) \"character\" which is prerequisite for him to be the top pick among the bunch. Laurie's intuitively destructive performance enables the film to be more affecting than the usual offerings where female-roles are decorative and neglectful.  \n\nNewman also stretches out in his best form to deliver the gamut of emotions through the narrative arc, deadly charming as he is, Eddie is a far cry being a complete likable fellow as he appears to be, even finally he beats Minnesota Fats (Gleason) and valiantly defies and censures Bert's (Scott) greed and vileness, he still bears a certain degree of responsibility to the tragedy occurred before, in the end, he is more a repentant sinner than a victorious hero. Each of the four actors (Newman, Laurie, Gleason and Scott) grabbed an Oscar nomination for his or her work, both competing in the supporting actor category, retrospectively speaking, Scott's flagrant menace isn't a too taxing requirement out of his comfortable zone, while Gleason's reserved taciturnity implies much more chewy undertones than he purports to be, which positively suggests his background story would spin another gripping and morally-ambiguous tale easily. Personally I give the edge to Gleason. \n\nOther than a sterling cluster of awards-worthy performances, THE HUSTLER is elegantly conducted by Robert Rossen, a gone-too-soon figure in Hollywood manufacture (passed away at the age of 57 in 1966), conscientiously teases out the best of his cast under a low-key production paddings and represents us a visceral parable on human nature's weakness.  \n\nP.S. The next step for me to dig into Newman's oeuvre is the unofficial sequel THE COLOR OF MONEY (1986), a Scorsese's production belatedly gave Newman a golden statue which he should have won decades ago.",

            "content": "A very well-done, old fashioned story concerning a drifter (Paul Newman) who hustles people at the game of pool, but potentially meets his match on the pool board in Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), while struggling to keep his relationship with an equally troubled young woman (Piper Laurie) going. You can probably call a good chunk of what takes place, with a few surprises dished in, but ultimately this movie remains extremely entertaining thanks primarily due to the ensemble performances (Newman, Laurie, Gleason, and George C. Scott are all tremendous) that raises this somewhat familiar tale well above average territory. It has a lot to say about taking sports too seriously, especially when gambling is involved, and how one could sometimes put sport above relationships with people and the cost that comes with it. Not a flawless film, but darn close to one, and a movie that should be seen by anyone who loves sports (like me).",

            "content": "George C. Scott is fearsome. I love the way he carries his self on stage. Hustler was only his third appearance in the movies. This film had some impressive cameo performances, with a supporting best actor nod going to TV legend Jackie Gleeson as Minnesota Fats. The fat man didn't say much and wasn't on screen much at all. But he won it with \"character\" and style. His body language alone spoke a thousand words. Way cooler than Paul Newman, who was nominated for an Academy Award but didn't win until 25 years later in the Martin Scorsese/Tom Cruise sequel, \"The Color of Money\". \n\nThe relationship between Eddie and Sarah was doomed from the start. Both of them were severe alcoholics, and Eddie, a foredoomed gambler. In the end, Fast Eddie had his way on the pool table, but he had lost everything else in life. He had hit rock bottom and was about to be taken out by George C. Scott and his goons. But he surrendered his will, stood up for himself, and because of that, was allowed to walk away a winner. Even the vicious, dark-hearted Bert Gordon (Scott) felt remorse for what he did to the young couple, particularly Sarah's desperate little life. \n\nThis movie has some complex characters in it that belong in a 12-step program. It was depressing and dark. It isn't one of my favorite movies but it earned my respect. \n\n4/5",

            "content": "The only real problem with The Hustler is that in many shots it doesn't feature footage of Pool Balls so what happens to them is left up to the script to explain, and at times it fails to do so.\nThe other thing which isn't much of a problem but more of a personal opinions from me is that for such a long film I was hoping that Jackie Gleason's dramatic turn would get a lot more screen time, but I was disappointed with the little time he was given, despite a great performance. But like the performances of Ben Kingsley and Harvey Keitel in Bugsy I didn't find it enough to constitute an Academy Award nomination because it was just too brief and small in the storyline.\n\nHowever, The Hustler is still largely enjoyable. \nPaul Newman provides an excellent lead performance and creates a likeable character due to his determination and vocal charm. Fast Eddie is a realistic sports figure whose real enemy is himself, and his enemy can only be beaten by Bert Gordon.\nGeorge C. Scott's performance as Bert Gordon in a strong one because he is manipulative internally and hides it well thorough clever use of words so the audience never know what to believe of him. George C. Scott turns Bert Gordon's characterisation into a villainous and hateful character that never brings r obviously to the surface and gives a sense that George C. Scott is an actor who knows how to level his character emotionally with the script. His performance was great.\nAnd although it was small, Jackie Gleason gave an excellent dramatic turn to his career. With the same wise-guy look as in The Honeymooners, Jackie Gleason instantly turned Minnesota Fats around so that he's more of a prophetic figure to the development of Fast Eddie and therefore it's the influence and idea if him that makes him more important than Gleason's performance itself, and even then Jackie Gleason gives a performance that ensures he will not be second best to his character, as so they combine to form a legendary figure, that can be known simultaneously as the legendary and wise Minnesota Fats and the excellently dramatic Jackie Gleason.\nAnd in the other side of the story is Piper Laurie pulling her own in an excellent performance and great chemistry with Paul Newman.\n\nMore straight up in the thing that makes The Hustler a classic is that The Hustler takes a deeper look into the human psych of sports than many other sports movies, and primarily in the determination to win. Many excellent sport films such as Rocky theorise that the chase is better than the catch, but The Hustler explains the character's determination for the catch and how sometimes the chase doesn't matter, because there's a certain point in sports where winning really is everything. When there's that much money AND a reputation on the line, the player wants a win. The Hustler examines that theme excellently and even expanded it into other sectors of gambling. The Hustler is an entirely new look at sports which explains it's notoriety, and what comes next is the only question, so The Colour of Money is next on the to see list for me, and The Hustler should be next on the to see list for you, as it is admirable for not only its themes and acting, but the smooth soundtrack and cinematography, and smart screenplay and direction.",

Eddie meets a girl wth similar problems with drink, they have there ups and downs.\nOverall The Hustler is a great character story Paul Newman Embodies James Dean a lot but his performance in The left Handed Gun led me to the conclusion Paul maybe the original Rebel Without A Cause, and in the end the film really does want to get you down to pool hall !",

This was definitely the film that assured all audiences around the world that he was born to be a movie star, and he proves it in this film without a doubt. With some great acting, an all around great story, and Robert Rossen's ability to mix whitty complexities with all around popcorn entertainment, \"The Hustler\" easily proves why its a classic. \n\nPaul Newman plays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a newcomer to the game of pool who no one takes seriously. Over time he begins to prove to everyone in the game of pool that he actually has the ability to beat people.The one problem that Edie has is his overbearing pride. He doesn't recognize the notion that he might lose a whole lot of money. This gets him into trouble. But his one overall goal is to beat Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason. It's a classic rise to the top movie. The one great thing about Newman's character in this film is that he is in no way perfect. More times than not, his faulties get him in trouble, and he needs to find a way to get out of tough situations. But over the course of the film, his transformation allows him to become more wise and mature. \n\nPaul Newman does the stroy a great service by giving an amazing performance. This is easily one of his best movies and he shows why in his performance. We feel for him throughout the film's duration. Newman conveys his genius ability to real an audience in with his legendary screen status. Jackie Gleason also gives a very good performance. The movie's acting was certainly the best aspect to the whole thing. \n\nThis movie certainly wants to make you play pool. This is thanks to a lot of the great cinematography in this film. Somethinig that I liked a lot about how this film was shot was its juxtaposition camera angles, displaying balls as they roll in, and points of interest on opponents facial and physical mannerisms. Another thing that I liked to point out is that these visuals were tributed in \"The Color of Money\", the sequel to the film. I thought that was awesome. And it certainly is something to tribute, because the organic photography in this picture was as progressive as it gets. \n\n\"The Hustler\"is a timeless movie. Paul Newman gives one of his best performances, and along with the great acting by Jackie Gleason, we have two stars who never let up throughout the entire movie. But the best thing about the picture is that it doesn't try to be great for the wrong reasons. It doesn't try to be individualistic, and it certainly doesn't try to level itself above its viewers. It simply attempts to be a fun movie, and certainly is one of the funnest films to watch.",

It has a timeless nature, with the brilliant black and white accentuating the film's depressingly bleak tone.

Scott (who was also nominated for an Oscar) stole the show.  Jackie Gleason - why was he nominated?  The world may never know.  Despite its many nominations, it is no surprise that it lost out to \"West Side Story\" in most categories, but I still don't see why everybody adores it.

There are parts of me which want to call it a great movie, like four stars good, which I'm sure most people do.  However there's another part of me that keeps asking, \"What's the point?\"  I know there are tons of great movies which don't have a point, but this one acts so much like it does that it leaves me baffled.  The entire film seems to be heading toward some great enlightenment at the end, and I'm not sure if it ever gets there.  Let me repeat:  I'm not sure.  It may, it may not.\n\nHere's a plot set-up for anyone who hasn't seen the film.  Newman portrays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, an almost unbeatable straight-pool player from California who is dead set on beating Minnesota Fats, hailed by all as the greatest player alive.  Eddie shows up confident and ready to play Fats, and the two embark on a grueling 40 hour streak of pool playing.  However, this is only the beginning of the film, and acts more as an initiator of the plot than anything else.\n\nI went into this film thinking to myself, \"Which one is the Hustler, Newman or Gleason?\" What I found is that most of the characters except Gleason could fit the description.  The reason Fats is so cool (and so important to the story) is that he's way past that part of his life.  He doesn't hustle.  He just plays.   For everyone else, however, the film is about one person hustling another whether purposely or not.  The plot and all the character relationships seem to ride on the tension one would feel in a pool game, thinking, \"Is this guy hustling me or not?\"  For that reason, it is a very intriguing plot, and will keep you interested despite it's lengthy runtime.\n\nLet me first praise the acting because that's the part everyone knows about.  Paul Newman is astoundingly good in this movie, and that's not just because I want to be him so badly.  He plays numerous different moods in this story, and even undergoes a complete change of character motivation at least twice in the film.  Gleason is really good, but in this movie it might be more a case of looking awesome than acting awesome.  This is mainly because he isn't given much to say.  His lines become increasingly scarce until at the end he feels almost like an idea instead of a person.\n\nTo sum up there is a lot of really great stuff going on here, and the exploration of the themes does a really good job of making you think about it.  The best analysis is of the ideas of winning and losing, and the attitudes of the people who do both.  However, my problem is that there is a large build-up, and in the end I'm not sure what the movie was trying to tell me.  Man did it do a good job telling it though.",

            "content": "Fast Eddie: You know, I got a hunch, fat man. I got a hunch it's me from here on in. One ball, corner pocket. I mean, that ever happen to you? You know, all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? 'Cause I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road. Five ball. You know, this is my table, man. I own it.\u00a0\n\n\"They Called Him Fast Eddie\"\n\nWell this masterpiece is a new favorite of mine. The Hustler is one of the best character driven movies ever made. It's easy to see how Scorsese drew influence from this with Raging Bull. The film is perfect in every single aspect. I loved everything about it. From the first epic pool battle between Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats to the depressing and heart wrenching conclusion; this is a film that is just amazing in everything it is doing. Pool is used a backdrop for a character study on Eddie Felson, and the way everything is pulled together is just fantastic.\u00a0\n\nEddie Felson, played by Paul Newman, is a pool shark, a hustler. He has been moving around the country with his partner hustling bars and pool halls for cash. He's cocky and he's good, so he thinks there isn't anyone out there that can beat him. So he goes looking for the guy everyone claims is the best pool player in the country; a man who hasn't lost in 15 years, Minnesota Fats. Eddie doesn't just want Fats' money; he wants to destroy him. The first pool scene with Eddie and Fats' sets up the rest of the film perfectly. We know Eddie's personality and the conflicts he is going to face throughout the film. He doesn't know when to quit, be it if he is winning or losing. We wait a long time to see the reunion between Eddie and Fats and when it comes it isn't what you expect, because of the enormity of what just happened in the story. It just really doesn't matter anymore.\n\nThe acting in The Hustler is as good as you would expect. Paul Newman is at his best, with an Oscar Nominated performance. The supporting cast is phenomenal as well, especially Piper Laurie, who plays Sarah Packard; Eddie's love interest. Her character ends up complicating the film in ways I didn't see coming. George C. Hall and Jackie Gleason are also on top form, and all three were also nominated for Oscars. The cinematography won and Oscar and it is clear why, the film is beautifully shot in black and white. There's a lot of clever camera work and some amazing use of lighting and scenery.\n\nThis is a classic that is highly praised, but deserves even more praise than it has gotten. It's a masterpiece. I could watch this movie countless times and I would always be intrigued by it. The setup is amazing and when everything that happens, happens, it is devastating, but so well done that it feels almost natural; like that is what needed to happen. As of today, I have yet to see Scorsese's sequel The Color of Money(I'll be watching it real soon), but I am very interested to see how the aftermath of Eddie's life would be handled by such a talented director like Scorsese. I don't expect it to be to the level of The Hustler because I just don't think that is possible, but it should at least be interesting.",

It's a great drama with brilliant performances and a brilliant jazzy soundtrack by Kenyon Hopkins. This film tells the story of small time pool hustler \"Fast Eddie\" Felson (Paul Newman) who travels the country from Oakland, California with his friend Charlie (Myron McCormick), to take on legendary pool champ Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), after playing for 25 hours straight, Eddie wins $18,000, but blows it all. As he leaves to head home, he meets alcoholic college girl Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), who Eddie begins a relationship with. During the showdown with Minnesota, Eddie was introduced to professional gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who claims he can help Eddie win big, but after hustling the wrong people, Eddie ends up having his thumbs broken, but after they've healed, he's determined to take on Minnesota Fats again. It's a very engaging drama with some brilliant pool action, (Newman and Gleason learnt how to do pool to an almost professional level), but it's like an American equivalent of those Angry Young Men dramas that were coming out of the UK at the time, and Newman just reeks of coolness in this.",

            "content": "The Hustler was nominated for nine Oscars, winning for cinematography and art direction for a black and white film. The four main actors deservedly received nominations, although George C. Scott refused his. It was the second nomination for Newman, the first of three for Piper Laurie and Jackie Gleason's only nomination. The film deserved the recognition, but West Side Story ended up with 10 Oscars that year. Newman received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a best supporting actor Oscar a year later when he reprised the role of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money.\n\nThe film is quite complex. Although a sports movie on the surface, there's a strong romantic element. The story is essentially about strength of character. What would you do to get what you want in life? What if it means hurting people close to you? Is the goal worth the sacrifices? And, most important of all, how do we define success?\n\nNewman was an emerging force in 1961, but his popularity hadn't reached its peak. His portrayal of Eddie Felson was convincing. He only took the role because another movie he had committed to fell through.\n\nFelson begins the story as a pool player who is building his reputation. He wants to take on the best and prove that he's the better player. There are definite similarities between Felson's place in the pool world and Newman's status in the acting world at the time. Both were looking to make a name for themselves.\n\nWe learn in the opening scenes that Felson is a hustler. While playing a game with Charlie, his manager, he deliberately misses shots he could make. He also pretends to be drunk. The people watching are fooled and he wins $105 by betting that he can make a difficult shot and pulling it off. Then he leaves with Charlie and they look for victims in another town. This is Felson's life. He makes a living conning people who don't know that he has real ability.\n\nFelson isn't satisfied and dreams of making $10,000 in one night. In order to reach his lofty goal, he plans to play the best pool player in the country, Minnesota Fats (Gleason). Fats hasn't lost a game for 15 years and has heard of Felson. He agrees to the game.\n\nThe stakes begin at $200 and quickly build to $1,000 per game. Felson is cocky and talks a good game, but also backs it up with good play. He's soon ahead by over $11,000 and Charlie wants him to quit, but Felson says he'll play until Fats says the game is over. He doesn't just want to win, he's looking to humiliate Fats and break his spirit. After 12 hours, Felson is ahead $18,000, but still insists on continuing the game.\n\nYou can see where the story is heading. Fats freshens up, washes his hands and puts powder on them. Felson teases him on how beautiful he looks. Fats starts winning and Felson keeps drinking. He eventually loses everything apart from $200. Who was hustling whom?\n\nThe pace of the film changes after the initial meeting with Fats. Felson doesn't have the necessary stake money for another game. He meets Sarah Packard (Laurie) and eventually moves in with her. She has a limp from having polio as a child and enjoys drinking even more than Felson. The two are a good match and each has flaws.\n\nCharlie visits and we learn that he has $1,500 which was his cut of Felson's previous pool winnings. Felson is angry and decides to cut Charlie out of his life. Sarah wonders if she's next. This part of the film moves a little slowly and some viewers may lose interest, but I felt it worked and was essential to give the film depth and additional meaning.\n\nThe pace picks up when Felson meets Bert Gordon (Scott) who is Fats' manager and witnessed the first game between the two. Bert says that Fats was on the hook for the first time in 10 years, but Felson let him off. He calls Felson a born loser, but a loser with talent. He wants to be his manager and demands 75 percent of any winnings. He also issues a warning that Felson could get hurt if he wanders into the wrong pool hall and they realize that he's hustling.\n\nAfter learning a few life lessons, Felson takes Bert up on his offer. He takes Sarah for a meal and she comments that it's the first time she's seen him wear a tie. It's a sign that he is willing to change. The two go on the road with Bert and Felson plays billiards for big stakes. Billiards isn't his game of choice; he prefers pool. Felson loses initially, but something in his demeanor convinces Bert to continue staking him. He eventually wins enough for another showdown with Fats.\n\nThe final 10 minutes of the film show the second game between the two. Felson has changed since the first meeting and life has toughened him up. He's still brash, but won't take a drink while he's playing. I won't reveal who wins, but the film reflects on how we define winning and success in life.\n\nThe film has an authentic feel. The pool rooms are dark, seedy and potentially dangerous places. They match the gritty feel of the film. The pool scenes were shot in real pool halls rather than on a set. The only thing that wasn't convincing is the way the actors held a cue in a few shots. A professional player wouldn't have his head so far away from the cue and certainly wouldn't wear a jacket in case it touched another ball and caused a foul shot. But the actors did a good job and both performed most of their shots. The remainder were performed by former billiards world champion Willie Mosconi.",

It's a brilliant performance, but he doesn't overshadow Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C. Scott, who are all essentially just as incredible.  In some ways this falls in line with film noir, as Newman is a classic antihero.  The pool scenes are superb and very believable.

If you think watching your childhood burst into flames is proof that you need medication, try watching this - everything you wanted to know about the glory days of pool is pretty much either consider quack or just plain delusional.\n\nI'm not saying that this is the most realistic portrayal of life as it happens, but it did introduce ideas that would central for a lot of the New French Extremity and New Hollywood films to come later in the future: the idea that humans have to accept the unrelenting and sometimes needlessly cruel nature of reality and a lot of stylistic cues from the then-maligned genre of film noir. You can see sort of a template for John Cassavetes and Gaspar Noe here - this whole nightmarish look into a world once romanticized by all these tall tales and somehow torn down by people who knew better than to actually propagate all this happy surreality that was going through films at this time.\n\nAlso, the whole pool story was kind of neat. Unlike others who thought it was kind of boring because it comprises of people hitting balls with sticks, I think it gives a kind of dark look at one of college's favorite pastimes.\n\nI probably wouldn't want to watch it again anytime soon.",

He moves, talks, and behaves the way you would expect a real person to and ends up creating one of the most realistic charcters in movie history.\r\n\r\nSome may say that the movie starts going down hill after Eddie meets the girl, and I probably might think so too but the acting is just so manipulative that it doesn't matter. People also bring up Jakie Gleason alot whenever they talk about this movie, honestly...why? I mean yeah he's in it and whenever he speaks you get some good acting to go with it but he's literally only in two scenes an he hardly has any dialogue. I'd say he has more of a cameo than a supporting role.\r\n\r\nOverall, really great. You can't go wrong with The Hustler it...is ...awesome. Highly reccomend.",

Scott, and Piper Laurie give outstanding performances in this tale of pool.\r\nPaul Newman stars Eddie Felson who dreams of becoming the greatest pool player in the country. I enjoyed The Hustler, but not as much as would have been desirable. It's interesting that a movie like this can suck in an audience even though most of the audience probably would find a film based on pool a little peculiar. And it is, for the most part.\r\nThere's no denying Robert Rossen's directorial skills in this movie. He was able to keep these pool games interesting and did a great job of balancing the drama with the game itself and the characters' personal problems. I especially liked the cinematography in this movie (side note: the same guy who did the cinematography for this film did it for Metropolis, which is a fan favorite).\r\nThe Hustler is not, I feel like, without its faults. The biggest fault is that it was really hard for me to connect with these characters. And that is saying something because I can usually find some kind of connection with the characters on screen. But I almost couldn't here. Newman's character stays extremely cocky for a majority of the film and his main love interest is an alcoholic who seems to like to complain about. Also prominent are crooked dealers, thugs who protect pool houses, bartenders with little sympathy, and a billiards player. The most likable character in the film that I could find was the enemy, Minnesota Fats. But perhaps I need to see this film again and try again with these characters.\r\nThe film gets really dramatic the more it goes, which is impressive considering this is a film about pool. Overall, I enjoyed myself, but I would have liked to have had more likable characters to invest in. But maybe that's just me being picky.\r\n7/10",

The first half hour of this movie only consisted of pool, but the games weren't really clear and it was difficult to tell who was winning most of the matchups. It was the equivalent of the fight scenes in Transformers: those scenes were filmed so fast that you couldn't tell what was going on. \r\n\r\nFollowing the games between Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the movie shifted into a bogus romantic story that I did not buy for a second. That romantic subplot really tested my ability to stick with the movie. I ended up stopping the movie half way through because I was so bored with the uninspiring plot. I finished the last half of the flick last night and was somewhat impressed with it. \r\n\r\nThis is not a pool movie just like The Big Lebowski isn't a bowling movie. After the first half hour, there are only one or two more scenes about pool. This movie is really about acceptance, defeat, and knowing what's important in your life. Newman and Gleason were terrific in the movie and their pool playing was fantastic. Some scenes were powerful and legendary, but the hokey romance really did damage to this movie.",

George C. Scott turns in another great performance as a manipulating money man determined to dangle the carrot in front of Fast Eddie's nose long enough for Eddie to lose everything. Scott's character personifies temptation (perhaps Satan himself) while Piper Laurie's Sara, an equally troubled soul as Eddie, offers redemption. What I enjoyed most about \"The Hustler\" is that it's a sports film where the main character's talent for the game he lives to play also blinds him and could ultimately be his undoing.

In today's modern world, habitual gambling is mainly related to poker, slot machines, horses, sports, and casinoes, although sometimes in can be related to pool or billiards. It is also easier to find the gambling money, sadly from credit cards, since they are more popular today than they were in the 1960's. The acting from Newman and Piper Laurie is outstanding and the score is beautiful, maybe one the best of the 1960's. The cinematography is also very good.

Paul Newman portrays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a hustler who tours the country with his partner conning the money out of men to pay for their next hotel room, booze, and many dames. Still, Eddie has higher aspirations than to be a con man to secure a sizable nest egg, and so he goes up against the biggest fish in the pond, Minnesota Fats, played by the always entertaining Jackie Gleason. Though Gleason isn't a large presence in the film, he is the main goal for Eddie, the motivation for most of the film. It's a complex issue that rears its head in many antihero works, when the main protagonist gives up happiness for something bigger than themselves, and here Eddie is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's truly an actor's film, showcasing the talents of Paul Newman and the very enigmatic and rarely seen Piper Laurie. Both are thrown into many scenes together with very little story and are forced to show the craggy underbellies of each of their characters. Though it drags at times, it's very volatile to watch their relationship, and the sacrifices each puts forth in order to keep Eddie from becoming a washed up has been, yet find some form of happiness. At the very end, it's no longer about the ideal Eddie holds of himself, but escaping the clutches of a system that would keep him underfoot. Besides Newman and Laurie there are some great small parts for Gleason and George C. Scott. Both come off as austere and stoic in the face of the storm but in the end they show their true colors, their lack of strength when the hero shows himself above their antics and backroom dealings. Eddie really is the entire film, falling between a mess of a human being into the hero who you root for when he's down by a large sum of money, the crowd starting to disperse, and the sweat and tears mingling on his face. Heavily Oscar nominated, The Hustler remains a classic in every sense of the word, sparking a sequel in the eighties called The Color of Money, starring Paul Newman, again as Fast Eddie, and big star Tom Cruise. I can't wait to see it in order to compare and contrast, but truly it's this film, so classic, so fraught with tension and sexual ambiguity, that will probably stay with me.",

The editing is well executed also, featuring a mix of dissolves, wipes, hard cuts, and brilliant intercutting that really elevates the tension during the game scenes. The music is also quite wonderful- nice jazz music that really brings the themes, characters, and situations to life: really timeless stuff.\n\nWhile all of the performances are absolutely perfect, this is truly Paul Newman's film. Gleason exudes a calm, yet menacing wisdom, Scott nails the greedy soulless vulture role (and keeps it from being cliched), Laurie gives a deep and heartbreaking performances as the moral center, and McCormick is also great as the old friend, mentor, and partner who really was a better fit than he got credit for. As I said though, this is Newman's film. This is one of those performances that will truly stick out in history, and that's saying a lot considering some of his other great roles. Newman is sharp, charming, and someone you care for, despite his flaws, no matter how big they are. His redemption is earned, although it comes at a terribly high price.\n\nI can't recommend this enough. I'm sure it already gets studied enough in film classes across the country (and rightly so), but the attention paid to it wll never be undeserved. As a bit of closing trivia, besides the earlier reference to Raging Bull, here's some more. Now, everyone probably knows that both Raging Bull and The Color of Money (the sequel to The Hustler) were directed by Martin Scorsese, but how about this one: Jake LaMotta appears in a cameo in this film as one of the bartenders-that's great.",

The action, sex, and romance may not be as ideal or flashy as some would like.  Having just watched it, I can understand those feelings.  But those people aren't really looking for a movie like \"The Hustler.\"  It's goals are different and it achieves its own goal entirely.\r\nThose goals, for 1961, were unusual.  Here was a film whose strengths lie completely in its realistic and thought-provoking portrayals of personalities, conflicts, and personal relationships on various levels.  The acting is some of the best of the era and certainly groundbreaking when compared with what came before.\r\nIn some ways, the innovations of \"The Hustler\" may seem out of date now, when the works of Scorcese, the Coens, and the Coppolas have made intimacy, realism, and subtlty part of mainstream dramatic film making.  Even still, I would be surprised that an intelligent person who watches this movie and pays attention doesn't walk away thinking about their own life or society in general.  A consuming artistic masterpiece about self-loathing, friendship, love, rivalry, and redemption. Feels less like a movie than a great piece of literature.\r\n\r\nAnd some great pool shots too!",

            "content": "The Hustler opens up with a gripping and excellent opening montage of two men making small talk with a bar tender. They are Eddie Felson and his 'business' partner Charlie Burns. They are said to be traveling salesmen in town for a convention and Eddie is getting an award for being the fastest and best salesman. Eddie and Charlie start playing pool and betting each other that Eddie had luck making an impossible shot. First they bet at 10 dollars and then Eddie raises the stake at 20 and misses the shot. Charlie tells him he doesn't want to bet anymore and gives up on the game. The bartender after attentively watching the game decides to take on Eddie and makes a bet with him that he can't make the impossible shot. Eddie bets 105 dollars and the man decides to stake some money from his till. The next shot you see is Eddie and Charlie in their automobile with Eddie having an ecstatic grin on his face and a wallet in his hand. It is then obvious what Eddie's talent is: hustling big time money. \n\n\"Fast\" Eddie Felson is played pitch perfect by the one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen: Paul Newman. He is a money grabbing pool hustler who loves making good hard cash to thrive on his pride. He has an overstimulated ego and is both charming and convincing with his smart quips and jokes and fast talk. Eddie doesn't know what's more important in life other than money and being the best.\n\nWhen he decides to take on Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) after hearing from everyone that he is the best pool player, Eddie is ready to take on a big game knowing that he can beat him quick and flat if he plays it right. He wants to feed his ego if he beats Fats. However, he makes a huge mistake: he drinks too much whiskey and gets drunk. At one point of their excruciatingly long pool game, he has him beat at 18,000 dollars but it isn't satisfying so he decides to wager even more. He asks his partner Charlie for more money and he refuses. Finally he gives in and tells Eddie, \"be a damn fool\" seeming to know the consequences. After a near victory with Fats; he ends up losing it all. This absolutely puts a dent in some of his confidence and egotism and he holds on to the idea that he must beat Minnesota Fats. It's all Eddie can think about. It's all that matters to Eddie. \n\nThen, he meets Sarah (Piper Laurie) in a diner in a bus station. He is immediately attracted to her and decides that he must 'get' her. He finds out that she is a binge drinking alcoholic whose a bit crazed as he is. She goes to college Tuesdays & Thursdays and the rest of the time.. she drinks. She loves to drink. They start seeing each other and eventually Sarah invites him to live in her place. At first, Eddie is intent on the idea of using Sarah and to 'hustle' her but he ends up falling for her. They are perfect for each other because they are emotionally crippled and they bond together by having problems. They are both obsessive about something: him: the intensity of winning and success and her: drinking.  \n\nHe goes into business with Bert; a professional gambler ready to take Eddie for a fool and, Eddie, hungry for winning, pours  his pride and soul right into the devil himself- after being told from Sarah not to give in. This leads to her downfall when he refuses to listen to her and shoves her away. In the end, after Eddie goes through situations the hard way, he somehow wises up and learns what is meant to have true character.\n\nAll of the characters from the main ones to the extras deliver some of the finest acting. The cinematography is shot beautifully in black and white and it lends some character from the grungy shots of the pool hall to the grittiness of the characters themselves. The fact that it is shot in black and white also makes shadows appear more often hiding the actors faces much like giving them masks that they invisibly wear. The dialogue is clever and at times can be very fast paced as Newman delivers some witty comebacks that are par to the role of Fast Eddie. Jackie Gleason, although he appears in approximately 30 minutes of the film, is engaging as the calm and collected Minnesota Fats. Every second of his screen time is a delight. He plays Fats with an air of mystery and it is exciting and convincing.\n\nAll in all, it reveals a powerful message. The true nature of the film is a metaphor about corporate America and how greed played a part. It is dealing with how people were hungry for success during those times and how mentally challenging it was. The game of pool is the lifestyle that people lived. It is also a landmark film because it brought the 'anti-hero' into cinema and that was a revelation in itself. \n\nThis is what a perfect film is and Robert Rossen has created a masterpiece that should be seen by any true lover of film and anyone interested in the nature of the human condition.",

After you see this movie you will be obsessed with pool for life. Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason was this movie. The battles of \"Fast Eddie\" and \"Minnesota Fats\" were the best parts of that film. I bet 100% of people who saw this movie became obsessed with their characters and playing the game of pool. This is probably Paul Newman's best sports movie performance. 8 Stars.",

We have Paul Newman giving one of his career defining performances. There is Jackie Gleason best known for the role of Ralph Kramden on the Honeymooners who truly excels here in his role. We also have strong performances from Piper Laurie as Felson's somewhat damaged love interest and George C Scott as his possibly dangerous manager. Although none would win all four would be nominated for Oscars.\r\n\r\nThe film would be Nominated for nine Academy Awards of which it would win two (for Cinematography and Art Direction/Set Decoration).\r\n\r\nIt would be followed 25 years later by a sequel Color of Money, directed by Martin Scorsese.\r\n\r\nWhile a professional pool player has become known by the nickname Minnesota Fats the film is in fact the origin of that moniker.",

The quality of the pool itself was top notch as well.\n\nThe film wasn't just about pool though. It is more about having to accept the way life works. You can't live your life on dreams as in reality dreams mean nothing. You have to man up, take your shot and know when to quit.\n\nThough I did enjoy the film, I do not feel that it is a masterpiece. Original for its time maybe, but in my opinion you can't be sentemental about such things. I wouldn't go and buy a jacket that was made in 1961 as it would look dated when I wore it and probably wouldn't be as great in quality as some of the more mass produced jackets of today.\n\nOverall, I was fairly entertained, slightly gripped but felt rather emotionally detached from everything that was going on. The Hustler has had its time, but like good old Minnesota Fats, its doesn't hold up to the new improved players of the modern era.",

The great Paul Newman plays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a pool shark who believes he's only worth the amount of his winnings.  That is, until he meets Sarah Packard (the sensational Piper Laurie), and learns the value of self-appreciation and human relationships.  Unfortunately, for Eddie, this realization comes too late, and at a sky-high cost.  \r\n\r\nThe Hustler differs greatly from other sports movies because the ultimate victory does not come from winning, but from succumbing.  Eddie discovers that the only way he can survive is by freeing himself from the bonds of his pool playing.  He has the passion, but his pride is too great to know when he has had enough, and only through broken bones, betrayal, and death does he discover this.  And, at the end of the film, we are left to wonder if it is not too late for him.\r\n\r\nNot much can be said about The Hustler; it's one of those rare movies that you just experience.  You have to let its dark beauty wash over you to fully appreciate it, and, once you do, you won't forget it.",

George C. Scott, that guy is just intensity, great as a master manipulator who takes Eddie on to hustle for him.

The Color of Money, with its flashy montages and awesome soundtrack, is more about the game of pool and the art of hustling.  The Hustler is more subdued and seems to be much more about the characters with the game merely setting the stage.

(And, no, we didn't do [i]The Color of Money[/i], and, no, we're not going to.  Tom Cruise, remember?)  I used to play pool a bit myself in college, though I was never terribly good.  However, I remember wanting to see this movie long before that.  Strangely, I remember the 1986 release of [i]The Color of Money[/i], and I think my curiousity was piqued then.  Even at the ripe old age of nine, I thought pool was about the coolest game going.  I couldn't play, of course, and I had no idea where I would learn.  But a whole movie about pool?  Sure, I was game for that.  And even at the time, I couldn't see that a 25-year-later sequel was the one to watch.  No, I'd want to see the original . . . someday.  However, when it came to actually choosing movies, this was just never one I thought of.  Netflix has been pushing it on me lately, but of course, I knew we were almost there.  Heck, I went so far as to check that the library even had it; if they hadn't, Netflix would have succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"Fast Eddie\" Felson (the delicious Paul Newman) is a young, cocky pool player.  I'm not sure I'd actually call him a hustler, honestly; everyone in the movie seems well aware of how good he is.  And he is very good.  Very young--Newman was 31 at the time and had credits stretching back nearly ten years, but [i]Eddie[/i] is very young, with all that signifies.  He is brash, boastful, over-confident.  Oh, he's good, too, but he doesn't know how to handle himself as a person.  He goes up against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), a great in the pool scene.  Oh, an aging great, and probably one who's not as good as he used to be.  But still great, and still well able to wipe the floor with just about anyone.  Eddie could have beat him had he not let Fats get to him.  Afterward, he hooks up with the dissolute Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), a drunk with aspirations, and acquires Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) as a mentor/manager.  Bert thinks he can make Eddie one of the greats, if only he can tone Eddie down a bit.\r\n\r\nActually, it took me a while to recognize Piper Laurie.  After this film, she stopped making movies so she could raise her daughter.  It is her next film that most people know her for--[i]Carrie[/i], where she played the crazed mother.  However, I didn't see [i]Carrie[/i] until I was an adult, and I saw [i]Twin Peaks[/i] before that.  And, in many ways, Sarah has several things in common with Catherine Martell.  (N\u00e9e Packard, interestingly enough.  I wouldn't put it beyond Lynch to have done that on purpose.)  Neither are exactly going to win any popularity contests.  Both are a little too fond of the bottle.  Neither seem able to really connect.  Sarah wants very much to be a part of Eddie's life, but I don't think she really knows how.  I don't think she entirely knows how to be a part of her [i]own[/i] life, and it's what drives her to become the person she is and to end up as she does.  She's a second act.  She exists to drive Eddie from his failure in the first act to (it's a sports movie; this is not a spoiler) his triumph in the third.  She's a placeholder, and that's all a Sarah like this one could ever be.  The movie isn't about her.  It isn't about her relationship with Eddie.  It's about Eddie's relationship with pool, and she's not needed there.  Eddie needs the pool cue and the manager, and Sarah is just in the way.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for all its perfect sports movie ending, I think this can also be seen as a tragedy.  Eddie is a deeply flawed character, and in many ways, he's taken down by his own flaws.  Oh, yes, he comes from behind to go against Minnesota Fats again, as we all knew he would and must.  But his arrogance gets in the way, as it would and must, and he has essentially shot himself in the foot in the very place he needs to be most.  Earlier in the movie, Bert comments on Fats's style.  He accepts the challenge from Eddie, goes into the bathroom, cleans himself up, and comes out calm and ready.  Eddie would never do a thing like that.  He thinks he's ready for anything at all times.  He says he lost the first time because he got drunk, but he let himself drink enough to get drunk in the first place.  He doesn't take the game seriously, and Fats does, and that's the important difference between them.  That's why Fats wins, and it's why Eddie never really will.\r\n\r\nOh, I know.  I didn't watch the sequel; how can I know for sure that's what really happens?  How can I be sure he won't change?  And it's true that I don't know how things go for him 25 years later, when he's dealing with brash, cocky Tom Cruise.  (And, really, doesn't he essentially always play brash, cocky Tom Cruise?)  On the other hand, for 25 years, no one else really knew what happened to Fast Eddie Felson, either.  For a quarter of a century, the movie had to stand on its own and be analyzed without a sequel, without anyone being shown what became of him.  And, I think, it works very well that way.  If you have to rely on a sequel to tell people about a character, maybe you shouldn't have made the first movie at all.  Certainly you should have made the sequel sooner.  Since they didn't, I can only assume that we may speculate all we like.",

Though I haven't seen any of Rossen's pre-'Hustler' films, I sensed immediately that the man approached this material with confidence gained through extensive filmmaking experience -- there's just no other way to account for this movie's complexity of tone and outright assault on sentimentality. Maybe the only (very minor) disappointment here is Piper Laurie's character. I watched 'Lilith' immediately after this, and I feel like I detect a certain hesitancy on Rossen's part when it comes to handling female characters -- Laurie for all her screentime here gets a less thoroughly \"shaded\" treatment than Newman, and her scene-chewing might require a special sensibility to appreciate.

That juxtaposition was kind of fortuitous, though, because it really drove home that the latter film is ultimately just a pale imitation of the former, and while Rourke's performance is certainly worthy of Newman's (if less flahsy, which is to its credit), Aronofsky's directing can't hold a candle to Rossen's.  More importantly, \"The Wrestler\" is a one-man show, whereas \"The Hustler\" has a handful of the cinema's most fully-realized and best acted supporting roles.  Laurie and Scott are fantastic, and Gleason does a great job of shifting from beaming, defiant confidence to the slumped shoulders and exasperated eyes of a displaced giant.",

The first half hour of this movie only consisted of pool, but the games weren't really clear and it was difficult to tell who was winning most of the matchups. It was the equivalent of the fight scenes in Transformers: those scenes were filmed so fast that you couldn't tell what was going on. Following the games between Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the movie shifted into a bogus romantic story that I did not buy for a second. That romantic subplot really tested my ability to stick with the movie. I ended up stopping the movie half way through because I was so bored with the uninspiring plot. I finished the last half of the flick last night and was somewhat impressed with it.  This is not a pool movie just like The Big Lebowski isn't a bowling movie. After the first half hour, there are only one or two more scenes about pool. This movie is really about acceptance, defeat, and knowing what's important in your life. Newman and Gleason were terrific in the movie and their pool playing was fantastic. Some scenes were powerful and legendary, but the hokey romance really did damage to this movie.",

Rather than breaking down the line between performance and self, though, The Hustler focuses on the thrill of doing something great, and the way that the whole rest of your life can seem insignificant next to that. In another way, though, The Hustler is indeed an old-fashioned morality tale, as one review I read pointed out, except that the morality is filled with shades of gray. There's no doubt that George C. Scott (excellent, as always) represents the voice of darkness, but the appeal here is far more insidious and selfish than simple greed. It's about winning, and the exhilaration of breaking someone else and proving your superiority. The fact that The Hustler goes to such dark places all while never feeling like its sermonizing is a testament to its greatness. Every major performance is a knockout; Newman and Scott are superb, but when are they not? But Jackie Gleason brings a smooth minimalism to his Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie is riveting as a broken woman who finds herself involved with Newman. The Hustler is a masterpiece from opening to close, and if you're worried about watching a long movie about pool, don't be; it's less about the sport than about the obsession.",
