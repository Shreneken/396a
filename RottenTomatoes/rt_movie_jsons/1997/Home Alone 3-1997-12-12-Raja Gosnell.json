The acting was alright with very generic characters that make it hard to get invested in anything with bland dialogue and over the top generic villains. The cinematography in this is good and the best part of the movie. The music is ok, sometimes it stands out more than others. It is worth noting comedic sound effects make you roll your eyes more than laugh though. The editing is not that good and the biggest flaw as it feels like this wants to be a Cat & Mouse Spy Thriller half the time and a comedic family comedy at the same time and doesn't know how to make it work well. The pacing is ok with noting really happening for most of the film leading to the final big gags & traps which only last about 15 minutes. The traps are a bit over the top and farfetched but entertaining none the less. Overall nothing is truly broken in this but nothing really stands out either. I will say the jokes fall flat most of the time and this shouldn't have been called Home Alone 3. It is a very misleading title which I'm sure was done on purpose. Honestly its not really worth seeing besides nostalgia purposes.",

And that's not because of the change of cast, but because of the humour, and how it's NOT funny. It's not that I grew sick and tired of the slapstick genre, but because it's more exaggerated than JUST slapstick. One of the booby trap scenes shows one of the antagonists getting electrocuted over a long period of time, leaving little to no room for other needed parts of the movie. But when it comes to characters, they're good, but not as great as the ones from the first two films that made the series work. You see, in the first two films, all of the family were a$$holes, but in this movie, the family is surprisingly decent. Even the two siblings are supportive after a few pokes. And if you're a fan of the first two movies, you would probably agree with me, that the family in those movies were so cruel, but that made it more interesting when they were actually nice. But with this movie, the family is kind of bland and boring, and that's not me considering the fact that a cruel family is a good one. But anyway, let's talk about the star of the show here, Alex Pruitt. Alex Pruitt is the main protagonist and replacement of Kevin in this film, and he never really seems to pay off what Kevin had done so well, which was giving an in-depth look into the character. You see, instead of being a whiney baby, and a genius in disguise, Alex is kind of just smart as if it's normal to be that smart.",

However, the plot is very similar to the original 'Home Alone' film. Instead of two comical villains, we get three or four of them. This film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. The slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy, then watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.",

Linz was able to carry this movie, and he did it again in \"Max Keeble's Big Move\".\n\nI'll be honest I re-watched this because \"Hot Ones\" mentioned Scarlett Johansson was in it, and I couldn't remember that.  She has a bit role, but even back then (possibly unrefined, the role didn't have a lot to work with) she was a big personality in a small role.  She has one, brief, powerful scene that would really be worth remembering: most of it is the messing up the burglars.\n\nThis has a very different vibe than the first 2 movies.  While Kevin was isolated and unable to get help, Alex starts by doing everything right to get help, but no one believes him so he feels forced to \"do the right thing\".  However it manifests in almost a psychotic fashion.\n\nOf course, almost everything that happens in this movie should kill someone, but doesn't.  It also had a very easy out: at any time Alex could give the chip up, and it would be over, the bad guys leave the country: he's heavily volunteering for this carnage.  Kevin was being targeted, he saw their faces and was actually defending himself and his home because the \"wet bandits\" were coming for HIM.\n\nUltimately it's fun and charming, and interesting what the limits of technology were back in 1997 with cellphones and pagers, RC cars with block long range, but not wireless cameras, but remote control gizmos that can turn on the neighbors tv.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with it is that his brother's bird is basically as smart a person, having conversations, and taking bribes (or insisting on being paid at least), and the worst bit is that I know there are people with birds as smart as that.  I'm not sure if it would be a Conure, but I don't deal in parrots.\n\nThat said, it's not overly hilarious, it's not bad, but it's just not great either.",

Finally I found the new criminals more enjoyable with their lack of stupidity also entertaining against the increased cleverness of Alex. Furthermore, having 4 criminals rather than 2 allowed for greater banter and even inside jokes made some of their scenes even more comedic.

No Macaulay Culkin, but a new boy, Alex D. Linz (Race to Space) is introduced as the new protagonist. Although many of the events and even the family have been inspired by the previous films, I did enjoy the film. Perfect around Christmastime. With Olek Krupa (Eraser, Salt), Rya Kihlstedt (Deep Impact), Lenny von Dohlen (Twin Peaks, Teeth), David Thornton (the Notebook), Haviland Morris (Gremlins 2) and Scarlett Johansson (the Avengers, Lost in Tokyo). How would you defend your house against burglars? \n\nAfter placing a stolen microchip into a remote control race car to get it past airport security, the bag it is in gets mixed-up with the bag of an old lady called Mrs. Hess. Now terrorists Peter (Krupa), Alice (Kihlstedt), Burton (von Dohlen) and Earl (Thornton) must seek the old woman to retrieve the car. Unknowingly for them, Mrs. Hess has given the toy to her neighbor Alex (Linz), who has to stay at home because of the chickenpox, while his mother (Morris) is gone to work and his brother Stanley and sister Molly (Johansson) are at school. When the crooks show up, Alex feels it's his duty to protect his home...",

This film goes to a new direction by adding a new family, a new kid, and a brand new group of villains. Unlike the first two films, where Kevin is being chased by a couple of burglars while accidentally being put a situation that would cause him to be alone. In this film, Alex, who is the new central protagonist, is being chased by a gang of smugglers that want to get their hands on a military-class data chip could possibly cause war or something like. As the kid finds out more about the reasoning of the chip and smugglers we have our traditional slapstick humor.\nThis film is not a great one, but it is not THAT bad. Like, there are some humorous moments here and there. The slapstick is pretty funny at some points, others are JUST do brutal. Like I am watching a horror movie. The kid is the serial killer and the smugglers are that group of idiotic teenagers that walk themselves in the obvious traps laying around. Seriously, they don't notice the NOTICEABLE traps in this movie. Also, the point where the parents leave the kid alone turns into a pointless comedy routine. In the original two, losing Kevin was tragic moment in the parents lives. In this film, the parents leave him alone ALL THE TIME!  That is poor parenting. \nBottom line, Home Alone 3 is an average family comedy that really does manage to get a few laughs out of you, but there are a lot of inconsistency's. Also the premise is more of a James Bond/Mission Impossible film rather than a Home Alone. If you want to see this, check it out, but I think that would be a terrible idea, but DON'T SEE THE FORTH ONE! Go see the original two.",

It was supposed to be a separate story from the McAllister's.  The whole drama between the Mother (Alice) and Alex and family altogether has cooled down, and wasn't as harsh in the first two, plus the fact that this sick 8-year old kid took on 4 PROFESSIONAL agents with often times unexpected traps was such a laugh.  People often complain about Alice constantly leaving Alex alone making these supposed \"false alarms\", without realizing that both parents have WORK.  Good stuff aside, what I didn't like was that the villains took their pain in a bit too silly a way.  Childish sound effects, pratfalls, and... a snow blower falling on top of Jernigan's head with its blades rolling, was WAY too violent.  The biggest flaw I've seen in the movie, is that if these villains were so professional, why wouldn't they put a tracking device within the toy car in case they lose it?  BUT... then we wouldn't have a movie would we?  I say watch it, along with the first two.  IT'S NOT THAT BAD!  I rate this movie 7.6/10",

Linz helms the lead role. He does it well enough, but the script he's stuck with is poor and he is no Macaulay Culkin. He does manage to keep things mostly alive though, so he's certainly successful.\nBut the story dissolves from what it once was into some childish fantasy about taking on criminals with a remote control car, and although that entertained me as a kid and may still entertain child viewers, for the rest of the population it's a challenge to please.\nThe worst parts of the script are the lines given to Seth Smith and Scarlet Johansson, who serving as the older brother and sister to Alex Pruitt respectively have to intimidate him, but do it with cheap and pathetic lines and poor direction from Raja Gosnell. Perhaps Seth Smith is part to blame, but there is no way Scarlet Johansson can be because today she is one of the most talented female actresses around, but why she had to start of with sub-par material of this quality isn't good for her.\nEssentially, the dynamics are uncreative and repetitive, failing to please fans outside of juveniles, and there is no real creativity or originality to it save from the efforts of Alex D. Linz to make Home Alone 3 a movie worth seeing or remembering. The second Home Alone jumped the shark, while this one jumps it again, but it could have been worse. Good thing it wasn't.",

Couldn't these people think of anything new for slapstick? \n\nWhat's even worse about it is it's written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Home Alone, Christmas Vacation), the script is downright terrible but then again John Hughes was getting worse at making movies.\n\nAlso on the cover a very stupid critic says \"It's better then the first two!\", actually it isn't.\n\nIf you wanna watch the Home Alone movies please stay away from this stinker and the fourth film and just watch the first two.",

Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.  That's not exactly an epic idea.  It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse.\n\nHome Alone 3 reeks of desperation.  Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.  Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.  Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.  What remains is a name-only sequel - a remake really - that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time.\n\nCulkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.  Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.  As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.  He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris.\n\nThe outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.  In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.  At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.  The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.  That means they will have to search them all one by one.\n\nAlex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.  The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice!\n\nAs the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.  Those scenes are sheer torture, they  go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.  Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.  We'll see.",

The slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring.

When Alex's house becomes the next victim, he sets up traps that involves being really precise and not being a centimetre away from anything. This movie was bad and I mean bad! It completely abandons everything from the first two Home Alone movies and fucks them up. Just looking at the front cover makes me cringe. Is there anything worse than this? No wait- Home Alone 4!!!!! Home Alone 3 gets a Some Old Bullshit/10!",
