The acting is clueless, filled with bad dialogue and puns and devoid of any charm at all. The cinematography and editing is a weird cross between a Kung-Fu film, John Carpenter & a early 90's PC game. This looks so cheap and the CGI AND practical effects are some of the worst I have ever seen The music is overloaded and plays constantly in fights and feels obnoxious and over the top and gets very annoying. This all leads to terrible pacing. Quite often it felt like there wasn't a plot even though I know they are trying to stop Shao Khan. The fights go on way too long and I just wanted this to end after 20 minutes. Stay Away From this even if your a fan of the Video Games.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did.\n\nThus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't.\n\nWhere to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson.\n\nThe plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows?\n\nThe dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability.\n\nI would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say \"Yep, that's Baraka,\" \"Yep, that's Mileena.\" The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors.\n\nEvery bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision.\n\nIt pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished.\n\nPerhaps I should've taken the hint.",

For starters, Lui Kang's and Kitana's actors are the only ones to reprise their roles from the previous film but besides that the films suffers from a poor plot, terrible cgi and green screen effects (such as the infamous explosion scene and the animalities), characters that show up only to disappear one scene later ( for example Nightwolf, Sub-Zero, and Scorpion. The former being the brother of the original Sub-Zero from the first film and the latter having survived being killed by Johnny Cage for some unexplained reason.), and Shao Kahn being a laughably bad villain by killing his minions for minor infractions. Ed Boon has said that this is the worst thing to have the Mortal Kombat name on it and we don't blame him.",

Also, hey, how come Sonya, Johnny Cage and Raiden's actors get to escape from this crap and get different actors but Liu Kang and Kitana's stay? The biggest narm however is the bad greenscreen effects and CGI. The first movie had these shortcomings too but at least, only one character got the PS1 treatment and we got a really good animatronic out of it. Here, we have CGI that came out of a bad PS1 game. Seriously, what was wrong with New Line back in 1997? I say that because this movie came out the same year as Spawn, which also had glaringly bad CGI, even for the late '90s. MK: Annihilation is a bad movie that has no redeeming qualities beyond being snark bait due to its poor production values.",

Yes, you can see where they imposed CGI and where a character is moving against a blue screen. The \"special effects\" are F-grade, the kind you find in a hapless hacker's basement.\n\nThe second thing you'll notice right away are the character designs. Never mind the latex on Sheeva, what made me laugh was Motaro's design. Wow, I didn't think that Tenacious D's devil from The Pick of Destiny would be more threatening than that. The dialogue is corny and idiotically spoken right out of the gates, and I know it's going to get worse. \n\nSo obviously, one of the things they try to do is make this more serious by having Johnny Cage become a classic red-shirt and get his neck snapped only 6 minutes into the film. That might be beneficial to preserving his character by having Cage cut from the cast list right away. I wouldn't be surprised if he refused to show up for the premiere of the film at the local AMC or even see it in theaters.\n\nI should mention that Shao Kahn in this film looks like someone I would hang out with at the gym. The game's Shao Kahn is a mix of Tarkatan face and human; this one is not. That's not the image you want to give me. I thought that scene was a decent TV level conversation, but it could have been a bit better.\n\nAnd of course, the final fight with the infamous CGI. It doesn't last long, but the CGI returns at the end of the fight.\n\nSo what can I say about this that hasn't already been said before? I know this film has already been dealt with by so many people, but I wanted to do my own look at it. Here's how I sum it up.\n\nThe dialogue is not particularly memorable, there are a lot of weird yells and grunts that did not endear me to the Kombatants not named Jax, and the CGI is awful. The only Mortal Kombat game I've ever played is the Sega Genesis version of the original, and I can say with full confidence that that game looks a hell of a lot better than this movie.\n\nMKA is just a dumb-ass attempt to be a fantasy martial arts film, and surprisingly a step down from the original film. Next time, talk to Jackie Chan, Michael Dimartino or Bryan Konieztko regarding that idea, not the dummies who made this.",

            "content": "~~~~~~(MAJOR SPOILERZ!!!!)~~~~~~\n\nLet us just start with saying that all the reviews of this movie were wrong, and that we honest to God believe that this is an  amazing movie. Let us tell you why! \n1) Every character was lovable. \nJax: As the token black guy, he filled his role just like his witty and urban banter filled my heart. At first when we saw that Johnny Cage died and was replaced by Jax we were sorely upset, but after he opened his mouth and spit his first hilarious line we were hooked for sure! Also let us just say that he is HUGE! Ladies will love this movie! \nLiu Kang: Immediately we were struck by his hair. We had seen it before in the first movie (also a must watch), and we are proud to say that not a single hair has been displaced. It looked just as luxurious, if not more so. Liu Kang struggles throughout the movie with low self-esteem, and the three dimensional nature of his character really strengthens the movie as a whole. \nSonya: Wow, nipples. Shes back and even hotter than before, and now with a new love interest in Jax. This classy Hollywood hottie is now paired up with a black dude, and is fighting social norms while kickin' ass. Cool. \nShiva: Double the arms, double the fun. We both have had a crush on her since the we moment  saw her, and we agree she is without a doubt the most beautiful woman either of us have ever seen. We wish we had a girl like Shiva to do some \"Mortal Kombat\" with, if you know what we mean.\nWe could honestly go on, this movie was filled with amazing, sorry, let us reiterate, AMAZING characters which we could write about until \"Annihilation\". We wish that they were a part of our great big family.\n2) The Kombat was amazing.\nFirst off, the flips. They rule! The characters basically flip everywhere. You might think it would get old, or just look stupid but we are glad to report that it doesn't. The choreographers and the stunt doubles really did a bang-up job. Just when you thought the flips would stop, or that it wasn't appropriate in the scene, they pulled a fast one on you and stuck one in there. It fit every time and felt great. We honestly believe they could squeeze a flip into a sex scene if they weren't stuck to a PG13 rating. Besides the flips, the fight choreography was a visual banquet and fight choreographers Robin Shou and Pat E. Johnson deserve more recognition for their masterful accomplishment. The kicks, punches, leg sweeps, and cartwheels are top knotch. Sonya has a magnificent high kick, smacking perpetrators for miles around with her beautifully meaty legs. The special wizard powers of characters like sub-zero and nightwolf (that vision quest was groovy) added a whole new dimension that conventional martial arts movies just can't match.\n3) Special effects\nThe special digital effects (both 3-D and 2-D) were mind-expanding at the time of the movies release, and believe it or not they still hold up powerfully today. We're at a loss for words trying to describe the climactic dragon fight between Liu Kang and Shao Khan. It's truly something that has to be seen to be understood. The digital effects team hits hard, fast, and often with a rambunctious energy in their craft and love in their hearts, leaving us and my companions stunned and speechless for indefinite hours.\n4) The plot\nWe cried when Johnny Cage died. The bond between Johnny and Sonya was so deep that during that scene we almost felt like we lost our own lover. We were brought to tears. Other scenes had the perfect mix of poignancy and sexy. Many times we were left both misty-eyed and half-chubbed, a perfect mixture.\n5)Conclusion\nIn short, this movie has changed our lives for the better. We live our lives like Sonya, and make sure we make connections with our loved ones because we know they could be ripped away at a moments notice. The wise words of Raiden echo in our brains, helping us overcome any challenge or trial that life can toss our way. We used to get caught up, but now we can front flip through the fires of hell without the slightest of harm befalling us.  \n\nWe thoroughly believe everybody should see this at least twice in their lifetime; it's just that good.\n\nOver and out, Carney and Matt",

I remember going to the theaters when this came out, when i was younger and craved the mindless action and violence of mortal kombat, and loving the first one, only to sit in a dark room for an hour and a half, watching this debacal before me in a sold out crowd (half who were on the train of thought as me as thinking that this SUCKS!) I was ashamed that i paid to see this. This was the first movie i ever thought truly sucked. Even in my younger age, when i would watch anything and like it, i walked out of that theater that day, with just a little less respect for mortal Kombat, and a very disappointed kid. I hope that new line does the right thing and burns and crucifes all remaining copies of this movie. Burn MKA. BURN!!!!!",

Anderson. \n\nLui Kang (Robin Shou) and the crew (except Johnny Cage because he died in the first few minutes) has get to victory before Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson), the evil Emperor of the Outerworld, who has a new plan to overtake planet Earth. He has also discovered a portal between Earth and Outerworld. If it stays open for seven days (which I do not understand why), the two worlds will merge, and Shao-Kahn taking control both planets. Rayden (not played by Christopher Lambert) and Sonya (Sandra Hess) set to find his colleague Jax (Lynn Red Williams) while Liu Kang and Kitana (Talisa Soto) are on the trail of Nightwolf/ Litefoot as they race against time to defeat Shao-Kahn, who has brought Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander), who is Katana's mother, back from the dead to aid his evil scheme.\n\nThe sequel to Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is an unnecessary sequel in every way. If you did not see the first film, you will not know what is going on because I did not. You will wonder who these people are, where they are going, what is their motivation, and most of all what the hell is going on. There are twists and turns during the movie (for example Rayden mentions that Shao-Kahn is his brother) but I either did not care, I really saw it coming, or both.\n\nThe acting for the most part is pretty bad. I think it is because they got a new cast. While the cast for the first movie was not perfect, but atleast have better acting than the new cast in Moral Kombat: Annihilation. I will say: the new cast try to give good to decent performances but they unfortunately they have to do what the script and the direction tell them to do (which are both equally bad). \n\nThe special effects in this movie are really horrendous. They look a Saturday morning cartoon special. In fact, they are the some of the worst special effects I have ever watched. If the special effects are this bad, then this movie should went straight to video. \n\nLastly, the only people see a movie like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is to see some fights. They are decent to downright bad. After watching the fight scenes, they get repetitive and old real fast. \n\nAt the end, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is a joke. It is incredibly bad in every way. The fight scenes might be decent to bad but that does not save the movie from been a failure or the fact that they are repetivite, consists of characters dodging each other by kicking over and over again or doing somersaults over and over again. This is a guilty pleasure because you can watch how bad the acting is, how laughable the dialogue is, and how horrendous the effects are.\nIf can see it, especially if you not a fan of bad movies, then you might need to avoid this movie and see the first one, which is so much better than this.",

Yes, you heard it here. The man behind not one, not two, not three or four, but five shitty Resident Evil movies and Alien vs. Predator made the better film. To actually allow a feat like that to occur means taking shoddy filmmaking to such unthinkable depths of woe, and it should come as no surprise to anyone that a film whose best asset is stunt work that looks like a low-rent acrobatic act you'd expect to see set up shop on a Kmart parking lot reaches those depths like it's walk in the park.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2015/02/02/what-the-hell-were-they-thinking-57/",

Thank goodness he still has a lot of sci-fi fans and of course, married to Resident Evil star Milla Jovovich. I think that \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" always had a lot of bad reputation and they should because the movie only has Liu Kang (Robin Shou) but no returning characters from the original Kombat movie. Also, Annihilation just taken a page of the \"Mortal Kombat II\" playbook and it feels like a rerun of \"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues.\" And I don't know if the cast look good, but the story and the setting that they supposed to continue to where the original left off, it was just terrible. To me, I won't be watching this on Blu-Ray. This is one of the worst video game movies/sequels of all time. And I think that eventually hurt Midway's chances to continue with the Mortal Kombat franchise since Mortal Kombat 4 and all of its adventure games started to fade away. I hope Warner Bros. (which New Line still owns the rights, but the studio was merged in 2008 to Warner Bros./New Line Cinema) should reboot the movie franchise and hopefully soon, maybe Paul W.S.

The special effects are abysmal, and the fight scenes are way too many.  However, Annihilation's greatest flaw comes from  trying to fit too many characters into one film.  Based on Mortal Kombat 3, as well as a few elements of Mortal Kombat 4, which came out the same year as this film, it seemed more about \"Hey, how many characters can we put into this film, even for two seconds?\"  Rather than, \"Ok, which characters are in, and which are out?\"  Yeah, it sucks.",

            "content": "As Mortal Kombat served as a guilty pleasure, I hoped that at worst its sequel would do the same.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation is set up to be troubled on the mere surface because it is a sequel to an adaptation of a video game and it features replacement cast members for other dropouts. But with a budget of $30 million which equals nearly twice the budget of the first Mortal Kombat, it should at least be a decent visual experience, right?\nWrong. Somehow, director John R. Leonetti managed to take a film that cost about twice as much as Mortal Kombat and make it look three times as cheap. The production design of the film is cardboard, the scenery is weak and the visual effects make the blue screen of the film so damn clear while the animated effects are nowhere near as organic as they were in Mortal Kombat. The quality of the visual effects in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is very low which is surprisingly ridiculous, even for a film with a meagre budget of $30 million. That wasn't enough money to afford good visual effects, a talented cast or even anyone with a sense of how to craft a decent fight scene.\nThe first fight scene in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation depicts Shao Kahn and Raiden getting into a fight. All they essentially do the entire time is fly at each other, knock each other across the screen through slow motion and blue screen before it all reaches the end, and at about the same time viewers will realise the low quality of the film. The fight scenes in the film are choreographed terribly and filmed as such, as well as being edited to incur an excess of slow motion which was annoying in the film but insulting in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. It is strange that the cinematography in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is so poor because director John. R. Leonetti has contributed good cinematography to many films in his career. This time, his brother Matthew F. Leonetti has to take it on but is cursed with the distinct inability to capture good action scenes whatsoever. Admittedly the film was doomed from the start due to poor choreography, but the cinematography just captures ridiculously arbitrary elements some times. Still, it is far superior to the schlocky editing of the film which curses it all with excessive slow motion and awful speed. The one semi-decent fight scene is shared by Sub-Zero and Scorpion, but it is still not that good.\nWhile director Paul W.S. Anderson worked to make Mortal Kombat a guilty pleasure which is focused more on fighting than on storytelling, John R. Leonetti takes a different angle on it. It is a completely wrong one because it is more focused on storytelling than action, and the story is even more shoddy and senseless than the first time around. But worse than that, it means that the film takes itself seriously and therefore cannot be even a guilty pleasure. The atmosphere of the film was melodramatic, and not intense or dark in the otherworldly fashion of its predecessor, and it is constantly made cheaper by the lacklustre script and cheap technical elements of the film which leave Mortal Kombat: Annihilation as nothing but an exercise in terrible filmmaking and severe stupidity.\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation follows in its predecessor's footsteps by failing to deal justice to Johnny Cage. This time, it is because he is killed within 6 minutes of running time and then that is all. There is no telling what performance Chris Conrad may have given in the part or if the comic oriented nature of the character might have helped to change the overly serious atmosphere of the film. But as there is little time before he is gone, there is no telling how the film may have turned out if he remained present. Although, if it is anything like the rest of the cast, Chris Conrad would not have been likely to succeed.\nWhile I'm happy that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation brought the character Jax into play, Lynn \"Red\" Williams is pushed into a heavily stereotypically African-American archetype in the role. He is the intended source of comic effect in lieu of the dead Johnny Cage, but it is so painfully generic that it is not the slightest bit funny. Lynn \"Red\" Williams looks appropriate for the par, but he is given such lacklustre scripting and stereotypical character elements that he does nothing for the part and simply wallows in the shadow of the low standard of comic relief set by the first Mortal Kombat film.\nSandra Hess is a weak substitute for Bridgette Wilson. While Bridgette Wilson was far from perfect, she at least stood her ground as a serious and determined woman who was willing to put up a fight. With Sandra Hess, the difference is that she is put back into a singlet to reveal the busty state of the actress which later becomes all the more revealing as she goes through a mud wrestling scene and attempt to distract from the fact that she can do nothing for the part. Sandra Hess looks too different from Bridgette Wilson, cannot fight nearly as good and is there clearly for shallow sex appeal purposes. I don't deny that she is attractive, I deny that she is a good replacement or much of a good cast member. So Mortal Kombat: Annihilation fails to deal justice for Sonya Blade also because Sandra Hess is so clearly unintelligent and helpless in the role.\nTalisa Solo also takes a step down in the quality of her performance as Kitana. In the first film she did not get enough screen time or fight scenes, but in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation she gets even less. The one difference is that somebody decided to throw in a half-assed plot element which makes her mother one of the central antagonists, and so Talisa Solo has to focus more on drama than action. She is terrible. She wasn't great in the first film, but the unexpectedly low quality of her performance in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was not something I was prepared for. So it is no surprise that after Mortal Kombat: Annihilation she was essentially never seen again, with the only exception being Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever which is recognised as being one of the worst films ever made.\nThe remaining characters are not as weak. But there are still no cast members who can transcend the half-decent standard which is set by James Remar.\nJames Remar is semi-decent as Raiden because he stands confidently in the part and delivers his lines with a minor of wisdom, but he is streets behind coming close to what Christophe Lambert put into the part. The tone of his voice and the myopia induced eyes of Christophe Lambert were what gave him the godlike sense which made him fit the profile, and James Remar has neither of those. But as far as he goes, he is ok and certainly stands out as the best cast member. But then again, considering the distinct lack of talent that he is up against there is not much he has to do in pursuit of that\nRobin Shou still has his spirit present in the role of Liu Kang, but the script and the direction of the story forces him through so much hokey tedium that there is little he can do. The poor choreography and shortage of his requirement in action scenes makes it all worse because it means that the best skills he brought to the first film as a fighter cannot be used in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Robin Shou brings nothing more than his mere presence to Mortal Kombat: Annihilation because he is only of paper thin relevance to the film.\nMusette Vander is a thoroughly awful antagonist, Brian Thompson performs like a WWE pro wrestler on meth as Shao Kahn and Deron McBee is just dreadful as Motaro.\n\nSo despite being the sequel to one of the better video game adaptations in cinematic history, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation runs incredibly far beneath the standard of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation due to a ridiculous plot, shoddy action scenes, cheap visuals and a cast who cannot save themselves from anything.",

In fact, all throughout this film, the fights seem to be taken up by a large number of jumping scenes. One of this films fight scenes is of two barely dressed women fighting in the mud (and it includes hair pulling), and the saddening thing is it isn't as hot as it sounds. \r\n\r\nIt really does not bode well for the movie when only two of the cast from the first film return. James Remar brings a less raspy voice to the role, and for some reason, changes his look (including a hair cut) before the final battle to look more hip or something. We get a new character to replace Johnny Cage, in Jax, complete with the metal arms and boasting the cheesy one liners we tolerated from Johnny Cage, whilst managing to be slightly annoying.\r\n\r\nThis film is chock full of plot holes and problems, but the biggest one has to be when Scorpion and Sub Zero appear for one scene to have one fight, and then, despite staying alive after the fight, never appear for the rest of the film. While it's explained how Sub Zero is here (he's the original S.Z's bro), we never get any explination why Scorpion is back from the dead or why he can talk now (his scream of \"SUCKERS!\" makes you cringe for a week). It would feel like fan-baiting to bring them back for the movie, but for one scene? It's illogical and pointless. Nightwolf also appears in a one-time useless appearance, granting Lui Kang three tasks, where we only see one and are told him lying down and trying to act was the first task.\r\n\r\nShao Khan is in no way a strong villian. He's by the numbers in everything, in his actions, in his plan, even his costume is the type of by the numbers thing you'd see for halloween. And it doesn't help that the actor acts and delivers his lines with an amount of cheese that is lethal for those with lactose intolerance. His henchmen are barely talking and one-note, what with a centaur gladiator, a lesbian tetramand and a chequered Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile wanna-be, with none of them making any kind of an impression. Baraka makes an out of nowhere appearance, with bad make-up and an all-too easy defeat.\r\n\r\nThe crappy CGI is back in this film, only this time, in the form of a dragon fight and an awful looking demon for Jax to fight. When a fight scene in the film is centered around two terribly done CG dragons, you know this film isn't going to get much better. But the effects are bad also, so that hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nOne thing that struck me in the Outworld was the geographical inconsistencies. From one location, the characters could see the Eiffel Tower, the Twin Towers and Lui Kang's temple. I'm not geographer, but i'm pretty sure they're not meant to be so close together. But barely anything in this film manages to make sense, even the explination as to why the portal opened in the first place or how Queen Sindel is connected to the portal. Seeing as I mentioned Queen Sindel, here's a link to one of the worst/most hilarious film lines in history courtesy of her http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt0VY7Yg2w\r\n\r\nWhen a film based around a series of fighting games cannot do good fight scenes, you know this film has fucked up. While the first Mortal Kombat film may not exactly be oscar winning standard, it's quite astounding how bad this film is. The plot doesn't make sense, the dialogue is awful, the acting is sub-par, and anything you liked about the first film has been diluted and re-used in this film.",

Anderson lacks the strength of the first movie it seriously lowers the bar of the Mortal Kombat trilogy and it is also the worse Mortal Kombat movie ever along with DOA Dead or Alive even the Uwe Boll video game adaptations. From what I can tell this is the worse movie ever I mean come on this sequel had nothing to do with the first movie at all. There are various reasons on why I hate this movie and why I also prefer the first one better.\n1) First of all there's no plot or story. The first movie was better because the first one has a really interesting plot this one is seriously boring and dumb.\n2) Second the directing is really bad and terrible. Director John R. Leonetti would have done something better in this movie and he didn't do a good job with his directing for one reason.\n3) Third the fight scenes are seriously pointless and boring. Unlike the first movie the first film has better fight scenes than this cheap movie because all of the fight scenes in Mortal Kombat Annihilation are seriously plain dumb and really boring.\n4) Fourth the effects in this movie are really bad. The special effects in this movie are seriously plain dumb and incredibly boring and the film even suffered from Bad CGI effects.\n5) Fifth there's too much characters in this movie.  Unlike the first one there's just a few characters but here there's too much which makes the new Mortal Kombat movie even dumber and dumber.\n6) And last but not least the new casts in the new Mortal Kombat movie seriously didn't make any sense at all. I mean come on the new actor who played Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) wasn't as good as the other actor who played Johnny Cage in the original movie (Linden Ashby from the first movie). The new Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess) was also terrible I mean seriously the other actress who played Sonya in the first movie (Bridgette Wilson) was much more better than the new actress in this sequel. The other actress who played Sindel was seriously awful with her performance.  And last but not least the actor who played Shao Kahn was even worse than the other new casts in the film. Only Robin Shou who played Liu Kang in the original was the only actor who did a better job in the sequel the same also to Keith Cooke who played Reptile in the first movie and now he even did a better job with his performance as the younger version of Sub Zero in the sequel. Talisa Soto (the actress who played princess Kitana in the first movie)  did a better job with her performance as Princess Kitana in the sequel. The only new casts who did a better job in Mortal Kombat Annihilation is James Remar who plays Raiden in the sequel along with J.J. Perry who plays Scorpion in the sequel and the new actor who plays Jax in the sequel are the only new casts who did a better job in the sequel along with Robin Shou and Talisa Soto while the rest seriously went down the hill.\nOverall Mortal Kombat Annihilation gets a 2/10 because the movie has no plot. The film has pointless fight scenes. Bad directing. The film suffers from Boring special effects and really bad CGI effects. Too much characters and the new casts seriously ruined the entire film.",
