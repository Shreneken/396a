            "content": "As someone who has spent a lot of time in Baltimore, I have never found a restaurant that actively requires a coat and tie anymore, let alone one that will lend you either. If there still is, it would not be the kind of place where you eat \"hardshell crabs\", as Jack Nicholson calls them; you'd need a hard table and no qualms about swinging a mallet.\n\nWhen considering rom-coms, As Good as It Gets is definitely among the more poorly-aged. Nicholson's Melvin has gone from 'uncouth' to 'intolerable', and his bizarre relationship with his much younger waitress, Helen Hunt's Carol, toes the line between grooming and sweetly unsure expressions of affection by a guy with a behavioral disorder. What haven't aged poorly are just what the film received due credit in its day for, the performances; Nicholson and Hunt are both great, portraying the legitimate confusion and distress of a radically torrid relationship with appropriate exasperation. That may be part of the problem, that Nicholson sells being a terrible human being too well, and thus makes it very difficult to want to see him happy or to let Carol be drawn into his strange existence. There's something to be said for the film's willingness to promote a character uncomfortable with emotional intimacy who lashes out with insults, but I mean this is a guy who flings Jewish jokes to get a happy couple to leave 'his' normal breakfast table at a public restaurant. There seemed to be more sincerity and weight in Melvin's eventual friendship with his negihbor Simon (Greg Kinnear), with whom he shared more chemistry and common interests with a neat 'odd couple' finale.\n\nBut everyone likes when a mean guy gets soft due to taking care of a cute dog. That's always nice. (2.5/5)",

Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a romance writer who is afflicted by a debilitating case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, masking the resulting insecurities by viciously lashing out at anyone brave enough to get close to him.  He soon finds himself enamored with Carol (Helen Hunt), a local waitress who tolerates Udall's behavior while trying to manage the health problems of her young son.  The movie is marred by a long running time, an annoying and seemingly ever-present music score, and the implausibility of Carol actually being romantically interested in Udall, but a remarkable performance by Nicholson and some fantastic dialogue make As Good As It Gets worth watching.",

            "content": "This movie provides wonderful and deep insight into human nature. If you're tired of today's shallow, bullshht, political correctness (ie Marxism) existence, and long for some genuine human interaction, this is food for the soul. The blue-haired 22 year old Millennial who has never had a relationship is not going to understand the obvious dynamics in play here. This is a time of adults and real life circumstances, before the Clownworld existence of today.\n\nCarol is a single mom/waitress with a son who has health issues. She comes across a successful, rich author as a patron of her cafe. He's good looking and highly intelligent but crass and serious deficiencies in social skills. Over the course of time you get to see how the heart of a person can make reality so much different than the window dressing that consumes most simple-minded folks. \n\nHelen Hunt (as Carol) is truly stunning in looks, and Jack is much older than her, and a bit too old in real life, I think. This is the one minor flaw, that you kinda need to overlook. Of course, Jack still has good looks and of course his charisma and intellect and riches make plenty of make-up for the age difference. In a real-life scenario, you can see this being possible, but I'd estimate her character to be around 32 while his character is close to 60, so the romantic interaction is a bit far-fetched. Don't let that stop the rest of the absolute magic that is the rest of this film.\n\nSimon and Cuba Gooding Jr. are also absolute gems. Simon the gay neighbor is maybe one of the most likeable characters I think I've ever seen on film, and it's ironic that the alphabet mafia activists target this film because it's not politically ridiculous like most film of today. \n\nThis is absolute must watch.",

Really, he should have been blacklisted from the place but then the movie couldn't happen.\n\nThen said guy literally stalks her (finds out her address). He ends up paying for her son's medical bills. Oh and is disrespectful to her too, unless it gets him something in return. It is made clear that without this money, her son may very well die. And yet she's still torn about accepting the money, as she vehemently does not want him to leverage that to get romantic or sexual favours, which she makes very clear to him. Literally at every turn she is saying no. And yet as soon as he makes even the most basic attempts at bettering himself, the plot demands that he be rewarded by \"getting the girl\". Her mom \"helps\" this along by telling her, basically, this is all that's available for you- there's no such thing as what you want in a boyfriend. These two have a clear power imbalance, and a 20+ year age difference, and zero chemistry. She spends most of the movie turning him down or only going along with it because she fears for her sons life. EW, GROSS. Even by 90s standards this is sexist af.\nAnd yes yes I know, he was meant to be be a bigot and to show him kind of redeeming himself. But he didn't, yet the movie still rewards him as if he did. This feeds that incel idea that if you make an effort to reach a bare minimum of niceness, you are entitled to the girl. Why? Because YOU like her so much, you're the only one who can love her right. That's literally the argument- it's entitlement based on your own feelings- you like her? then you should get to HAVE her, right? she should see that only YOU can see how awesome she is? He stalks, manipulates, disrespects and pressures her the whole movie long, and gets his way. This isn't a redeemed character its just \"I took a pill, I will not directly address all the awful things I did let's just gloss over all that cos I'm \"better\" now so let's smooch\".\n\nHow is this a comedy? If anything this is a commentary on how the healthcare system is broken and the wealthy exploit the working class.",

The author also has a gay artist neighbor who lives in a next door who holds parties, and he ends up seriously hurt by robbers and becomes financially wiped out.\n\nThe waitress has to quit her job to take care of her son, and the author offers to pay for his medical care, simply because he cannot tolerate the waitress not serving him anymore. All credible, but then the story falls apart when the author essentially becomes a Santa Claus.\n\nThis is billed as a romantic comedy, but the movie is hardly funny.

            "content": "The late 90's had some of the most arguable greatest cultural impacts leading in to post-modern filmmaking. In this year alone, James Cameron's opus, Titanic (1997), winning an incredible 11 Oscars to the small blockbuster achievement of Men and Black (1997), to Tarantino's smooth-talking and quiet flick, Jackie Brown (1997). Among many other films alike, it can be easy to get lose among such a high-time for Cinema - and one of these films that is slowly fading away is a masterful romantic drama that manages to squeeze every ounce of creative juice in a sub-genre already drying. As Good As It Gets (1997) happens to also be one of my favorite romance films along with dramas, and while it has some very bad blemishes, the core is sweet, heartfelt and rich and most of all: satisfying. The plot itself is rather rom-com, Jack Nicholson plays an successive obsessive compulsive writer who’s rather brutish to all those around him, while Greg Kinnear plays a gay artist - struggling to find his passion, all tied to Helen Hunt with a struggling mother with a son who suffers from quite a bit. Of course, with some slick sly writing and some great performances, Nicholson’s character, Melvin, begins to soften up - after having to take care of his neighbors dog. And even though it’s a solid 139 minute film, it often does dabble on sitcom, rather than feeling like an actual film. It’s rather repulsive in how the film looks like a tv show, rather than a movie. The plot already is very heavy with how it flows and how the humor is executed. Don’t get me wrong, it’s wonderful; I loved the humor - but it still needs to be addressed as it is. But the most important aspect of Cinema comes to two things: Either a story about humanity, or exploring the deep intimacy of human beings - or how we observe ourselves from a non-parti pris perspective. As Good As It Gets thrives with overflowing richness, and a feeling of blunt honesty. The thee duo’s all play off each other - not only dramatically but hilariously. Did I mention the humor was sly? Comedy, or what makes you laugh is subjective but their is an art form to pulling it off and As Good As It Gets does that in spades. While it may be a drama first and comedy second, Comedies are usually not made to be coherent; quite the rule breakers, but if they have a good story to boot - who cares? But the remarkable thing to observe about the film is how it treats Nicholson and Hunt’s back-and-forth relationship. Ending on what I easily can boast as one of my favorite endings of all time. The two, so polar opposite walking on different sides as they enter a shop - only for Nicholson to stumble or lose his footing a bit only to brush it aside and take a step into her side; willing to do whatever it takes to make it work. All done from a long shot, and even the previous scenes before make it all the more sweet. But what makes it mature is, while it does end on a mostly happy note - work needs to be done- but one can leave feeling sated in knowing there is a good chance of all working out; unlike a good fairytale. It suffers from some dragging and some aging, but the movie is iconic, and also quotable. But the dynamic trio all really bring the best out of each other - a great good feeling film that’s actually good. Few films make me smile when I think about their dialogue, however, “You make me want to be a better man,” will probably be one of the greatest quotes to ever come from a genre in such high quotability. This not as good as it gets, but it’s pretty damn great. ",

I wish people would still give me a chance and see that I have a heart too after I lose my temper and tell them that they're a gold-digger for asking me to buy them a jaguar or that they need to stop running an illegal business. It's only because I care, and I'm like Jack, I just have a funny way of showing it. This one hit close to home, and there may have been at least one cup of soda filled with tears at the end!",

All of them were not happy with lives but at the end found peace, happiness and redemption with one and another. Great feel-good movie. Recommended.

No, The Sweet Hereafter (1997), The Ice Storm (1997) and even Wag the Dog (1997) are better films and they should have been nominated for Best Picture over this film but this is still a decent romantic comedy. I love James L. Brooks' feature film debut, Terms of Endearment (1983), but I was disappointed by How Do You Know (2010) and Spanglish (2004) which tempered by expectations for this film and I felt that this film was just OK. I was also aware that this film earned Jack Nicholson his second Academy Award and he was not worthy of it but I did appreciate the work of Helen Hunt in this film and I wish she had been a bigger star.\n\nMisanthrope Melvin Udall, Jack Nicholson, terrorizes waitress Carol, Helen Hunt, who he is attracted to but fails to communicate with because he suffers from OCD and is generally ornery. The two grow closer after his gay artist neighbor Simon, Greg Kinnear, is assaulted and loses his passion for painting which forces Melvin to take care of his dog and pushes him to reach out. He ends up paying for her son's medical care which causes her to feel indebted to him and allows him to pressure her into going away with him and Simon as Simon tries to get money from his estranged parents. While there Melvin and Carol admit their attraction to each other but he sabotages himself again and the two only reconcile when back in New York City.\n\nThe sweetest moment in the film came when Carol angrily confronts Melvin in the middle of the night and tells him \"I am never going to sleep with you.\" Their was an oddly palpable sexual chemistry between Hunt and Nicholson that adds an extra layer to the scene but her tireless attempts to find the goodness in everybody made me love her character. The whole scene works so well because Brooks is aware of the comedy of the moment but plays it just right so it doesn't feel like it's part of a John Cleese movie but instead like it's a mixture between Nora Ephron and Norman Jewison. I love scenes like this and I wish that there had been more in the movie because that would have elevated it to a higher level in my view.\n\nWhere the film loses me is how quickly the relationship progresses and how creepy some elements of the relationship feel, particularly the age difference and the fact that he essentially pays for her company. Their flirtation scenes are sweet but they are far too brief and we jump from him telling her that she is ugly to him trying his hardest to compliment her. I was also creeped out by how her mother, who would have been an age appropriate love interest, was cheering on their relationship as she seems to be looking for a father figure in him more than a real boyfriend. One scene in particular, divorced from the romance, also irks me as we see Melvin, who ironically writes romance novels despite not understanding the women he actually interacts with, condescend one of his fans. This felt to me like Brooks, who is a man making female oriented entertainment, mocking the women who enjoy Broadcast News (1987) and Terms of Endearment which is unfair to the people coming to watch the film.\n\nHunt did charm me as a kind, relatable romantic lead who nonetheless settles for a man who is not good enough for her. She really sells the early scenes as she plays a stressed out but devoted mother struggling in her day to day life but later shifts into being an attractive, desirable woman who wants a man in her life. Of the two actors she was more deserving of her Academy Award and while I prefer the performance of Julie Christie in Afterglow (1997) I don't begrudge Hunt's win.\n\nYou should watch this film because it has it's moments but be prepared for moments that may annoy or irritate you and if you go in expecting a great romantic comedy this will not fit the bill, it's no Sleepless in Seattle (1993).",

It's parallel tracks are given equal importance with fine polishing around the edges that is decorated by the three dimensional characters that resides in this typical New York neighborhood. \n\nThe background score by Zimmer is impressive, the cinematography is decent if not extraordinary but has fine editing and camera work that is breezy and light and is uplifted by music that plays vital role in order to elevate the momentum. Nicholson is in his A game where he redefines his throne and proves why he still is the best of all and on the other end, Hunt is equally challenging and replies to his all serves with a winning shot where both of them are supported nicely by Kinnear and Gooding Jr. \n\nThe narration is elaborative and not stretchy with adaptive tone that unfortunately wears off in its latter stages as it loses its grip on settling for a mellow course. Brooks's execution is what fuels this familiar drama and offers a fresher perspective to it that is brimmed with tiny cathartic notions that are just pills for adrenaline rush to the audience. \n\nTicking for more than two hours and fixating on a singular topic, it is surprisingly intriguing enough to keep us invested in it. The dry humoristic tone of each character, the morale conflicts and their answer to it and Nicholson and Hunt's stellar performances are the high points of the feature. \n\nAs Good As It Gets is actually as good as cinema can get on terms of the craft it carries out from mundane events.",

It also has some decent laughs and some great one-liners courtesy of Mr. Nicholson. What it does lack is pace and I had largely lost interest by the mid-point. With the end ever-so-clearly in sight it just took too long to get there and I wish they'd trimmed a good 20-30 minutes of pointless fannying around as it really added nothing to the mood but frustration.",

Jack Nicholsons character (Melvin) behaves inappropriately, he is offensive, and his every good deed seems to be immediately followed by something nasty. Then the film asks you to forgive him, because it is ostensibly a mental illness that he cant control. It doesnt help that he is surrounded by kind and loving people who contrast with him so dramatically. Every time I sit down and watch As Good As It Gets I feel like I have to strain to endure certain parts because the protagonist is so vile. That being said, there are some delightful moments in this film, especially when we see slow improvement in Melvin. The scenes with the dog are all a blast, the friendship with Greg Kinnears character (Simon) flows brilliantly, and both have a satisfying payoff at the end. Where I have a hard time is watching Melvins relationship with Helen Hunts character (Carol). While there is a gradual decrease in animosity between Melvin and Simon, his interactions with Carol are almost like a roller coaster. Its up and down with no seeming progression. Its so erratic that I dont have that warm fuzzy feeling that I should have at the end of a romantic drama, but I have an uneasy feeling that Melvin is about 5 minutes away from saying something else that will ruin everything. Then I start asking myself if Carol deserves this frustrating life. It doesnt help that Jack Nicholson is clearly old enough that he should be dating Helen Hunts mother instead. Still, I can get past a lot of the odd quirks of As Good As It Gets, because there are some great scenes that remind me why Ive watched it multiple times. That doesnt change the fact that every time Im done watching this movie, I feel like I dont want to go through that all again.",

I had always considered Jack Nicholson as not too pretty of an actor. I assumed that he probably was fine and decent lookin guy when he was younger, but now he  not really a good wine by the looks. Though, the acting is still good.\nRomantic comedies are often cheesy and far from reality, and this one had quite a few moments of this sort. I especially didn't like the ending - lovely and romantic \nand... meh. \nAll in all decent movie, but wouldn't say that it was somethig very special. Nicholson was good though.",

Helen Hunt, robbed of all her Mad About You subtlety, relied on loud mouthed caricature and sweet smiles.  Greg Kinnear stared...and somehow launched an undeserved career playing quirky guys who recited lines with PEP.

Brooks, and it stars Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear in a romantic comedy about an author that is horrible to every person that he meets, whether it be a waitress with a kid that has a problem, or a gay artist, and when Melvin (Jack Nicholson) has to take care of the artist's dog, he starts to change a little. This is the first film that I've seen from James L. Brooks, which makes sense as this is one of his most highest-grossing made film, and even when watching it again, As Good as it Gets is an amazing film that never seems to get old. Jack Nicholson does a great job of being a horrible person while also being very charming at some aspects of it. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are also pretty good when trying to make the best of dealing with Jack Nicholson's character, but will say what they have to say when getting him to shut up. The writing by James L. Brooks and Mark Andrus is very naturally well done in terms of the dialogue how it just flows in with the characters, and the characters are three-dimensional, especially Jack Nicholson's character which we seen how he acts, but not why he's like that, and it's kind of done in a mysterious way that it makes me want to know a bit more about him, but is ok with what they put in there in terms of characters development. Even when it's 139 minutes long, As Good as it Gets never felt that long as I was interested in the characters and the humor that it even though it may be structurally similar, it's executed in a very refreshing way that stands out as a classic film for me to rewatch.",

Later we see him re-enter his apartment only to lock and unlock his door three times, and turn the bathroom light on and off three times before throwing a perfectly good pair of leather gloves away. His apartment is well organized, even his candy dishes are color coated and originizied by volume. Melvin is not a nice man. His OCD prevents him from using a filter when talking to stranger or people in general, and he sure can't walk on cracks! Eventually Mevlins neighbor, Simon(a superb Greg Kinnear), is robbed and left beatin and unable to take care of his dog and Melvin is forced into babysitting by Simons art dealer/business manager played Cuba Gooding Jr. The dog is a cute little fur ball that melts Melvins icing heart and gives the audience a glimpse at melvins true character. The real heart of the film however is Helen Hunt. A single mother and waitress in Manhattan who lives with her mother and ill son. Melvin has breakfast a lot at her restaurant, and always at the same time and same section. And obliviously, it's Helens section. From there the film delevops into a romantic comedy. Jack Nicholson who plays Melvin won his third Academy Award and Helen Hunt won her only for best actress. Although I contend a perfect rating for this film, I still vote Titanic best picture of 1997. What makes As good as it Gets so damn good is not just the acting or writing, but James L. Brooks direction. Every now and then a director writes or is given a script that fits what they do so well. Think ET or Raiders of the Lost Ark for Spielberg, or the Departed for Scorsese and you get the idea. Watching this film makes you think it was an effortless project, because it flows so naturely. While Terms of Endearment might be James L.Brooks masterpiece, As Good As It Gets is his swan song.",

The story is unique and interesting, complete with Oscar-winning performances by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, but I found a lot of the comedy to lie in an awkward area between serious social issues and ironic dark humor.  I don't know if it is the fault of the writers or the difficulty of writing a racist, homophobic, OCD character, but the tone of the film seems inappropriate at times.  Still, there cannot be enough praise given to the acting.  Nicholson and Hunt are magical together, to the point where the creepiness of their extreme age difference is barely an afterthought as the story progresses.  Hunt has a great crying scene, Nicholson flips out on a bunch of people, and that's what we really want out of this film.  Their chemistry is everything that you would expect from these great actors, but Greg Kinnear is a great surprise.  His emotional and unfortunate existence earned him an Oscar nomination (which will also probably be his last, due to his sour grapes toward not winning).  The film contains one of my favorite lines of all time: \"You make me want to be a better man.\"  It might not seem like much out of context, but its simplicity is perfectly matched with Nicholson's delivery in the film.  It isn't my favorite film and definitely did not deserve to beat \"Titanic\" in the 1998 Academy Awards, but \"As Good As It Gets\" is one of those films that has become a staple in the repertoire and everybody needs to see it at least once.",

But why in the world would a woman with a self observing ego and great personality want someone as horrible as Jack? That did not fly with me. By the way. Jack? Great as always.",

And it will surely join such Classics as When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle and An Affair To Remember in the hall of fame of the genre. James L. Brooks teams up legendary Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in a duo which has warmth, honesty and tenderness rolled into it. Coupled with Brooks' perfect romantic timing, use of the well chosen score and you have one of the sweetest, most sensitive and heart warming movie seen in years. As Good As It Gets was in my view robbed of the Best picture and Best Director awards at the 1997 Academy Awards by a blockbuster called Titanic. And to further validate my statement both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won respectively Best Actor and Best Actress for their performance in As Good As It Gets, NOT Leornardo Di Caprio or Kate Winslet. If you are for the over the top, over romanticized and somehow unrealistic love story then you would probably think that Titanic is better. But, if you stop and think a little, after watching As Good As It Gets then your answer may not be the same anymore. Highly Recommended!",

            "content": "As Good As It Gets is a pleasantly surprising and uplifting film with strong performances from Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson. The film is about an anti-social and obsessive compulsive novelist, Melvin Udall (Nicholson)who hates people. He's rude, offensive and unkind and certainly doesn't gain himself many fans apart from kindly waitress, Carol (Hunt) who is about the only person who can tolerate him. Melvin finds himself falling for Carol and she inspires him to want to become a better person, which for Melvin isn't easy. His first good deed includes looking after his gay neighbour, Simon's (Greg Kinnear) dog and then agreeing to help him out when he is brutally attacked. Melvin also helps Carol out by finding a good doctor for her severely asthmatic son.\r\n\r\nAs Good As It Gets is touching, witty and phenomenally acted. Jack Nicholson is simply superb in this and really shows what a versatile and talented actor he is. I've always liked Jack Nicholson, but he's really like you've never seen him before. Helen Hunt also gives an emotional, feisty and strong performance and it made me really respect her as an actress. She's always been very likeable but she's brilliant in this. Greg Kinnear also gives a decent performance.\r\n\r\nAs Good As It Gets is a rather unusual rom-com which is why I really liked this film. Melvin Udall is far from your archetypal rom-com hero; for a start he's um a bit older than your typical male lead and a jackass, but you can't help rooting for him at the same time and \"awing\" everytime he becomes a bit more human. As Good As It Gets also makes me have a bit more faith in humanity and it epitomises the idea that first impressions don't tell us everything about a person. Everyone hates Melvin, but deep down he's got a good heart but he just doesn't really know how to show that he cares. Melvin Udall is an unforgettable and intriguing character and the story is heart warming. I really recommend this and it's suitable for guys too. I should do a suitable for guys rating for every rom-com I rate. On a scale of 0-10, 0 being totally unsuitable for guys and 10 being completely suitable, I'd give it an 8!\r\n\r\nGrade: A",

            "content": "\"You make me want to be a better man.\"\n\nI finally got around to watching this touching and funny film directed by James L. Brooks that stands out thanks to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. As Good As it Gets is proof that actions are louder than words because despite how cruel and mean Nicholson's character is, he does incredible and kind things for others. In a way this film reminded me of David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook as I found both films to be difficult to follow at first due to the lack of a likable character, but once we get to know who these people are we forgive their flaws and end up routing for them. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt give excellent performances, and their Oscar wins were well deserved in my opinion. As Good As it Gets is the very definition of charm, and the screenplay written by Mark Andrus (Life As a House) shines thanks to some incredible performances. I really enjoyed this film and found myself laughing through most of the scenes. This is one more film I can eliminate from my shame list, and I'm glad I finally got to experience this romantic comedy which also has a lot to say about overcoming illness.\n\nWe are introduced to Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a cranky but successful author who suffers from OCD. He lives on his own in a beautiful apartment where he spends most of his time writing. He always goes out on his daily breakfast ritual which consists of walking to a nearby cafe without touching anyone or stepping on any cracks. He always sits in the same place at the cafe and always demands to be served by the same waitress, whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt). Carol is actually the only one in the cafe who stands his constant outbursts and cruel comments. Melvin's daily routine changes through two events that end up affecting his life. First, his homosexual artist neighbor named Simon (Greg Kinnear) suffers an accident and Melvin unwillingly accepts to take care of his dog in his absence. Second, Carol's son, Spencer (Jesse James) gets ill and she quits her job. Not accepting the fact that Carol isn't there to serve him, Melvin tries to find her in order to restore order back to his life. These series of events force Melvin to change his routine and at the same time he forms an unlikely friendship with Carol and Simon proving that he isn't as bad as he seems to be.\n\nThe performances by each one of the talented actors are the heart and motor of this film. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt share an incredible chemistry together. It's funny how despite never being able to share his feelings towards her and always saying the wrong things, it becomes clear that she does inspire him to become a better person. The supporting cast is also incredible here, especially Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver several funny scenes. I was partial to Brooks's work considering I had only seen How Do You Know which didn't work for me and Spanglish which I did enjoy, but As Good As it Gets is without a doubt his best work thanks to an unbelievable cast. This is a smart and funny film, which also could be cruel at times, but it was well balanced. Despite the schmaltzy story it still worked thanks to the characters that carried this film. It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face.",

I have to say though, I'm finding them not quite as bad as I had feared (there may be more in the future - be warned). I found this one witty, charming and over all a decent watch; although there was one minor niggles. More of that later, after this very brief summary.\n\nMelvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a writer of romantic fiction but knows very little about women. He's very misanthropic, that is to say; antisocial, unfriendly, morose, surly (take your pick). On top of that he has OCD and finds it hard to function in the outside world; stepping on cracks in the pavement is a definite no-no. He likes routine and every day he goes to a certain diner where he likes to sit in a certain seat and have the same waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), serve him. His world is turned upside down when his gay neighbour, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) is beaten up and Melvin is forced to look after his dog by Simon's friend, art dealer, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding Jr.). For some reason the dog brings out a softer side of Melvin and he begins doing things that are way out of character. He arranges a doctor for Carol's sick son, Spencer (Jesse James) and even helps Simon out when he returns from hospital. But will a road trip with Carol and Simon bring Melvin and Carol closer together? Or will his straight-talking mess things up again?\n\nVery well scripted with some really great one-liners; mostly delivered by Jack Nicholson; although there is one point where Greg Kinnear does a rather good impression. Both Jack and Helen Hunt put in great performances that were worthy of praise. My main niggle is that it is way too long; it could have easily been shortened by at least 20 minutes and that would have maybe given it a little more punch. Not that I was bored you understand, far from it, I just felt it would have benefited from being a little shorter. Enough of that; it's a very well made film with some excellent performances and a touching, well written, script. Well worth a look.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 7.7/10.\n\n\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links, trailer and BIGGER PRINT) on my blog at:\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/film-review-as-good-as-it-gets-1997.html\n\nEnjoy!... :)",

My biggest issue with this film, is that it felt like there were a lot of plot points, that were just dropped, or never wrapped up. Also it treats doctors at hospitals like idiots, her kid has asthma, lots of kids have asthma so the writers should have picked a more realistic disease.\nWhat this film does well is keep you interested and highly invested in the main character. You feel all his ups and downs, and get mad at other characters when they can't see that he is actually struggling from a mental illness, and that is why he acts the way he does.

Brooks directs As Good As It Gets, a rom-com which follows the life of Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a verbally vicious writer who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. When local waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) has to take time off work (due to her son's chronic asthma) from Melvin's favourite eating spot, Melvin's necessary routine is all but ruined with his main priority centring around getting things back to normal. Things get worse for Melvin when his neighbour, gay artist Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), ends up hospitalised, meaning Melvin is required to take care of Simon's dog Verdell. Will these new relationships change things for Melvin? He hopes not.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is filled with quick, hilarious dialogue and great character acting, but in terms of direction and writing, it is too long. With a great opening and ending, the middle third of the film, especially the segment surrounding Simon being forced to go and ask his parents for money, slows down the whole pace completely; and with a solid finish lined up at around 80-90 mintues, it seems that it just indulges itself and carries on for another hour, magically allowing each of the main characters to have moments of self-discovery.\n\nAlthough overlong, Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt rightly win Oscars for their phenomenal performances. Jack is unrelenting in his verbal attacks, completely self indulgent and utterly convincing. Helen Hunt portrays the working class single mum superbly, delivering a character that seems so knowledgeable about the world yet so frustrated with it. The pair light up the screen when acting together. Greg Kinnear also gives a solid performance, showing that he is a great character actor.\n\nPhenomenal acting performances in a film that could easily finish at 90 minutes.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7/10.",

Kinnear's character is a gay and sensitive artist who is thrown into Udal's life showing him true hurt, a common hurt.",

            "content": "An extremely memorable romantic comedy.\n\nJames L. Brooks directs As Good As It Gets, a rom-com which follows the life of Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a verbally vicious writer who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. When local waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) has to take time off work (due to her son's chronic asthma) from Melvin's favourite eating spot, Melvin's necessary routine is all but ruined with his main priority centring around getting things back to normal. Things get worse for Melvin when his neighbour, gay artist Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), ends up hospitalised, meaning Melvin is required to take care of Simon's dog Verdell. Will these new relationships change things for Melvin? He hopes not.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is filled with quick, hilarious dialogue and great character acting, but in terms of direction and writing, it is too long. With a great opening and ending, the middle third of the film, especially the segment surrounding Simon being forced to go and ask his parents for money, slows down the whole pace completely; and with a solid finish lined up at around 80-90 mintues, it seems that it just indulges itself and carries on for another hour, magically allowing each of the main characters to have moments of self-discovery.\n\nAlthough overlong, Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt rightly win Oscars for their phenomenal performances. Jack is unrelenting in his verbal attacks, completely self indulgent and utterly convincing. Helen Hunt portrays the working class single mum superbly, delivering a character that seems so knowledgeable about the world yet so frustrated with it. The pair light up the screen when acting together. Greg Kinnear also gives a solid performance, showing that he is a great character actor.\n\nPhenomenal acting performances in a film that could easily finish at 90 minutes.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7/10.",

            "content": "As Good as it Gets may appeal to the majority of the population, but I was not one of them. I found that the humour wasn't all that clever and undermined the dramatic themes it attempted to cover. The general plot tries to cram too many dynamics into 133 minutes and ends up directionless in what subplots it should emphasise, and so we end up forgetting that Jack Nicholson's character is obsessively clean and that he was kicked out of the restaurant, and it just becomes played off as if nothing happened.\nAlso, the romantic themes in As Good as it Gets are weird and inconsistent, and they don't see. All that integral to the plot and rather get thrown in there so that Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt have an excuse to kiss each other.\nAnd lastly, why did Jack Nicholson win an Oscar for this? He's done so many better performances that he hasn't won for, such as Chinatown or A Few Good Men,  yet he wins for as good as it gets. He did give a great performance, but i didn't see it as one that deserves to win an Academy Award. A nomination perhaps, but not a win.\n\nOn the plus side, the script was fairly strong and the performances from Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear were all very good. Plus, Harold Ramis and Julie Benz are featured in the cast and it's refreshing to see them.\nAnd James L. Brooks did give good direction to the actors, but I feel like he struggled to balance the comedic and dramatic themes. \nAlso, Jill the Dog was adorable and very well trained for As Good as it Gets. She basically brought a similar light to the story like Mr. Jingles did in The Green Mile, and so I enjoyed that.\n\nBut As Good as it Gets isn't a film that could have me considered as a target audience, and since it didn't appeal to me it's easy to see how far it can reach. It reached my mother, but I didn't find many reasons to keep watching other than to determine a rating.",

Evidently enough they all come together, in none other than a road trip. This is the main problem of this film, it's all so obvious. Just from the opening fifteen minutes and the poster I knew where this was heading. Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars for there performance, and as expected they do there jobs well. The screenplay has plenty of good quotes that are shot at you one after another. I still had many questions about Melvin after this was done though. Was he always like this, is Carol his first love, why does he have a need to act mean? None of these are answered, and while I understand why many find this touching, I didn't get enough out of it. I'm sure romance fans are on there knees when they watch this, but it felt predictable for me.",

Jack Nicholson plays an obsessive-compulsive writer who hates everything around him, until he interacts closely with the dog of a gay artist neighbour (Greg Kinnear). Then he starts to become fond of a waitress (Helen Hunt) at the restaurant he tortures with his presence. Predictable, WAY overlong movie that is essentially a \"chick flick\" in disguise. Nicholson, who worked with director James L. Brooks in \"Term of Endearment\" with much better Oscar winning performance, can't save this generally hammy movie. The dialogue, characters, story, and script are very mediocre and I generally wanted this production to end so badly. That is now three Best Actress winning performances, in this case being Hunt, I have seen in a row that did not deserve those accolades (the other two were \"Coming Home\" in 1978 for Jane Fonda and \"Kitty Foyle\" in 1940 for Ginger Rogers). What is wrong with the Academy Awards? It is like they have particularly bad tastes for those they feel deserve the Best Actress award. Such an annoying love story!",

Sure, characters need to develop, and they as prescribed by Hollywood scriptwriter handbooks. But not to the extend that a warm relationship develops between two people who are so unsimilar as Melvin and Carol. It seems like the producer of the film demanded a happy ending.",

Brooks knows what angles to use to express feelings and maintain a mood. It moves at the right pace, never rushing through sentimental moments with pin point timing. \n\nIn the final act it does try too hard to stick to the romantic formula, throwing the rest of the plot (and reason) out of the way to reach a sweet ending. I guess films like this have to end a certain way, so it isn't really an issue. It's a shame the build up to the end is slightly rocky. \n\nI could watch As Good As It Gets again... and again... and again. I'd probably find something new to appreciate each time.
