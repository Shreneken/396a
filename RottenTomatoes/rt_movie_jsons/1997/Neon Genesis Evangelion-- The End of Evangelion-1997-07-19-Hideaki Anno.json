Its the story of a young man who takes on the responsibilities of saving the world and has to deal with the consequences of not trusting people.\n\nOf not letting them in\n\nIf I go into massive amounts of detail here, it would ruin the impact of this story and its far more worth it to experience the series in its entirety\n\nSo I suggest you watch the TV series, the last 2 episodes and then this movie, back to back as much as you can.\n\nRemembering one thing about all the characters you're seeing and loving.\n\nThey are liars and they ALL hate themselves on some level. Don't trust what they TELL YOU, trust what they SHOW YOU in their actions.\n\nBy doing that, when you get to the pivotal scene of \"help me\" you'll begin to understand what is going on.\n\nPray for the poor people who suffer like these souls. And trust they'll be okay if you reach out to them.\n\nOn its own, End of Evangelion gives to the fanbase every tiny little bit of what it wanted, it isn't what we THOUGHT want wanted, but its what we wanted.\n\nAnd you should listen to what Rei is saying...and then realise that she's not just saying it to Shinji, she's saying it to EVERYONE - including you.\n\nI have to walk back a worlds worth of bile and hatred of Hideki Anno for the things that I said about the Rebuilds, the man is not a hack or a fool.\n\nHe's always been a tortured genius Watch his work. Love it and spread the message he's giving.",

            "content": "The \"end.\"  I seriously doubt I can recap an entire complex television series in a concise plot synopsis, so let me just say that this is the ending to the anime for the fans that were not satiated by the final two episodes.  Now with this one, I will try to avoid going into extensive specifics regarding what this is about because I don't feel like it would be a great use of everyone's time.  It's a stupendous show that you should watch even if you don't have a background in anime.  There is mystery and intrigue around every story turn, and when you combine that with colossal robots, monsters, and fantastic production values, you've got yourself quite a show.  Now that I've finally wrapped the series, I'll be taking on the movies, which has always been a point of confusion for me.  My good friend has been walking me through the episodes every step of the way, and even after multiple conversations, I still don't think I will have a chronological grasp on the movies until I actually watch them.  If they are at all close in quality to this movie here, then I've got a lot to look forward to.  An interesting point of this movie is that it only exists because creator Hideaki Anno essentially got bullied into making it.  This doesn't spoil much, but the last two episodes of the series drop the main running story and opt to get completely introspective.  While I didn't mind them going that route, I understood why fans were upset about it.  That's not to justify the death threats that Anno received, I'm just saying that I get it.  As far as the actual movie goes, this is basically two extended episodes combined into one, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that there are credits at the midpoint, which is not something I've seen before (unless you're counting Drive my Car).  The first half is truly something else.  I'm having difficulty referencing a movie that has more feel-bad action than the first half that this movie pulls off.  It's an outnumbered siege situation, and casualties are happening left and right on both sides.  This makes it so that while the smooth action is as jaw-dropping as it has ever been in this entire series, you can't relish in it because it immediately slams you back down to Earth with a gut punch.  The second half of this movie gets back to the metaphysical, which stays more in step with the controversial last two episodes of the series.  If that's what you're here for, great.  Personally, I felt like the second half would pair better with a Wikipedia article, but it does get by on the strength of its visuals, which are nothing short of stunning.  This is absolutely not for outsiders.  I don't know why you would, but if you're trying to watch this without having first experienced the series, you will be like a child lost in a shopping mall (back when malls were still a thing).  This is strictly for the fans of the series, and it does not disappoint.  It's a bit difficult for me to rate because it feels like I'm grading the entire series as opposed to a standalone movie.  I may come back and change my rating later if I feel so inclined, but as it stands, this is a highly satisfying conclusion that will both answer burning questions and raise new ones.",

Even Rei Ayanami has less personality than in the series, being reduced to an object.

It was worth any wait.\n\nThose not familiar with the series will have no clue what's happening, so you should at least watch the first 24 episodes. End of Eva takes place as an alternative to the last 25 and 26th episodes. It may sound confusing, but trust me, if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything makes sense...even if not right away.\n\nThe final Angel has been killed. The 'hero' of the story, Shinji Ikari, now regrets doing it, as he was the only person who seemed to ever like him for who he was. But there is no time to lament on personal demons, as the shadowy puppet masters in SEELE have set the final stage of their plan in motion.\n\nThe dreaded Third Impact.\n\nWhat's even more surprising is that the entire series shows one, giant plan to actually SPEED ALONG the Third Impact, as it could lead Humanity to it's next evolutionary step.\n\nAnd so, Humanity will now rely on a weak savior who may or may not lead humanity to it's oblivion. A hero who must first fight his own inner dragons, and come to terms with life, and love from himself and from others.\n\nAs a response to the public outcry that the last 2 episodes were someone strange and had no \"Mecha Combat\", the End of Eva has enough of both combat, AND philosophical scenes. A strange, but wonderful mix.\n\nAsuka's fight against 9 Evas is absolutely the most STUNNING visual fight sequence I have ever seen. The energy and awesome scope of the battle is impossible to convey through words alone.\n\nThough Asuka's character is as flawed as Shinji's, she finds redemption in this movie. Again, an amazing testimony of the Human Spirit and our will to live.\n\nThe emotional impact of this movie is also quite amazing. It brings reality and the mind to question, and asks us if being individuals is better than being a whole. Is life just a dream, and can we ever be Gods of our own Reality? Those who have watched the last two episodes of the series will see instances where the movie and episodes combine and compliment each other.\n\nFinally, the animation is wonderful. Creepy and breathtaking. Powerfully deep, but also amazing on the physical conflict level as well. This movie is EASILY a match for Akira and is an instant classic.\n\nWatch it with an open mind, and be prepared to be stunned. Be ready to question yourself. Be ready to use your mind in ways you may have not before. This is truly the End, and I wouldn't want it any other way.",

It looks cleaner and way more polished. It's beautiful, and kinetically stylized! It also starts out notably dark with the infiltration of NERV. A lot more bloodier and violent as well. But it makes sense since it's the End of Evangelion. \n\nOmg the A.T. fields that protect the Eva's and Angels are actually a loved ones spirit that is shielding them! In the case of Shinji and Asuka, it's their deceased mother's soul who has inhabited their Eva's. That's beautifully poetic. Holy shit that introduction of the 9 white Eva's was incredible. They look really deadly! \n\nOne of the most exciting and thrilling anime's I've ever watched with some of the most brilliant animations. Some of its premise is very fucking weird but it also makes for some very intriguing and original material to watch. The imagery in this movie is much more ominous and darker than the show. The themes can be somewhat depressing especially towards the end of the series and especially during the movie, as it dwells a lot on loneliness and isolation from others. It makes sense when you realize that the director was battling with depression throughout the making of it. He read a book on depression that changed his outlook and is the reason why the anime took such a weird turn during the last couple of episodes. But overall, I thought it was one of the most visually dazzling and kinetic anime's I've ever seen. With some of the most brilliant and original ideas about the human self I've ever seen an anime tackle. Evangelion is an anime that is in a league of its own. This is definitely worth watching!",

It was too torturous, they ruined her eye and her Eva REALLY BADLY and Shinji just got even more hateful by going crazy, crying, and even choking her at the end (gladly, she didn't die).\n\nI do not get the hype for this. The movie is boring. Asuka is what made the series better, I would've got bored and I did skip the episodes if she wasn't in them. So, I guess I do not get this movie or maybe I have to watch the series again.\n\nSo, now we got to suffer an hour of Shinji's pansy butt. Like in the series, he did get more likable towards the end when we learn about his past. I did like Misato more, too. Rei had a more decent ark, but I don't like the end of the world thing at the end. No one else I really could care much for.\n\nThis movie was just creepy and violent. I was thinking that this would be a great film but it was just very over-hyped. This movie just had me screaming at the computer through. The characters are quite different, Asuka is worrying about her mother and I was wondering if like I heard, it may be because her mother's soul was there or she was just relying on her to try her best to get through this hard battle but she had a really evil face on sometimes during the battle, I understand that this type of facial expression was new for its time but it still looked too evil. Misato seemed to have been in love with Shinji, she might've been this way in the series, too. And I don't understand Rei's arc of being above the world while it was destroyed.\n\nI also did not like the new facial expressions for Asuka representing the scenes in the anime like when she wakes Shinji up, she's now more scary and hateful than she was likable and funny.\n\nI also do not like the live-action combination in this, even though it did have a good message about reality in dreams.\n\nThe jazzy song at the end of the first half was okay but it was smoother than Fly Me To The Moon.\n\nGladly, it did not have Hikari in it but it still could do better than this.",

My only lesson learned from this film is that you should approach a high concept series full of existentialist, religious, and philosophical implications, from its base, not from its top.

            "content": "Even with the absurd amount of hype I had for this film, nothing can adequately prepare you for what you are about to witness as it is completely unpredictable. I try to go into every film without any expectations but after everything that I've heard about this, it was quite hard not to go in with expectations. Saying that, The End of Evangelion is a rather unsettling experience that never lets up all the way until the final scene.\n\nIt's quite hard to review something like this, I've been thinking about this for a long time and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to write anything. It isn't as simple as sitting down for 90 minutes and writing about what you saw, objectively. This film is more about how you interpret it for yourself and coming to your own conclusions for what it all means, very much of it I think I understand but some other parts just mystify me. \n\nAt the end of episode 24 of the anime they show clips from this, so that means that they were working on this for well over 2 years and it really does show. The animation is absolutely beautiful and it is very smooth, the action is exhilarating and the imagery that appears near the end is unforgettable. I very much like that it is technically split into two halves one as it does keep it the same as the anime but it flows like a film because of the extended length of the halves. It doesn't at all feel like something that should have gone to TV. Both parts are directed perfectly and it is seamless but it's only fitting to have Anno direct part II. The credits are in the middle and it's like a warning, a warning to the audience to leave now because everything after that point just goes south fast. \n\nAs harsh as this sounds, I'm glad this ran into problems when this was intended for broadcast on the TV, only because I feel like if it was allowed, a lot of what made this what it is would most definitely have been taken out and it would have in turn, dampened the impact. While I don't hate the ending of the anime and you could say both endings happened in one way or another, this certainly has a lot more weight to it and is most definitely more memorable and fits better with the dark tone of the series. The scenes toward the end are so vivid and visceral that I don't think any of it would be allowed to be broadcast and the anime already pushed a few boundaries as it is. Of course, however, if this was left on TV it's not like we'd notice any difference because we wouldn't have anything else to compare it to. However, it does feel like something that belongs in a film and the budget problems that plagued the series and it's finale are nowhere to be seen here and once again, the animation shines. They did an amazing job with what they had in the series and this is just brilliant.\n\nShinji Ikari still remains one of the most fascinating characters I think I've ever seen. I kept waiting for that pivotal moment in the anime where his character would develop into someone that isn't as afraid anymore but after talking with a friend, I just came to the realisation that, that was never going to happen. It's so strange to see a character in a work of fiction who is the same at the end as he was in the beginning and you could even argue that he is worse in the end of this. It might end up being annoying to some that while he has plenty of development, he doesn't really change but life doesn't alway work out in a nice 3 act structure of people overcoming their fears, sometimes it doesn't happen. Sometimes he's annoying, sometimes he's infuriating, sometimes he's likeable, sometimes he's not, he's just a fantastic character. I don't think we're supposed to like him 100% of the time and while that can be a problem of storytelling, wherein, if the main character isn't likeable then the show becomes annoying, I do think it works well with this series and gives it a whole new dimension and any character that has me yelling at the screen has to be doing something right. And to be honest, I see part of myself in Shinji, I've been like he has before, not as bad as he has but there are definitely some parts that ring home and it only makes it all the more relevant and probably a reason why I like him more than most do. When I say that him not changing is a good thing, I'm not trying to make excuses for a bad character and say that it's really deep because it's unique that he doesn't change because it isn't like that, you'd need to watch the entire series to understand fully what I mean. The rest of the characters still remain as brilliantly written as ever and all the original voice actors return.\n\nIf I have to find any complaint at all its that I think some scenes could have benefited with less music being played in the background and just let the sound effects of the scene set the mood, instead of being told what to feel by the blaring music in the background. Also, I got a little bored in the live action parts of the film, I understand their point and why they are there, it just took me out of the experience for a little bit, but now I see where MGS 2 got a little inspiration. Saying that, these aren't a big enough negative to take away any of the impact that this film holds. \n\nThis review took a long time to write and it's probably one of the reviews I've agonised over the most. The longer I sit here and think about this film and the anime, the greater it gets. It really isn't hard to see why this series has been as influential as it has been and there is nothing else quite like it. The End of Evangelion is a shocking, emotionally devastating experience with some of the most creative animation I think I've ever seen. It asks plenty of questions, leaves many things up in the air for a long time and explains very little of it (if at all) and just ends, that might be annoying to some but I think it's fantastic. And it'll probably take a few more watches, of both anime and film, to piece it all together and understand it all because of reveals that happen in both anime and film. There was nothing like it before and there probably won't be ever again. It's amazing. Oh, and just because for a joke, 2deep4u... Hopefully someone gets that. Haha.",

Goes as much deeper in the human existence subject as well as offering a more climatic, convincing ending to one of the best animes ever made.\r\n\r\nWhile the ending of the series managed to close circles with character Shinji, the rest was left out. How did the Instrumentality happen? What could happen next? What the fuck was happening? All answers are here, in The End of Evangelion. The story centers around an overly depressed Shinji, and how his desires, hatred, and all kinds of emotions ultimately has consequences in what could be the World's End (and with it, our possible rebirth) or the future of humanity. The movie has great animation, amazing visuals, great shots and all kinds of cryptic and symbolical sequences that not every person will understand. That's the issue with many people in this movie, they don't get anything of what's going on. Well, of course you have to watch the entire series to understand and have an eye and mind for symbolism and religion.\r\n\r\nThis movie has many things that make it work: the ambientation gives the feeling that the end is near, and somehow, we are there. And also, we know is coming, it could happen any time, by any cirmustance. The movie has a very climatic, emotional and character circles coming to close scene, were we see all humans dying and transforming into one sole being. The movie is fantastic. The music and songs just fits so perfectly, and the sequences and dialogue are so intriguing that it's impossible to forget this movie. This is a perfect ending for a great anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion; it closes everything and also leaves a huge space for interpretation, such like the final scene:\r\n\r\nShinji is alone in a red beach, full of LCL (the human being without soul or form) with Asuka, the girl he constantly pleeded for. Shinji sees a ghostly Rei (like in the first episode of the series) that suddenly dissapears. The he sees Asuka, wounded but apparently fine. And then...he strangles her. This in order to prove \"a human emotion\", to prove that both are separated from the united existence of the humans (turned into LCL); by Asuka rejecting Shinji, like she always do. However, instead, she caresses his face. The last line is by her words: \"How disgusting\". And the story of Evangelion ends.\r\n\r\nWow, now that's and ending only a true fan could understand and be OK with. A nearly-perfect ending that satysfies. Ultimately the point of this ending is not let the ending as it was written, instead give a solid basis for the fans to create their own conclusions: there's no concrete ending for this story, it depends on the fan, he or she can interpretate it the way they want; if it's a happy ending, a sad one, a mystical one, or every kind of finale you can think, it depends on you. I thought that was very ingenious, that way everyone can have the ending they want. It's confusing, but not for me, i know every scene, every line, leads to the perfect finale of a perfect series. Probably the deepest movie i have watched.\r\n\r\nWhat the Fuck did Gendo say before killing Ritsuko? Did the audio cut out?",

            "content": "Now, before I even bother to write this review I'd like to address what at least some of you are thinking. 'Why the hell is there 5 stars next to an anime on your list?' And not just an anime either, is what I'd reaffirm for you, but the movie ending of an anime series. Heresy, right? Well... Probably. But here's the thing. Very few movies can match this opus visually, tonally, atmospherically, or in character. For the ambition of this project and bravery of the director alone this should get five stars.\n\nTo explain what makes this film so special requires me to go into moderate, to in-depth detail about the television series and subsequently this movie. Because this is unavoidable, this review will completely disregard any attempt to avoid spoilers. So if you haven't seen the television series and this film, please just stop here, go rent it or whatever and watch. The rest of you, please carry on.\n\nNow, if my warning was heeded, this review should really only be being read by people who've seen the film and thus one would imagine would be completely aware of what Neon Genesis Evangelion is, but bear with me while I scribble this little introduction and synopsis anyway. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a 26 episode anime released in the mid-90s by Gainex studio. Directed by Hideaki Anno, who subsequently moved on after Evangelion to direct live action cinema, Evangelion will be remember by many anime historians, should there be such a thing, as a revolution. The series fearlessly tackled with issues of existentialism, identity, depression, faith, religion, alienation, and sexuality amongst other things, and here's the important bit, it did so through the lens of the genre. Evangelion didn't shy away from giant robots, hypersexualised females and whacky Japanese humour; in fact, it downright embraces the conventions expected of anime. And this leaves us with something one couldn't expect. An oddity, a bizarre amalgamation of everything distinctly pulp, which one will typically scoff at, with this genuine exploration of the human condition- a feat 'real cinema' should always aspire to. And there's more.\n\nSome have suggested Evangelion wasn't always intended to be what it was. Gainax, the studio behind the development, was close to sinking under a tidal wave of financial problems at the time, and slowly but surely they began chopping Evangelion's budget until it was close to nonexistent. To add to the difficulties of the production, the writer-director, Hideaki Anno, was struck by a black depression, a darkness which is known to have consumed him during the production. It is said the combination of the budget cuts and the dejection Anno was experiencing forced the series in a much starker, more experimental, direction. The first few episodes of the series contain no hint of the bleak tone that permeates the conclusion of the series. But it is in this perhaps unprecedented shift in tone that the luster lies. One grows to have certain expectation from any genre, and Evangelion at the beginning fits the mould of an anime perfectly. We have big robots, sexualised females, an unwilling 14 year old boy and a quest to save the city. So as the pace of the episodes begins to slow, and we are presented with internal monologues, characters questioning their existence, metaphysical symbolism, and suddenly we're being asked to no longer think of these behemoth robots as mere fighting tools, but as a metaphorical representation of the characters' will and the impending doom is no longer odd looking aliens, but trials the teenagers face in their lives we are flung. We become invested. Which of course only makes it harder to accept the inevitable, as the characters fall into what becomes more and more obviously a hopeless end. Or does it? We reach episodes 25 and 26, the most surrealist and experimental episodes of the series, to be left only with ambiguity. Did the kids survive? Was the world saved? It's all left to interpretation. \n\nNow all of that is an examination on a thematic level. I haven't even bothered to write about how the score is unrivalled in terms of anime, how the character designs have become iconic, how beautiful the animation is, how Anno creates a genuinely intriguing mystery, or how the action scenes ramp up the tension to unbearable heights. Mainly because without the thematic depths, these aspects would just make it a brilliant anime. And that would not be what it in fact is- which is a film worthy of five stars. Now I know some of you may still think it's a cheat, because let's face it, I'm basically reviewing this as an extension of the TV series rather than a stand alone film. So anyone criticising my review on that basis, I will yield and hold my hands up. Ignoring that, I stand by everything I've written!\n\nNow onto the actual film. The End of Evangelion. The film as you're all no doubt aware is split very clearly into two halves. But before we delve into that, let's discuss how the film came into existence in the first place. So it's now 1997, a year and a bit after the last episode of the series has aired in Japan. The series has rescued Gainax (and has provided quite the cash cow even until this day, with a 'retelling' of the series receiving a 4 film theatrical release internationally) and proven a huge hit. Happy ending for Anno? No. Although Evangelion prove itself critically and commercially, fans were outraged at the ending. Gainax was inundated with complaints from furious fans demanding a 'proper' ending, and Anno himself received countless death threats. Seems anime fans weren't too appreciative of surrealism. For whatever reason, the unreasonable demands were met. Perhaps Anno relented or perhaps Gainax saw a great opportunity to milk the cow that secreted gold. Either way, 'The End of Evangelion' was commissioned and released. Not only this, but it took into account the fans complaints. Not enough action? That'll be remedied. More 'fan service' (an odious addition in anime catering to the otaku among viewers... Look it up)? Sure thing.\n\nThe first half of The End of Evangelion culminates in the massacre of the entire cast, whilst the main character, 14 year old Shinji, whom fans should have grown to care for, masturbates over the comatose naked body of Asuka, his 14 year old friend. Careful what you wish for, I guess. If anywhere else in cinema a director has been as brazen in his contempt for his fan-base I'm unaware of it. This description may make the film sound reactionary and artless, but quite in fact everything that happens seems to merely present the ending of the TV series in a more literal manner. The only difference is, where there was some ambiguity left in the final scenes of the series, here all hope is removed. The melancholy is relentless. The effect of this ending remains with me to this day, 10 years after first seeing it- the emotions it evoked as fresh on reflection as they were on first viewing. The second half of the film becomes hallucinogenic. The direction becomes deconstructionist, literally erasing layer after layer of animation until we have reverted to the beginning of the process, which has a powerful impact considering the events taking place. There is no longer any artifice or veneer, the viewer is seeing the half-formed mess at the core of Shinji's soul, his true will and all of the ambivalence he feels. The film finishes, as a last middle finger to the fans, as unknowable as the television series, but with a much more melancholic, despairing shade.\n\nAnd that's it. The End Of Evangelion and why it is nothing short of brilliant. I've specifically avoided any real interpretation, because as a true Evangelion fan, I know how subjective and meaningful each person's individual take is.",

Concluding a fairly straightforward series on a mind-blowing, provocative and insightful note, \"The End of Evangelion\" leaves the viewer mentally and emotionally decomposed, as well as pleasantly disappointed by its lack of closure. In addition to visual extravagance and overwhelming writing, the film will undoubtedly leave behind an overflow of replay and discussion value, and so it is advised that one should view this film immediately after completing the series, and with at least one friend.",

They protect Tokyo from mysterious creatures known as the Angels, whose purpose for attacking the city have been, up until this movie, purported to be the destruction of humankind. \nMy synopsis is greatly oversimplified. The series has a deep, multilayered plot with Freudian and religious symbols strewn throughout. The characters are fleshed out almost too much; we frequently see the turmoil going on inside the main character's head as exposition.\nThis film revolves around the theme of human nature. All of the characters' deepest and darkest desires and compulsions are explored in ways not usually seen in animated films. Because of this, there is a lot of disturbing imagery. The apocalyptic events portrayed in the film complement the characters' heart-wrenching struggles as their sins, neuroses and shortcomings are laid bare. And there's plenty of fantasy action to make up for the more understated scenes that take place in the characters' minds.\nMoviegoers not familiar with the original TV show may not appreciate this film, as it relies on a load of foreknowledge about the technobabble and situations. The visualizations, however are striking enough by themselves to be lauded for ingenuity. I fall short in being able to convey the power of these visuals. The director even sneaks in seconds of footage containing images of letters written to him by disgruntled fans. I believe the best way to describe the visuals is post-modern.\nThe music, by Shiro Sagisu is powerful, and it was nominated for several awards in Japan. The soundtrack as a stand-alone CD is fresh and exciting as well.\nAccording to the amazon.com descriptions of the DVD, this film has been rated NC-17 (sometimes \"unrated\") because of sexual situations involving 14-year-olds and graphic violence. This is not a \"cartoon\" in the traditional sense. Adults I know who have seen this film have admitted to me that they were a bit disturbed by the movie. It is a troubling, perhaps cynical, view of mankind and its future portrayed through animation. It is by no means preachy, though. I advise moviegoers to avoid this movie if they might be offended by graphic sexual scenes, twisted portrayals of Judeo-Christian symbols and gory battles. Otherwise, it's a movie experience like no other I've ever seen. 4/5 stars.",

            "content": "Even the DVD Menu Is Seriously Weird  \r\n\r\nLast night, I was discussing anime with a friend.  She says she likes the kind where all the main characters have something seriously wrong in their minds, so I assume she's a fan of [i]Eva[/i].  But anyway, we were observing how anime theme songs never, ever seem to connect to the actual tone and action of the show they're about.  I mean, [i]Ranma 1/2[/i] has the \"yapapa!\" song, which is at least cheerful and silly, but mostly, it seems that theme songs are chosen at random.  They're also usually love songs of some sort, even if there isn't much in the way of romance to the story or if what romance there is fails to be the primary focus of the show.  And then today, I was watching this, and the theme music seems to imply that this is a very different kind of anime than it is.  It can be argued that the theme of [i]Eva[/i] is Shinji's becoming a man, but not in the sense the theme music implies.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternate ending to the TV show and therefore makes only limited sense, especially as a stand-alone movie.  Broadly speaking, this is the last days of humanity.  The Angels have all been defeated, but there is still a threat.  The mysterious organizations which control the world in this story are now at war with one another, and poor Shinji Ikari must somehow once again be the last hope of humanity.  Except this may turn out to mean that he has to help humanity give up its corporeal forms and become something altogether different.  NERV headquarters is under attack, and one by one, all the people Shinji has come to love are dying.  As always, whatever answers there are to be found are in Shinji's own head, and Shinji doesn't want anything to do with it.  However, no one else can possibly do what needs to be done, though Asuka gives it her level best, finally coming to terms with her own personal demons in the process.  Then again, she's always been stronger than Shinji.\r\n\r\nThe world of [i]Evangelion[/i] is a dark and complicated one.  It doesn't propose to answer any deep philosophical questions; one character asks if they are doing the right thing in helping Shinji, and her superior says, \"How should I know?\"  They think they're doing what's best, probably, but they have no real way of knowing until they see what the results are.  Pretty much all the characters in the series, except those members of those shadowy cabals, are flying blind.  Few of them have any idea what the long-term results of their actions will be.  They are all just hoping that it will be what's right, but few if any of them have enough information to be sure of it.  It was much easier when they were fighting Angels; a giant mysterious creature taking out entire cities is not a philosophically complicated enemy.  There is no doubt there about whether it's right or wrong.  It's attacking, and you defend.  But helping humanity to overcome the tyranny of flesh?  That's a bit trickier.\r\n\r\nShinji is afraid that everything he does hurts people, and so he would rather just not do anything.  It's not an uncommon philosophy, for all that, and it's not hard to see how he reached that point.  It's not made clear, but Shinji has not had a pleasant time of it of late.  Yes, he's probably saved untold lives, but it isn't healthy for the people around him.  It's not his fault, not mostly, but he can't help seeing it as such.  If he were better, stronger, smarter, faster--if he were the son his father wants.  But his father is evil, one of those shadowy sorts, and so you don't really want to be the kind of son he wants.  So Shinji is torn, and the world is collapsing around him.  He is not a happy person, and he misses the quiet innocence he was able to have before he got caught up in the whole thing.  He gets called a wimp, but I really do think he's a sympathetic character if you try to see the world from his perspective.  I don't think most of us would do much better, when it comes to that.\r\n\r\nThe world of [i]Evangelion[/i] is not one of those fictional worlds you'd like to live in.  It is a world of confusion, pain, and doubt, a world where God has abandoned His creation.  I'm not sure there's any character in it I would want to be, even leaving aside the various ends they come to.  This is one of those rare stories where backstory equals showing gaping psychological wounds, and I've got enough of those of my own to want to take on those of a fictional character.  Each one, at the end, faces a demon and either takes it in or finally overcomes it, but the point is that they all had demons in there to face or overcome in the first place.  In fact, I think that the implication is that it's that very psychological scar tissue which shapes the world, which in fact makes us human.  However, the movie doesn't come down on the idea of whether being human is a good thing or not.  There might be something better beyond humanity, but the only way to find that out is to pass through, which might be terrible.",

Whereas the final episodes of the show were abstract and elusive, submerging completely into Shinji's shattered psyche, the film focuses on the external world, intense and at times sickening, while remaining abstract and elusive. The entire first half is so fun to watch, especially Asaka's glorious bloodbath, you almost forget it's both visually and psychologically horrific.

Also, it is visually stunning, with some amazing animation. However, that doesn't keep it from being the most perplexing and surreal piece of cinematography that I have ever witnessed. The first half of the film is fairly standard storytelling, apart from some lengthy monologues by Misato to Shinji. There are some really cool action sequences, and the usual religious symbolism, but I still can't help but feel that Anno was trying to screw over his fans with the second half. For the most part the second half of the movie is just a higher-budget remake of episode 26. Some of the things that the characters say are far beyond what most people, not just fans, will be able to absorb without re-watching it three or four more times. At one point, it cuts into some live action shots, including one segment with a crowd at a movie theater. Also, I have heard that there are debates over what the final scene even means! If you can catch all of the narrative curve-balls, this movie should be a good watch, but I still can't shake the feeling that Anno is metaphorically raping all the characters, and even making fun of his fans.",

This is a nasty, mean-spirited, narcissistic, gloomy, and downright depressing film, with characters dying left and right and an even more unstable focus than even the original final two episodes.  The film turns even more incoherent in its last half hour, which devolves into looped live-action footage, flickering screencaps from episodes, monologues, hateful verbal attacks, and flash-cuts of graphic images.  While this latter half makes for an interesting artistic style, it gets in the way of both the storytelling and even fails to provide a satisfying conclusion.

He simply sits around, wallowing in self-pity, whining and angsting while his friends disappear right before his eyes.  I don't know if this film is a case of director Hideaki Anno exorcising his personal demons or making a vicious attack against the world, but either way, THE END OF EVANGELION is very unpleasant, chaotic and confusing throughout.

When I saw this anime, my whole life exploded. By the plot, I mean, humans are fighting and killing themselves (nothing new to me, since we are ANIMALS), but killing themselves for 2 EVAS? Come on! Machines are machines, and without us, they cannot think or move! Anyway, the ending? Quite good actually. Some stars for it's confusing story-telling.\n\nMusic: Dramatic, intense, beautiful, charming, estresico, magnifico, the music at the end was so BRUTAL/emotional, I must say, it almost made me cry, but it didn't, sorry folks. Some stars here too.\n\nTo end this short review, 3 and a half stars of 5. I wish it was like PAPRIKA or SERIAL EXPERIMENTS, or even PARANOIA AGENT, or yeah, INCEPTION, but it wasn't. So, enjoy my review and bless does souls people! LOVE YA ANGELS (and not so angels too).\n\n*Analysis 2013, January 10 - BEWARE OF SPOILERS*: I re-watched the movie after re-watching the 26 episodes of the anime (I stop being confusing at last since now I get everything of it, not like my past review that I was a bit ignorant, some still are but not me at last and it's serious). The first ending (between episodes 25 & 26) are Shinji's mind, understanding in a psychological way the humans, why his father made copies of his own wife, extracting parts of the 1st Angel and also wanting a normal life without EVAS (the Eva extracted of Adan, even if we know she is a second copy of the 1st one. Read the new version of the Bible, it's amazing literature! Yes, the humans created the religion, didn't you know that already? It's not perfect neither us). After seeing the episodes, and you see this movie (don't forget Shinji was in a place that we call Psychiatric, where they attend cases of depression and other motives to be with a low self-esteem.  Because of that, the movie continues where it was left out. The boy did not had a normal life as does two final episodes wanted you to believe, it had a tragic one). Finishing my analysis I came to one conclusion only: He and Rei are the beginning of the Earth once more, the Adan & Eve.",

Not to say that the animated episodes were bad or anything, but although it provided excellent details on characters and their development it left us waiting for what actually happened in the real world.\n\nEnd of Evangelion though mainly focuses on the real world and what is happening in terms of Seele and Nerv. The three children take a backseat in terms of the story for awhile due to events that occurred prior to the start of the movie (before episode 24 in the anime).  However as if to provide some evangelion action, all three do get into some sort of action with their Evas and my favorite character even gets to let loose and let go. The battle animations were fluid, suspenseful, gripping, and action packed.  Certainly something to die for.\n\nThough as if driven by a need to cut costs from the use of such intense battles, a bit of the movie though goes into the realm of dreams and psychology.  I have to admit that at times what the characters say and think is something otherworldly. Though in reflection it makes sense as it seems to be statements made on the reflection of the characters on their life, the meaning that they found in their life, and truly making an attempt to accomplish and achieve that which they want.  After enduring the moments that require some concentration the movie brings it back with some excellent action and a thrilling finale. Though with the costs in mind the movie ends rather abruptly.\n\nCertainly it is a movie that deserves to be checked out and should prepare people well for when Evangelion 4.0 comes out to presumably close out the entire series in the way that it needs to be done.  Though this movie certainly closes it well too.",

Outside of Miyazaki movies and faint memories of DBZ on Toonami, I have never been a big anime fan. I had heard a lot about Evangelion over the course of a few years and one day on a whim I threw it on my Netflix queue. Little did I know that I was about to begin watching what could possibly be the best TV series of all time. The story of Evangelion boils down to a young boy's journey as Earth's savior. The show starts out as an often humorous and action packed show about robot's fighting monsters (referred to as angels) and then turns into a deeply spiritual and psychological show when we see the mental processes of one person literally absorbing the psyche of the entire human race and becoming a sort of god who has to choose the fate of humanity (this movie serves as a recap of the mental process covered in the series as well as a window into what happens to earth physically as all of this is going on. It also covers humanities eventual fate, something that is distinctly not clear in the actual series finale). So while the majority of anime still sits besides a line of nerdiness/badness I wish to never cross, Neon Genesis Evangelion changed my perception on the genre completely.Check it out, it could seriously change your life.",

This is the most creative way to end up a TV series I've ever seen and yes you should watch the show, which is only a short 24 episodes, and the first movie, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth, before watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThere is no possible way to give a description about the story because it is WAY too complicated and anything I could say would probably be a spoiler so I'll start with character development. Each character is developed perfectly and this movie doesn't have that much dialogue.  The biggest piece that stuck out to me was how a lot of the character's strove for redemption. Lots of them, including Gendo, Shinji and Asuka, had minor goals that either related to the main plot or were some personal mental insecurity that needed to be fixed.  To me that marked a character being fully developed having completed a  *life goal* or fixing a flaw in their behavior.  It was just beautiful to see on screen how almost all characters were important.\r\n\r\nThe action was also amazing in The End of Evangelion.  There were only a few brief clips throughout, but there was one part in particular that was breath taking.  you could feel the character's pain as he/she battled on against  a large number of foes.\r\n\r\nThe action however was not the focus of this movie, the symbolism and drama were.  Honestly this movie felt like an animated David Lynch movie were symbolic scenes took up most of the movie.  It was very cool to see and it provides great re-watchability. You can pick out something new every time.  The next big thing this movie had going for it was the disturbing drama, and when I say disturbing I mean disturbing.  Lots of the main characters and even the real story behind this movie are just messed up this is by no means a *happy movie*.  There are lots of moments with grotesque violence and there is a good question asked to the audience that I won't write out because it's a spoiler.\r\n\r\nIn any case this is a great great great great movie and everyone should probably at least see it once, After Watching The Show! The End of Evangelion takes bold steps even some live action movies are scared of taking and it definitely stands it's ground when compared to something like say the Dark Knight. In all the End of Evangelion is a brilliant masterpiece of a movie and should be up there with  Miyazaki films as the greatest animated movies of all time.",

            "content": "[i]Neon Genesis Evangelion[/i] was a popular Japanese anime series that ran for 26 episodes, but fans of the show did not respond well to the last two episodes. The episodes in question used minimal animation to communicate the psychology of the characters into a mental ending. As a result, director Hideaki Anno decided to redo episodes 25 and 26 in the form of a theatrical feature.\n \nFor those who have not seen the TV series, let me bring you up to speed. An underground organization called NERV is using organic robots called Evangelions to do battle with the supernatural beings known as Angels. The Evangelions are piloted by three teenagers named Shinji, Auska and Rei. Shinji, after killing a close friend who turned out to be an Angel, is currently in a depression. Auska is in a intensive care after the last battle. Rei is currently being used as a spiritual and disposable tool of NERV. Misato, the guardian of Shinji, is starting to lose faith and becoming angry with Shinji's attitude. Gendo, Shinji's father and leader of NERV, is cooking up something that will change humanity in the basement of NERV with Rei.\n \nThe story picks up from there with NERV being attacked by U.N. forces now armed with nine Evangelions at their disposal. Misato is hauling around a moping Shinji while the employees of NERV are ruthlessly gunned down. Auska quickly comes to her senses when put into her Evangelion and attacks the U.N. military. Rei and Gendo are currently trying to revive a crucified Angel located in the basement named Lilith. Auska fails in her attack, Lilith rises from the ground and Shinji forces himself into his Evangelion to fight the Lilith. At this point, everything literally falls apart with many symbolic images, dream sequences, sensory overloads and discussions of uncomfortable situations. This all leads up the to feature quality and visually stunning destruction of mankind.\n \nHow could this possibly be considered two episodes of a TV series? Apparently, the director thinks so and I think that is the movie's biggest flaw. Even with such brilliant writing, direction and feature quality animation, director Hideaki Anno still feels the need to include title cards and closing credits to signal when \"episode 25\" has ended and \"episode 26\" begins. Putting those concerns aside, the film has some other flaws. In the scene where Lilith rises to the sky, there are many symbolic images that appear in the sky...for no reason. Yes, I understand the meaning behind the many symbols, but WHY do they show up? The only purpose these images serve is to fill the sky, act as a reference and confuse. They are pretty to look at, but I just wish they did more.\n \nHowever, there is some symbolism in the film that works with the scene and isn't painfully obvious. Take for instance a staged scene of Shinji's childhood with visual elements relating to the womb and the desire to create and destroy. There is also some live-action footage of everyday life in Japan and an empty movie theater that works well as a reflection on life. Some of the scenes from Shinji's subconcious reveal him coming to terms with uncomfotable subjects. This includes Misato's sex life and how Shinji ejaculated on Auska in a coma. Scenes like these, despite being unbearable, are interesting to see how they play out and how Shinji responds to them.\n \nAnd, yet, all these elements never really seem to connect. Don't get me wrong, though, they all work on their own level. It just seems like all these different emotions, feelings and understandings are disjointed into a mess of visual interpretation. Maybe this was done intentionally to act on a subconcious level or maybe it was done to overload the audience with information until they were confused enough into calling this movie an acid trip. I am not sure.\n \nOne element I have no complaint on is the animation. From the cold opening of the lake to the last apocalyptic enviornment, it's all top quality. Some of the best animation is in Auska's action sequence when she battles the U.N. military. Scenes such as Auska's Evangelion using a battleship as a shield and clashing metal weapons with the enemy Evas really gives a sense of scale and weight. In terms of being an apocalyptic movie, the director is able to perfectly convey that uneasy feeling of everything coming to an end. In fact, the scenes where the U.N. soldiers are slaughtering NERV employees are more horrific than the apocalypse.\n \n[i]End of Evangelion [/i]is a movie that could've and should've been able to stand on it's own. Sadly, due to specific direction and writing, it remains an interesting movie trapped in the TV-based-movie genre. I don't regret seeing the film as it makes for some great subjects to talk about, but I can't quite recommend it because of the questionable symbolism, arrangement of subject matter and the fact that it is not a stand-alone movie. Fans and viewers of the TV series praise [i]End of Evangelion[/i] as it is most certainly an eye-opener. Those who have not seen the show will view this film as a confusing acid trip of psychology, philosophy and religion.",

            "content": "I've got a small business project going on the side right now (as though I don't have enough going on already!), and here is an excerpt from an email from one of my collaboraters after she recently discovered my blog:\n     \n \"so how close are you to your online persona? what would you actually pay us to NOT get printed no less than 250 cards with \"Rockin' Tim - Business Development Manager\" plus your blogsite address as contact information (given that having a mobile phone number is obviously a travesty of civil liberties on a scale that only you and xxx understand...)\"\n     \n     And if you've read this journal at all, you'll of course not be surprised to hear that this got me thinking.... how close [i]am[/i] I to my online persona??\n     \n     [img]http://www.downes.ca/ed_radio/microphone.jpeg[/img]\n     \n It's an interesting question (at least to me!)... the online persona is to a large extent an extension of my radio persona from when I was doing college radio. That's where the name 'Rockin' Tim' was invented. The story there is that I was doing a blues show one night, and I talked about how all the Blues guys had great nicknames, and how I didn't have one but if I did it would be something silly like Rockin' Tim. Despite the fact that the show was from midnight to 2:30 am, the next day no fewer than three people saw me and said 'hey! it's Rockin' Tim' so I decided that if people responded to it that strongly, I oughta stick with it. So for the rest of my radio career that was my name.\n     \n Doing radio was big part of my transformation from incredibly shy, barely socially functional introvert into an outgoing on the surface able to somewhat function within society introvert, and in some ways the radio persona facilitated this. So the persona kind of represented a part of me that wasn't even really an actual part of me yet. If that makes any sense...\n     \n I've always thought that \"Rockin' Tim\" was a reasonable facsimile of \"Tim\"... but on the other hand, my best friends at uni never really liked the persona, and the only people that called me Rockin' Tim outside of the radio station were people that didn't know me that well. So maybe it wasn't...\n     \n All of which brings us back to the original question. And the answer is - I don't know. I think that people that only know me through this journal wouldn't be too surprised if they met me in person (disappointed maybe, but that's a whole other issue!). They might be surprised by just how much of a bookworm I am... as the people that know me through academics are surprised when they see this blog. But I think both blog-Tim and academic-Tim make up complementary parts of the whole me...\n     \n Sooooooooooooo, all of this brings us to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Which looks at a lot of similar issues - what is your identity, how do people connect with each other, what would a life without pain be like, et cetera. All within the context of what on the surface is another anime big mechanical robot battle show. It's got all the stuff that you'd expect with the latter: big fights, lots of hot anime babes, enormous hidden conspiracies, more fights, more babes, and so on. But it also has a huge dose of existentialism, biblical symbolism and navel gazing. There's a [i]whole lot[/i] going in this show, and it would certainly reward multiple viewings. Overall, the whole thing is kind of like if Jim Jarmusch got signed up to direct the next Star Wars movie, and he was working from a script by Camus. Or something like that.\n     \n The box set ends in a bit of a fizzle, but I really like it. This is the version that ran as a tv series in '95. However, fans in Japan apparently [i]hated[/i] the ending, which led to two tries at wrapping things up more conventionally. The first try is called Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth, and from all accounts, it is not worth the time. The only new footage in it is also the first half of NGE: The End of Evangelion, which then goes on to a huge apocalyptic ending, where several of the loose ends are wrapped up. Curiously, philosophically it ends up at exactly the same place that the original series does, it just gets there in a completely different way.\n     \n All in all, NGE is messy, sometimes sloppy, and utterly fascinating. The whole thing runs for about 12 hours, but in the end, I thought it was worth the time. For it to be worth your time, you've got to be pretty interested in the philosophical stuff - if you're just looking for action, there are probably better things around. But if you want action and thinking, this is the way to go. There are parts of it that don't make any sense at all, but I've really enjoyed trying to figure the whole thing out. Oh, and also, it has a penguin...\n     \n     [img]http://www.absoluteanime.com/eva/pen_pen.jpg[/img][img]http://sfirk.canalblog.com/Pen2.jpg[/img]\n     \n Getting back to my journal, the character in it that probably least resembles his online persona is Zamboni! In person, he's a great cat - especially around me and Nancy. But he's very shy around other people. So when you get to see pictures of him here, you get to see sides of him that you'd probably never get to see if you saw him in person...\n     \n     [img]http://www.fieldornithologists.com/nancyandtim/zambonibag.jpg[/img]\n    \n    Oh, and I want the title on my business cards to be:\n    \n    King",

The first half hour sort of recapitulated the last half hour of [i]Death and Rebirth[/i]. So, [i]D&R[/i] is rendered completely frivolous. You don't need it! [i]End of Evangelion[/i] has it all. This one brings the story to a close, answering most of the questions one might have. It's well made and well written. After I got over the fact that I had to return the worthless first film, I was overcome with pure joy. If you're a fan of the series, but haven't watched any of the movies yet, I hope these reviews help. Just buy [i]EofE![/i][/size][/font]",

With my Evagelion avatar and all. Damn. Should've listened to my elders in the anime world. \n   \n THIS is how the series, and arguably the greatest anime of all times should have ended. Not in a whimper, but ina BANG! A bang, with a forray of psychological and philosophical elements, so profuse-it's just perfect[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/smile.gif[/img]\n   \n The last two episodes to Neon Genesis Evangelion were good... But a let down from the heights witnessed throughout the other 23 episodes. End of Evangelion makes amends, and never dissapoints, at least on a clear asthetic level. It follows suite from the series' greatest episodes and explodes them onto the big screen. Plot twists are rampant. Loose ends are explained. Action is undefiably great. And more importantly, the entire series comes full circle. It couldn't have ended any other way. Fans of the serie will, of course, eat this up. Anyone who hasn't seen the entire series, and then sees this first, is really missing out in the full experience. \n   \n Though the end of End, is vague and maybe confusing. All of the pieces are there. Enough, to find the important answers. And enough missing, to inspire some interesting speculation.",

The series had ended with the defeat of the Angels, who had come to free Adam, an Angel captured by humanity (and quite possibly God Himself).  Humanity defeated the Angels using Adam \u0093knock-offs\u0094 known as Evangelions - giant living creatures piloted by gifted teenagers with enormous emotional problems.  In the final television episode, the Evangelion pilots were left in such a state of mental chaos that fans went crazy.  The director of the sexually potent series (and this movie) Hidaeki Anno even received death threats if he didn\u0092t take care of the mess he had left.\r\n\r\nI purchased the 8 DVD set of the television series, and after watching with growing fascination (and frustration), I could understand how the fans felt.  When the last disc had spun to its end, I wasn\u0092t sure if I was badly confused or if I needed therapy.  Then, in 2002, came the movie \u0093The End of Evangelion,\u0094 containing two additional episodes, which I had only just learned about through the good fortune of having Grand SACHI as an RT friend.\r\n\r\n\u0093You kill or you die.\u0094 Shigeru Aoba, NERV Lieutenant\r\n\r\nI ended up watching the film twice, and then spent time going through parts of the film frame-by-frame (the detail is amazing!).  Even knowing the story\u0092s potential, and armed with Grand SACHI\u0092s warning, I still wasn\u0092t prepared for the turn that the story would take, and the hard-core violence that resulted.  Uniquely horrific, brilliantly constructed, and nearly incomprehensible, \u0093The End of Evangelion\u0094 is a cinematic mind-fuck.  It was like sex directly wired into your brain, only you don't have any control over it.  Don't worry.  You'll survive, I think.",
