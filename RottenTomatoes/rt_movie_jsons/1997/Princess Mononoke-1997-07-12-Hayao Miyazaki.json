They make a good point to show that this will not be a family friendly venture right from the very beginning. The violence can sometimes seem a bit outlandish such as shooting an arrow causes someone to be decapitated. This is only a minor nitpick since it doesn't take me out of the film that much. There is a lot going on in the film and if doesn't feeling like any part of it is wasted by simple distractions or one-off jokes or quips. It makes a point to show the brutality of war, but also its ambiguity because of the ability to see the understandable motivations with all the major players in the battles shown. The two main characters reflect the opposing viewpoints regarding war: the need for war and the need for compromise. The Mononoke character is a strong character that's full of heart, but also shows the dangers of someone feeling the need to jump into war. The Ashitaka character is more level-minded, but also shows the dangers and sacrifice that may happen for those fighting for peace and compromise with two opposing and violent factions. From the animation to the message, there is a lot to love about this movie.",

The visuals and ideas which were born inside of Mijazaki's head are insanely interesting and nuanced and I loved it very much because we just don't see these kinds of movies these days. I like this movie a lot, it's just I couldn't connect emotionally to the characters, that's why my rating just isn't that high. For sure it's an extremely solid movie with likable characters and beautiful visuals, but I wanted a bit more of the story, I don't know particularly what, but these movies lack something I don't know how to describe. Maybe I just have to adjust to this way of storytelling and just enjoy it more, but you know it isn't that easy and I don't want to overrate something just because it's a classic. So that's that, I finally watched it and I decided to watch some more arty films so yeah. If you read this, please comment something to this review, I'm interested.",

            "content": "Decided to discover Miyazaki for the first time without having seen any of his films before and finally got around to serious work. Not that they were not serious before, but there really is much more depth and meaning than in his previous films.\n\nThe beginning was especially shocking. I thought it was going to be another kids cartoon, and there are decaying skeletons, pools of blood, demons, dismemberment and decapitation only in the first 15 minutes! And then in general places almost horror. I didn't expect this Miyazaki...\n\nBut when I got used to the level of cruelty and maturity of this film, I also saw its philosophy, symbolism, problematics. \"Princess Mononoke\" seems to have absorbed the best of the master's previous works: the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200ba conflict between people and nature, touched upon back in Nausicaa, is shown here much more thoroughly, the spirit of the forest, which Totoro was, is here a truly mythical creature, and the princess herself seems to be collective the image of all the previous heroines of Miyazaki - everything came together here. The visuals are great as well as the music.\n\nI can find fault with the implausibility of an ordinary bow arrow being capable of blowing heads off like a cannon ball, or chopping off limbs like an axe, with a single hit. I understand that this is a magical fantasy, but the arrows are not magical. Sometimes there was a feeling that Hayao just wanted more blood in order to go far beyond the scope of children's films.\n\nAnd the rest I'm impressed. So far, this is Miyazaki's biggest, most beautiful and grown-up film. However, the next film in line is Spirited Away, which now intrigues me even more.",

Because of some quite pronounced brutality (visible blood in large amounts, decapitations even) it seemed more like an old folk saga than modern fantasy story, giving it a overall vibe of venerability. And while the ecological themes so prevalent in nearly all Ghibli fantasy productions here are also obvious, the plot itself is far removed from being so. It doesn't have any clear fairy-tale-like structure and resembles in some aspects modern political dramas, albeit subtlety. There is surprise here, to be sure, there are also emotions, and it all seems somewhat grandiose in the end. Maybe not profound (old lessons repeated over and over again quickly loose their profoundness),  but yes, certainly grandiose. In the end \"Princess Mononoke\" is rather unlike anything that Ghibli has done before, but only as long as you fail to remember that even before they were named that, they made \"Nausica\u00e4\". Rhythms from the Valley of the Wind echo in wolf princess' ears.",

I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I fell in love with theses with these characters, they felt so real to me, I have not seen such masterful animated characterization since Avatar The Last Airbender, they truly do feel alive. Also I simply must give amazing credit to the overall tone and maturity of this story, yes, this movie can be brutal at times and never shy's away from showing everything from death to blood and dismemberment, it's very rare that a movie targeted at kids, (yes I know it's rated PG-13 but this movie to me can still be targeted at kids) won't hold back so as not to scare or intimidate, and boy does this really help pull you in and invest you even more, and I appreciate that. The only negative thing I can really say is that it felt to me as though the ending came somewhat abruptly and it felt rushed to me, leaving characters and some plotlines unresolved in my opinion. Not a bad ending by any means just somewhat unsatisfying. Overall this movie is great and I highly recommend this film to any lover of animation or great story telling in general, do yourself a favor anf pick up a copy! I give Princess Mononoke a 9/10.",

This could've easily devolved into Nature = Good, Humans = Bad (which is actually what I was expecting) but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't that at all. We have the personification of man v. nature, the latter including spirits and other creatures from Japanese and Chinese folklore. I'm still not entirely sure what the human's motivation was, but I'll just assume it was good ol' fashioned need for resources. The violence of the movie was jarring (+$1) at first, but intriguing after the shock wore off. There's some really beautiful imagery here, as one is to expect from a Ghibli movie concerning nature. I especially enjoyed the putrefying look of Okkoto (Keith David), the elderly, white boar god. I also loved how they animated San (Claire Danes) in battle as a ninja who defies the laws of physics. I think if you had knowledge of Japanese folklore you'd appreciate this movie more (here's a good vid), but it's still a must-see for anime fans, especially those who enjoy animation with more substance and nuance.",

            "content": "Sympathy for the Earth from Miyazaki.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's environmental epic anime Princess Mononoke (1997) is a behemoth of a feature with glorious hand drawn animation from Studio Ghibli and sincere feeling from Miyazaki's thoughtful script. Princess Mononoke is another fantasy adventure anime, much like his earlier films, but I've always felt that Princess Mononoke is Miyazaki's fully realized vision for his debut movie Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. The similar themes, imagery, and story are obvious.\n\nSimilarly, Princess Mononoke is really upheld by Miyazaki's stunning direction and brave environmentalist narrative alongside Ghibli's breathtaking animation. The lush green forestry, oozing bloody gore, piercing eye drawings, and fluid running movements are all peak animation for Ghibli. Princess Mononoke is a revelation of visionary direction with a genuine peaceful message delivered by Hayao Miyazaki's authentic writing voice. It's easily one of his best pictures.\n\nMiyazaki's direction sweeps you away on a fantasy odyssey to save a forest from humanity's greed, capitalism, and warmongering. Violence is never the answer in Miyazaki's movies and I appreciate his peaceful themes, serene atmosphere, and heartfelt filmmaking for Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki's writing is creative, especially for the forest spirit encounters and the relationship between Princess Mononoke and the young hero prince she comes to love and understand. Hayao Miyazaki and Takeshi Seyama's editing is so smooth and naturally flowing that Princess Mononoke feels half its tremendous 134 minute length.\n\nClaire Danes is fearsome and empathetic as Princess Mononoke the Wolfchild. She's confident and intense as this warrior for the woods, yet her softer voice fits Mononoke's emotional personality, full of heart and love for the forest and its animals. Danes does a phenomenal job voicing Hayao Miyazaki's iconic vanguard of the trees: Princess San Mononoke. Likewise, Billy Crudup is excellent as the young hero Prince Ashitaka. His heroism is not marked by his skillful archery or powerful sword strikes, but rather his unwavering loyalty to nature and goodness. Crudup's sensitive voice gently captures Prince Ashitaka's love for Princess Mononoke as well as his boundless quest for peace.\n\nGillian Anderson's dark charisma and deep intensity are perfect for Moro the Wolf. Billy Bob Thornton is surprisingly funny and entertaining as the quirky, self-serving villain Jigo the Monk. Minnie Driver's posh English accent really works for the selfish female ruler Lady Eboshi. She's welcoming and commanding as a leader, but also conniving as she plots to take over the world by smiting a forest god. Jada Pinkett Smith is funny as the former brothel lady and current ironworker Toki with her persistent attitude and personality. Honestly, the new English Dub cast makes Princess Mononoke worth hearing in English for me as this all star cast voices Miyazaki's art with fervent reverence for the picture.\n\nAtsushi Okui's cinematography is particularly striking and resolute with still wide shots of the trees and the spirit of the woods for a heavenly feel. His face close-ups are wonderfully emotional and his far wide shots of forests and lakes are really beautiful. Joe Hisaishi's score swells with symphonic sympathy for the creatures with gentle orchestral passages. His phrasing is simply divine with really memorable music for Princess Mononoke. Hisaishi's scores are one of the magical elements of Hayao Miyazaki's anime features.\n\nMichihiro Itou and Nobutaka Hirooka's sound design for Princess Mononoke is really noticeable. Their quiet and loud dynamics are quite special as all the sound cuts out wherever the spirit of the forest appears. This sudden stillness makes the woods feel truly tranquil with an earnest love of nature on display. You hear cicadas at night, flowing water, wind rustling falling leaves or fields of grass. Everything in Princess Mononoke is natural.\n\nMasashi Ando, Yoshifumi Kondou, and Kitarou Kousaka's visual effects for Princess Mononoke are resplendent with magical glowing for the spirit of the forest's nightwalker form or the celestial glow for the smaller of the wood spirits. I love all the gushing blood as Princess Mononoke remains Miyazaki's most gory and shocking film. These artists allow audiences to realize how horrific bloody violence is when faced with bleeding animals of massive size and soul. There is a real feeling put into this picture. \n\nFurthermore, Y\u014dji Takeshige. Naoya Tanaka. Kazuo Oga. Satoshi Kuroda, and Nizou Yamamoto's art direction is lovely with pretty designs for an abundantly alive forest and starkly industrial ironworks village in juxtaposition to the woods' natural beauty. Their aesthetics are interesting and whoever designed Princess Mononoke herself did a wonderful job making her look unique, cool, and lovely. I'd say that Princess Mononoke has a unique look for everyone in it.\n\nIn conclusion, Princess Mononoke is a fierce statement in favor of defending Earth's natural beauty and wildlife.",

Abandoning much of the family dynamic and childhood themes that were so prevalent previously, Princess Mononoke feels mature right out of the gate and doesn't stop, exploring complex (not necessarily evil) characters in competition for what resources they each require, though the ending does feel too neat given the brutality of the conflict. The environmentalist themes, role of the titular character, and even the design of the Deer God are eerily reminiscent of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, feeling like something of a soft remake to me; somewhat more restricted in terms of pure creativity, though far more intellient in its comments on human nature, survival, and change. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the quality of the animation, including some fantastic action sequences and beautiful natural backdrops. Though Mononoke is often considered among the great films of the venerable studio and is doubtlessly solid, I personally consider it to be more of a middling effort overall when compared to some of their other masterpieces.

While previous efforts like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro contained mythical elements - sleepy deities, spritely spirits, magic-tinged talents - the influence of god-level beings often feels secondary, relegated to a few enchanting (yet fleeting) glimpses. In Princess Mononoke, such divine creatures are essential, active participants. They speak, argue, swing their weight around. We aren't left to guess about their opinions or motivations, because their words and actions carry such a resonant influence. It's mesmerizingly effective, a contrast between the seemingly petty concerns of human tribes and the mass and muscle of a much heavier entity.\n\nMononoke represents a huge step up for the studio, particularly in that sense of scale. Rather than maintaining the quaint, intimate essence that typified their early output, this time Ghibli has gone sweeping and epic. Everything, from the ambitious, enveloping symphonic score to the wide, gorgeous landscapes and distinct environs, emphasizes this point. We've left the village to find there's a broad undiscovered world out there. Yet the distinguishing little touches and unspoken human gestures haven't been lost in the transition, either. It still looks and feels like a Miyazaki movie, calmingly earnest and heartstrong, but the canvas is larger and more potentially powerful. And man, do they make the most of that promise.",

Nothing is explained, everything just is, and there is no reason for it other than \"yep, that's how it is.\" I don't lie these types of movies, and you either love it or don't like it, but you definitely don't Hate it At All. It is a crazy ride, even though it is pure nonsense. \nAnimation is good, but you also have to deal with ancient-animal spirits that are stupid as hell, they don't know anything yet act like they know everything, and people that do nothing right just for self interest. It is as political as it gets, where people destroy everything and animals don't... even though they Do, so it is meaningless. \nI think people just got carried away with the idea that there are giant wolves, because fanatically emotional people seem to Love talking giant wolves. I just don't get the hype at all. It is pure idiocy most of the times, and amazing visuals don't make up for stupid story, dialogue, plot, and Everything else dealing with Sense.

            "content": "Listen, I get it if you think this movie is deserving of 5 stars. I would've given it that too if it wasn't for these three reasons. 1. Dialogue: this one is probably the smallest problem out of the three. It's pretty much just a knit pick but I had to say something about it. The problem doesn't arise too often but sometimes the main character could be saying something totally unneeded in the conversation or a side character could say something that was so cheesy I couldn't believe it was in a Miyazaki film. Mind-boggling almost. 2. The Pacing: this is a 2 hour and 13 min movie. Too long for an animated feature film. It kept it up well for the most part but it definitely had some bumps in the road. I was extremely intrigued for the first 45 minutes or however long it was until they got into Iron Town. But as soon as they opened that gate, the story came to a complete hault. The pacing became slow, the conversations started to become exposition heavy and it was just overall boring. It picked back up when Princess Mononoke invaded the town and didn't slow back down until about an hour left in the movie but that one wasn't as long. 3. Confusion: the story itself is great, don't get me wrong. Sure, it gets heavy handed at times with its preachiness but not enough to make you role your eyes and cut off the TV. The confusion stems from too much stuff going on and not enough time to explain. I guess you could say there was not enough exposition or at least, not where it was needed. Like I didn't even know until the end of the movie that the bore at the beginning was a god. Heck, I didn't even know until the credits rolled why he turned into demon. But again, the issues I had with movie didn't take away from my experience. I still loved it and would love to explore more of this world. And gee wiz, was the animation amazing. Over 2 decades and that is still one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen. Absolutely astonishing.",
