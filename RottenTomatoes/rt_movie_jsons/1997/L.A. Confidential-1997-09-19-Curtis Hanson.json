            "content": "The fiercest neo-noir ever made about police integrity and corruption.\n\nDirector Curtis Hanson's neo-noir crime mystery L.A. Confidential (1997) is absolutely captivating with bloody shootouts and corrupt police everywhere. Curtis Hanson really wrote and produced a neo-noir film in the 90's that's as hard hitting and shocking as the old 1940's noir pictures like The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, or This Gun for Hire. L.A. Confidential is a blend of The French Connection, Chinatown, The Untouchables, Mississippi Burning, Goodfellas, and The Silence of the Lambs. You are given shadowy nights and sudden bursts of violence from Hanson's technically masterful direction. It's such a matter of face nihilistic film that shows you all the grit and grime of L.A. I really appreciate Hanson just showing you everything and never needing to explain the gritty details upon rewatching L.A. Confidential. Justice is delivered, but not always to the right people.\n\nHanson's direction delivers upon intriguing confidential mysteries, sizzling hateful buddy cop rapport, heroin rackets, shady drug deals, violent grisly murders, brutal abuse, sleazy nudity, shocking victims of rape, racist profiling, underground porno profiles, suspicious homicides, and high class Hollywood prostitution rings with ladies of the night that look like movie stars. L.A. looks horrifying here without all the Hollywood glamour. L.A. Confidential is not for the faint of heart or idealists, but its morality comes from its condemning judgment of all the police corruption. Curtis Hanson is essentially asking what is the real difference between law enforcement and law breakers. Is there any justice for police committing crimes?\n\nWriters Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's blistering screenplay adaptation of James Ellroy's novel is fascinating. Clues are hinted at and intricate mysteries pile up seemingly without connection until the final reveal. They show the virtues of attempting to be a good cop in a systematically racist, violent, and corrupt police force. Everything feels hopeless when a lone decent policeman wants to change his police department. But he even succumbs to personal gain at the expense of other officers. I love that you actually see the disgusting, corrupt, and regressive retaliation from all the awful corrupt cops against whistleblowers and snitches. L.A. Confidential really demonstrates exactly how and why police corruption starts, continues, and protects officers from repercussions. L.A. Confidential's main theme is a nihilistic viewpoint of all cops being bad at heart, whether from corruption, perversion, or rage. Few screenplays have navigated such complex mysteries, clues, and characters with such visceral style.\n\nGuy Pearce finds himself in a comparable good cop role as Willem Dafoe in Mississippi Burning and Roy Scheider in The French Connection. His cold attitude is a nice juxtaposition to Crowe's viciousness. His callous snitching, calm and clever multiple interrogation sequence, and brave finale shootout. Pearce is incredibly nuanced as he slowly shows doubts in his legit process as he questions his entire motives. You see someone who might have been good lean into depravity like any other cop.\n\nRussell Crowe plays the hard cop with a mean temper and a no nonsense attitude like Gene Hackman in Mississippi Burning and The French Connection. Crowe is fearsome in his brute force interrogations and subtle in his depiction of trauma that lead to him wanting to beat every woman beater. You witness a formerly deeply moral man resort to violence endlessly, even against women. Crowe shows how in his righteous fury, he never notices that he is really working the same case as Spacey and Pearce.\n\nKevin Spacey fittingly plays a corrupt sleazebag policeman out for fame and redemption. Spacey is hilarious as he is seedy. James Cromwell is excellent at subtly portraying his disdain for Exley ratting out his fellow cops and his refusal to resort to violent methods. His every line delivery is chilling.\n\nDanny DeVito is very funny as the tabloid photographer and reporter out for stories and cash. Kim Basinger gets dressed up with similar peek-a-boo bangs and dresses like the adorable and iconic Golden Age of Hollywood starlet Veronica Lake. She's an alluring femme fatale with daring realism and sultry sex appeal. Basinger feels so lived in as this rather tragic heroine. David Strathairn is perfect as the cavalier porno producer that gets Hollywood hopeful girls in his prostitution ring.\n\nEditor Peter Honess keeps you in the moment with really sharp cuts from moment to moment with a breakneck pace. He gives you every angle in a room before a shootout. His neat cutting style is class and tells a dark story about corruption with every detail imaginable laid right out for you. 138 minutes fly by due to Honess' quick editing. He passes by time with a few select cuts that make sure L.A. Confidential's slick story is a coherent one. \n\nCinematographer Dante Spinotti's gorgeous shots are beautiful with shadows cast on cars and guns alike. His neat perspectives around corners and up close to faces reminds me of Jonathan Demme's style of close-ups for The Silence of the Lambs. There's a sick voyeurism to all the nudity and brutality being in the dark limelight. He holds shots for the horror and emotional scenes alike. I'm always stunned by how well shot L.A. Confidential is especially the midnight finale.\n\nProduction designer Jeannine Oppewall recreates 1950's Hollywood from bars to lavish homes. William Arnold's art direction leans into rainy days and curious faces. Jay Hart and Louisa Bonnie's set decoration brings the past to life with old antique furniture and props in every scene. You never doubt what era you're looking at during the movie. Peter Donen's visual effects make for gory gunshot wounds and slit throats.\n\nComposer Jerry Goldsmith's music is full of nostalgia for an older time, while also feeling a pounding rhythm for the intense action. I love Goldsmith's scores and L.A. Confidential features some of his finest melodies and musical ideas. Ruth Myers' costumes lean into classic Veronica Lake and Marilyn Monroe dresses, while every man has the 50's suit standard. Lance Anderson's hair and make-up does up Kim Basinger like she's Veronica Lake or Marilyn Monroe with the wavy locks, peek-a-boo bangs, and crimson red lips.\n\nIn all, I love L.A. Confidential for Curtis Hanson's meticulous investigation style direction and ruthless acting all around.",

The twists keep comin' and they don't stop. The plot is layered and buttressed by an ensemble cast that includes, but is not limited to, Guy Pearce, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell. The interrogation scene is top-notch; the shootout scene is delightful. There didn't seem to be a storyline wasted and I appreciated their interconnectedness, but I must've missed something concerning the Nite Owl massacre because I was not pulling on that thread at all. The roller-coaster relationship between Ed (Pearce) and Bud (Crowe), culminating in the aforementioned shootout, is the highlight of the film. I don't think L.A. Confidential wow'd me like it did both critics and audience on RT, but it's definitely a solid, comprehensive movie about the dark side of early 1950s Los Angeles.",

From the thrilling screenplay to the aesthetically pleasing cinematography, there is a lot to like about this 90's noir showpiece\n\nThe performances from all involved are brilliant. I particularly enjoyed Russell Crowe's intense and ferocious portrayal of Bud White, while Guy Pearce provided the intelligent and calculated base to play Edmund Exley, and finally Kevin Spacey brought the sly and wise humour that embodies his character Jack Vincessens. These are all heavyweight actors who all produce a career best performance, they all bring something richly different to a heavy narrative that requires attention. Couple these with the psychotic nature of Cromwell's character, Dudley Smith, and this film has about just everything a detective narrative needs. Kim Basinger's performance alone is great\n\nThe screenplay from Brian Hegeland and Curtis Hanson is perfect, a very precisely told neo-noir story that has its twists and turns placed brilliantly. \n\nThis is an essential noir film to watch, it's paced very well too meaning the runtime rarely drags, a brilliant film from Curtis Hanson",

And 'LA Confidential' didn't disappoint at all, it is an outstanding film on all levels and should have won the Best Picture Oscar of 1997 and won more.\n\nVisually, 'LA Confidential' looks great. The photography is both audacious and stylish, suitably the story and genre superlatively. A good music score also helps and there is an appropriately haunting one courtesy of one of the greatest film composers ever. Curtis Hansen directs superbly, it has a lot of style and how it balances everything is so cleverly done, he hasn't made a better film and to me it's the best directing of his entire career.\n\n'LA Confidental' richly deserved its Best Screenplay Oscar. No other film that year came close to the film's rich character development, complexity and its refusal to fall into clich\u00e9 territory. All the characters are compelling in their realism and none of them feel stereotypical or one-sided, actually breaking the mould of good cops and bad villains. The story is gripping in its intensity and thrills, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, and very rare a dull moment.\n\nThe acting is exceptionally full-blooded and there isn't a single weak link. How Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey weren't nominated for Oscars is unfathomable. Spacey in particular is brilliant, though Crowe is appropriately hard-nosed and Pearce has rarely been better.\n\nJames Cromwell and Danny De Vito also shine. Cromwell is chillingly insidious and De Vito has never been slimier. Whether Kim Basinger deserved her Oscar win is up for debate, to me it was a very worthy win where she gives her role hard edge and charm.\n\nIn conclusion, superb film-making and an outstanding film on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

He rejects Captain Dudley Smith's (James Cromwell) advice that a detective should be willing to beat a confession out of a suspect or shoot him in the back if necessary for the greater good. Plainclothes Officer Wendell \"Bud\" White (Russell Crowe), whom Exley considers a \"mindless thug,\" is obsessed with viciously punishing woman-beaters. White confronts former cop Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks, a driver for Pierce Patchett, whose Fleur-de-Lis service gives its prostitutes plastic surgery so they resemble film stars. White hates Exley because his partner, Dick Stensland, was fired thanks to Exley's testimony. With the city's gangland kingpin Mickey Cohen imprisoned for tax evasion, Smith recruits White to torture out-of-town criminals trying to gain a foothold in Los Angeles. Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a TV police drama series. Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine, pays him to arrest celebrities whom Hudgens photographs for his magazine. Exley investigates an apparent botched robbery and multiple homicide at the \"Nite Owl\" coffee shop. Stensland was one of the victims. Exley and Vincennes arrest three African-Americans for the murders; they later escape from police custody and are killed by Exley in a shootout that also kills a fellow officer. Exley is decorated for bravery. However, a Mexican girl, Inez, who was raped by the African-American men around the time of the murders, admits to Exley that she falsely reported the time they left her in order to try to get them arrested for the Nite Owl massacre. She tells him that she \"did what she had to do for justice\" because otherwise \"nobody would care that they raped a Mexican girl from Boyle Heights.\" Exley realizes that this admission places their guilt for the Nite Owl murders in doubt. Although the police department considers the Nite Owl case solved, Exley and White independently investigate it and discover evidence of corruption...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Taut pacing, brilliantly dense writing and Oscar-worthy acting combine to produce a smart, popcorn-friendly thrill ride.\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"seductive and beautiful, cynical and twisted, and one of the best films of the year.\" He later included it as one of his \"Great Movies\" and described it as \"film noir, and so it is, but it is more: Unusually for a crime film, it deals with the psychology of the characters ... It contains all the elements of police action, but in a sharply clipped, more economical style; the action exists not for itself but to provide an arena for the personalities\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \"Mr. Spacey is at his insinuating best, languid and debonair, in a much more offbeat performance than this film could have drawn from a more conventional star. And the two Australian actors, tightly wound Mr. Pearce and fiery, brawny Mr. Crowe, qualify as revelations.\" Desson Howe's review for The Washington Post praised the cast: \"Pearce makes a wonderful prude who gets progressively tougher and more jaded. New Zealand-born Crowe has a unique and sexy toughness; imagine Mickey Rourke without the attitude. Although she's playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a sort of chaste sultriness. Spacey is always enjoyable.\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote, \"The big star is Los Angeles itself. Like Roman Polanski's depiction of Los Angeles in the '30s in Chinatown, the atmosphere and detailed production design are a rich gel where the strands of narrative form.\" USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing, \"It appears as if screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have pulled off a miracle in keeping multiple stories straight. Have they ever. Ellroy's novel has four extra layers of plot and three times as many characters ... the writers have trimmed unwieldy muscle, not just fat, and gotten away with it.\"\n\nCurtis Hanson\u00b4s gripping crime noir drama \"L.A. Confidential\" based on James Ellroy\u00b4s book is truly a treat still today. Great story with crime, corruption and justice as the centre pieces set in L.A. and with great characters and a great ensemble to portray them. The three main characters played by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are all in top form and they all lift eachother to greatness in this film. Great direction by Curtis Hanson with James Ellroy's source material as the base and he manages to take us back to Los Angeles in the 50s via solid cinematography and great environments/props. The film grossed $126 million worldwide and was critically acclaimed. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning two: Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay; Titanic won in every other category L.A. Confidential was nominated. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected L.A. Confidential for preservation in the National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \"L.A. Confidential\" is a fine piece of film in my book.",

Plenty of \"turn in your badge and gun\" and \"how's tricks?\" moments to provide the nostalgic atmosphere. Chock full of star power and commensurately great performances, even if it feels that some of the characters (particularly Basinger's Bracken and a bit of Crowe's White) feel sidelined at points to allow for Pearce to get additional screentime. One of the best aspects of this film - every character has at least one fatal flaw, resulting in a conflict of who is the \"least worse\", and an environment ripe with opportunism. Should appeal to both fans of the Bogart era and modern action aficionados alike. (5/5)",

            "content": "*SPOILERS AHEAD*\nL.A. Confidential, a new noir film, is a decent film. It is not awful, but it is not a great film either. The film has many good aspects, but many that take away from what the film could have been. It also fits every aspect of a noir film and lends itself greatly to the genre. \n\tThe acting in the film is average as well. Kevin Spacey, who plays Jack Vincennes, does an average job. His acting was done well, but there was no hint of any emotion or thought in his eyes. It drew away from the plot and intensity of many of the scenes. Russel Crowe is almost unrecognizable as Bud White. He plays the short-tempered, highly emotional, rebellious character, \"the bad cop\", very well. It is a nice thing to watch on the screen and he draws attention and holds it very well throughout the entire film. Guy Pearce, who plays Ed Exley, did an average job as well. He does a good job portraying the \"good cop\", but most of the time, he looks more psychotic and the villain of the film, until the true villain is revealed. Lynn Bracken also does a good job portraying the typical damsel, noir women. \n\tThen the casting of Danny Devito is overall very confusing. He is a very comedic actor and to place him in a very serious, intense film took away from it. It would have been better to cast someone like Johnny Depp or Morgan Freeman. DeVito must have been cast for comic relief to the intense film, but it didn't provide that and took away from the message and story in the film.\n\tNext, the sets and costumes do a very good job of portraying the 1950's. It is very easily recognizable and helped the film as well. Helgeland's screenplay however, is a little mis-written it seems. Many lines and phrases said in the film, appear way to modern to be said in the 1950's. \nThe plot of the film itself is very confusing itself and hard to follow along with until the very end of the film. The subplots take too long to come together into one major plot. It is hard to follow each subplot as well. The film definitely has Criminal Minds, Law and Order: SVU vibes, but it tries to push the plots to fill a movie length. But many aspects of the plot are admirable. The showing of police brutality, especially in the 1950's and what has occured in today's society, was very well done and important to be seen in the United States. Also having a part of the central crimes in the plot being a paid escort service was nicely done as well. It showed an aspect of society not really talked about or mentioned, when it is important to talk about in our modern society and how it was going on even in the 50s and hints at the industry being around before that as well.\nMany angles and scenes in the film were impressive as well, such as the shoot-out at the end and the interrogation of the three black suspects. They were very well done. The Bloody Christmas scene was well shot also, but hard to follow with the confusing plot, but the angles and camera work were very impressive in a lot of the film.\nThis film, when it was made, was trying to usher in a new noir era, but because of new crime television shows, it did not achieve it. This film definitely would have been better if it was turned into a tv series or mini series, like The Act. The noir era served better before the creation of television shows and modern dramas and while the effort is duly noted it was not very effective. \nFinally, the film was surely worth doing. It did test whether or not a new noir era could come into this century. It also showed newer audiences what a noir film is and gave a great nod to the noir era. The film also gave audiences an interest in crime dramas, as it was made in 1997, before many new crime television shows started and \"You heard it here\u2026. On the Q.T., and very Hush Hush.\"",

It boasts one of the greatest casts in the history of cinema, and it is the movie that made Russell Crowe a star.  Russell's portrayal of Bud White is maybe the best thing about the movie, but the entire cast turns in outstanding performances--even Kim Basinger, as evidenced by her Oscar win.  The plot will keep you guessing--and although it gets convoluted, it never cheats (although you might have to watch it twice to catch all the nuances).  If you enjoy an intelligent, thought-provoking movie and somehow missed this one, then check it out now!  It is a 5-star movie all the way, I promise you!!",

            "content": "My familiarity with director Curtis Hanson largely came from the terrific films In Her Shoes (2005) and Wonder Boys (2000) before having seen this film but even with the tainting that the presence of Kevin Spacey brings to the film I think this may be his best film. I'm not usually a fan of crime drama films but this movie tells it's story so compellingly and features such memorable characters that you can't help but be drawn in. I would even venture to say that I think it is the best film nominated for Best Picture in 1997 and probably should have won over Titanic (1997) which I think makes a mockery of the romantic epic genre which I usually adore.\n\nThe by the book LAPD detective Ed Exley, Guy Pearce, teams up with the talented but combustible Bud White, Russell Crowe, as they attempt to defeat the perpetrators of the \"Bloody Christmas\" murders. They are diverted from their task when a rivalry develops between the two of them and their associate Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes, Kevin Spacey, realizes that the murders that the murders of various prostitutes is related to police corruption. White begins a relationship with prostitute Lynn Bracken, Kim Basinger, while Exley and Vincennes find evidence of the corruption but it is revealed that it is their superior Captain Dudley Smith, James Cromwell, who is heading all of the corruption. Exley and White team up to take down all of those who head the corruption and both get their happy endings.\n\nThe film is obviously very stylish as it sets up a world in which L.A. is a sort of paradise even though it is just seething with criminality and potentially dodgy behavior hidden among the few self-righteous, moral individuals like Exley. I liked seeing all of the 1930s d\u00e9cor and costumes and especially the shots of various locales in Los Angeles as they feel as though they are capturing a very specific time and place and contribute to the moody, evocative feeling of the film. Even the police building which appears on screen several times sends a little thrill up your spine as the film builds tension which is sure to be unleashed in the workplace of these men who devote so much of their lives to their jobs which appear to dictate so much of their lives outside of their jobs and in their personal lives.\n\nThe plot is also skillfully pulled together by the screenwriters as we spend so much time confused at how all of these seemingly disparate events will connect to each other and yet the finale brings everything together. When it does reach it's exciting climax you are completely on board as you feel the deep anger of our three and eventually two protagonists at the wrongness of the institution they work within. I felt joy at their victory because their characters had been set up as more than just your average buddy cop pairing, we knew about these men and their personal lives, their relationships with women and their dead fathers. Even though it is difficult to root for Kevin Spacey the fact that his character also dies makes the film not necessarily as bad as it could have been. Films like Lethal Weapon (1987) don't have the impact that this film has because their characters seem so outlandish and are so hard to care about in addition to being surrounded by a less complex plot that is less gratifying when it gets wrapped up.\n\nThe one thing that I will fault about this film, is not really the fault of the film, but Kim Basinger's win for Best Supporting Actress has always irked me. I think she does very good work in Fool for Love (1985) but I would hardly call her a \u2018great' actress and when nominated alongside performers like Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights (1997) and Joan Cusack in In and Out (1997) the weaknesses and flatness of her performance can be more closely dissected. I think she is very well used as she is convincing as the sort of beautiful older woman who could charm an angry young man into having a real relationship but there is never a moment where I am amazed by Basinger and her abilities.\n\nDespite my minor complaint I actually think that the film is fantastic and you should absolutely watch it.",

It had some big stars in this like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito. It had a good story about three police officers and detectives investigating the \"Nite Owl case\" and other stuff. Kevin Spacey is Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a popular TV police drama series. He is also providing Sid Hudgens, publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine. Russell Crowe is Officer Wendell \"Bud\" White who is in love with Lynn Bracken and he investigates the Nite Owl case where his partner is killed. Guy Pearce is Det. Lt. Edmund \"Ed\" Exley who is investigating the Nite Owl case. His father is murdered by a man who Exley nicknames \"Rollo Tomasi\". I kinda like the part where the police and criminals are fighting at \"Bloody Christmas\". The story is great and well written and it is faithful to the novel which is based on by James Ellroy. Kim Basinger is really good as Lynn Bracken, the directing style is immense when something goes wrong and the police are on the crime investigation and the cinematography is great. I know I say that quite a lot but what can I say? They immense. As much I loved it for it's story, directing, editing, art design and cinematography and everything about this. L.A. Confidential is a impeccable neo-noir crime film filled with characters, mystery and beautifully crafted set pieces. If you guys haven't seen it then I would definitely recommend you watch it.

Without a single detail missed, the director delivered us a complex but tremendous clear- cut story full of many kinds of characters, more precisely, different faces of sorts of men who work as a same title: policeman, plus the picturesque motion image of L.A. especially,that L.A. in 1950s. the movie definitely push the boundary ahead with regard the same category. \n\nThree different cops, say, Edmond is that politician kind who wholeheartedly want to climb to the top of heap, never give a damn about rumors that may come from his colleagues, and officer Bud, who believe that justice must be served and maintained only by violence, because this is what those villains do to the society, which should be used against them either. Sergeant Jack, who works as a real movie star in the bureau for the reason that he just always can grab some tabloid information and can bust scandal stars by privately collaborate with  so-called \"Hush-hush\" magazine''s editor.\n\nIn my view, these three policemen are by no meas technically that exemplar-kind, they all in a way lost themselves as time goes. However, a vital point: Night-Owl murder case somehow connected them to each other, and just because of this, some signs of human nature were made appearing as the deep dive into that case goes. Take one line for example. \" Why'd you become a cop?\", a simple but evocative and profound question must arouse that conscience which may have long gone in Jack's heart. Of course, such a veteran like Jack impossibly forgot his motivation, but that doesn't matter, what matters was that he must realize he should take his own responsibility for his job's sake, and we do not have to bother pointing out the inside change of Edmond. Ironically, a man died in front of a gun who not long before had done asking another man \"even if it means paying the consequences\", while the latter probably was flirting with that hooker and enjoying his time. Maybe, in a way, we can consider it a sign indicates accomplishing one heavy task sometimes brings a certain risk either, the screenplay just chose Jack and wrote this character dead. Till the end, Bud got what he yearned for and so did Edmond. Power and women, two seems by any means undetachable elements made their different ways head to two different people's palms, and that indeed made this impeccable thriller open exciting new territory while still basing on classic structure of police-and-bandit film.\n\nL.A. Confidential, deserves no less than four-stars ranking if totally reaches no more than five. Well-designed screenplay(albeit it based on that novel), fantastic performance of characters, ravishing landscape, impeccable background music, all without exception made this movie stand out.",

            "content": "There was no stopping Titanic in 1997, iceberg be damned. James Cameron's epic disaster movie had all the momentum of the times, and yet it's a smaller movie that captured more of the critics and was far more deserving of the ultimate Oscar prizes that year. L.A. Confidential was based upon a James Ellroy novel that many argued was unfilmable. Enter journeyman director Curtis Hanson and novice screenwriter Brian Helgeland, and the pair stripped the book down from eight main characters to three, kept the spirit and essence of the book alive while rearranging the storylines for large-scale popcorn thrills. It's been nearly twenty years since L.A. Confidential first seduced big screen audiences and its powers are still as alluring to this day. It's a neo noir masterpiece.\n\nIn 1950s Los Angeles, not all is what it seems. The captain of the police, Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), is looking to keep the peace in the City of Angels as outside criminal elements are looking to fill the void from Mickey Cohen going to prison. Three police officers of very different stripes find themselves on the edges of a complicated murder case stemming from a massacre at the Nite Owl cafe. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is the son of a famous police captain and wants to rise up the ranks as quickly as possible. He's a political animal and unafraid of ruffling feathers. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a bruiser of a man who enforces his own level of justice when it comes to men who beat or harass women. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a happily shady officer who serves as a consultant for a hit TV police procedural. The Night Owl case takes them into many sordid corridors of sex, money, and power, including Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), part of Pierce Pratchett's (David Strathairn) stable of prostitutes meant to look like movie stars, the mysterious self-serving sources to tabloid journalist Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), and good cops and bad cops on the controversial L.A. police force.\n\nThis movie is a master class in plotting and structure, enough that it should be taught in film schools. By nature noir plots are meant to be busy and mysterious, and a guarantee for mystery is a Byzantine plot full of plenty of suspects, dispirit elements, and strange coincidences that eventually coalesce into a larger picture. The beauty of what Hanson and Helgeland have done is that they have made the script complex yet accessible, able to lose one's self in the tangled web of intrigue but still able to see how all the myriad pieces fit perfectly together by the conclusion. There is an efficiency to the screenwriting that is mesmerizing. It all seems so effortless when you're with storytellers this gifted or who have a divine connection to the source material. Forgoing the customary slow builds of recent film noir like the oft-cited Chinatown, L.A. Confidential just moves from the opening narration. Within the first 25 minutes, the movie has expertly set up all three of its main characters, what defines them, their separate goals, the obstacles in place, and previews how they will intersect into one another's orbit, and then the Nite Owl case explodes. Every scene drives this narrative forward. Every scene reveals a little more depth to our characters or fleshes out a superb supporting cast. Every scene cements that contradictory theme of the glitzy allure and unseemly darkness of the post-war City of Angels. My only quibble is that before the truncated third act the movie resorts to a few easy shortcuts but by that point Hanson and Helgeland had more than earned their paces. This is one of the greatest modern screenplays, period (WGA listed it as #60 all-time).\n\nThere are so many remarkably assured sequences but I want to emphasize one in particular - Exley's interrogation of the three Nite Owl suspects. \"Oh I'll break him,\" Exley promises his superior before entering into the first interrogation room. At first you're with the other officers and morbidly curious with his arrogance. By the end, your jaw hangs in amazement at the intuitive pressure this man is expertly applying. It's a terrific moment that allows Exley to masterfully manipulate three different men, taking pieces and running toward accurate insinuations, building momentum and clarity. Each man is different and each man offers a new piece of the overall puzzle. A slight reference by one unlocks another's confession. An overheard sound byte pushes another into self-defense. I'm convinced it was this scene that ensured robust and thorough interrogation was a crucial element of the gameplay for the 2011 video game L.A. Noire, a noble misfire that definitely looked to replicate Hanson's film as a user experience.\n\nNoir is one film genre with a visual code that can get the best of directors, but Hanson played this to his advantage. Classic noir is filled with criminal activity and the allure of sex and violence, typified perhaps best in the position of the untrustworthy but oh-so-sexy femme fatale. Yet the majority of film noir was produced in an era of censorship thanks to the implementation of the notorious Hayes Code, making sure that audiences didn't enjoy the sordid elements too far. Free of these restrictions, some modern filmmakers take the opportunity to revisit the noir landscape and fill in the blanks of old, furnishing an outpouring of unrestrained exploitation elements. Brian DePalma's 2006 film The Black Dahlia (also based on an Ellroy novel) gets drunk on this mission, though \"restrained\" has never been a word I would associate with DePalma's filmmaking anyway. My point, dear reader, is that it's easy to get lost in the superficial trappings of the genre: sexy dames, corrupt lawmen, temptation, shootouts, schemes, and chiaroscuro lighting. It's easy to dabble in these elements because they're so nostalgic and celebrated.\n\nHanson did something different with his 1997 masterpiece. He builds upon the audience expectations with noir but he doesn't let his complex story and characters come second to the visual spectacle of the famous genre. L.A. Confidential is in many ways a movie that straddles lines; old and new, indie and Hollywood classicism, and film noir and drama. It's an adult film that doesn't downplay its darkness, brutality, and moral ambiguity, yet when it comes to those exploitation elements, especially sex, it's almost chaste. The relationship between Lynn and Bud seems refreshingly square, like it was pulled from Old Hollywood. The entire movie feels that way, an artifact that could exist any decade.\n\nHanson was something of a journeyman for most of his career, directing competent thrillers like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. As Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in his eulogy for Hanson (he died in September 2016, a fact I shamefully didn't know until writing this review), after 25 years in the industry the man became an earth-rattling auteur after the age of 50. That is a rarity. Who knew the guy had something this singularly brilliant within his grasp his entire career? The care he puts into the screen is evident from the opening montage onward. There's an elusive magic to the filmmaking on display, a bracingly divine sense of how to move the camera for best effect, how to escalate and deescalate audience nerves. He knows his story structure and characters inside and out, but he also knows how to play an audience. His time making serviceable studio thrillers certainly helps him during the film's climax, a bloody shootout that's also a mini-siege thriller.\n\nHanson also assembled an incredible crew to enable his vision. The technical elements recreate the early 1950s L.A. time period with beguiling immediacy; the cinematography by Dante Spinotti (Heat) gives a sense of the darker elements just under the surface without having to overly rely upon the film language of staid noir visuals. Peter Honess' sharp editing provides a downright Thelma Schoonmaker-esque musical orchestration to the proceedings, especially as the multiple storylines and developments spill onto one another. Speaking of music, the score by Jerry Goldsmith (Star Trek) is thick with the jazzy overtones of the genre. It's a score that simmers with sexual tension and malevolence. The casting director deserves a lifetime free pass. There are a whopping 80 speaking parts in the movie, and each person is a great hire that builds a richer film.\n\nWhile the plot of L.A. Confidential sucks you in right away, its characters take hold the strongest. Film noir is one genre that has a codified cheat sheet of character archetypes, and this movie fulfills and subverts them, finding surprising and gratifying ways to further round out these figures into complex and nuanced human beings. The three main characters all provide a different approach to law enforcement and when we see them start to work together it's a wholly wonderful turn of events. Bud is the muscle, Exley is the brain, and Vincennes is the charm, and each one attacks the Nite Owl case and its subsequent leads from different angles that best apply to their set of skills. Each of the three characters discovers new pieces of evidence, new contacts and suspects, and when they start to work together it not only provides a payoff with the combined evidence but with the satisfying nature of their teamwork. That's because they become better people when they work together and each moves closer to some moral redemption.\n\nBud is the loyal cop with a hair trigger and a penchant for being a white knight to abused women. His personal history of abuse makes him seek justice, often by his own fists. He has a rigid moral code of right and wrong and isn't afraid to cross lines to achieve it. He's also tired of being a bully and wants to be more than just the muscle. Exley is a straight arrow with a strong sense of moral righteousness and a mind for politics. He knows how to play sides for his own gain. He's not afraid of making enemies within the department, and his opportunistic choices create many. He's trying to forge his own path outside the shadow of his father, a famous lawman who was gunned down by a random purse-snatcher (\"Rollo Tamassi\"). He has to learn that he can't do everything on his own. Finally, Vincennes is in many ways the face of the department as an ambassador to the world of TV and film. He's succumbed fully to the glamour of Hollywood but he's also full of profound self-loathing, trying to count how many compromises he's made in life and where it's gotten him. The appeal of the old life is crumbling and his detective instincts are reawakened, spurring Vincennes into the fray and surprising even himself. It's extremely rare for any movie to successfully develop more than one protagonist, let alone three, and yet L.A. Confidential achieves this milestone so that when we alternate perspectives there isn't a drop in viewer interest. Each man brings something different and interesting, each man reveals new hidden depths, and each character is fascinating to watch in this setting.\n\nThe gifted actors take the already excellent written material and elevate it even further, turning an already sterling movie into one of the all-time greats. Almost twenty years later, it's fun to see these famous actors when they were young and, arguably, in their prime. Spacey (House of Cards) was on a tear at this point in his career, between his two well-deserved Oscar wins, and having the time of his life in every role. His character seemingly has the least complexity, a man who knows he's sold out but believes himself to be enjoying the ride, but Spacey offers poignant glimpses of the man behind all that oily charm and sly glances. There's a scene where he stumbles across a mistake of his making and the subtle, haunted expression playing across his face is amazing. The man was capable of expressing so much, and still is. Crowe was still a couple years from his big breakout in 2000's Gladiator but he put himself on the Hollywood map as Bud White. He's a coil of anger and pain looking for an outlet, and Crowe is magnetic as hell. His glowers could burn right through you. Pearce (Memento) was another knockout that solidified leading man status thanks to his performance as the rigidly self-righteous Exley. He's a character that thinks he's above moral reproach, and his humbling is a necessary part of solving the case. Exley is constantly surprising his peers and it feels like Pearce does the same, showing exciting new capabilities from scene to scene, from his stirring hire-wire act with the interrogation scene to his understated glimmer of fear through a poker face. These three performances are golden.\n\nNobody better represents sleaze than Danny DeVito's character and the man brings a merry lechery to his tabloid journalist/exposition device. His unquenchable thirst for the worst in humanity to sell more papers feels even more sadly relevant given the media climate that contributed to the recent presidential election. Kim Basinger (Batman) won an Oscar for her somber performance, which reinvigorated her career. She's good but I can't help but feel that she won the Oscar in a weak field (my choice would be Julianne Moore for Boogie Nights). David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) is enjoyably nonplussed as a man who specializes in delivering vice. James Cromwell used every bit of audience warmth associated as the loveable farmer from Babe and used that to his advantage. His pragmatic police captain is a father figure for Exley and the audience and perfectly sets up a turn that leaves the audience spinning even twenty years later.\n\nThere are little details the could go unnoticed but confirm for me just how much thought was put into L.A. Confidential. Exley is chided by his superiors for wearing glasses as they think it makes him look weak. As the film develops and he gets more immersed in the Nite Owl case, his compulsions against violence and rash judgment start to waver about the same time he stops wearing his glasses, a subtle symbol of his difficulty to see things for what they truly are. I enjoyed that our introduction to Lynn is in a liquor store and she's wearing a winter cloak that strongly resembles a nun's habit. It's a memorable costuming choice and also suggest Lynn's penchant for straddling the line of devotion. The Patchett \"whatever your heart desires\" line of high-class prostitutes has allusions to our current media culture of celebrity worship and personalized sexual fantasies. It naturally ties into the exploitation of the dream factory of Hollywood that takes young ing\u00e9nues with dreams in their head and squashes them pitilessly. It's not the first film to explore the darker side of the film industry but that doesn't make its themes lesser.\n\nL.A. Confidential feels like the noir thrillers of old but stripped down to its essentials and given a new engine. It's something that celebrates noir thrillers of old and Old Hollywood but it isn't so lavish to either the genre or older time period that it loses sight of its own storytelling goals. The elaborate plot is complex and intensely engaging while still being accessible, populated with memorable and incredibly well developed characters, each given their own purpose and own insights that contribute to the larger whole. Hanson's lasting accomplishment is a near-perfect masterpiece to the power of story structure and characterization. The three lead detectives are compelling on their own terms and the movie keeps them separate long enough that when they do come together it feels like a payoff all its own. Hanson recreates the world of classic film noir and makes it his own, using new Hollywood to lovingly recreate Old Hollywood. It's the kind of movie I can watch again and again and discover new depths. It gave way to a wave of success for its participants. Hanson never quite delivered another movie on the level of L.A. Confidential, though I'll posit that In Her Shoes is an underrated character piece. Helgeland has become a go-to screenwriter for many projects low (The Postman) and high (Mystic River) and became a director for A Knight's Tale and 42. It's a movie that plays just as strongly today as it did almost twenty years ago, and that's the mesmerizing power of great storytelling and acting. L.A. Confidential is a lasting achievement that proves once more the power of our darker impulses. It's stylish, seductive, smart, subversive, and everything you could ask for in a movie.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

I watched it because of its similarities to a newer movie I had my eyes on \"The Nice Guys\", and while that film is good, this one takes the cake.  The perfectly capture that old school Film Noir feel, without being beholden to the time period. If it wasn't for some of the set details and props, this could be a movie set in 1997. Its based on a series of novels and never got a sequel. It is almost unlike anything else I've seen recently, as far as successful cop movies go. No stories in the 2010's have as much mystery and suspense in them.\n\nOf course there is corruption in the police force and one of our main characters is out to wade through all of that regardless of the consequences. The ensemble cast does a bang up job, with the new comers (at the time) Pierce and Crowe carrying this movie brilliantly and Kevin Spacey + Kim Basinger doing great work as well. Kim won an Oscar for her performance.  The eventual three-way romance was a little forced but this movie had a ton of things to do in 2 hours.  How could one forget Danny Devito? Playing a sleazy tabloid journalist, who still brings his brand of gravel voiced humor to this relatively serious role. \n\nLA Confidential had over 80 speaking roles and balances them well, with characters leaving their mark and eventually coming back up as a point of reference, moving the story forward. There were also many different plot threads that do not get too convoluted as the story goes, which is a problem with many films today. The mystery keeps you hanging on and an hour in you are still curious to who the antagonist is. But when you find out, you are then stuck with wondering how they would ever take them down.  The characters are flawed, real humans with motivations that many other cop movies have, but acted to perfection.",

            "content": "Radiating confidence beat for white knuckle beat, this expertly sharp shooted adaptation of James Ellroy's brilliantly Byzantine slice of L.A. Noir is as much a high-minded mystery as it is sinfully entertaining. One quarter of the crime fiction maestro's LA Quartet (The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, and White Jazz round out this A-Level book series), the novel is smart, serpentine, and seemingly too unwieldly to transcribe for the screen. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland, however, somehow hard-boils the dense puzzler and rich - practically living and breathing - characters at its center into a boozy black confection. Speaking of black, darkness bleeds into every frame - be it location or metaphorical - but this motion picture isn't steeped in shadows as a noir throwback. Rather, director Curtis Hanson frames the action with a very modern approach, naturalistic lighting and period detail as background but never lauded over at the front and center. No, that spot gets reserved for the hard-hitting star-making performances, be it Russell Crowe's feral blunt-force cop, Guy Pearce's bookish scheming detective, Kevin Spacey's slick angle-playing dick, James Cromwell's political blarney-spewing police captain, Danny DeVito's mischievious sleazy tabloid writer, or Kim Bassinger's manipulative femme fatale (deservedly Oscar-winning). The pace emerges as the true star, however. Impossibly, Hanson and Helgeland turn this ridiculously complex nearly 500-page thriller into a taut 138-minute police chase, cynicism and seduction fully intact.\n\nIn this R-rated detective tale set in 1950s LA, three policemen - one strait-laced (Pearce), one brutal (Crowe), and one sleazy (Spacey) - investigate a series of murders with their own brand of justice.\n\nChinatown rules this roost. That said, LA Confidential will always get compared with Roman Polanski's 1974 LA Noir classic, the crown jewel of hard-boiled detective tales on film. Whether a compliment or backhanded compliment, this comparison short-sights the shear genius of translating Ellroy's wholly unique style. Stripped down in words but somehow loaded with ripe, ridiculously researched detail, his prose seems spare but packs a deeply and multiply rooted punch. It's easy to characterize him as a Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler aping scribe, but his immersive plotting takes readers to an entirely new and involving mantle of crime writing. Granted, it's a dark cab ride but the fact that Hanson and Helgeland short-cut the dense wordsmithing without losing the pulp speaks highly of their adaptation. They capture his jazzy verve using a modern edge that pits us all on a 5-Star collision course with one of the most absorbing City of Fallen Angels films of all time.\n\nBottom line: Asphalt Jungle Love",

This film has a really great cast and everyone is fantastic, you have Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger and Danny De Vito. The acting is phenomenal and all the characters are very likable. Russell Crowe is fantastic as the hot head officer who doesn't follow the rules too much. Guy Pearce was amazing as the officer who just wants to do good and follow the rules, he was probably my favorite character in the film. Kevin Spacey was brilliant, I love how he starts the film as the asshole, fairly corrupt cop but by the end he's so likeable and one of the best characters. Kim Basinger is also brilliant, her character is somewhat cliche and she's not in it as much as I thought she would be but she was still great. This film is fantastically directed by Curtis Hanson, I can't think of anything else he's done but he directed this film so well. This movie gets the time period really well and it's also brilliantly shot and gorgeous to watch. This film is also really tense, there are loads of twists and turns and you have no clue who to trust. This is also really funny, there are some really funny bits with Kevin Spacey, there's also a really funny scene with Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey questioning a woman in a bar that was really funny. The finale of this film is brilliant, the hotel shoot out is great and the ending is very satisfying. L.A. Confidental is an amazing film that everyone should see. It has great acting, great writing, great direction, it's just a masterpiece and I can't really any think of any major problems. It's one of my favorite films. A+",

Maybe it's another case in which I'd have to see it when it first came out to really understand its influence.\n\nI enjoyed the second half a lot more than the first half. In general a lot of the movie was convoluted, although I blame myself more than the actual movie for not fully understanding how all the pieces fit together. I'd probably enjoy it more upon rewatch, because I felt a little disoriented throughout my first watch, trying to juggle the characters and motivations.\n\nEverything snapped more into place for me when Exley and Jack teamed up, and even more when Exley and Bud teamed up. I like the idea of having three different cop protagonists all involved in their own cases, exploring different leads that tie together in interesting ways (another thing that would undoubtedly fascinate me more during a second viewing). The various dynamics among the three men are interesting because there's no one who's completely likable. Exley is probably the most likable, with his strict morals, but he's also selfish and manipulates his bosses to get the promotion he desires. And stoic Bud is violent and occasionally seemingly unemotional, but his violence is for a good cause when he's putting away abusive husbands and rapists. So when Bud attacks Exley and then the two team up, it's satisfying and surprising, because each of the protagonists has been relegated to their own private storylines, investigating the same things in different ways.\n\nI liked the Exley and Bud team-up, and I like how the movie ended, especially with the climactic battle with them trapped inside the house. And I definitely liked Exley finally deciding to do something outside his strict moral code, shooting Dudley in cold blood because he knows Dudley would probably be able to weasel out of culpability. So though some of the movie was a bit hard for me to follow, and though Bud's survival at the end seems a little fakey, I definitely finished the movie with a positive opinion about it.",

What really makes this film shine is the fact that, even when the truth becomes obvious and there's no mystery left, I was still on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. I can't remember the last film that had me this engaged to the point where I couldn't stop watching even for a moment. I think at the time Guy Pearce was a relatively unknown actor, but this role was a perfect way to introduce himself to Hollywood. He plays Ed Exley with this intriguing mix of determination and integrity. You never know what to expect next from this character because he seems to be simultaneously interested only in himself, and interested in upholding the law to the letter. I've never been a huge fan of Russell Crowe's acting, but if you're going to use him, this kind of lunk-head enforcer role is great. He doesn't have to portray the kind of nuance that many of the other roles require, so he is excellent as Bud White. And I have learned to expect nothing less than perfection when movies have Kevin Spacey in the cast list. I don't even know what to say, but his performance as Jack Vincennes is 100% spot-on, even his mannerisms in the jailhouse brawl fit his character perfectly.\n\nThere's lots of other cast members I could go on and on about in L.A. Confidential. James Cromwell is great, Danny Devito is wonderful, etc. However the only flaw I found in the film was Kim Basinger. I was not impressed with her performance because she seems to hold only one or two expressions throughout the movie, and I struggled to ever pin down whether we were supposed to think she was having real emotional reactions or if everything was an act. Her entire role in the film felt somewhat tacked on as if we needed a femme fatale in order to further shoehorn this movie into the film noir genre. That's not to say I didn't appreciate some of the ways they incorporated her into the plot. Using her as the catalyst to get Bud White angry with Ed Exley was a stroke of scripting genius. In fact with all the praise I've heaped on the cast, the script writers deserve infinitely more. They crafted a great story that is loaded with unexpected twists and turns, and it holds together extremely well looking back on it. Many murder mysteries with plot twists tend to feel a bit contrived at some point and fail to make sense when you scrutinize them in any way. This seems like a film that will excite me just as much on a second viewing, and it is definitely one that I want to watch again. L.A. Confidential is a great film that was both thrilling and intriguing, and it made more than 2 hours fly by as if it was no time at all.",

And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of life back then, even compared to the original movies of that period, with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's. This overall thanks to its better elements is worth a look, but I don't feel it's the modern classic many claim it to be.",

            "content": "I finally watched the 1950's police drama L.A. Confidential. I am not a fan of police movies as the films are often ridiculous.  Setting the movie in the 50's offsets much of this problem for me as police work in the 50's is nothing like it is now, so the errors are not as glaring.  That may be one reason that I loved this movie despite the overall premise.\n\nThe movie is visually striking.  The cinematography and lighting are beautiful.  The set design and costumes are excellent.  Basinger's costumes and makeup were excellent.  \n \nThe film had great fleshed out characters.  Each of the protagonists had their flaws. Bud White (Crowe) has good intentions, but has fallen victim to noble cause corruption.  Jack Vincennes (Spacey) also wants to do the same thing but seeks the trappings of stardom and that he sees and is willing to bend the rules to achieve them.  Ed Exley (Pearce) comes across as the straightlaced idealist but in reality he is actually the most complex and pragmatic character.  He is unwilling to plant evidence or beat someone into confessing but he is willing to lie to cover up the truth if he can gain prestige by doing so.  They combine efforts to see that justice is served and the truth comes out; only to cover it up, ostensibly for the greater good.  Basinger was 44 when the film was released.  By Hollywood standards that is older for a sexy starlet.   The makeup and costuming choices for her showed that she is a little older but still amazing sexy.  The effect was to show that her character, a celebrity lookalike prostitute, is past her prime but still a beauty.  Her bedroom shows that she still wants to be the innocent dreamer she was when she left Arizona and headed to L.A.\n \nThe film is rich and highly entertaining.  I give it 5 / 5 (Must See).",

There are more twists and turns than on a rollercoaster, leading to some intriguing places.\n\nThe cast is top notch. The three cops are played by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, and they are backed by a strong supporting cast that includes Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Strathairn and Ron Rifkin. (For fans of \"The Mentalist\", it also features an early performance by Simon Baker).\n\nIt truly is a brilliant watch, and the stylish violence mixed with classic noir gives it a timeless feel.

The film' story is not easy to completely comprehend, there are details in there that could only be picked up if one has seen the film enough times and gives it the attention it deserves; I was only able to pick up a couple of things but I did find it difficult to wrap my entire brain around it, this was the same feeling I had when I first watched Chinatown. The film's plot is definitely interesting, one doesn't have to completely understand it to know that, and I was happy with the fact that the film doesn't repeat itself in order to remind us what the objective is; if you didn't pay enough attention then too bad. I guess I regretted not giving this film the attention it deserves. The film shows us the life of a policeman in Los Angeles, we are able to see it from all sides via its three protagonists; Jack Vincennes, Wendell \"Bud\" White, & Edmund Exley. The film establishes its characters through their actions rather than what they think or feel, as it never allows us to get in too deep with its characters. This approach allows us to feel immerse in its atmosphere rather than spend most of our time contemplating about our characters. Though I am not trying to say the characters are written in shallow fashion, as the film does spend enough time with them and allows each one to be distinguishable. Curtis Hanson, the film's director, is primarily more concerned with the film's look and feel rather than giving us something uniquely deep. The film takes inspirations from many of the classic film noirs and crime films, but elevates it to the standards of contemporary cinema. The first thing I noticed when coming into this film was its sense of style, one can truly feel its presence and the film knows it is trying to be homage to the noir/crime genre; the style definitely kept me engaged with the film, I didn't care if I only understood very little of the story because I was more interested in absorbing the cinematography handled by Dante Spinotti and score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The aspect of the film that impressed me the most is the acting. There are some damn good performances in this film, particularly Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. They played their roles with such intensity and also awareness, as Hanson wanted the slight banality in their performances to pay homage to the classic noir figures. I was a little disappointed with Kim Basinger as her performance felt a little empty, making it difficult for me to care for her character, regardless of how important she actually is to the plot. L.A. Confidential has its ups and its downs but the negatives aren't enough to stop me from wanting to go back to the world that Curtis Hanson has created here.",

Most have been a terrible year for supporting actress performances. \n\nAnd her character is probably my biggest flaw with the film. So bland. And yet we are supposed to see her appeal as to why the characters want her. OTHERWISE. I very good noir movie.",

Haven't seen such an accomplished cop thriller in a long time, I'd say that in \"L.A. Confidential\" the formula was polished to near perfection. Money, corruption, personal interests, crime, moral struggles, sex, media, public opinion and even Hollywood, many of the traditional ingredients of the genre are explored, albeit vulgarly, in a sapiently dense script. This movie overflows with contagious charm stemming from the mixture of typical Hollywood narrative profile, well acted characters, wonderful cinematography that flirts neo-noir visual, scenic style reminiscent of David O. Russel and Scorcese, soundtrack that couldn't possibly complement the pictures in motion any better and a captivating plot with the necessary twists. Although there's nothing really new here, the cinematic accomplishment of this movie never fails to keep me engaged in the story, either at the edge of my seat or in indulgent contemplation. All in all, everything very well crafted in a movie that rides us through unexpected ordeals against organised crime in the City of Angels. Directed by Curtis Hanson, \"L.A. Confidential\" is the ideal popcorn movie for me, entertains like few others, nothing distracts from the experience, it's accessible yet smart ... and has a very happy ending so it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings (just in case...). Jokes aside, top-notch entertainment hands in hands with fine cinematic craft cannot go wrong. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey very much, such a great talented actor playing Jack Vincennes with humor and charm to spare. Great stuff, recommended!",
