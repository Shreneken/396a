As the embodiment of the fifth element, Leeloo needs to combine with the other four to keep the approaching Great Evil from destroying the world. Together with Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) and zany broadcaster Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), Dallas must race against time and the wicked industrialist Zorg (Gary Oldman) to save humanity.",

The movie has dated badly, the jokes are not funny and the plot is about as solid as a wall constructed of egg yolks yet the movie does sort of pass the time in a way that a funeral can be viewed as high entertainment. The special effects may have been state of the art for the time but they have been so eclipsed now to render the cities in the sky as pie in the sky and the attempt at gender-bending may have been funny twenty years ago but borders on the offensive now. It was when I got to the part in which the supreme being after surfing the internet and learning the moves performed a Bruce Lee fight sequence I knew it was downhill all the way. Not so much a screwball affair as a plain and simple all-around screwing of poor ideas. Badly directed and pointless ramshackle ideas without meaning. Sorry, not for me.",

While Chris Tucker and many other things were a bit over the top, I appreciated a lot of the humor and thought that the story/mythology was clever. The sci fi action was done quite well in many scenes too. Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lister Jr., Lee Evans, and Brion James were all noteworthy cast members as well, as they are in everything. This came out the year I was born and it's hard to believe how far these kinds of movies have come, yet they won't make movies quite like this again and it's a little special because of that.",

The plot is a little thin perhaps but it's still quite entertaining. It has very much a comic book or graphic novel, type feel to it. The bad guys are typically over the top in terms of their performance but that's not entirely a bad thing. I can't say I fully followed all that was going on but I did find it pretty engrossing, in terms of seeing what was going on with various characters and the surroundings in scenes.

I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.\n\nThe script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.\n\nBesson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun. As is the acting, Bruce Willis is charismatic, Milla Jovovich is beautiful and Gary Oldman is the personification of haute-couture corruption.

            "content": "As the credits rolled at the end of The Fifth Element earlier today (the first time I'd ever seen it incidentally) I had to check Luc Besson's Imdb page. I was pretty sure he'd made many films since The Fifth Element, but my initial reaction was confusion. How had he managed such a back catalogue when whoever wrote The Fifth Element must have surely been sectioned immediately on the films release? \nOf course I should have realised earlier than I did, Besson was a producer on Taken and I've actually seen many of his films since The Fifth Element that I've inexplicably quite liked (Lockout, 2012, Lucy, 2014). Not to mention the fact that Besson was behind Leon (1995), undoubtedly his masterpiece to date.\nThe more I thought about the film, the more I liked it. It's Blade Runner on so many drugs that the death knell should be imminent, but the final blow never comes. The invention in the film is second to none, the early flying car chase is thrilling and the visuals back up its $93,000,000 budget. I was reminded of several films as well as Blade Runner, Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) is a touch point, and Star Wars is absolutely in the fabric of the film. The big difference between this and Star Wars however, is that The Fifth Element doesn't take itself seriously at all, and in that respect you feel fine laughing at it. When Star Wars is silly, you get frustrated at the fact that people take it very, very, very seriously. The presence of Ian Holm also reminds you of Alien (1979), and there's even a nod to Moonraker (1979) at the films conclusion. What also must be mentioned are the performances. Sure, Bruce Willis plays John McClane in what must now be looked back at as The Fifth Die Hard (that's a really good joke if you appreciate the 5th Die Hard film shouldn't exist for crimes against cinema) but Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker almost walk off with the film with outrageously brilliant performances. It's also highly amusing when Bruce Willis tells police he is not a human, he is identifying as a meat popsicle; and as a result avoids arrest. One wonders when The Fifth Element is inevitably released for a 25th anniversary next year, whether that joke is vaporized from existence to avoid inescapable offence. Deranged doesn't even begin to describe The Fifth Element, amongst scenes of cinematic carnage there are breathtaking visuals and wonderful performances. The only way to make your own mind up is to see it.",

And Chris Tucker, haha, wow! Then you add the insane brilliance and vision of Luc Besson and ground-breaking CGI for the time, and you'll have to agree it's way better than the rating.

            "content": "Enjoyable space romp with some dated elements.\n\nLuc Besson's science-fiction adventure comedy The Fifth Element (1997) is a truly deranged piece of cinematic history from the now infamous French filmmaker Besson. It starts off with an ultra serious sci-fi set-up only to immediately turn into a buddy comedy with some romantic comedy territory in the midst of this sci-fi adventure. I think Luc Besson directed a real classic with Leon: The Professional, but The Fifth Element is merely a fun movie. The CGI effects are really dated and corny. The dialogue is clunky and filled with pointed sci-fi jargon and exposition to justify nonsense on screen. There's so many cringe moments that don't work, especially with the jarring editing that's so late 90's, it's absurd. Overall, watch The Fifth Element for the Bruce Willis parts and I'm sure most viewers will find Milla endearing as the \"perfect\" woman Leeloo.\n\n It's quite funny and action packed due to Bruce Willis' charm as the taxi driver turned universal savior with a crush on the beautiful Milla Jovovich. Willis certainly elevates this picture with a charismatic leading man aura, funny comedic timing, and intense dramatic skill that he uses in bursts here and there. Jovovich is fun and playful with moments of tender vulnerability as Leeloo. I love her delivery of nonsense divine language talk that sounds like Latin, French, and Italian all at once. She's got nice chemistry with Willis. I do find it creepy that Besson left his wife for her, who he dated since she was 12 when he was 29. Besson infantilizes Leeloo with the baby talk and weird outfits too. It's even stranger to think that the blue diva opera singer is played by Luc Besson's wife at the time. The Fifth Element is truly strange.\n\nI have to mention Chris Tucker is just overacting the entire movie. He shows up more than halfway through as this gross parody of a drag queen with an obnoxious scream. He just shouts horrible dialogue and repeats himself with awkward buzzing and incessant yelling. I found maybe 5 lines of his funny with the rest nearly ruining The Fifth Element. In a movie with Gary Oldman chewing the scenery with his awful haircut and over the top Southern accent, Tucker is still more flamboyant and outrageous. This is seriously a strange picture, but many of the dated or annoying elements might be fun upon revisiting for new viewers.\n\nIn short, I cannot hate The Fifth Element. It tries so hard to make interesting sci-fi concepts out of nowhere, thrilling action sequences, and pleasant comedic adventures around space. I think Bruce Willis really saves The Fifth Element overall, but Milla Jovovich brings a realistic warmth. The scene where Leeloo watches war footage should be corny, but her tears make it a raw, emotional moment. Bruce Willis really used to try once upon a time.",

Great production values, great special effects, and some of the actors, like Chris Tucker and Bruce Willis, even put in some good performances.  However, I think the story and humor fall entirely flat for me.  There's not much realistic or creative about it considering it takes 300 years in the future.  I can't comprehend the audience score, because the audience is often more right about these things.  The critics score is too high because critics contradict practical reason.  In contrast, I much preferred the original Total Recall.  That movie had a cool little story, it was futuristic and held up way better.  So in conclusion, I can't stand this movie.  Unless I'm in a situation around a bunch of brain dead people watching this, I will absolutely never watch this again of my own free will.  The half star it gets is the credit I give it for special effects and some actors putting in hard work who have nothing to do with the epic atrocity that is this movie.  Do not waste your time. ",

I found that I admired it but I don't think it's on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Blade Runner (1982), although my mother would disagree on the latter, and I didn't feel passionate about it. The visual style, from the costumes to the special effects, were distinctive and beautiful and the direction was great as most of the film is mesmerizing. I would definitely recommend that people see the film and I would praise it for managing to balance a comedic tone with serious science fiction. The 1990s produced a lot of great films and I don't personally believe this reaches those heights but it's still a hugely enjoyable experience.\n\nKorben Dallas, Bruce Willis, is a taxi driver who has the \"Fifth Element\" fall into his taxi in the form of Leeloo, Mila Jovovich, who he immediately falls in love with and protects against the police. Priest Vito Cornelius, Ian Holm, has been waiting for the fifth element to appear since 1914, the film is set in 2263, and helps to educate Leeloo when Korben brings her to his door. The major villain is Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, Gary Oldman, who is under the control of the great evil and faces death if he is not able to attain the stones that will cause the great evil to be destroyed if combined. As the love between Korben and Leeloo continues to grow they have even more incentive to prevent the world from ending due to the great evil.\n\nJean-Paul Gaultier, legendary French fashion designer, was employed to design the costumes for the characters in this film and it shows as we see Willis in an orange mesh halter top one minute and Jovovich in \u00e2~bandages' the next. The whole affair has a French affectation to it that makes it look wonderfully outrageous and sophisticated, it's brightly colored and ostentatious but always classy. Along with this the visual style of the entire film is insane, it has touches of Logan's Run (1976) but is also all it's own. The flying cars, the concert halls and the villain's lairs are all lavishly set up and create a world that feels very constructed and self-conscious but so what? It's a wonderful, psychedelic vision straight out of Besson's head.\n\nThe performances were good enough for a film that requires them to do very little but I feel that Oldman was not particularly good as a villain. I had heard so much about how iconic this performance is and how scary but campy he manages to be. I just thought that his Southern accent was poor and he wasn't serious or campy enough to be very entertaining. The better respected British actor playing a villain in a Bruce Willis action movie was Alan Rickman in Die Hard (1988) as he is genuinely chilling but also funny in all of his little idiosyncrasies. Seeing Jovovich be used properly as an action lead was nice despite her being objectified at points and she manages to give the character she plays more personality than I imagine was on the page. Willis is solid and has nice chemistry with Jovovich and it was funny to see Holm in the same year as his brilliant performance in The Sweet Hereafter (1997) which is far more serious in it's tone.\n\nI didn't emotionally engage with the characters in the way I would have liked to, maybe it was the comedic tone and I don't think the film is trying to ask the sort of philosophical questions that Blade Runner is. It was because of this that I found the film to be entertaining but empty and even as I cheered at the sight of Korben and Leeloo engaging in physical contact in the pod at the end of the film I wasn't moved. That should not be a requirement for a film, some films exist purely to entertain and thank goodness but it is because of that that I don't see this as the classic that some people do.",

            "content": "In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for safekeeping from World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a Fifth Element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns. In 2263, the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), informs the President of the Federated Territories about the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has been directed by the great evil (sending messages as Mister Shadow) to acquire the element stones. The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, and the only \"survivor\" is a severed hand in a metal glove from the Fifth Element's sarcophagus that still contains some living cells. Human scientists take it to a New York City laboratory where they use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a former major in the special forces. Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, and it is revealed that she is the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, but had been entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores for their failure to obtain the stones, but the survivors determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro (Brion James), Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna in a flying luxury hotel..\n\nThe Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as an \"elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's Mission: Impossible.\" He concluded that The Fifth Element was \"a lot warmer, more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see.\" On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a \"thumbs up\"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it \"One of the great goofy movies\", and concluding, \"I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long.\" The film was, however, subject to a number of harsh reviews that expressed disapproval of its overblown style. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \"A largely misfired European attempt to make an American-style sci-fi spectacular, The Fifth Element consists of a hodgepodge of elements that don't comfortably coalesce.\" David Edelstein of Slate was even more critical, saying, \"It may or may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is one of the most unhinged.\"\n\n\"The Fifth Element\" is a poor poor sci-fi actioneer from Luc Besson which I saw at the movies when it came out. I remember reading about the fact that Luc Besson was going to make a sci-fi movie and how excited I was about that. But, my vision of this film was a cross between the dystopian and dark \"Blade Runner\" and something Moebius would draw. \"The Fifth Element\" is nowehere near this at least. This film is a pretentious multi coloured muppets in space saga with a wobbly storyline, wobbly acting, wobbly lines and it is just way too slapsticky for me. The characters are all one-dimensional and  flat as a wooden door. Bruce Willis seems lost, Chris Tucker is beyond annyoing, Gary Oldman is Herr Flick on drugs and Milla Jovovich adds not much to the film. Yes, some of the set designs are quite ok for being a 90s production and the vibe has something in it. But, nevertheless my verdict has not changed. I hated it when it came out, and I still hate it.",

Actually the movie exceeds my expectations. It's a thoroughly gleeful sci-fi/action romp brimming with creativity; marvellous inventive visuals, distinctive style and idiosyncratic tone, and splendid and utterly unique world-building.\n\nThe characters are quite relatable, and well-developed and have some reasonable depth into them, especially Leeloo, who brought to life by Milla Jovovich. Bruce Willis showed his solid action chops and plenty of stamina and charisma to make Korben Dallas a quite likable hero. Gary Oldman plays the villain of the movie, Zorg, and I think that his fantastic over-the top performance is more than enough to elevate his rather uneven character that was hindered by the decline of the plot's cleverness.\n\nThe movie also has an awesome utilization of its electrifying soundtrack in the action sequences, which are pretty cool!\n\nThe Fifth Element is a helluva fun time; but that doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb at all. In fact the movie has some surprisingly deep moments that work pretty well despite the fact that Luc Besson never wanted us to take his movie seriously. I can see now why many fans hated Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets!\n\n(8/10)",

Plus someone needs to tell Chris Tucker to get off my screen as he is incredibly annoying. The Fifth Element uses one of the newest tricks in the science fiction motion picture handbook: perform a visual and aural assault on viewers in the vain hope that they won't notice the lack of substance, logic, and intelligence. For a few recent examples of where this tactic has been employed, check out Stargate and Independence Day. The Fifth Element, the summer of 1997's first big-budget disappointment, is right at home in such company. A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script. Once The Fifth Element's assault on the senses starts to wear off, it's easy to become restless. After all, in keeping with the \"epic\" sweep demanded by such an obese budget, the film had to clock in at over two hours, even though there's no excuse for a movie with so little going on to last for so long. (Gorgeous visuals but annoying story and a certain character).",

It's well produced, well directed and brilliantly written. Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker, Mila Jovavich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman deliver perfomances and characters you'll never forget.",

            "content": "Visually unique, content wise cheap\nFrom a visual point of view, this film is one of the most impressive of my life, every second looks like a painting. The movie sets the colors the props everything is beautiful. Although I do not always like the costumes and I want to ask a few questions in some design decisions, I would say that the movie is a masterpiece. (From a visual point of view)\nBut then he is pulled down by the fact that the script looks as if it had written a small child or comes from a children's book. The narrative style, the narrative structure everything is cooked really soft and fade the characters are quite okay but the dialogues are, please do not misunderstand, too stupid for science fiction. Especially during the climax I had the feeling that every moment \"Dora the Explorer\" shows up and asks for me help.\n\nHowever, I think Dora got lost in the plot holes, no plot caves. Not every story has to be infinitely complicated but if you make a movie out of it, we expect it to be a movie and if this movie has a PG-13, then I'll rate that as well. I am against the age restrictions, but even as a 13 year old boy would this cheap narrative + black and white representation of good and evil bother me tremendously.\n\nThe story is the most important thing that makes a good movie and when I get such a \"My Little Pony Fanfiction\" that even my 5 year old cousin finds miserable mixed with costumes and furniture that belong in a museum, then I get headaches, depressions and gripes at the same time. I think it's a pity that all these wonderful set pieces and technological details are stuck between this crap of script. I'd rather have a movie with a fantastic script and awful flaws than the other way around.\n\nBruce Willis is fantastic as always he could play a Nazi and I would still like the man. Chris Tucker is unbearable but Milla Jovovich has anything in this performance which just fills me with hate.\nI do not know what it is, whether it's her voice her costume or the way she talks like a baby, something annoys me so much that I always want to skip her parts because I'm afraid I'm going to go crazy. I like Gary Oldman but here he is totally wasted in this movie Zorg is a totally superfluous character that has no (major) impact on the course of the story.\n\nIt's also really difficult to assign a fixed genre to this movie, what is it? Is this Comedy Action, SciFi Action, SciFi Comedy? Is it satire, is it serious or a costume orgy?\n\nPS: A lot of people like that the protagonist and antagonist never meet firstly Zorg is not the antagonist but only a lackey from the real villain, we never met our hero, Korben Dallas do not know about Zorg's existence or its influence the whole thing. That's why it's not worth mentioning.\nI like that the film has a theme of 5 that is a nice Easter Egg what I did not notice the first time.But on the other hand film has two TV troops I loathe as a solution to the problems.\n\nMy conclusion: applause for Luc Besson ideas and cinematography but I can do without his films.",

Chris Tucker does give a good performance Ruby Rhod, but his character is way too over-the-top, which is saying something considering the rest of the movie, and honestly he's just unintentionally annoying.

The movie has a pretty good story that will keep you interested in whats going on as well as it has great action moments. The visuals are fantastic and the practical aliens looks great as well. The movie is very funny and Chris Tucker is one of the best parts of this movie with his hilarious persona.

He goes to get the stones and when he finally reaches his ship he opens the case and there not there it's classic. \n\nHighly recommend this! It's action packed, funny as hell, great opera/music throughout and the sets that were created with technology in the late 90s makes its pop. It's stylish and over the top even lame but all in a good way.",

Like the rest of Besson's filmography, The Fifth Element is jam packed with visual style and flair, amplified even more so this time due to the sci-fi nature of the film, but never sacrifices the integrity of the story or characters. The tale of Korben Dallas and Leeloo may not pack the same punch as the stories of Nikita or L\u00e9on and Mathilda, but the two are likeable enough to keep things engaging. The performances from Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich certainly help in that regard. Willis brings the same charisma seen in his performance(s) as John McClane, and makes for a charming yet physically capable lead. It's Jovovich who really shines, though: Leeloo is endlessly adorable, often painfully so, but, like Korben Dallas, she packs a punch when necessary. Jovovich manages all of this with an amazing performance that often requires little or no dialogue (she doesn't even speak English until midway through the film). Gary Oldman also turns in a delightfully hammy performance as the film's villain, akin to his performance in Besson's The Professional. Besson's direction is as sharp as ever, and the part-Blade Runner part-French comics inspired visuals he's added this time hold up really well. The Fifth Element is another solid entry in Besson's filmography.",

Bruce Willis is great in this, and Milla Jovovich is not that bad in this. The effects are still fantastic to look at, I like the worlds that the filmmakers created, and the creature designs look really good. Chris Tucker was decent at first, but then he turned into a whiny drama queen which there were some chuckles from him, but it was really annoying and embarrassing at times. There are some stereotypes that seems to be a bit racist at times. The action is really good, and the writing is not bad, although really silly at times which they make it as a funny moment, but juts seems to be awkward. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich is pretty sweet, and there are some funny moments in there between them two.

The only weapon capable of stopping this evil is the four classical elements with an additional fifth one that is represented as a supreme and perfect being named Leelo thus a quest begins where a taxicab named Korben Dallas needs to fulfill Leelo\u00b4s destiny.  \nIf you ask a number of people their opinion regarding \"The Fifth Element\" you will either get two answers: \"I love it\" or \"I hate it\", so I will try to explain why this film is known for polarizing both audiences and critics. \"The Fifth Element\" is a filmed that guarantees a fun time thanks to its fun to watch acting with the highlight being the masterful Gary Oldman in a role so silly that he seems to be having the time of his life, creative visuals, laughable dialog, hilarious setups, a irreverent directing, memorable moments, a straightforward narrative, a ridiculously goofy but fun art design, and a tricky camp factor that's executed with efficiency. But this film also counts with numerous elements that audiences will most find annoying: Chris Tucker\u00b4s character is one of the most annoying characters ever put to film, the story is filled with clich\u00e9s, at times director Luc Besson crosses the line between camp and ridicule, the action scenes are laughable, and not in a good way; the running gags quickly got old, and more than a handful of scenes are stretch without any purpose whatsoever.\n\"The Fifth Element\" is a memorable and unique film that is definitely not for everybody but if you enjoy comedies and just want to have a nice time, this is a film made for your demands but if you are a person that demands quality and high level filmmaking you should skip this film.",

The movie is visually inventive, imagining a metropolis that is plausible within the next century consisting of great imaginative elements. The movie is laced with slapstick and humor takes up a great deal of the film to the point it makes the plot look preposterous and the characters goofy diluting the seemingly deep theme.\n\nThe story cannot be more epic in nature, science fiction going apocalyptic with a messiah figure who can save the world and also happens to be a badass fighter as well as someone who needs the love of Bruce Willis to do her job. The plot goes chaotic because of lack of communication and co-ordination on both sides of the spectrum-- which results in the goofiness of the plot and adds humor.\n\nThe characters lose their seriousness simultaneously as the plot beguns to spin out of control. Bruce Willis is the action hero who pulls off dangerous stunts and causes havoc with his firepower and fools with enemies with his quick wit-- the typical Bruce Willis typecast. Gary Oldman is a ridiculous villain who has a very sinister look but has a horrible group of henchmen and eventually has to do everything himself. And the most outlandish character ever played--Chris Tucker as a cross dressing talk show host who is no more than a comic relief and a bit of annoyance, nevertheless the character is a very memorable one for his quirkiness. \n\nThe visual imagination of the film has to be praised for they have created a future that is plausible, especially that of the gigantic metropolis and its mobile hotels and flying cars..a vision reminiscent  Gilliam had conceived in Brazil. Overcrowded apartments and a layer of smog that cover s the foundation of every single megastructure, seems like the inevitable future that the present day earth is heading towards. The aliens are Stars Wars like with bizarre creatures with orc lke figures and fly masks, blue tubular beings..seeming unsettling and humorous at the same time.\n\nThe fifth element is an action/sci-fi flick but whit a plot that consummates with the climax but an initial scope of an interstellar franchise, that was way beyond Besson's imaginative realm. It cannot be taken seriously ever instead as a tribute to the sci fi genre and the excitement it offers us and as a lesson of how it can be convoluted into a goofy story that we are happy to get along for the ride.",

I highly recommend. [revised] This movie is bright, vibrant, and just simply amazing. Brion James is someone I always liked ever since a young boy after seeing Tango and Cash and I was sad to hear of his passing after seeing this film. This movie also taught me who Ian Holm and Gary Oldman were, as I didn't know them by name before this. I can't believe Luke Perry is mentioned in the opening credits and after he trips on a bag is forever forgotten. I do like all the performances of the actors and casting choices. I think whoever did costumes for this film should have been paid more. Costumes are over the top and crazy, but look great in this world. The score of the film is great and I love the soundtrack as well. Music is a driving factor in many scenes and it's done masterfully. Great story, great screenplay, great director, and that's just one guy? This story tells us that even though people are self-murdering, mass destructors, there will always be a savior of some kind to save us from evil so we can kill another day.",

Seeing this film for the second time, I still feel the film contains those qualities but I was able to find more enjoyment in it this time due to my preconceived knowledge of the film and my mind isn't as uptight as it once was back then.\n\nThe film's plot is certainly predictable but I was able to have fun with this due to Luc Besson's light direction, embracing the story's seriousness and pushing some moments to the point where it is actually comes out comedic. Besson does at some points, push the comedy a bit too far and ultimately hurting my feelings towards the film in the process but it wasn't abundant enough for me to feel cold towards it; an example of a poorly handled comedic scene was the one that involves an opera, it leads you on in one direction then suddenly diverts it to another which left me cringing.\n\nBesson was able to sneak in a couple of significant themes, and true they do come off as a bit forced particularly the one found in the film's resolution but I was able to get past that and saw it as an aspect that prevented the film from feeling pointless. Would the film be much better if it turned down its fun and superficial qualities, and letting the film take its content more seriously? Probably, but that wouldn't be what Besson wanted. I think his goal here was to create a film that brings in the films that made an impact on him and have them wrap around a simple story; If one looks carefully, actually one doesn't even try as most of them are quite obvious, but it pokes fun or pays homage to classics like Alien, Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner, to name a few.\n\nThe film's characters were certainly one of the film's strongest aspects. Some of them may seem ridiculous, like Zorg and Ruby Rhod, but since the film is somewhat conscious of this, it makes it easier to tolerate them. The two leading characters, Korben and Leeloo, are certainly the main reasons why I watch this as the film provides its audience with a tender romance and dialogue that steadily entertains. Though I did hope for some of these characters to show a little more depth but I think that would be asking too much from a film like this.\n\nThe acting in this film was good but far from being astonishing. One can easily see the fun that the cast is having in playing their roles but also providing their roles with enough effort to make their roles feel three dimensional. If I had to nit-pick, I felt Chris Tucker was a tad bit too overwhelming for my tastes, but I only feel this in a few of his scenes as for the most part, he was able to deliver some laughs from me.\n\nThe Fifth Element is certainly not Luc Besson's best but it his most superficially entertaining film. Its sole purpose is to have its audience escape from reality and just have a good time, so if you are looking for some with a bit of substance then look away as this would be a horrible choice. I found enjoyment in this film during my second viewing and I think it'll grow the more I come back to this film.",

The film actually follows futuristic cab driver Bruce Willis getting caught up in working with the secret society when Milla Jovovich literally falls into his cab. From there, the film is a breezy stream of action set pieces, including flying car chases, wild shootouts and epic space battles. The film's villain is a scene chewing Gary Oldman as the evil Zorg, who actually never comes fact-to-face with the hero, Willis. What makes this film work so well is that it knows it's a popcorn film and has no pretenses of grandeur (as compared to Star Wars episodes 1, 2, & 3) and that Besson's vision of the future is a rich, living and well thought out place. Besson began writing the script while a teenager and I think it's the amount of time he's thought about this story that led to so many ideas about how this future world works, even if it's just a quick thruway moment like a retractable shower or even the more thought out mythology of the titular fifth element, viewer can really tell Besson has thought about this world quite a lot. Besides Willis, Jovovich and Oldman there's a great supporting cast that includes  Ian Holm, Luke Perry, Brion James, John Neville and Tiny Lister as the biggest President of the United State you've ever seen on film. I've never been a Chris Tucker, so his purposefully annoying character came off as more grating than funny and was a real drag on the last act of the film for me. Other than that, I quite like this film, though it's still nowhere as great at \"The Professional.\"",

Throw in a bunch of weird and just plain stupid moments such as blue chicks singing opera for twenty minutes and Gary Oldman delivering terrible dialogue in his worst performance ever and you have a true stink-pile. The film also has the single most annoying character ever: Ruby Rhod, played by Chris Tucker. The fact that Bruce Willis actually tried in this role and gave a great action hero performance just annoys me more because it goes to waste when the film is this awful. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element is a fully enjoyable, lighthearted and fast-paced Sci-fi adventure which has borrowed stylistic and visual elements from other classic science fiction productions such as Blade Runner and Star Trek. To very shortly sum up the odd story of the film, it depicts a future society where former special-ops major, Korben Dallas played by Bruce Willis is working as a taxi-driver after resigning from the military. A destructive entity is threatening earth and impending doom seems unavoidable, but the event have been foreseen by priests and an alien race called  Mondoshawans and these aliens have created a weapon against the destructive entity in the form of a supreme being called the fifth element. As the result of a series of incidental events the fifth element also known a Leeloo played by Milla Jovovich happens to find herself in Korbens cab and sooner than he knows, Korben becomes involved in a mission to save all of mankind. \r\n\r\nI generally tend to dislike campy movies, but i can't really say if this particular film would be better if it took a more serious tone or if the goofiness is such a big part of the films entertainment value that it would suffer without it. The casting is more or less optimal, Bruce Willis is as great as always playing the every day action hero and Milla Jovovich pulls of a very difficult role as the supreme being Leeloo, Gary Oldman gives a very strange performance which fits well with the film and Ian Holm plays a future priest and last of we have Chris Tucker who plays a future radio DJ, a role which is partially an annoying stereotype that takes up too much space in the film, but equally much a source of humor. This isn't the usual type of Science-fiction and it doesn't focus that much on modern issues nor does it get political, but on a few occasions the director takes some satirical strikes at commercialism and the film makes some very interesting points concerning the nature of humanity and our inability to view ourselves objectively.",

The Fifth Element does none of that opting to be a simple and very odd film that entertains from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Element is about a cab driver unwittingly becoming the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr. Zorg at bay. The plot is undoubtedly simple on all corners. It contains the basic good vs. evil scenario in its background with the adventure to obtain mystical objects to save the Earth from a large threat in the foreground. It doesn't do anything new with it basic formula nor is it filled with surprises, but contains interesting ideas and characters. The characters are all vibrant even the villain himself is appropriately comedic. The comedy on the other hand can drag the film. Forcing some comedic antics to drag on a joke longer than it needs to with these overlong segment stretching the run time. It's playful tone makes it an easy viewing. Parodying the the conventions and convoluted nature of the genre it fondly does so with respect. It is itself convoluted too, but it's brisk pace makes its incoherence possible to look past. What's not possible to overlook is the antagonist motivation which is being paid millions find these crystals to destroy everything in the universe. Idiotic yes it is, but the as a whole it does so with it tongue in cheek nature. \r\n\r\nThe cast of actors is significantly better than the film script. If anyone can play the average joe hero in your action movie few can do it better than Bruce Willis. He firmly places his tongue in his cheek with a sarcastic attitude. Cracking jokes one moment and blowing up aliens the next. Gary Oldman performance is not necessarily bad. He's very hammy in his role, but works with the humor of the film. Milla Jovovich pulled off a difficult role well. It's easy to laugh at Jovovich dialogue and her rather odd childlike behavior. She's still is able to be convincing in her scenes whether it be comedic or dramatic. Ian Holm brings (like most of the cast) good humor with him in his simple role. Chris Tucker on the other hand will gather a mix response. He's very flamboyant and loud coming off as funny for some and annoying for others. Although it doesn't help matters that his character serves the plot no favors. Besson imaginative direction is the best part of the film. His vision of the future is full of bright colors with a right mixture of CG and practical effects. The detailed costumes design while goofy looking adds personality to the strange world.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Element while not an intelligent or a coherent sci-fi is fun enough to pass the time. The good selection actors and vibrant visuals will win you over even if the plot does not.",

Then aliens arrive and warn them to collect four stones that resemble the four basic elements (air, fire, earth, water) - also warning them that their Earth is no longer safe. Three centuries later, scientist-holy man Victor Cornelius played by Ian Holm declares that along with the four elemental stones, they must also find the fifth element and combine them all to prevent the Earth from being destroyed otherwise, if  the force of evil presents itself to the stones instead, the evil Zorg played by Gary Oldman will trigger the disaster. In the 23rd century, a huge ball of molten lava and flame is hurtling towards the Earth and the fifth element turns out to be a girl named Leeloo played by Milla Jovovich. Despite her remarkable powers, she needs help as she falls into a taxi owned by Korben Dallas played by Bruce Willis who promises to protect her and help her survive. Now everyone had mixed opinions after watching this film but for me, I thought this movie was somewhat good. Bruce Willis has taken a dramatic step forward with his career back then. This science-fiction opera-style film is one primary example on how to make a futuristic movie. Gary Oldman was a good villain and I guess the hairstyle and make-up covers him accurately well. Ian Holm was a great scientist-holy man as he had a great character to work with. This may be crazy but this is actually the first and only time I actually liked Milla Jovovich in this movie. She was a proper 3-Dimensional character and not just a sex object, even if she was hot at times, and I saw her able to act. People often criticized the goofiness of this movie and for me, I know it was goofy at times and that didn't bother me. What bothered me the most and killed the potential full marks from this movie is Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod! Jesus was he annoying! If you thought Detective James Carter from the Rush Hour movies was obnoxious, then you need a brain scan! Everything was awesome and was a visual spectacle except for him. The Fifth Element gets a 8.7/10.",

Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ.

However, his character is probably the most plot-wise /correct/ annoying character that Tucker has ever performed; the character actually seems somewhat believable in it's universe, no matter how annoying he is, especially compared to every other Tucker role I can bring to mind.\n\nPerhaps one of the admirable feats is that the special effects/eye candy still mostly holds up in this day and age, 16 years later, which is no small feat for a sci-fi flick, in fact, I would say that no other sci-fi movie has held up as long.\n\nIn summary; average acting and directing, average to slightly below par plot, superbly thought through universe and (still) great eye candy, which actually amounts to one of the best alien-sci-fi flicks to this date.",

People know him for having this charisma that draws people toward one of his movies and he even has the rare quality of being able to create an enjoyable movie just from his presence in it. These characteristics stem from a long filmography of some of the most beloved films of all time (Die Hard, The Sixth Sense) and I think that this movie is one of the main reasons of why he has been so loved.\nThis is a fun movie. That's it, it's a fun movie and I highly recommend anyone check it out. Don't expect it to challenge your mind, but still expect it to entertain and have fun doing it. It's also a really over the top movie which is a make or break for some people. In my opinion, I don't mind an over the top film (Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor). So beware of the bizarre events and characters that are in this movie, everyone is brought up to a ten on the acting scale in this, especially Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich.  But that all adds to the fun. I actually thought that Gary Oldman did the best job in this movie. \nThe effects were also very impressive for the time period and so were the action sequences. I think most of the effects were practical but the actually CG and stuff looked pretty good, being from 1997. But the practical effects were great. The costumes and set pieces were really cool. I really enjoyed that stuff but I also enjoyed the action sequences too. They reminded me a lot of Die Hard. I think that was what they were going for, Die Hard in space and they did it, with style. Near the end of it when Bruce Willis and the radio DJ (who was the most over the top for sure) were killing the aliens in the cruise ship was especially exciting. I loved it!\nI was pleasantly surprised with this movie. The effects were very good, and the acting was actually  pretty good (for sure enjoyable). I'm just a big fan of movies like like this. Ones that are so gleefully over the top and can laugh at themselves when they need to, and you can laugh at it too. It never does take itself that seriously and it really brings something to it that a lot of films don't, entertainment. I could totally see this movie being that Star Wars rip-off that just gets lost with time, but it's not and this is a pretty infamous movie. It doesn't try to be interestingly directed or daringly artistic, it just goes to entertain, and it entertains the hell out of you.",

Featuring Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker, the cast is quite strong.  Willis and Jovovich in particular bring a lot of charisma to the film and deliver fantastic performances.  Additionally, the visual aesthetics and set designs are amazing, creating an imaginative and vibrant universe.  The humor and satire of the film also work especially well.  The Fifth Element is a fun and lighthearted film that's tremendously entertaining.",

            "content": "A great film to watch over and over again. Taking a journy into the future is a thrill when it is filled with action. The story of the fifth element is definatley an adventure. Mila Jovovich plays the fifth element and it is surprising as a main element is a woman. I guess this world really cannot survive with them. Gary Oldman playing the villian does a well done job. He keeps a straight face and is determined to get what he wants. Chris Tucker is hilarious when he plays a talk show host. His hair, makeup and wardrobe is  so funny. When all the guns are going off, all he seems to be doing is screaming and in a serious panic mode. Lastly Bruce Willis as the cab driver that saves the world. Truely a story about the little man who can become the hero and save the world.",

It doesn't take itself too seriously unlike most sci-fi flicks; it blends comedy and drama seamlessly. The Fifth Element shines in the character development and dialogue; these characters are lovable in their own ways and each has a way of conversation that never makes this movie dull. No wonder it's a cult classic.",

He directs every frame with ostentatiousness and ecstasy for his $90 million comic book ideas, but the cut-rate writing is a trait all his films share, not just this one. Still, it's fun in the disposable way a cartoon is, featuring what have got to be among the goofiest costumes and aliens in any non-parody sci-fi film of the '90s, while the chases seem inspired by The Blues Brothers in the air as opposed to any visionary sense of flying cars of the future.",

            "content": "Being one of the most succesful films in the careers of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson, The Fifth Element sounded like a gleefully fun science fiction film.\n\nThe intro scene to The Fifth Element does not set it up as being an original film. Borrowing elements from Star Wars, Stargate and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the feature begins as a trifector of derivative elements from Star-themed science fiction titles. After seeming like it is going to take itself too seriously, the film quickly changes and embraces its cinema du look roots. The sudden shift is somewhat jarring, but the moment that Bruce Willis enters the screen encapsulates the exact point in time that the comic energy overtakes the material. But that isn't the only time it happens. There is never a sense of consistency in the mood of The Fifth Element because it can't decide whether it wants to be a legitimate science fiction feature or a parody of one. This ultimately creates a sense of imbalance in the film.\nThe scale of the film is also inconsistent. The story takes place in a limited series of settings with occasional larger scale shot depicting spaceships at war or flying car chases, but I honestly don't feel that I believe the wider universe of the narrative to be convincing. This is largely because there is little transition between locations with the speedy narrative simply cutting from one place to another without spending enough time in one. And since the film has the potential to have big scale locations capitalized on, the fact that it fails to do so more often ultimately ends up frustrating. But I will admit that even though I didn't full believe it, I did find joy in the visual experience. Luc Besson's vision of a science fiction future is packed with all kinds of flash. Sticking with the conventions of the cinema du look movement, The Fifth Element maintains a gritty story context and a sense of flashy colour to combat it. The society is seen as very damaged yet covered up by the facade of colour, and it provides an interesting experience. There are all kinds of awesome technological concepts and designs put into the film which use strong practical effects. But also, there are some awesome moments such as the flying taxi chase or space battle scenes that put the quality of the visual effects to maximum use. The detailed animation in these moments is very impressive and the colour is just marvellous, but at the same time the film is not ovverreliant on them and instead moderates them with use of practical effects and colourful scenery to fuel the experience.  But one thing that stood out for me was that the design of the Mondoshawans is just plain weird. Though the story characterizes them as being the species that guards the ultimate weapon for Earth, they look like gigantic chickens in robot suits who walk like sumo wrestlers. They clearly represent the more dramatic aspects of the film but are hard to take seriously, and even though they are only present for a brief period of screen time they interfere with the credibility of the experience.\nStill, the ultimate flaw of The Fifth Element lies in the fact that Luc Besson doesn't divert his large budget to the right cause. With $90 million to helm, Luc Besson is so bent on showing off all these ideas for a future that he forgets to put enough action into the film. The action scenes in The Fifth Element make strong use of the film's production elements which are all captured with strong cinematography and timely editing, but that just makes it all the more frustrating when there is not enough of them. The same can be said about the big budget CGI scenes, but budgetary limitations can explain that. They cannot explain the lack of more action choreography though, and the fact that the cast clearly have a fun time engaging in warfare simply makes the film less satisfactory when the action is lacking in quantity. That is the ultimate drag for the experience, and it means that there is ultimately not enough to distract from the tonal inconsistencies and cheesy screenplay.\nThe one thing that did make a strong impression for me in The Fifth Element was the cast.\nSince Bruce Willis started out his career working largely in comedy on the series Moonlighting before hitting it big as an action star in Die Hard. In The Fifth Element, he is given the role of Korben Dallas where he has to amalgamate these skills into a singular character. As a result, he delivers one of his best performances in years. Though his over the top energy is more restrained than the surrounding cast, this proves ideal because it lets him succeed as a legitimate action hero and a cheesy adventure man at the same time. He proves to capture Luc Besson's character with a strong combination between his instinctive masculine charisma and a touch of camp energy, standing out as one of the best parts of the film.\nMill Jovovich also makes a decent effort. It's easy to see how one might be polarized by the performance of Milla Jovovich. She is constantly lost in her own world, speaking a language she actually invented for the film. But considering her characters is actually a humanoid reconstruction of the titular fifth element there is genuinely little materal to work with. Fortunately enough, she manages to capture an alien-type figure who balances both frailty with fierce strength. Milla Jovovich is able to convey both the childish innocence of a new creation and the wisdom of a fast learner at the same time, and her dedication to staying in character remains a boost for her credibility.\nGary Oldman is awesome as always. Even though he has to shave half his head, comb over the other half and use a southern accent all for his character, Gary Oldman is the kind of actor who can pull anything off. So when he re-teams with Luc Besson to create another villain after Leaon: The Professional, it is no surprise that he pulls it off. Gary Oldman sinks his tenacious teeth into the ridiculous flamboyance of the role and captures a hilarious contrast between the way his character looks and acts. His surface level appeal is hilarious, as is the novelty that it is actually Gary Oldman in the role, and yet the actor still manages to successfully work a legitimate effort into the part.\nChris Tucker does not have the same level of appeal though. Chris Tucker transcends the level of flamboyance delivered by everyone else in the cast, for better and for worse. While his abundance of campy energy delivers sporadic laughs, it is so unstoppable that it proves overwhelming. Chris Tucker's insistence on shouting every line manages to create a convincing character, but not so much an entertaining one. He doesn't have the slightest bit of subtlty about him as he loudly and repeatedly shoots every character with one line after the other but failing to come up with any reason why it matters. Chris Tucker is in heavy excess in The Fifth Element, and it's the first time I've ever seen him as annoying.\n\nSo The Fifth Element has a talented cast and plenty of colourful gusto, but its overblown visual style is dragged down by a lack of action and a jarring sense of tonal inconsistency",
