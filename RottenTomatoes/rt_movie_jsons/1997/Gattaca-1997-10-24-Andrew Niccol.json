    "summary": "Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) has always fantasized about traveling into outer space, but is grounded by his status as a genetically inferior \"in-valid.\" He decides to fight his fate by purchasing the genes of Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a laboratory-engineered \"valid.\" He assumes Jerome's DNA identity and joins the Gattaca space program, where he falls in love with Irene (Uma Thurman). An investigation into the death of a Gattaca officer (Gore Vidal) complicates Vincent's plans.",

Masterful acting by the entire cast with the standout being Ethan Hawke who has the presence of James Bond and never comes across as self righteous or arrogant. Perfectly walking the line of determined and confident but also charming and grounded. The cinematography is very good with great camera work, memorable settings, and a very intimate Sci-Fi story that doesn't rely on massive space battles, cool tech, or epic scenery but purposeful scenes and focuses on telling the story rather than building an immersive world. A very rare occurrence in this genre. It really immerses you with the incredible witty and intelligent dialogue throughout and the science. The only minor complaint is sometimes the backgrounds can be a bit dull and maybe should have more color. This really is a movie that puts the \"Science\" in Sci-Fi. The music is very good also although I wouldn't call any of it memorable or catchy but used very well. This film shines in its masterful editing and deliberate but perfect pacing. There is no battles or crazy alien encounters in this or any explosions. Just a incredible script, incredible dialogue, and masterful acting the whole way through loaded with tons of underlying commentary about discrimination, chance and genetics. This is definitely a film everyone should see once.",

            "content": "Gattaca is a smart and well done science-fiction film that tells a disturbing and seemingly more and more realistic story of mankind's evolution and the future of scientific research in regards to our fetility. The film stars Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman who both work at the space facility Gattaca. Unlike their peers however they were born the old-fashioned way whereas the elite at the academy were born using scientific techniques to weed out any imperfections in their genetic code. They can run farther, see better, are the ideal image of man but they don't have the unrelenting perserverance of Vincent (Ethan Hawke). Since he was a boy he dreamed of visiting the stars and though the futuristic world deems these \"normal\" people as second-rate citizens, he won't let this dampen his dream. Vincent sets out to get into Gattaca, the real position he seeks not the janitor position he is currently at, and after befriending Jerome (Jude Law) he sees this as a chance to meet his destiny. Jerome was born as one of these elite citizens with perfection bred into him and yet after much success was paralyzed in a seemingly self-inflicted car accident and as such works out a deal with Jerome to give his genetic material in return for money and the lifestyle he is accustomed too. Using genetic technology Vincent uses Jerome's blood and fingerprint copies as well as urine and other genetic markers to pass for Jerome at Gattaca. When a murder occurs at Gattaca though a detective working with Vincent's brother is called in to investigate and Vincent's inferior coded eyelash is found at the scene, and while unknown when compared to the current employees it seems they are on his trail. Vincent must confront himself and those few he trusts against societies views on inferior genetics and push to see his lifelong dream a reality before he is discovered and potentially jailed for a murder along with the impersonating someone of better genetic code.\n\"Gattaca\" is both smartly written and suspenseful throughout it's running time and a very thought-provoking work. As technology and genetics advance in the fields of medicine and science, this seemingly fictional plot becomes more and more realistic and concerning. The performances are solid and the script is well paced and meticulously paced. It delivers a perfect balance of action with substance and makes for an entertaining and thoughtful film",

            "content": "I just watched GATTACA for the fourth time. So that should tell you that I'm a fan of this movie. By the way, the title comes from our genetic code which is \"written\" in a four letter code that makes up all DNA. It consists of the letters G,A,T, and C. The producer played around with the letters until they spelled something close to a word: GATTACA. Very clever. And it is appropriate because this movie is all about being more than your genetic code says you can be. You are not just your code. You are your dreams! As for the movie itself, yes, the plot has holes, and yes, some people act so selflessly (not selfishly) that they are not quite believable. But, as they say in comedy, \"If you buy the premise (the set up), you buy the bit (the comedy routine)\". I bought the premise. Why did I like it so much? Because it creates a MOOD. It creates a world where most of us would like to live. It's a world where your dreams can come true: romance, adventure, love. All it takes is believing in yourself. It's a theme running through almost every Disney movie. What creates the mood in this movie? The actors are perfectly cast; the music underlines every emotion; the sets are appropriately futuristic; the screenplay is well written. All the pieces fit. Except for the logic flaws in the script. But they are forgivable in service to the story. You may like it more or less than me, but I can say with great probability, you won't think you wasted two hours you'll never get back.",

            "content": "What a breathtaking film about reaching beyond your fate.\n\nAfter seeing Andrew Niccol's science-fiction crime drama Gattaca (1997) over 5 times now, I continue to have my mind blown everytime I see it. I appreciate it more now too after really understanding the concept and commentary Gattaca is going for here in terms of racial and ethnic science justifying discrimination in humanity's future. Andrew Niccol's script is intricately plotted around a future fraud crime committed by an imperfect man raging against a society in a man made perfect world. Gattaca is a fascinating critique of racism, predestination, and gene splicing in general. Niccol's script writing is nothing short of genius and Gattaca really holds up. Ethan Hawke's dejected narration delivers this brutally judgemental film a decisive counterattack as his unlikely hero strives to be more than his genetics. Gattaca proves that science has its limits and should always ask if they should do something rather than if they can.\n\nAndrew Niccol's direction is riveting as he thrusts you into his vision of a technologically advanced future wherein babies' genes can be altered by doctors to fit their parent's desires with no birth defects. It's a mentally stimulating idea that is equally inspired and horrifying. What happens to those who were born before this miracle science is all Gattaca seeks to ask as Niccol's direction focuses on the forgotten and less fortunate world. His visual style has a unique 1990's flair and stunning cleanliness to his design. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography features jaw-dropping wide shots of isolated characters into a bleak, cold, machinery laced planet with neon greens and yellows everywhere. Colleen Atwood's stiff and classy costumes dazzle your eyes until they fill up with tears during all the drama. Gattaca holds up visually as much as Stanley Kubrick's 2001.\n\nLisa Zeno Churgin's editing is smooth and precise, cutting only when necessary to take the viewer into a new moment of doubt or revelation. Gattaca's story is so specific that her particular cuts are both alluring and inviting for Gattaca's engaging 106 minutes. The bright, sleek lighting bears a sterile quality as well as a revealing quality. Jan Roelfs' production design is very cool with grey industrial tones alongside chilling icy blues for a very contemporary as well as a futuristic feel. Sarah Knowles' art direction cannot be overstated as she thought of breathtaking shots for every scene in Gattaca. Michael Nyman's haunting classical score has an inspiring and frightening aspect to his dark melodies. Gattaca's score is simultaneously serene and somber thanks to Nyman's thoughtful composition. Gattaca's score is as refined and crucial as any cinematic great score.\n\nEthan Hawke is truly phenomenal in Gattaca as Vincent Freeman. His thoughtful, subtle performance as the stoic, reserved, contemplative hero with no limits. Ethan Hawke has always had this sensitive, relatable aura about him and that works to Gattaca's advantage as his character is both the hero and villain given the crime he's committing. Hawke delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the defiant loner who will not give up on his out of reach dream.\n\nJude Law is outstanding as the scene stealer Jerome Eugene Morrow in his handicap wheelchair, self-loathing self. Law draws you in with his intriguing performance as the wretched well endowed, who could not achieve despite his genetic gifts. He is a brilliant foil for Ethan Hawke's more understated role as Vincent. Jude Law could easily have won an Oscar for playing Jerome Morrow.\n\nUma Thurman has never looked more radiant than in Gattaca. She captures a quiet longing for more, while displaying a visible inner pain over her character's bleak outlook. Gore Vidal is great as Director Josef as he demonstrates why only focusing on your space mission can lead to ethical oversights. \n\nAlan Arkin is fantastic as the ignorant Detective Hugo, who relies on genetic prejudices rather than logic and the law. He is perfect as the obtuse, yet hard driven detective. Xander Berkeley is great as Dr. Lamar, who has more to offer than he realizes. I liked Jayne Brook as the worried Marie Freeman and the worried Elias Koteas as Antonio Freeman. Loren Dean is great as the adult Anton. Ernest Borgnine is funny as the dour janitor and skeptic to Vincent's dreams named Caesar. Tony Shalhoub is excellent as the funny and particular black market dealer German. Gattaca's cast is so amazing that Dean Norris even cameos as Cop on the Beat.\n\nGattaca is a thought provoking scientific commentary kind of arthouse film that everyone can enjoy.",

Hawke plays Vincent- a genetically inferior man born by way of natural reproduction in a society where genetic tinkering has resulted in creating perfect human beings without many flaws. Vincent wishes to go to one of Saturn's moon on an assigned mission but because he is an inferior he cannot. He uses the hair, urine and blood samples of Jerome who is a genetically gifted paraplegic, but without the knowledge of the administration whose rules demand that any person chosen to go to the mission must not be an inferior. Gattaca is a very good movie the likes of which we seldom get to see. Watch it as soon as you can.  (Andrew Niccol hits a homerun in his first film)",

Kind of ironic how the \"perfect\" person who had everything, wanted to kill himself, while the \"flawed\" person, all he wanted was to live and see the stars.

Brings up some pretty good questions about life, death, being able to live through someone else, and whether genetic coding should be something desired in the future. I think not in the end.

In fact, it's a lot like Minority Report: slick, smart science-fiction thriller that is good fun until the third act, which only the intelligent will understand. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (and Alan Arkin, for that matter) are excellent in this film, and I really don't have anything bad to say about their performances. It's beautifully shot and everything about Gattaca's movement is poetic and elegant, but it sometimes gets caught up in its own thoughtfulness, if you know what I mean. It's sleek, polished, and fun *enough*, but fun isn't the purpose, I don't think... it's how deep it makes you think and how well it's made, and in both cases, it succeeds.",

Set in the near future where society bases everything on your genetic make up. People are treated badly who are deemed \"inferior\" by which i mean their genes are predicted to make them weak. These people are regulated to menial tasks and can't work the better jobs. We follow a genetic inferior man named Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) who has always dreamed about being an astronaut sent to space. Unfortunately, because Vincent has inferior genes he's predicted to only last 30 years because of a heart condition. Vincent finds help from a seedy man who introduces Vincent to Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) a wheelchair bound man who has perfect genetics. Jerome is a shell of his former self and agrees to help Vincent \"transform.\" Vincent uses uring, blood and skin samples from Jerome to pass as him (including a few other unorthodox methods). Vincent passes as Jerome for years at Gattaca Aerospace Corporation eventually leading him to be sent on a space mission. A week before though the Director of the company is murdered and an eyelash from Vincent leads the detectives to believe he is the killer. During the investigation Vincent falls for another employee named Irene (Uma Thurman) who slowly realizes there's more to Vincent then she suspects. Vincent must work to protect his identity, throw off the detectives and think about what really makes up a person. The film is quite well done! It's a bit dated for a movie that came out 21 years ago, but it never takes away from it. There's a lot of great cinematography and I really enjoyed the score here. The film has a lot of great moments where the very notion of someone's life being determined is all up to the person not what they're made of. I enjoyed Hawke and Law's performances here and enjoyed this one quite a bit. I saw a lot of parallels with this film and also In Time (2011) both having been directed by Andrew Niccol. Both films have that central story of people living in a dystopian society where something else controls the outcome of their live. Solid sci-fi give it a look!",

Ethan Hawke plays a man who's genetics determined he live a life be as a simple laborer, but he's more ambitions and decides to pose as the genetically superior Jude Law, who's in chaoots with Hawke to hide the fact that he's been crippled in an accident. The film works well as a straight forward sci-fi thriller about Hawke trying to hide his true identity from the cops, but what makes this film special is that it also works brilliantly on a more intellectual level as a story about class, privacy, ethics of reproductive technologies, as well as larger topics of destiny. Besides having a smart subtext, the film also works on an emotional level where you really care about the characters. The relationship between Hawke and Uma Thurman, who plays a wonderful ice queen, is riveting. Does she love Hawke or does she love what his genetics (i.e. class, wealth, reputation)? If this film had been made in the 1950s, Grace Kelly would have been perfect of the role. There are also strong supporting performances by Ernest Borgnine as an elderly janitor who gives Hawke depressing life lessons from the underclass before Hawke assumes his new identity, Gore Vidal as a pompous executive, and Alan Arkin as a subordinate detective who's actually onto Hawke but his suspicions dismissed by  his genetically superior lead detective. I'd put \"Gattaca\" among the best science fiction films of the last 20 years, alongside \"Inception,\" \"Primer,\" and \"Ex-Machina.\"",

Unfortunately, Gattaca is so uber-stylish and incredibly in depth that it very exclusive and kind of pretentious at times.

In my opinion, it manages to touch upon the subject of genetic engineering very nicely from Vincent's point of view. It makes the viewer question where the line should be drawn. The film also explores the dangers of social classifications and how both society and circumstances beyond your control can hold you back from being all you could be. The film also does a great job in showing the audience how nobody has the right to tell what you're worth. Even though it is true that the movie has a plot hole or two, the story is so engaging that you are able to ignore them. That's what a good movie is all about.",

However its inability to trust itself and its audience means we get another by the numbers and barely invigorating story, which adds another \"Ho-hum\" addition to the 90's canon. Gattica is set in a not too distant future, scarily resonate of modern day, where DNA rules the world. Your ability to work in certain sectors is judged by you DNA, procreation can be manipulated and predicted and crime is now an almost impossible task to get away with. When Vincent, a not so perfect DNA specimen, manages to infiltrate Gattaca, a huge company who is pioneering space travel, he tries relentlessly to ensure he is on their top project to Titan. However just one week before launch a murder is committed in the complex, which due to the nature of the investigative route, makes Vincents life and dreams of going to space no longer a walk in the park. Its a decent enough idea and the opening 5 minutes would allow you to believe you were in for a science fiction master class. Then the films biggest flaws comes tumbling in all at once, insulting itself and the viewer simultaniously. See in the opening 5 minutes Gattaca manages to set everything up perfectly, it sets up its dystopian world, the importance of DNA and the character of Vincent in such a hypnotic and subtle way, you cant help but be drawn in, merge that with a gorgeous score and utterly pristine visuals, which have not dated, Gattaca is like a venus fly trap, luring you in before clamping shut and leaving you, well dead. For all the good work it achieves, it then goes on to ruin it all by inserting completely unwanted monologues, created so blandly by Ethan Hawke, who I actually really like, but here just is average. These monologues plague the entire piece, that at times it feels like it desperately wanted to be a film noir rather than anything else. It also ruins all its subtlety by utilizing these monologues with boring and pointless flashbacks, flashbacks that if the film got rid of, the audience would be able to create something a lot stronger in their mind. The film never really finds its footing, every time you feel its going to take off, it becomes sub par at every junction. The acting is just not very great, its bland and nobody actually feels like a character, Jude Law is the strongest of the bunch, yet again an actor I have no qualms with but he is barely doing anything memorable here. Uma Thurman is completely wasted in her role of Irene, there is zero dimension to character. Sure they all have back stories, written on a piece of paper but the characters themselves never come alive. Where Gattaca does excel is its wonderful presentation, Its visual flair allows it to stand out from the crowd, its production work allows it to seem futuristic without dating it, its polished, clean, framed brilliantly. The music is goose bump material, but this acts like its biggest weakness, the film is so clean, so polished, that it feels like they were too busy creating jaw dropping visuals, rather than have any emotional depth to the film. Gattaca is not a terrible film, its just so completely average, it promises so much and delivers so little, it has the emotional weight of a tennis ball, with performances to match. It has its moments, but ultimately its a one time watch, with zero replay value.",

In this hypothetical gene-discriminatory society, the film's essential theme is of one's value and destiny; whether we define it or someone/something does, ultimately, it's upto us.\n\nThe casting is good, and the acting is commendable. Though it's a science-fiction film, it didn't need any special effects to explore its themes; it made use of the well-designed sets and captivatingly-coloured cinematography.\n\nThe ideas explored in the film are intriguing and thought-provoking, but other than the lead character Vincent, whose description would take five sentences, other characters' descriptions would take just one. Especially, Irene (Uma Thurman), of whom we get to know nothing. Most of the movie is a cat and mouse chase, with characters dancing around the lines of morals and ethics, not that it wasn't entertaining.\n\nOverall, it's a film which is firm in its stand against discrimination, and inspires people to against all odds to fulfill their passion; an interesting sci-fi parable about destiny.",

My big issues with \"Gattaca\" are only two: The romance feels ham-fisted and the execution is so clich\u00e9 and unbelievable, and the way the film approaches the exposition is too simplistic, maybe I would have preferred if they told the story in chronological order instead of using flashbacks. \n\"Gattaca\" is an ambitious and thought provoking sci-fi film that is incredibly relevant in today\u00b4s society. It is a little predictable but the smart premise and the interesting characters make up for it. If you like sci-fi film, this is a film that you simply can't miss.",

I had not seen Gattaca in several years, and I vaguely remembered the premise. When I saw the consensus claim that the movie, \"poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science,\" I was excited. As someone who has recently considered working around the bends of gene therapy (as a statistician, but still, I'll be important someday), I was curious what those questions were. Much to my disappointment, Gattaca is not what I thought it would be. I wanted a movie that not only tackled the topic of gene therapy, but truly delved into the complexities of the situation. I can sense that Gattaca wanted to do that, but somewhere, it was stopped. For example, in this utopia -- truly, this did not have the vibe of a world in greater chaos than now, which was a cinematic relief -- main character Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is what is commonly known as a \"godchild,\" meaning he was conceived naturally instead of through genetic engineering. An old expression for such godchildren is that they are generally happier than those conceived through genetic engineering. That's an interesting idea, and the film perpetuates that through the hierarchal system established in business. No matter how high in power the \"valid\" people are, there is always that desire for more power. So, what I don't understand is the correlation between ambition and happiness. If those who were engineered supposedly have the greatest potential in their gene pool, how is it that so many of them remain unhappy? If it relates to them not having everything that they want, then wouldn't that apply to everyone in the system, no matter how one was conceived? Look, I understand that a movie is not supposed to answer every single question it poses, but that is just one example of various grievances I have with what Gattaca offhandedly mentions.\n\nOddly enough, Gattaca feels stuck between too much simplicity and too much complexity. It could have simply been a gene therapy-themed movie that ultimately teaches the audience never to give up on realizing one's ambitions, no matter what society might say otherwise. In that sense, Gattaca succeeds, with a forgivable exception for the ending to the story of the crippled Jerome (Jude Law). I find it harder to forgive the contrived romance between Vincent and Irene (Uma Thurman), but those moments were short enough for the entire data sample to be notable in other respects. Performances were good, if not outstanding. The set design perfectly fits the dysfunctional utopia that is described. And one scene, in Jude Law's apartment during the climax of a murder investigation, was thrilling in good ol' Hollywood fashion. Ultimately, however, my greatest concern were those questions. Personally, I don't see why one would ask, \"Should I conceive my child through natural or artificial means?,\" after seeing this movie. Given how discriminatory the system is, the only scientific reason why someone should conceive naturally is related to happiness. And no further information was provided on that front. Gattaca spends a solid amount of time in telling a straightforward Hollywood drama/thriller, under the guise of intellectual science-fiction. Don't be fooled. It's a false print.\n\nP.S. *SPOILER, AVOID ME, SPOILER* This one is personal: What a waste of an ending. How could you have Vincent say, \"I never saved anything for the swim back,\" and NOT have him die of heart failure during his trip into space? He was past his due date, it would have shocked everyone else on board, and that line would have come full circle. SUCH a waste.",

            "content": "\"I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body. You lent me your dream.\"\n\nIn Andrew Niccol's directorial debut we are invited to imagine a world where humans are categorized according to their genetic make-up. In this world, genetic engineering is not only a possibility, but a very common thing. Society now classifies people according to their DNA, and social classes are determined by it. It is not a future too hard to envision considering over history we have categorized people according to the color of their skin, their race, or their gender. Niccol creates an interesting sci-fi premise by using this sort of allegory of our society and combining it with some action and romance. I have yet to see Niccol's Lord of War, but from what I've seen his debut film has been his best. He had an interesting cast to work with as well. Ethan Hawke plays the lead role, Vincent Freeman, who was born with inferior genes and therefore not expected to live long. He must settle for unimportant jobs, and no matter how hard he tries, he is unable to achieve his dream of traveling to space. Those jobs are only available for humans with superior DNA. Jude Law plays a supporting role as Jerome Murrow, a man born with perfect genes, but after suffering an accident he is left paraplegic. Vincent assumes Jerome's identity and by deceiving DNA testings he is able to follow his dream and is assigned on a space mission. It's an engaging premise despite some flaws, but it is much more intelligent than some recent sci-fi Niccol films.\n\nEthan Hawke gives a solid performance, but he doesn't really stand out here like he has in some of his other films. The best thing about Gattaca is its sci-fi futuristic premise which manages to thrill and keep the audience in suspense. Jude Law doesn't add much to the story, but he is always an interesting presence. Uma Thurman plays Hawke's love interest and gives the plot a romantic side. Her chemistry with Hawke is what makes the film emotionally engaging, because without her Vincent isn't really engaging on his own. The film succeeds thanks to its strong narrative (written by Niccol himself) and the way it manages to adapt current prejudices in society to a future we don't want to look forward to. It gets its point across of cautioning us and delivering meaning in a similar way that classic fairy tales did when our mothers read us the stories when we were kids. It has become a classic for some over the years. It's not among my favorite films, but it was an enjoyable ride and i'm glad I finally got around to watching it.",

            "content": "Gattaca is the tale of a near future where mankind is able to genetically engineer their children before they are born in order to weed out any imperfections. In this world Vincent, played by Ethan Hawke, is an outcast because he was conceived in the more conventional fashion. I feel the world they created is a bit far-fetched, but the ideas of racism and discrimination really transcend whatever reality they've manufactured. My biggest complaint about the setup of the film was just the choice to use voice-over, when they were already showing the events of Vincent's life. Despite that minor flaw in the setup, I love how this story plays out. It's intriguing how Ethan Hawke must go to so much work to not only avoid being detected because he is masquerading as part of the genetically elite, but also to excel intellectually as a member of this organization. It all works perfectly to not only challenge what we as a society are doing with the science and technology being developed and the power it gives us, but it forces the viewer to look at the discrimination we are dealing with in the present day. You can really see it in the look on some of the faces of the \"Valid\" members of society in Gattaca when Vincent exceeds their expectations of an \"Invalid.\" It's rare that a movie like this says so much with such a simple premise, and this one feels entirely relevant and current despite the fact that it was made 17 years ago.\n\nI absolutely loved Ethan Hawke and Jude Law in this movie. Their relationship was so interesting and the contrast of their journeys throughout the film was amazing. I also liked how they took the less obvious route and made older Alan Arkin the cop who relies 100% on the modern technology, and Loren Dean was the youngster who wanted to use more conventional methods of detection (and that pays off with a nice twist at the end.) There are 2 things that I don't like in Gattaca, unfortunately, and one of them is pretty significant and hurts my opinion of the movie. The less vital one is a spoiler, so don't read the next couple sentences if you want to avoid spoilers. I didn't enjoy the doctor being aware of Vincent's Invalid status. To me it diminished some of the impact of the film, and made Vincent's efforts to avoid detection seem less important. The bigger issue I had with the film, and this one grated on my nerves quite a lot, was Uma Thurman. I did not find her character integral to the plot, I was annoyed by a number of her acting choices (as I always seem to be,) and I felt my interest in the story wavering every time she was on screen. That being said, this film was still remarkable. I love how they were able to create a lot of tension in certain scenes, to the point where I can hardly breathe because I'm so concerned Vincent will be discovered. I would definitely recommend Gattaca (and crank that up to a must-see for people who have a high tolerance for Uma.)",

They have chemistry, but if it hadn't have been for that, I wouldn't have been convinced, because there's no other reason for us to believe in their romance.

The protagonist is a well fleshed out character, he's really interesting has really great motivations and carries the story really well. It's a really interesting and unique story too. I love the way it says things about society, particularly on social status, and the way the government relates to that. It plays with themes of superiority, inferiority, and how someone's social status shouldn't determine the path his life takes or wether people should respect him or not.

Geneticists weeding out all \"bad\" fertilized egg cells to produce a \"perfect\" child? While we're not quite there yet, it's still quite feasible.

            "content": "Andrew Niccol's Gattaca is one of the most chilling and thought provoking science fiction movies I've ever seen. It's very sombre and serious in tone, but the complex plot and fascinating themes had me gripped from the very beginning. In these times of advancement, the science of the movie seems very realistic. Gattaca is a stunning movie that works on numerous levels: a dystopian fiction, a film noir thriller, a psychological drama.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with the words 'in the not-too-distant future,' the first indication that the movie might be more socially relevant than your usual sci-fi about UFO's and alien invasion. The movie deals with the themes of eugenics, social class, technological reproduction and genetic discrimination. It takes place in a dystopian world, where those of a perfect genetic makeup (often conceived with the aid of reproductive technologies) are capable of rising higher in society and achieving a more respective status. Those of a less-than-perfect genetic makeup, usually conceived traditionally, are often discriminated against (although the law forbids it) by employers, and made to serve menial jobs. \r\n\r\nEthan Hawke stars as Vincent Freeman, a man who was conceived naturally. As a child he is diagnosed with a fatal heart defect, among with many other genetic imperfections. His parents take no chances and choose genetic selection in the conception of their second son, Anton. Despite being fully aware of his inferiority, Vincent is not resigned to fate, as he competes with his brother in swimming contests, and even has the audacity to dream of going into outer space:\r\n  \r\n'Maybe it was a love of the planets, maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one, but for as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of going into space.'\r\n \r\nVincent eventually takes a job as a cleaner at a space station, with the secret motive of getting closer to his lifelong dream of travelling into space. To participate in a prestigious expedition to one of the moons in Saturn, he forms a plan with a genetically superior man who was paralysed in a car accident. Jerome Morrow(Jude Law) agrees to sell Vincent his identity(including finger prints, urine samples etc.). With a whole new genetic identic, Vincent is chosen for the mission. The plan is going off without a hitch, until it is disturbed by a murder at the space station, with evidence that implicates Vincent.\r\n\r\nThis is a superb movie. Although it's contemplation on genetic discrimination and technological advancement has provoked much discussion, the movie also works at a very basic, emotional level, and asks many profound questions about what it means to be human. I love how the murder mystery is seamlessly worked into the sci-fi story, giving the movie a dark film noir edge. The movie also brilliantly captures the sense of guilt and paranoia that living under a false identity invokes in Vincent. Hawke and Law are both excellent as two people who are very different, but share a common disappointment. Their character's identities are contrasted with a psychological depth and complexity worthy of Ingmar Bergman's Persona. Uma Thurman is also solid as Vincent's enigmatic love interest. Loren Dean and Alan Arkin play the noirish detectives. Niccol's direction and writing is first-rate, and his set pieces and visual sense are fantastic.",

Also mixed in are some pretty basic detective and crime elements which act as a sort of diversion from the main storyline which it almost doesn't effect at all. The acting is good, but not stellar in any way and the direction, while at time visually interesting is standard, without too much interest. The way the story is told can be rather clunky at times and the most interesting story elements are not present enough. The interplay of the two brothers is basically nonexistent until everything is done, while all the other elements are obvious and somewhat dull.

The story tries to take this in the direction of impersonation, but in my opinion it skates over far too many likely problems with this scenario to be credible as a scientifically- or forensically-based prediction (not least of which is that, in the future, the Gattaca corporation would have seen the movie \"Gattaca\" and would therefore have closed off the loopholes it purports to expose; but this is straying from the point). There is also the frankly laughable closing scene, where a group of people who are supposed to be heading into space for a year-long mission simply wander into a rocket capsule wearing business suits, without any apparent equipment or preparation. Of course, we aren't meant to take this seriously as a prediction, but I feel the obvious technical flaws in the scenarios presented in the movie detract from the underlying premise. Jude Law is good, though, especially in the scene where he drags himself up the stairs.",

Vincent is the main protagonist in this motion picture and Ethan delivered a solid performance aswell as all the others. There is not a single bad performance in this film, but Ethan Hawke and Jude Law`s performance sticks out as one the best. The script is good, screenplay is solid, the performances are great, but the narrative is more than just great, it`s fenomenal. I adore this film for it`s message and original narrative.

It is not a matter of money, it was a matter of the choice of his parents. Then he spent his life in an uphill battle against a society that treats 'faith birth' humans as second class citizens. \n\nEventually he turns to fraud and becomes a 'borrowed ladder' of someone else who has superior genetics. This allows him to get the job he wants and eventually his destiny. But none of this came easy and he nearly gets pinched in a murder investigation. The detectives look at 'invalids' as likely suspects, so when his DNA shows up at a crime scene (even though he is innocent), he becomes a prime suspect. \n\nI see no hole in the plot or inconsistencies conceptually with this movie and anyone who does is simply not understanding the movie to begin with. Unlike more campy sci-fi movies that address this subject matter, this movie is elegant and clean, without hardly any CGI, and has emotive and deep elements to it as well.

That creates a very comfortable vision for the spectators, that feel like they are in the current era, just with some small evolutions, and they perfectly accept the idea of a future like the one proposed. \nAnother part that is well made is the creation of the atmosphere of oppression. Mainly because of what you see (the controlles police makes nearly in every moment of the film, or because you see all those people that make analyze others' genes in order to see if they are valid or in-valid, and so on) but not only. This is the sci-fi I really like.

It's a touching moment that comes far too late after a long slog of a film. Gattaca is an icy cold \"thriller\" without many thrills or immediacy to it. There are gaps in logic essential to buying the premise, and the film clumsily explains the world by completing halting the story after an interesting introduction. Characters are far too serious with little depth or emotional resonance, even though we're told they're the same as regular humans (just with the \"best parts\"). When the film finally resolves one of its long-running subplots about a murder in an all-too convenient way, it points out just how inconsequential it was in the first place.\n\nGattaca could have been a great sci-fi film. It's early take on the genetics debate (including humans playing God through manipulation before conception) is unique and worth exploring. It just feels like there's an identity crisis at the script level that can't resolve what kind of film it wants to be. The result is a film that overreaches and is stretched too thin.",

But as it turns out, Andrew Niccol has done an awesome job with this one.\n\n\"A genetically inferior man assumes the identity of a superior one in order to pursue his lifelong dream of space travel.\" That is the tagline as you will find it on IMDB today.\n\nIn this world, all natural babies are tagged as 'in-valids' while genetically engineered beings are stamped 'valid'. Social success and opportunity in general and all its details are governed by genetics: blood and urine samples are taken each and every day for access and identification in this sci-fi world. Ethan Hawke plays Vincent Freeman, an in-valid who chooses to actively beat the system with the help of another man, Jerome Eugene Morrow (played by Jude Law). \n\nThis Eugene (\"good gene\"), who has become crippled in an accident, provides Vincent with all the bodily fluids and DNA samples that he needs to take over his identity and to get accepted at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, where Vincent wants to man a spaceflight to Titan.\n\nIn the subsequent events a murder mystery needs to be solved at Gattaca and Vincent has to jump through several hoops to keep his cover from being blown. He also develops some kind of relationship with the beautiful Irene (Uma Thurman).\n\nThe absolute highlight of this movie is its setting. Through superb set design and cinematography, this film breathes a high consistency and high production value. There is a stark contrast between the characters and their environment, which aids the development of characters and story. Hawke, Law and Thurman get the most screen time, but the supporting cast does a great job as well. \n\nThe movie never feels like it's going too fast or dragging along. There's always something going on, but a very strong point is that this type of science fiction does not need over-the-top special effects or a lot of violence. It simply needs good actors and a great script based on a good idea. And Gattaca has all three.\n\nVerdict: Go see!",

Anyway Gattaca is a poignant, well directed Science-fiction drama, I repeat 'drama'. This is no thriller, but an original and a heart warming drama. As for the acting, every one in the film gave controlled and good acting, be it Ethan Hawke or Jude Law or Uma Thurman, Loren Dean etc. But my favoutrite among them is definitely Jude Law. \nGattaca is a good watch for all those who wish to see both Sci-Fi and drama at the same time.

I am so happy that his career took a turn for the better. It's too bad that when we start to notice someone and really like them, Hollywood saturates us with 3-5 features of them a year. I see too much Arkin, Goodman and Damon. It doesn't matter how much you like an actor, its easy to get fed up with them. Ethan Hawke's teary eyed, sensitive mush face works for him in Gattaca. Hawk even displayed an Oscar-worthy moment in the end when he easily outduels his brother during a passionate shouting match. Uma Thurman was sexy and possessed enough attitude to intimidate any man. She happened to be in love with Hawk, which made it very easy for the two of them to wind up in bed. Jude Law was good as the pre-planned perfect specimen turned paraplegic. He was an alcoholic, probably addicted to some substances, depressed and angry that Hawk was taking his identity and living out his dreams. But the exchange seemed to actually give Jude purpose and joy in life and the two developed a close friendship. When Hawk launched up into space headed for a yearlong journey to some moon near Jupiter, Jude Law incinerated himself in an oven... Didn't expect that to happen. \nAs cool as the story was with the futuristic technology, the cloning and genetic enhancements that were given to privileged, newborn babies, including a whodunit murder mystery with Arkin playing detective; the plot remained to be about Ethan Hawk and his brother. It was intelligently written but there are so many subplots and interesting relationships to pay attention too that when the brother comes out of nowhere and reveals himself in the end, you almost forgot what Ethan Hawk's entire drive and motivation was in the first place. I thought it had more to do with his parents than his genetically modified, pre-planned brother, but he was living, they weren't. \nI had trouble following the developments and twists in the end because I was busy keeping up with the romance between Uma and Hawk: who's heart was going to pop first? And the murder mystery: who killed the director and why? And Jude Law: when was he going to turn on Hawk and how was he going to do it? Did he have something to do with the murder? Than all of a sudden she didn't matter anymore, the murder was solved, and Jude Law incinerated himself. Ethan Hawk and his brother were left standing and what did they do? Go to the ocean in the middle of the night to participate in a macho man contest to see who could swim the longest. And...that's...how...Gattaca ends.....Didn't expect that to happen. \n3.5/5",

Uma Thurman is dropped into the story as a weak love interest who doesn't really do anything to affect the story.  In fact she's just a girl who Ethan Hawke bangs a few times before leaving.  \nJude Law over-acts in a few places and it comes across as a bit silly.  \nEthan Hawke's character, while he is the protagonist and is shown to be the underdog in the world he lives in, still seems to manage to pull off his grand scheme rather effectively without TOO MUCH struggle, which makes it difficult for us to really identify with his plight.  I mean we understand his problems, but personally I never particularly felt involved enough.  \nDespite all that it's a good solid film that's well shot and puts across interesting concepts and ideas.

It's analysis of a utopian future with a totalitarian government is very clever and the premise draws strength from it's subplot's and excellent acting, as well as great cinematography, quality film editing, good visual effects and futuristic production design, as well as a very strong screenplay.\nEthan Hawke plays a powerful lead with great character development and line delivery, making him into a complex character who is determined to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal of being an astronaut, even if it means compromising his beliefs.\nUma Thurman also portrays a strong character who embodies the film's setting and creates good motifs for conversations with Ethan Hawke so that we are provided with strong character insight.\nJude Law also brings charm and strength to the film in it's more subplot moments, and his physical talent is impeccable, especially in the scene where he is forced pull himself up stairs without use of his legs. He shows the physical talent as an actor as good as John Malkovich's in Places in the Heart which was some of the greatest I've seen. \n\nSo Gattaca works as a look at what can appear as a utopian future but is plagued with the extraneous variables of prejudice and lack of natural life that is enhanced by strong acting and a screenplay that really makes you think.",

In order to pursue his lifelong dream of space travel he assumes the identity of Jerome \"Eugene\" Morrow (Jude Law) who is genetically superior.\n\nI like Gattaca and think that it's a very good movie.  Andrew Niccol does a great job (Writer/ Director) and I feel that he has presented a very intriguing and thought provoking film.  In the age of cloning and genetic modification one does wonder how long it will be before scenes from this film become a reality; simply handing in a blood sample at a job interview.  To quote a few lines from Jurassic Park; \"scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn't stop to think if they should.\"  \"What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.\"  \nAlthough Gattaca is a very different film, it does convey a very similar message and poses some important questions.  Is genetically modifying children right?  How much should be left to chance?  How big a part does fate play in people's lives compared to what we were born with?  In the fight between modified and unmodified, is it always the strongest that survives?\n\nThe acting is pretty solid throughout and on the whole the cast are all believable.  I am not the biggest Jude Law fan, but for me he gives the standout performance here.  He does seem to be the most interesting character whenever he is on screen.  I particularly like the scene where he is stopped by the police for an identity check.  \n\nSince its release in 1997 it hasn't received any major recognition.  I feel that it has been under-rated and pretty much forgotten about.  I have asked many people their opinion of Gattaca and for most it's un-heard of.  Unfortunately it seems that this film has fallen \"through the net\".  I think that, that is a shame as it's quite a catch (pardon the pun).  I would recommend this movie to anyone and would suggest that you won't be disappointed.\n\nI think that Gattaca is good entertainment, it doesn't go on for too long, doesn't flood your brain with technical mumbo jumbo and definitely gives you food for thought.  It won't have you on the edge of your seat biting your finger nails, nor will it have you dozing off.  But it is a good, solid, decent movie about a timely topic.",

Vincent assumes Jerome's identity and is scheduled for a flying mission. However, a week before his flight, a Gattaca mission director is murdered, and all members of the program are the suspects.

With the exception of Jude Law, the rest of the cast seems flatfooted in their performance and the cause-effect relationship of the story is sometimes so jumbled that it is simply unbelievable and baffling. Some of the lines sound majestic and thought-provoking, but after thinking through them, they actually make no sense and sometimes it is to the point of being comical. I understand the premise behind the film and how science could potentially pose a threat to society through selectivity, and this movie is successful in transmitting this message, and is its main saving grace. The film does create some value in the rather interesting setting that Andrew Niccol is able to conjure, Gattaca as a whole has a whole lot more to be desired.",

In the future, society has been categorized by genetically inferior humans (ones whose lives have already been determined by genetic engineering), or the normal under-classed human. whose fate is determined by knowledge and education. A genetically inferior man Vincent (Hawke) assumes the identity of a superior one (Law) in order to achieve his dream of space travel. Presents a variety of weighty, intriguing topics for introspection. For additional reviews visit http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/Nesbitt10",
