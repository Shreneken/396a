    "summary": "Joseph Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who has infiltrated one of the major New York Mafia families and is living under the name Donnie Brasco. He develops a relationship with mob hit man Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero (Al Pacino) in order to get deeper under cover, but ends up developing a real friendship with the Mafioso. As their relationship develops, Pistone must decide whether or not to complete his job, knowing that it will lead to the murder of his new friend.",

            "content": "While this may look like just another crime movie with Al Pacino in it, it actually has advantages over other similar movies. The first is the degree of emotion involved and the engagement with the generally overlooked side effects of mob life. The second is Johnny Depp's ability to prove he could get to the level of Pacino and star next to him in a movie of this genre. The third is that Donnie Brosco is based on a true story. The fourth is its ability to keep the viewer's eyes on screen despite its relatively long running time, although it could've been slightly shorter (but either way it doesn't get boring). These advantages make up for the slow pacing and the somewhat trite plot, which in a way still resonates with the portrayal of the banalities of life. This means that the script and dialogue are good, but the overall result may not be memorable or leave a long-lasting impression like Heat or Serpico, for example. But that's what makes the Mike Newell movie unique in its own way.",

Pistone and Richard Woodley, this movie loosely tells the story of Pistone (Johnny Depp), an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family under the alias Donnie Brasco by gaining the trust of aging hitman Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino).\n\nThe intriguing thing about the movie is that as Pistone/Donnie disappears into the world of crime, he wonders if he's even a federal agent any longer. He also realizes that his actions will cause the death of Ruggiero, a man who he has come to consider a friend.\n\nBy the end, the Donnie Brasco operation got the law over 200 indictments and 100 convictions. Today, Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location \u2014 with a $500,000 open contract for his death \u2014 and continues to consult for the government and Hollywood.\n\nWhile Lefty takes off his jewelry and tells his wife, \"If it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him,\" the real life Lefty was arrested by the FBI on the way to his own murder. He was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, distribution of a controlled dangerous substance and running an illegal gambling operation. He received early parole in 1992 after he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and died in 1994.\n\nIt's wild that a gangster movie was directed by the same man who made Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mike Newell. The script was written by Paul Attansio, who also wrote Sphere, Disclosure, The Sum of All Fear, Quiz Show and The Good German.",

There's much here about eyes - characters often seem to be introduced by close-ups on the eyes, and throughout it's a film that has us question how we see ourselves and others, which for the two characters at the heart of the drama is the snare that captures them both in very different ways. The cast is good throughout  - special mention for the excellent Anne Heche as the wife of Johnny Depp's undercover cop, a role that's more fleshed out than many equivalents in other films, and a result really allows her to shine. If the film's subtlety is its strength it may also be its flaw - the emotional impact of the last 30 minutes or so is dampened without the more operatic tenor of many mafia stories.",

Al Pacino's Lefty appears as a precursor to Tony Soprano, and a breath of fresh air for mob based dramas, by bringing a level of humanity and pathos which amazingly made me sympathetic to his character at times, for example, as he continually lamented being passed over for a \"promotion\" despite the 26 guys he \"clipped\" for the bosses. Pacino could have just as easily been complaining about being passed over for a manager job at a supermarket, something many more of us could find relatable, and is just one small example of the normality he brought to a character with such an abnormal line of work.",

His use of montages and quiet suspense is as cool as cinematographer Peter Sova's love of silhouettes and darkness enshrouding the mob for various hits. Jon Gregory's editing is real slick for 127 minutes of montages and complex narrative structure all spliced together neatly. \n\nPaul Attanasio's script is very genuine as everyone speaks like regular people just having conversations. Donnie Brasco's script is based off the true crime story of FBI Agent Joseph D. Pistone's experiences undercover in the mob as Donnie Brasco himself. His life is insane and daring as he used cunning and creativity to trick the mob for years in order to get 100's of convictions. Patrick Doyle's score is interesting with mood setting tracks throughout Donnie Brasco to match the chilling crimes on screen. Aude Bronson-Howard and David C. Robinson's costumes are killer with black leather jackets and puffy coats to tacky tracksuits and pointed shoes that all look right out of the mob's wardrobe.\n\nDonnie Brasco is held together by a commanding lead performance from Johnny Depp as Joseph Pistone playing Donnie Brasco. Depp's accent and swagger are interesting as he slowly unravels from the wear and tear of being undercover among murderers. Depp plays Donnie Brasco so earnestly, you just forget about everything else when he speaks. Al Pacino is phenomenal as mob hitman Lefty Ruggiero. His sincere portrayal of a vulnerable assassin uncertain of his position within the ranks of crime lord underlings is fascinating to watch. Pacino has bursts of rage with quiet subtle reflective passages that are equally entertaining to see unfold around Donnie Brasco.\n\nAnne Heche is wonderful as Johnny Depp's lovely and forlorn wife in Donnie Brasco: Maggie Pistone. Her sensitive and relatable working mother performance is enthralling. You feel deep empathy for her endearing role. Heche was an excellent actress with a compelling dramatic skill that feels effortless. I wish Anne Heche got offered more roles akin to Donnie Brasco.\n\nMichael Madsen is wild and chaotic as Sonny Black. He's always this greasy, mean mugging, thug typecast, but Madsen is killer as the erratic Sonny Black. Bruno Kirby is perfectly annoying and underhanded as Nicky. James Russo is seriously intimidating and tough as Paulie. Paul Giamatti and Tim Blake Nelson have nice cameos also. In short, Donnie Brasco is an outstanding crime tale told with a superb cast and Mike Newell's creative direction.",

The actual film itself is loosely based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone aka. Donnie Brasco played by the famous Johnny Depp himself. Donnie Brasco revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated the Mafia Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s. He befriends with Lefty Ruggiero played by Al Pacino who vouches for him. He gave him his trust and loved him like a son but he doesn't know his real identity. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp have good chemistry together and they both played good characters along with the other casts like Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, and Anne Heche. The line \"Forget about it\" is a line that has been said multiple times and I don't know how many times they're been saying that. If I don't know how many times they said \"Forget about it\" just \"Forget about it\". So out of all the gangster films out there, this one is one of the deeper ones (if not the most deeper film). Some people say that this is best crime film, however it's not a perfect film by all means but it is a good film with a good story that stays true to the real life adaptation of the book. With strong performances by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, this is a movie for you.",

Donnie Brasco is an overlong stretched script that is predictable and flat out exhausting in its first act only to discover that the rest of it was just mundane. Mike Newell picks out his favourite details and sequences from the book and executes it with all the conviction but in the end there just isn't enough material to keep the audience investing in it. The only part that got it right was the star cast and boy oh boy what a star cast it is, Johnny Depp and Al Pacino face to face on screen encounters are the only highlights about it.

It's a perfect way to capture the ruggedness of the steel girders, the grandeur of the East River, and the magnificence of the city's world-renowned skyline off in the distance, all in a single sequence.\n\nHowever, one must also consider that the bridges serve a more symbolic purpose.  Donnie--an undercover FBI agent--successfully infiltrates the Bonanno crime family, and in doing so slowly transitions from an upstanding G-man into a gangster.  Thus the bridges are also used as a metaphor--a way to physically manifest his crossing over from good to bad.\n\n'Donnie Brasco' does so many of the big things right, not least of all Al Pacino's extraordinary performance.

Unfortunately, like Pacino's character Lefty, it is relegated to second banana against greater films like Goodfellas because, also like Lefty, it does its job but doesn't go all the way.  That's not to say it's a bad film; a real-life story with a phony ending would have been worse.  However, the real-life reality is that Joseph Pistone's case was pulled before a dramatic real-life tragedy could have occurred, preventing an ending that would have been more cinematically dramatic.  Not a flawed film by any means (except maybe the soundtrack), and definitely worth watching for any fans of the organized crime/cop genre.",

            "content": "This gem from the late 90's not only paired legends Al Pacino and Johnny Depp together, it also cemented Depp's career as an extremely versitile actor, which appears to be a rarity these days. Depp plays Joe Pistone, an undercover FBI agent in Brooklyn, sent deep into the hear of the mafia through age old and wise guy Lefty, Al Pacino. Joe soon takes on the double life of Donnie Brasco, a young up and comer and soon to be favourite of the mob, if only Donnie could juggle both his lives in order to stay alive. As ground braking as it was originally, the film still holds up tremendously to this day. It's great watching Pacino give a brilliant performance as the terminally ill and old dog Lefty, he brings a hefty emotional weight to the piece and also adds a human element, which the audience can relate to, in between all the lies and deceit that go on around him. Depp equals him, subtly playing 2 very conflicting characters, while slowly merging them together. In comparison to some of his other work, this may seem tame, but his tact for subtly here and under playing the role for the most part, really sells the film well. The support is equally strong from the likes of Anne Heche and Michael Madsen, both turning in strong performances, that bring the leading characters even more to life. The writing is tremendous, full of wise cracking put downs and threatening suggestion, Donnie Brasco is captivating till the very end, even with its sombre note. The film distinctly feels perfect also, relishing the New York and Miami beach feel perfectly, it doesnt harm the film having quite the wardrobe and music to help strengthen the vibe, mixing wonderfully between the cold and dank Brooklyn, with the glowing and neon Miami, its a nice contrast, which offers up a change in tone at the half way mark. Although there is some prominent violence in this film, its toned down when compared to the likes of Casino or Goodfellas, aiming more for a heavily character driven plot, which shocks coming more from tension rather than brutal violence. This film is jam packed with tension, especially in act 3 as the mafia begin to suspect a rat from within. It takes very simple moments and turns the entire thing into a thrilling and edge of your seat vehicle at times. Although the entire package is solid and works, there are times when needless moments kick in, a bit to much metaphorical exposition here and a bit to thrown in your face family problems here, kind of ruin the otherwise fun and thrilling experience. I understand the need for both of these, at times however dragging me so far away from what i want to see, to show me a marriage council session is not exactly engrossing, especially when it seems to have no real impact on the film. Which there lays another problem, the film could really have cut some of the more repetitive aspects out and fleshed out some of the characters a bit more, both leads families feel tacked on when they shouldnt, members of the mafia kind of come and go and are mostly forgettable. It would have been better to spend more time bringing their characters to life than trying to throw too many chips on the table. The film does hold its own, despite these minor draw backs, it doesnt really drag, the performances are solid and the entire feel of the film is grand. However a lack of solid subtext over bloats the movie, when that time could have been better spent on beefing up smaller characters.",

            "content": "Led by Al Pacino and starring both Johnny Depp and Michael Madsen, Donnie Brasco sounded like a thrilling crime story.\n\nDonnie Brasco is a slow burning gangster tale. It moves along at a pace which is very gradual and remains a lot more focused on its screenplay than on skyrocket story dynamics. The slow pace of the film may faze some, so viewers are really required to let everything come to them while they remain patient. At times, I found that it moved along a little too slow. I felt like there was a story that needed to be told in Donnie Brasco and that it was done with a stylish way of filmmaking and a firm screenplay. Donnie Brasco was a complicated and deep film which touched upon a lot of the theoretics of the crime world without resorting to Hollywood cliches. But while the story remains consistently realistic, it still adheres to a basic formula. By that I mean it goes back and forth between focusing on the personal life of Joseph Pistone and his career as an informant. This is a problem because while the latter is interesting, the same cannot be said about the former. The central focus of the film is arguably the nature of the relationship between Joseph Pitsone and Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero, and so when the film gets more focused on Joseph Pitsone and his wife Maggi, it loses momentum. \nThere are also so many characters in Donnie Brasco that it can become challenging to keep up with at times. Despite progressing very slowly, there are many characters the contribute to the two lives lived by Joseph Pistone who all make a different impact on the story ranging from major to minor. Having to remember what relevance they all play in the lives of both Joseph Pitsone and Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero. It seems as if Donnie Brasco attempts to fit too many minor elements of Joseph Pitsone's life into the story and emphasizing the existence of so many people, but like I said, the film is important in how it depicts the relationship between Joseph Pitsone and Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero. When it gets away from that and looks at the many other characters in the story, the effect of it is not as strong and it comes off as scattered. So Donnie Brasco proves to be largely all over the place at times.\nBut still, Donnie Brasco remains a strong film based predominantly on the asset of its acting, and to a lesser extent its style as the production design and scenery of the film help to assist in ensuring that everything feels legitimate, and it is all captured with strong and atmospheric cinematography which enhances the tension in situations at all of the right moments. The musical score in Donnie Brasco also gives it a tense feel consistently throughout the rough material.\nAl Pacino proves once again that his greatest talents as an actor come from him taking on gangster roles. The thing that makes Donnie Brasco different to films like The Godfather Part II and Scarface is the fact that in Donnie Brasco, the gangster he portrays is one with mercy to him. He keeps his head above the crime game and has a sense of humanity to him, constantly maintaining a sense of growing disillusionment which ensures that he keeps a lot of depth in the role. He is unpredictable in the role because he has both the harsh nature of a gangster and the sympathetic side of a human being. Instead of resorting to playing the role as a one-dimensional archetype, Al Pacino takes the perfect angle on the character to emphasize his natural humanity as well as his relationship with Joseph Pitsone\nJohnny Depp reminds me how skilled an actor he is in Donnie Brasco. While he is predominantly known for high-profile and commercialised performances such as his Academy Award nominated role is Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, Donnie Brasco is one of those films that remind viewers how good he is in more low profile and character oriented roles. In Donnie Brasco, he stands out because his natural charisma and strong dramatic line delivery shine as easily as ever, but his voice articulation is the central selling point. His change of voice tone is exceptional because it sounded so different from his natural voice or any of the others that he has put on so that he can play the role convincingly, and it is just incredible. When I looked back at the screen and realised that this was the voice of Johnny Depp, it was difficult to believe. But it was real, and it was exceptional. Johnny Depp shines in the role of the titular Donnie Brasco because of his deep involvement in the character, both physically and emotionally. In a film where he co-stars with Al Pacino, Johnny Depp does a strong job holding the screen equally by maintaining excellent character development which progresses very well over the course of the running time. Johnny Depp takes on the mature material in Donnie Brasco excellently and puts strong depth and natural charisma into the character which proves to be another winning performance from him.\nMichael Madsen turns in a firm performance as well. In his supporting role, Michael Madsen never lets up for a minute because he is so consistently confident in the part and stands with a brooding strength. His intimidation and strength is all subtle, but you can see it through the angressive stare in his eyes and the way that he seamlessly interacts with the other characters and the entire universe around him. Michael Madsen is great in Donnie Brasco because he maintains a lot of underlying power in his performance while keeping himself cool about it like a good gangster should, and so he fits the profile for the role excellently and shares a strong chemistry with all the other actors.\n\nSo while Donnie Brasco is a film which fails to consistently illuminate its best elements due to a scattered focus, the quality of the performances from Al Pacino and Johnny Depp as well as the chemistry between them render the entire experience an unforgettable one.",

            "content": "Though there are ample amount of movies based on Mobsters and the Mafia led organized crime only very few that actually is mention worthy. As we all know while Godfather remains as the undisputed godfather of modern mob movies, the list gladly follows by movies like Goodfellas (1990), Scarface (1983), Heat (1995) and The Departed (2006). And Donnie Brasco is another fine jewel that so powerful and intense in revealing the underworld life of mobsters and their painfully loyal and ruthless culture. And it's based on the true character Donnie Brasco (Joseph Pistone in real) who was an undercover FBI agent who spent 6 long years with the mob (1975 -81) that ultimately came very closely to losing his natural life in the name of duty.\n\nFBI agent Pistone (Johnny Depp) goes undercover as Donnie Brasco making connections with the aging hit man Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino).  After building trust with Lefty he manages to move in to big leagues and participate in mob activities and gather valuable information. But at the same time due to the work pressure and the overwhelming amount of crime he witness his perception towards certain things goes through a dramatic change. While Pistones wife and kids misses their man of the house he deeply engulfs in the mob and struggles to strike a balance.\n\nOne strong reason why Donnie Brasco sinks right in to the hearts of the viewers is that it has the right flavor and mix of crime and emotional drama. While it is entirely the solely expected mob crime movie it has a much unexpected value of feelings. Especially towards the end of the movie viewers get a heavy load of it and it fuels reaching a solid ending. The positive chemistry between the main leads Depp and Pacino is another winner. Both of them have big movies and scores under their belts and the director uses them to cleverly influence the viewers. While Pacino is a household name for mob movies I recall Depp appears seldom in them and another strong one being Public Enemies back in 2009.  In this role Depp depicts an emotionless face but underneath he finely portrays the ambition and at the same time the fear which he hides inside.\n\nThe majority of the movie runs on crime but does not show crime as such. However there is one scene which is brutal and overly gruesome for even the hardest of crime movie fans. But through that scene the director gives a clear message to the viewer about the filthy reality of the mob and what Donnie has to deal while performing his duty. And no crime and mob movie is completed without a gang murder. But Donnie Brasco goes beyond being a movie about loyal gangsters and murderers.",

            "content": "\"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas\" are so iconic that there isn't really space for any other crime film in the conversation, but \"Donnie Brasco\" will forever be the sleeper in this race.  I am not foolish enough to suggest that this film is better than the aforementioned classics, but it does set itself apart by approaching the mob from a different angle: the FBI.  This true story plays out perfectly as Joe Pistone (aka Donnie Brasco) is drawn so far into the Mafia that he has trouble separating his alias from his real life.  Johnny Depp is magnificent as Pistone and it may be his greatest emotional role.  The film has a few iconic moments, particularly Depp's \"forget-about-it\" explanation.  The real draw of this film is Al Pacino.  Just when you think that he's played his last great role, he steps into the shoes of Lefty Ruggiero.  Lefty is not the type of Mafia member that we are used to in the movies.  He is loyal to a fault and continually passed over by the family, struggling to make ends meet and wondering what has happened to his life.  Pacino captures that frustration with perfection.  I did not expect much from Anne Heche (especially after seeing her in the \"Psycho\" remake), but she was absolutely stunning.  The emotions behind her dialogue as she confronts her changing husband have resulted in one of my favorite lines from any movie: \"Why do you hate me, when I love you so much?\"  I also have to point out that Paul Giamatti and, no matter how small the role, he makes every movie better.  This film was honored with a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay but with movies like \"The Fully Monty\" and \"L.A. Confidential\" in the running, it is hard to believe that this was not nominated for Best Picture.  \"Donnie Brasco\" is an amazing true story that will satisfy your need for the mob while letting the good guys win for once.",

While not as talked about as other crime stories, I had never heard of this one, I think Newell brings justice to the tale. His account may make the mafia seem a little typical but New York Italians were like this in the 70s. They had a walk about them, a talk, a mannerism that has become iconic. They were making history as they were murdering and stealing. Depp is pulled into this world as an undercover agent and becomes a friend, a dear one to his representative Pacino, who has lived this life for thirty years. Think about what life you wouldn't want to live no matter the goal, while you watch this. Think about what you would sacrifice so you could accomplish something. We commend in speeches and essays the sacrifices of those who get the job done. What job is more important? It's a valid question. Who is most important? What's easier, being a killer or posing as one to catch him? This movie isn't about black and white life. It's not that you're either a cop or a robber. It's whether you're a good man or not and the meaning of such a responsibility as to be a good man. Emotions run high and the performances are stellar. This is not simply a crime movie but a good hard look at what evil and fighting evil can do to someone.",

How does Depp do a role like this, and how are he and Al Pacino such a good team?  Ah well, \"forget about it\".  Based Joesph D. Pistone's and Richard Woodley's book Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia, Donnie Brasco follows FBI agent Joesph D. Pistone infiltrating the Bonanno crime family in New York during 1978 under the alias Donnie Brasco, aka \"The Jewel Man\".  He meets a hit-man named Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero, and he works with him, deepening the investigation.  The film explores the underground crime world of New York and Miami by showing crimes ranging from typical to full-on organized, which is aided by graphic violence and language.  Mike Newell brings Paul Attanasio's smartly written script to the big screen through perfect direction that involves the timing of the scene, the setting of scenes, and the time of day for each part.  The script isn't melodramatic, as there are moments of humor, partying, and the guys being themselves.  Patrick Doyle does a great job with the music by adding in the right tunes to any scene, and timing the music when it's needed.  The best part about Donnie Brasco is the incredible acting, including Johnny Depp as the title character (alias though).  Depp expresses a captivating portrayal as the undercover FBI agent, showing his talent as an actor that hasn't been used as much anymore as he's more into comedy films in recent years.  Another great performance is Al Pacino as Lefty, and the pairing of him and Depp is flat-out amazing, this creating the perfect connection between the two actors.  This crime film digs deep into the characters by revealing information of their past, as well as their present lives, family, and what's going on in their lives, good and bad.  The film also shows how the investigation is impacted the ones involved with or part of the case, showcasing detailed events that capture what is necessary.  Another must-see film, and one that shows a new side in Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.",

He thrives in these type roles and it was actually rather refreshing to see him play a role of a character that never quite made it to the top. Don't even think about skipping out this one.",

            "content": "I first saw Donnie Brasco the year it came out, 1997, and didn't think much of it. As a brash 15 year old, what did I know? I took away a few funny quotes to use with my friends such as, \"you're gonna kill me with that draft!\"\n\nFast forward 15 years, I decided to re-watch . . . Brasco. This film is surprising on many levels. \n\nThe first being the performances by Pacino and Depp. Pacino, perhaps justly, gets broadly painted as a cartoonish and angry actor, but in Brasco the subtle nuances of his character Lefty are praiseworthy. He comes across not as Pacino wedging his personality onto another Italian-American mobster, but a genuinely disillusioned old wiseguy who is bitterly aware that his time is ending. I empathized with Lefty, and isn't that the ultimate goal of the actor?\n\nRegarding Depp: I think Johnny Depp is an overrated actor. A fawning lady's and poor man's Gary Oldman. That said, this is probably his finest work as an actor. Depp is so convincing in his range of emotions: from his \"trustworthy\" personality when convincing Lefty that he is a connected mobster (the scene in the car when he tells Lefty to apologize), to a troubled FBI agent whose undercover persona is taking over his life (cooking breakfast for his children clad in \"wife-beater\" T and gold chain), Depp is Oscar worthy. \n\nThe drawback to this film is that the storyline is relatively uninspired, although it gets a pass for being mostly true. By 1997, America is well aware of the Mobster/Wiseguy/FBI story, and Brasco is an unfortunate casualty of that timeline: it catches the very end of that era.",
