It's kind of beautiful and yet creates a sense of unease at the same time.  I can't explain it but that's how this movie makes me feel while watching it.  I fast forwarded through the rape scene this time because it just seems way too real and makes me want to throw up.  Whole scene juts hurts my heart.  Love Taylor Sheridan, I think he's proven that he knows what he is doing.",

Elisabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner do an excellent job with their character, both of their performance are engaging. The movie is about how hard and unfair it is to live in the Native reserve in the cold North, it's maybe even too harsh sometimes painting characters that have lost will to live, that have to fight unfair battle just because they are born there.  \n\nThe movie is sometimes hard to watch. The snowy mountains surrounding the movie is a threat for the eyes but also enhance the cold truths of the movie.",

Sheridan's writing additionally makes phenomenal use of and interpretation of the gritty cop/fish out of water tropes. \n\nIn turn, Elizabeth Olsen gives a believable performance as green FBI agent, trying to solve the case or get back to her office--whichever comes first. Jeremy Renner's bona fides as a brooding, grief-stricken hardman are only furthered here, as he struggles to find redemption and find some sort of peace. Renner's chemistry with Graham Greene's Ben brings to life a backstory and rapport between the two that is as fully-fleshed as it is unspoken. \n\nThis modern western is beautifully shot and my lasting memory are the well-timed use of wide shots to show that this story's protagonists are largely alone, and that sometimes vengeance must be undertaken in a cold-far away place from one's humanity. The film declines to pass moral judgment on whether this path of vengeance and redemption is good or bad; but it highlights that for this to be the only way to get justice, these people, this reservation, are far removed from what society would deem appropriate. And that is the larger tragedy in this film, and what makes it so hard to watch, but for all the right reasons.",
