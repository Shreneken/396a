            "content": "\"Turn in your badge and gun.\"\n*snaps photo of this cultural landmark*\n\nFritz Lang tosses out the conventional mystery elements many consider integral to the noir genre to instead focus on a one-man crusade from Ford to combat corruption and seek revenge after sticking his nose where he shouldn't have. Dripping with classic dialogue and features that would come to be considered tropes in the action genre, The Big Heat is surprisingly brutal for its time without resorting to expolitative narrative, and still retaining psychological and social themes beneath the surface. Lang delivers a portrait of crime as a social disease, refusing to inject the romanticism that others had already begun adding on to their underworld subjects; it's morally bankrupt and relentless, and all that touch it end up tainted. Scourby is technically the big bad, but it's the sadistic, streetwise Vince Stone (played by a shockingly young Lee Marvin) and Nolan's Bertha Duncan, a remorseless collaborator on the dole, that steal the show as the true forces to be reckoned with. Plenty of darkened rooms, shadows cast by window blinds, and shallowly disguised threats followed up with fists, all brought together expertly under Lang's still-solid direction. Dave Bannion may not be the first name that comes to mind when considering defining film characters of the genre, but much of his design has been co-opted or adapted to a massive range of subsequent projects. (4/5)",

            "content": "Dark secrets around every corner.\n\nFritz Lang's classic film noir The Big Heat (1953) is strikingly modern, pessimistic, and beautiful. Yet, it's also hopeful in its belief in the perseverance of good men and women doing the right thing. Lang's direction feels smaller and intimate like an indie production with dark undertones. He brings a seedy underworld of police bribery and abuse of women to the light with a scathing critique of the cowardice of men who stand by while women are hurt or killed. Fritz Lang's direction captures your attention with every detail and clue. His uneasy atmosphere keeps you on edge the entirety of The Big Heat's brief 90 minutes. Charles Nelson's editing utilizes sharp cuts from clue to clue, wasting no time. The Big Heat is easily Fritz Lang's most entertaining and fun film with impeccable filmmaking at the forefront.\n\nGlenn Ford is tough and compelling as Homicide Detective Sergeant Dave Bannion. His sure footed personality feels like a confident and strong Humphrey Bogart film noir archetype with a personal sincerity to him. Ford's acting is subtle, then suddenly explosive with a realistic fury over despicable men who hurt women for profit and coverups. His pain over this case appears in his anguished eyes and voice rife with indignation. Jocelyn Brando's supporting performance as Katie Bannion is excellent. She feels like a genuine wife and sweet love interest as she acts alongside Glenn Ford. I found out she was Marlon Brando's older sister and it's clear she carries the same dramatic skill in her effortless performance here in The Big Heat.\n\nGloria Grahame steals the show as the deliriously playful and astonishingly real role as Debby Marsh. She is funny, dreamy, sympathetic, and fierce in a versatile performance. Gloria Grahame is simply unforgettable in The Big Heat. Clay Campbell's make-up for Debby's scarred face is impressive for 1953 standards. Lee Marvin's fearsome supporting actor role as Vince Stone should have gotten him an Oscar. He is terrifying with a quiet temper that bursts into a visceral rage. His every line bears a heavy gravitas with Marvin's powerful screen presence and deep commanding voice.\n\nAlexander Scourby is interesting as the greaseball villain in a nice suit named Mike Lagana. His control over each situation makes his antagonist feel like a serious contender. Jeanette Nolan's supporting actress as Bertha Duncan has great range with her complex portrayal in The Big Heat. Peter Whitney's sleazy bartender is pretty fun in his interrogation scene. Adam Williams' whining and fear in his eyes as hitman Larry Gordon is engaging. Dorothy Green's Lucy Chapman has a great scene near the beginning of The Big Heat with her lively zeal.\n\nWilliam P. McGivern and Sydney Boehm's writing is grounded in heartfelt emotions of love and longing alongside gritty realism over how crime syndicates operate in large cities. It's a fantastic script is endless entertainment driven from what will happen next. Charles Lang's black and white cinematography captures the fear of these characters and the uncertainty of a violent world wherein people can get disappeared. Henry Vars and Arthur Morton's score is all the curiosity inspiring symphonic jazz you need for a film noir. Jean Louis' costumes are slicks suits and dazzling dresses from top to bottom.\n\nIn all, I truly enjoyed Fritz Lang returning to film noir after classics like M with his crime thriller The Big Heat.",

I love how hardboiled this one is, with Ford becoming suspicious after some discrepancies in a fellow cop's suicide, and a woman getting viciously murdered.  He's soon fighting upstream against a wave of corruption, and then getting threatened himself, but I won't say more about the plot.  All of the performances are terrific.  Ford is a sweet and decent guy with his family, brave and unflinching in confronting evil, and tough when he needs to be - tiptoeing along the line of being too tough in some cases, the moral ambiguity of which is interesting.  Grahame is just delightful, particularly in the scene where she shimmies about during cocktail hour.  Of the villains, Lee Marvin plays a sadist very well, and is explosive in every scene he's in.  Director Fritz Lang harnesses it all well, including the strong script based on William P. McGivern's novel, and the pace is perfect.  I loved how the film was clear enough to follow, but at the same time, had quite a bit of depth to it.  Great stuff, and clearly influential.",

It has a lot of drama, and a few mysterious pieces of the puzzle that we get to see slowly fall into place. I like the fact that we always know who is behind the crimes, but it’s all a matter of when the cops will put the pieces together. The heart of the film is Glenn Ford and the loving relationship with his wife. When that is eventually used against him, it drives a lot of the emotion in the second half of the film. I usually have some slight qualms when it comes to rooting for these hard-boiled detectives, because they all tend to be broken men. This character, on the other hand, I get to experience his breaking so I sympathize more. If anything they didn’t play this part up enough, and they could have gone further with it. There did seem to be some missteps in the second half, and I was worried the film would lose that emotional core. Eventually it came back around and won me over again. The conclusion was appropriate although it was a bit unsatisfying. I ended up happy with The Big Heat, but I think it could have been truly great with a few minor changes to the storyline. Still, I’d definitely recommend it to others as a solid film noir.",

I have a soft spot for Ford anyway because he reminds me of my grandfather.  And he is excellent in this, especially paired with hot mess Gloria Grahame and supported by Lee Marvin in a memorable role as villain. \n\nThe Big Heat is not available to stream on any of the subscription services, but Netflix does have it on disc.",

            "content": "This is, at least on its surface, a fairly standard film noir with a few standout elements. It doesn't make as strong an impression as the greatest classics of the genre - The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, etc. - but it's still a strong film. On the special features on the film's DVD, Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann make compelling arguments for its greatness. Roger Ebert's Great Movies review of it also advances an interesting, subversive reading of the film, but you should only read Ebert's piece after you've seen the movie.\n\nThe movie opens with a policeman committing suicide under suspicious circumstances. Another detective, Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) begins a long, costly investigation into police corruption, which ends up having unforeseen, brutal consequences. Also involved are a rough gangster (Lee Marvin), the gangster's girlfriend (Gloria Grahame), and Bannion's wife (Jocelyn Brando, Marlon's sister).\n\nI can't really discuss the movie too much without spoiling things, but suffice it to say the movie packs in several surprising, violent twists. There are two moments in particular, one involving a pot of boiling coffee, that make the movie possibly one of the grimmest and most violent noirs from the 1950s. The overall structure of the movie plays out in a fairly straightforward, predictable fashion, but the events along the way definitely do shock and surprise. \n\nGlenn Ford is fine as Bannion, though he just doesn't have the presence of a Humphrey Bogart. More interesting is Gloria Grahame's excellent performance as the gangster's girlfriend, who gets a lot more to do in the movie than you think she will at first. She's the real standout character in the movie. Lee Marvin is also quite good as the villainous gangster, but then Marvin was always a great villain. It seems odd that the movie was directed by Fritz Lang, the creator of the German Expressionist classics Metropolis and M, because it's possibly the most stylistically plain and uninflected film noir I've ever seen. It just looks like a standard black-and-white movie, with little overtly arty camerawork. Maybe that was part of the point, to make a barebones, stripped-down movie, but the shadowy lighting of most noir has always been part of the genre's appeal to me. So, overall, it's a little dryer than most noirs, but still worthwhile.",

It has also one of the most hilariously badly acted scenes ever when Bannion's daughter starts crying (really bad) and runs away laughing the next minute. Bannion's wife is hot though (even for today's standards - and she knows how to cook a good steak).\n\nI can't really add any substantial details or remarks.

Shoot-outs, fist fights, femme fatales, brutal thugs, revenge, and a crooked cop blend together beautifully and build quite an atmosphere-- but there's something special about the film that sets it apart from your average '50's thriller.  It's consistently brutal-- especially the scene where Lee Marvin throws scalding coffee in Gloria Grahame's face-- and its honesty makes the plot feel more authentic.  It's a simple tale-- a good cop, Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) is solving the supposed suicide of a colleague.  He has a beautiful wife (Jocelyn Brando), a loving daughter, and faithful friends.  His world is turned upside-down however, when a murderer, who appears to be violent thug Vince Stone (Lee Marvin), begins to kill people connected to major crime boss Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby)-- one of them being Bannion's wife.  Leaving behind the laws, he decides to go after the people responsible death: with Stone's moll (Gloria Grahame) is tow, who also wants a bit of revenge.  \"The Big Heat\" is one of the few film noirs that aged the best.  It have to get around censors to make its message lessen, but the story itself is so cruel and violent that even when a horrific event takes place of screen it makes you cringe.  Fritz Lang, who is masterful at make dark thrillers like this one, skips around every cliche, and seems to make sure not one minute of the film is predictable.  I was shocked constantly at how evil some of the characters are (the protagonist even battles some serious demons), but that only makes the film better.  Everything about \"The Big Heat\" is hard-boiled.  It doesn't stay in the box, but it doesn't necessarily out.  Film noir doesn't get any better than this.  Recommended.",

Dave becomes more involved in this case than he should, because it might effect his love ones. But Dave is one of those who doesn't leave a case unsolved.\n\nThe Big Heat is a great film noir. The reason I think it's great is because it isn't as stylistic as the other noir films. Here there's is no glamour, every one has an average look. A killing is a horrible thing, not poetic in any ways, which this film is able to bring out perfectly. Glenn Ford gives us a pretty solid performance as the vengeful policeman, that won't rest until he track down the killers. In other words, Fritz Lang, the creator of the greatest thriller ever made M, has once again given us a great film that shocks us, thrills us, engages us and makes us ask questions, but the only problem I can think of is that some of the question that keeps bugging us becomes unanswered.

Dave is an honest, good man, who will stop at nothing to end this corruption.  When recalling some of my favorite Noirs, I routinely credit 'The Big Heat', so I decided to re-watch it and make sure it stood up to what I remembered and I was glad to see that it absolutely does.   This is an extremely taught Noir, that has a streamlined story that is extremely well paced.  It's not as atmospheric as I remember, at lest compared to films like 'The Big Combo', but  their are some beautiful sequences, like the end confrontation between Dave Bannion and Vince Stone (Lee Marvin).   Early on, the film touches on the family life of a police officer, and the struggles that come with it.  We witness the countless interruptions which persistently interrupt Dave and his wife's time together and really get an insight into this lifestyle, which I don't think many other Noirs touch on to the same degree.  Like most of my favorite Noirs, the protagonist in this film is a man's man and the villains are down right rotten individuals.  Dave Bannion is such a great main protagonist whose no no-nonsense, steak and potatoes demeanor only aid in the viewers compassion towards him as the stakes escalates.  When Dave becomes rogue due to the police corruption reaching levels he didn't imagine, the film becomes almost more of revenge flick but it perfectly walks that fine line between vigilante and good Samaritan.  The film asks the viewer to question what is the main difference between the good and bad guys.  Its well written, exciting (I swear this film has some of the best action sequences for the time), and directed by a master story-teller.   Oh, and Lee Marvin is so much fun to watch as the vile, Vince Stone, whose abusive Misogynist ways are tough to watch.  Oh, and I guess I should also mention that Gloria Grahame is great in this as well.  Just  a stellar Noir in every way.",

The Big Heat is wonderfully dark and sarcastic; and on the other hand, Glenn Ford delivers a protagonist who's very different than most heroes of the genre, and is in fact more idealistic and likable than most of them. And Lang's cinematography shows that he still has a lot of baggage left over from his silent movie years, which makes it even more unique. Great film all around.",

Although Lang doesn't come across as the great compositional stylist he once was during his days directing his great Expressionist silent films in Wiemar Germany, he does resort to flashes of raw, sudden violence that must have been quite shocking for American tastes in 1953, and remains remarkable even today.

Everyone in this one stands out, but Glenn Ford is blistering in his portrayal of an angry detective hell-bent on taking down the nest of criminals roosting in high places (and hey, he was born in Quebec City). The script is taut, the dialogue lines pure muscle. One of my favorite moments is when Gloria Grahame tells Jeanette Nolan they're \"sisters under the mink\"(part of the pleasure is knowing what's coming next). This is one of my favorite Grahame performances, and her moments with Ford are wonderful. She really had a way of lighting things up around a great leading man, like she did with Bogie in In A Lonely Place. Lee Marvin does a bang-up job of convincing us he's pure snakeoil, and everyone else really does sell it. The direction is all Lang, dark, edgy, baldly convinced it knows the difference between good and evil in the hearts of human beings. Corruption is a Lang specialty, especially social malaise. I like to think of his post-war stuff as a refraction of pre-war experience, the society gone sick with evil, people destroying each other to keep their pile. We see it in some of his early pictures, but like other European directors who came to Hollywood before the worst of things, the post-war movies echo the darkness they saw, and the 1953 of The Big Heat is really not far at all from the mid-40s of Europe. It's a gripping story from start to finish, with plenty of shocks. Reminded me of Chandler and company, noir cops and detectives routing out the Sin. And this one does, all light and shadows in glorious light and shadow, and lots of dark. Great stuff.",

Glenn Ford almost continuously seethes, poor Gloria Grahame gets some great lines & coffee she didn't order, Marvin excels as the heavy. Lang's hand is professional here, but really only functional.

            "content": "Riveting plot will keep you nailed to your seat\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\n'The Big Heat' is a film noir classic due to its original and riveting plot. The film draws you right in with the suicide of a police officer in his home and his widow, Bertha Duncan (played by Jeanette Nolan) who hides the suicide note which implicates Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby), the town's number one crime boss. Duncan concocts a plot to blackmail Lagana, making sure the suicide note is released to the press in the event of her death.\n\nAssigned to investigate the suicide is Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford). Bannion interviews Duncan who is uncooperative and hostile. Bannion then gets a tip from B-girl Lucy Chapman who insists that Duncan's husband didn't commit suicide and implied that he was on Lagana's payroll. (I had trouble believing that she would have met with Bannion in open view at the nightclub which easily tipped off the mobsters that she was spilling her guts). Bannion turns up dead the next day, the victim of multiple stab wounds and possible sexual assault by a psychopath (the coroner's report to Bannion on the B-girl's death foreshadows some of the more explicit scenes of violence to come).\n\nWhen Bannion gets a phone call threatening his family at home, he decides to confront Lagana directly. Lagana is depicted as a man who seeks to project an image of a model citizen?he even has a picture of his mother on the wall and tells Bannion that he cared for her in his home right before her death a year before. Bannion isn't impressed by Lagana's phony resume and ends up slugging Lagana's bodyguard which outrages the crime boss further.\n\nIn a scene you can never forget, after Bannion gives his wife the car keys, she leaves to go on an errand while he's singing nursery songs to his daughter. Suddenly there's a tremendous explosion right outside the window. Bannion runs out to find his wife trapped in a burning car. He breaks the car window and pulls her out. But it's too late. She's the victim of a car bomb.\n\nAfter the funeral (never seen on screen), Bannion meets with the Police Commissioner who suggests that his wife was murdered by criminals Bannion may have locked up in the past. It's clear that he doesn't want to investigate the possibility of Lagana's involvement. Bannion accuses the Commissioner of being in league with Lagana who promptly demands his resignation. Bannion turns in his badge but keeps his gun which he bought himself.\n\nBannion finds out from the crime lab that parts of the bomb are linked to an auto salvage shop. The owner at the shop won't tell him anything but after he leaves, a crippled woman who works at the shop as an office assistant, tells him that a man named Larry called the shop from a nightclub (The Retreat) where Bannion had met the recently deceased B-girl Chapman earlier. Unable to find out who Larry is, Bannion still makes the acquaintance of Lagana's right hand man, Vince Stone (played by a very young Lee Marvin) at the Retreat. Bannion prevents Stone from beating up a woman who he's been playing a game of dice with at the bar.\n\nStone's girlfriend, Debby Marsh (played by an over-the-top Gloria Grahame) comes on to Bannion and they end up at his hotel room. Bannion wants Debby to tell him who Larry is but she's more interested in having an affair with him. Later, after Vince finds out that Marsh has been talking with Bannion, he scalds her face with a pot of steaming hot coffee. With her face (and life) basically ruined, Marsh has no compunctions about revealing Larry's identity. Bannion confronts Larry Gordon, the sadistic hit-man hired by Vince to kill Chapman as well as the one responsible for the death of Bannion's wife. But Bannion doesn't kill him?he extracts the information he's been looking for: Bertha Duncan has been blackmailing Lagana all along with her now deceased husband's suicide note. He tells Gordon that he plans to let his mob associates know that he's a snitch.\n\nDebby Marsh now seeks revenge on both Stone and Lagana. She bumps off Duncan (who is the actual femme fatale in this film noir) and then throws scalding hot coffee in Vince's face at this apartment (how she so easily got in is not explained). Stone then shoots Marsh just as Bannion arrives who gets in a shootout with him. Now out of bullets, Bannion has a chance to finish Stone off but decides to hand him into the police. A newspaper headline reveals that Lagana and the Police Commissioner (who was seen in an earlier scene playing cards with Stone and was a witness to Stone scalding Marsh with the hot coffee) have been indicted and presumably on their way to jail. Bannion is restored to his old job (why he doesn't get a promotion I have no idea) and once again is a respected member of the Police Force.\n\nWhat sets 'The Big Heat' apart from some of the lesser \"B-rated\" film noirs is the complicated plot as well as director Fritz Lang's decision not to 'soft pedal' any of the violent scenes here. His message is that when criminals kill, they do so with no conscience. So the car bombing scene along with Lee Marvin's treatment of women (to the point where he has no pangs about throwing a pot of scalding coffee in a woman's face) is both explicit and shocking. The collusion of the 'respectable' Police Commissioner and the timidity Bannion's colleagues add to the overall atmosphere of dread. The Big Heat is by no means a 'perfect' film as it sometimes falls back into the typical sentimental moments of the B noir. The story overall however, is most satisfying as it will keep you riveted in your seat throughout.",

            "content": "Being black and white this film suffers for me. But aside from that its first rate action.  Our detective works in a corrupt city run by a crook.   It is about a cop who takes on the crime syndicate that controls his city after the brutal murder of his beloved wife. \r\n\r\nSEE the entire film here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=the+big+heat+1953+full+movie&mid=821A9A1FD4AFE35610A8821A9A1FD4AFE35610A8&view=detail&FORM=VIRE1\r\n\r\nThe movie should have been called The Retreat.  Thats where all the action happens.  Its a bar, a strange name being called The Retreat, isn't it?  \r\n\r\nDave Bannion is an upright but unscrupulous cop on the trail of a vicious gang he suspects holds power over the police force. Bannion is tipped off after a colleague's suicide and his fellow officers' suspicious silence lead him to believe that they are on the gangsters' payroll. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS61pc38m76pu6cV4RT8QHw13drQxv2YBE57f49MBOwhO8gDATR[/img]\r\n\r\nWhen a bomb meant for him kills his wife instead, Bannion becomes a furious force of vengeance and justice, aided along the way by the gangster's spurned girlfriend Debbie. As Bannion and Debbie fall further and further into the Gangland's insidious and brutal trap, they must use any means necessary (including murder) to get to the truth. \r\n\r\nYou can guess what happens to cops like our lead, Glenn Ford. He as zero support from his superiors cause they're all bought and paid for.\r\n\r\nThe Big Heat is aptly titled.  The Heat is supplied by Mike Lagana, a town mobster.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5Qj2VeVLHc4ZaGh72gSkubbv4rccnLu001LsZOd6x0Rnej_Cq[/img]\r\n\r\nLook for Lee Marvin. Hey, this guy was trim in the day. Doing his typical gagster role, Marvin loves to throw hot coffee on his girlfriends.\r\n\r\nWell acted, well directed. This one's a knock out for its day.\r\n\r\nSuggest anyone wanting to be an honest cop not watch this film.  You will drop out of the force before you join it.\r\n\r\nFast paced, great acting from Debby (Gloria Grahame).  Defines film noir for you students of film.\r\n\r\nOf course, Glenn Ford turns in a stunning performance as a detective fighting corruption all around.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrIqDjVS-t6otpMseQxUG1KKBJjJb7njwWTU8px5mVVwo2rYz_IA[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nSays one unpaid reviewer:\r\n\r\n\"This film is a precursor to \"Serpico\" starring Al Pacino many years later. It's the story of an honest cop surrounded by corrupt and cowardly police officials who are in the take of a powerful city mafia. It's like Chicago during the times of Al Capone.\r\n\r\n The script is well written and has a good pace. The scenes are neither too short or too prolonged, just the right amount to move the story along. The actors played their parts well: Lee Marvin as a sadistic degenerate thug is very convincing as is Gloria Grahame playing his not so empty headed girlfriend, who has more depth and humanity than meets the eye. \"\r\n\r\n[img]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSDqL9inusxYKwnrpHLYt_7mA59_DG5tzUcjBYf8TeKApKNufB1AQ[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES about the film:\r\n\r\n1   The New York Times and Variety both gave The Big Heat very positive reviews. Bosley Crowther of the Times described Glenn Ford \"as its taut, relentless star\" and praises Lang for bringing \"forth a hot one with a sting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2    \"Best known is Gloria Grahame's disfigurement at the hands of über-thug Lee Marvin, who flings hot coffee into her face.\"\r\n\r\n3    According to film critic Grant Tracey, the film turns the role of the femme fatale on its head.\r\n\r\n[img]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRB6aUhg-eaG-KUIsBmOM1dYfhmaWzn5G0Hs88qrQHEQrmaltUo[/img]\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\n70%\r\n A noir noir.

This is an early --- if not the earliest --- version of this trope in US movies that has continued all the way up to today's Edge of Darkness with Mel Gibson playing the stubborn cop.  Glenn Ford, whose career was overshadowed by his later mild work in TV melodramas, shows his acting chops here, carrying the film on his tense shoulders.  The twist in the middle of the film --- although repeated endlessly in later flicks --- remains very affecting, even surprising.

            "content": "The Big Heat is right up there with \"Touch of Evil\" as one of the top noir films of the 1950s.  The movie starts with the suicide of police sergeant which soon sets off a chain of events which will transform Detective David Bannion (Glenn Ford) into a single-minded machine.  The story of crime and corruption will be familiar to anyone who's ever seen similar cop movies and yet, it's not a tired film, it moves along at a fast and angry pace.  Modern films like \"Sin City\" owe a great debt to this film, and Clint Eastwood seems to have modeled his entire career off of it (Who knew Glenn Ford of all people could inspire Dirty Harry?).  This is down-and-dirty gutter crime disguised in a 1950s package.  Director Fritz Lang (Metropolis) makes use of cheap sets and backgrounds, if not ignoring them all together as his characters set fire to the screen.  Debby (Gloria Grahame) girlfriend of mobster Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) walks the tight rope above her violent boyfriend's temper, always willing to prod him, even though it might cost her.  None of the characters seem too in charge of their own destinies though.  The mob bosses sit around, fretting over the rogue cop who pursues them, and the corrupt police officials watch impotently as the mob bosses beat and torture women.  Only Bannion seems motivated by some specific purpose, and whether that's justice or revenge, no one can really say.  He's seemingly indestructable and unstoppable, and shows no sense of fear as he charges through rooms of petty criminals.  Debby attempts to seduce him, more as a way of annoying Vince Stone than of getting any pleasure from him, but she can only elicit an unconscious disgust in Bannion: \"I wouldn't Touch anything of Stone's\" he snarls at her.  Such pure, unrestrained hatred rarely finds it's way onto the big screen, and it's alot of fun to watch.  Artistic touches are subtle as Lang allows the story to unfold artfully, the directing style could be described as no-frills, but it's necessarily sparce, as it allows the story and performances to stand in the forefront.  Fans of crime drama should see this film, not because of it's historical importance, or because it inspired so many imitators, they should see it because it's just damned good.",

The movie starts with the suicide of police sergeant which soon sets off a chain of events which will transform Detective David Bannion (Glenn Ford) into a single-minded machine.  The story of crime and corruption will be familiar to anyone who's ever seen similar cop movies and yet, it's not a tired film, it moves along at a fast and angry pace.  Modern films like \"Sin City\" owe a great debt to this film, and Clint Eastwood seems to have modeled his entire career off of it (Who knew Glenn Ford of all people could inspire Dirty Harry?).

            "content": "The Big Heat is a fantastic film noir by one of cinema's legitimate masters, Fritz Lang. This classic is highlighted by performances from Glenn Ford as a detective hellbent on avenging those responsible for the killing of his wife, Lee Marvin as the muscle of a gangster boss, and finally Gloria Grahame as Marvin's girlfriend in what certainly is one of her best performances. All the leads give good performances but it is Gloria Grahame's performance that deserves most recognition, one which was deserving of an Oscar nomination it's just too bad she didn't get one for this film; fortunately, she won it the year before for another great film, the show biz classic The Bad and the Beautiful. The mood/atmosphere and look of the film is quintessential Fritz Lang; his direction isn't showy or anything but it is beautifully executed. It is shot in pristine b&w photography by the great Charles Lang. The biggest highlight in the film is the coffee scene in which Lee Marvin's character throws a boiling hot coffee pot at Gloria Grahame's character and other highlights include the car bomb that accidentally kills Glenn Ford's wife (played by Marlon Brando's sister Jocelyn) and the film's ultimate climax. It's also interesting to note that all of the female leads are killed off. The Big Heat represents the highlight of Fritz Lang's tenure in Hollywood (a time in his career that admittedly wasn't nearly as impressive as his time as an expressionist filmmaker in the silent era and early thirties, but nevertheless featured some notable classics such as this one, The Woman in the Window, Scarlett Street and The Ministry of Fear). Highly recommended viewing for any movie fan; a must see movie even after so many decades. The Big Heat is not only one of the greatest examples of film noir, but also one of the greatest films ever made. 10/10",

I donât know if this movie is talking about the violence against women and the hot-blooded cop. The four main female characters are all dead because of the leading male character, Bannion. Bannion directly or indirectly leads to the death of four women in the film. The first woman is Lucy who was dead because Bannion is so stupid to distrust her and told Bertha about her. That can impute to Bannionâs mistake. The second woman was Mrs. Bannion whose death also leads to the revenge as the main plot in the film. Her death was directly cause by Mr. Bannion, he was the one who originally should die. The third woman is the widow, Bertha. She was killed by the other woman, Debby, who has something between her and Bannion.  That was, the last dead woman is Debby, the leading female character. She kind of fall in love with Bannion in the film, it was not Bannion that makes her disfigured by her husband and then also be killed by him. If she didnât have the relationship with Bannion, she wouldnât die. Besides, I found out that Bertha and Debby wore the same fur in the scene they meet. I am a little curious about that, I wonder about what the message is in this scene. Maybe it wanted to present that these two women are in the same boat or same poor situation. I saw the poster in the mail and that was the picture which Debby kneels down in front of Bannion. I consider it as that Debby was totally under Bannion sexual power in this symbolic picture. Professor always told as the gun as the sexual symbol, and in this picture, Bannion also has a gun in his hand; furthermore the position of these two is really symbolic, I guess so.",

            "content": "As a tough-talking, two-fisted, homicide police sergeant bent on revenge, Glenn Ford's Sergeant David Bannion in Fritz Lang's superlative thriller \"The Big Heat\" serves as a kind of prototype for Clint Eastwood's \"Dirty Harry\" character. This seminal saga about police corruption and metropolitan crime syndicates in the fictional town of Kenport appears a little dated by today's standards with its obvious studio sets and its black & white photography, but it still packs a wallop. \"Mystery Street\" scenarist Sidney Boehm based his screenplay on William P. McGivern's Saturday Evening Post serial. Before veteran cop Tom Duncan commits suicide, he leaves a written record of his corrupt dealings with big-time hoodlum Mike Lagana (urbane Alexander Scourby of \"Seven Thieves\") for the district attorney. Duncan's greedy wife wants the payoffs to continue, however, so she blackmails Lagana for $500 a week. Sergeant Dave Bannion finds himself assigned to the case. \"When a cop kills himself, they want a full report,\" he says to a fellow policeman at the scene of the suicide. Bannion generates a lot of hostility in getting that \"full report\" not only among the paranoid criminal figures but also with his superiors some of whom may or may not be on the take.\n\nEverything comes to a head one evening when Bannion and his pretty wife Katie (Marlon's older sister Jocelyn Brando of \"Ten Wanted Men\") are bound for a movie. Katie commandeers their car while Dave tells their young daughter Joyce (Linda Bennett of \"Creature with the Atomic Brain\") a bedtime story. She is going to drive off to pick up the babysitter. Unfortunately, Katie never gets out of their driveway because several sticks of dynamite attached to the ignition explode and kill her when she starts the car. Of course, the criminals expected Dave to die in the explosion. Dave survives and sends his daughter off to live with some friends while he starts smashing heads. Mike Lagana isn't any too happy about this error. Meanwhile, Dave's superiors turn up the heat on him to cool off, but he refuses to and quits the force to take care of business. Along the way, he crosses paths with a dame, Debby Marsh (Oscar winner Gloria Grahame of \"The Bad and the Beautiful\"), and they chat in his motel room. Word reaches Debby's thuggish boyfriend, Vince Stone (up and coming Lee Marvin of \"The Dirty Dozen\") and he takes his rage out on his girl by splashing her face with scalding coffee. Earlier, Stone burned a bar girl, Doris (Carolyn Jones of TV's \"The Addams Family\"), with his cigarette and attracted Dave's interest. Later, Dave has harsh words with Lagana, and our hero is forced to leave the force to complete his investigation. Dave and Debby become unlikely friends, and he confides in Debby that everything will blow up in Lagana's face if the wife of the dead cop were to release his death note. Debby visits Bertha Duncan (Jeanette Nolan of \"Tribute to a Bad Man\") and she has an interesting dialogue exchange with her about being 'sisters in mink' before she guns her down in cold blood as a favor to Dave. Actually, Dave turns into a rogue himself and he isn't much different from the scum that he wants to put away for the murder of his innocent, defenseless wife. Women fare horribly in \"The Big Heat.\" Indeed,all of the women involved in the plot, with the exception of Doris, wind up dead by fade-out.\n\nLang directs \"The Big Heat\" without any pretensions, and it is better for this treatment. The only complaint of mine is that we don't visually see Lagana suffer as a result of Bannion's investigation.",

Lee Marvin is appropriately sleazy in the role of a criminal who does some pretty awful things to women (one such incident involving scalding coffee). The biggest star in the film may be Fritz Lang, who directs the film with the same flair he displayed in The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and M. And unlike a lot of films from this period, the violence in this film seems mostly realistic but with a minimum of actual bloodshed (as Fritz Lang came from the generation of filmmakers that relied more on suggestion with such things - he pulls it off beautifully, except for the previously mentioned suicide).\n\nMaybe Fritz Lang's best American film. Not quite as good as his early German classics, but still a highlight of film noir. See it now, or else!\n\n*spoilers ahead!*\n\nI must also note some interesting parallels this has with the recent Dark Knight. In both films, a character is horribly scarred on one side of their face, and then decide to take it out on the criminals that made them that way. The person in this film, Gloria Graham, even has an awesome one-liner before shooting a corrupt cop's less-than-angelic widow. The widow is growing uncomfortable with Gloria's conversation and picks up the phone to call Lee Marvin to pick her up. She says something like \"You're obviously not well\" and in a slightly distant manner Gloria replies with \"I've never felt better.\" And then BAM! She shoots her. Awesome.",

Fritz Lang maîtrise parfaitement le genre et tout coule de source.\n\nL'intrigue est particulièrement captivante et le rythme rapide du film la soutient bien. Le spectateur se sent personnellement impliqué dans l'enquête du protagoniste qui cherche à venger le meurtre gratuit de sa femme. Le héros se fond à merveille dans l'archétype du personnage de film noir, entêté, violent et doté d'une répartie cinglante.\n\nUne oeuvre aboutie qui occupe une place de choix dans la filmographie de Fritz Lang. Probablement la plus célébrée de sa série de films noirs, suivie de près par Scarlet Street et Woman in the Window.",

            "content": "Fritz Lang's films are fascinating takes on their genres because of his wisdom concering social evils, combining them with the unlikely perceptions of morally ambivalent characters. The Big Heat, however, appears to be a simple good vs. evil tale. An earnest family-oriented homicide detective played with a brimming force by Glenn Ford investigates the death of a fellow officer named Tom Duncan. It would seem to be an open-and-shut case, suicide brought on by depression, suspicion, implication and gut feelings leading up the hierarchy of the city mafia and to a retalation too close to Ford's home. Ford confronts a suave mob boss played by Alexander Scourby in his palatial home, where Scourby berates him for his nerve to bring his business into his home, to which Ford check-mates with a rhetorical interpretation of Scourby's criminality, implying the double standard of Scourby having his men deliver phone threats to his house. Of course, Marvin has yet to fully grasp just how far Scourby is willing to go with that double standard.\n\nLe Marvin plays a degenerate, abusive gang thug who is rotten to the core, an almost robotic agent of corruption and violence. He is sought after by Ford's heartening good guy. But The Big Heat is a classic revenge story. It rouses the vindictive morale inherent in the emotional facet of our hearts. And again, Lang unfolds a narrative following the darker side of a good person. Holding true to our lust for Ford's vindication, as well as the legal justice that serves as its circumstantial springboard, the bad guys are absolutely despicable slime, but Gloria Grahame's character is the misreading.\n\nGrahame, a fireworks display of unwavering presence, emotive skillfulness and unabashed sexiness, plays Marvin's girlfriend, whom we first see impressed when Ford stands up to her man after viciously punishes a girl in a nightclub by burning her hand with a cigarette butt, forcing him and his bodyguard out of the joint. She tries to get friendly with Ford, who keeps pointing out that she gets her money from a thief. Marsh states: \"I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better.\" But when she unwittingly reminds him of the time he courted his late wife he sends her packing: \"Well, you're about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs,\" she remarks. Despite her deceptive appearance as just another token gun moll, there is already very telling subtext latently established in this scene. What ignites her fascinating transformation is a shocking scene of cringe-inducing violence, when Marvin accuses her of talking to a cop about his activities and throws boiling coffee at her face, a shot that betrays this grisly act, for Lang understands the augmented horror of what we can only hear and not see.\n\nGrahame is on the wrong side of the law who is driven to a means of justice, as we see in her greatly increased screen time during the last half of the film. And boy, is revenge ever a dish best served cold. Lang's truth-seeking wisdom is the key to its transcendence of average formulaic noir exercise. There is an intrinsic need for each major and minor character. Some of them are highly unlikely on Hollywood terms but zealously realistic on social terms, such as a mob informant in the form of an old woman with a limp working at a storefront junkyard. And on top of it all, Grahame is the emboldened highlight of whom you simply cannot get enough in this thriller, one of the most masterful, entertaining and timeless achievements of the silver screen noir variety.",

Every woman in this movie is someone's tool, and Glenn Ford's Dave Bannion is awfully careless with his tools.\r\n\r\nA policeman has committed suicide.  His wife (Jeanette Nolan) claims that it is because he was not well; his girlfriend, Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green), says he was perfectly healthy and intended to divorce his wife and marry her.  Well, girlfriends do tend to believe that.  However, Bannion starts to find evidence that all was not well with the Duncan family.  In fact, Duncan seems to have been involved with the local mob boss, Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby).  Apparently, he's done taking the mob's money, and he leaves a note explaining all of it.  His widow hides the note in exchange for a hefty payoff from Lagana.  As part of his--unsanctioned--investigations, he encounters Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame), girlfriend of mob enforcer Vince Stone (Lee Marvin).  And it only gets more complicated from there--Bannion's wife, Katie (Marlon Brando's sister, Jocelyn) is killed in a car bomb meant for Bannion, and she is actually the second woman to die because of her association with Bannion.\r\n\r\nThat's what bothered me about this movie.  Bannion comes out okay, and woman after woman dies for him or because of him.  True, it also bothered me that I had a hard time keeping track of which police officers were crooked and which weren't--or maybe some of them changed their stance during the film, inspired by Bannion--but not half so much as the dead women.  Lucy is killed more because of her connection with Duncan and her awareness of his mob ties, but it is fairly clear that she wouldn't've been killed had she not started to talk.  What's worse, the only death that really seems to bother Bannion is that of his wife, and it is the one least attributable to his own actions.  Yes, he angered the mob with his investigations, but it is, after all, his job.  It is [i]not[/i] his job to send the hapless Debbie into Lee Marvin's way to get her face scarred.\r\n\r\nWhile Lagana gets his comeuppance in the end, as of course he would have to under the code--it was not permitted for crime to pay--it's not terribly clear that the mob control of the nameless city is over.  Lagana's removal would create a vacuum, and it's equally possible that a new boss would merely take over where Lagana had left it.  In short, Bannion's actions may not have really improved anyone's lot.  What would have worked better than the essential vigilantism of Bannion and his friends would have been uprooting the whole system.  But that's not generally as dramatic--that's why [i]The Untouchables[/i] is not about the bold and fearless work of the accountants who actually brought down Al Capone.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad movie, though there were several jumps in the film that rather catch the eye.  However, more so than even most other noir, this paints a [i]very[/i] bad picture of women.  Even the otherwise-saintly Katie is a \"sampler,\" who cannot, apparently, drink her own beer or smoke her own cigarette, but must sample her husband's.  Also, it always kind of bothers me when the kids are in bed before the parents have dinner--okay, Bannion and Katie have steak and potatoes.  What did Joyce eat?",

The standout is Gloria Grahame though. She's wowed me yet again in this movie(In a Lonely Place being the first). She brings this certain energy to the film that you don't even know it lacks until she pops up on screen. \n\nThere's a lot of underlying themes going on especially Ford's blatant recklessness and that and many other things is what makes this a classic that should be more famous than it is.",

As Bannion digs deeper into what he suspects is a murder, he becomes more driven to solve the mystery. He keeps digging even when the gangster violence and terror hits home. Complicating matters is Bertha Duncan, the corrupt wife of a dead police officer who has committed suicide. She is in possession of a letter, written by her husband, implicating the criminals, and Ford needs to get the letter so that he can blow the case wide open.[/color][/size][/font]\n[font=Times New Roman][size=4][/size][/font] \n[center][img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Bigheat.jpg[/img][/center]\n[font=Times New Roman][size=4][color=white][/color][/size][/font] \n[font=Times New Roman][size=4][color=white]It has been a good little while since I've seen this, so I'll try to do the best I can. The Big Heat is a successful noir, but a bit crowded at the same time. I consider myself to be a smart guy, but I still has trouble with the numerous plot devices, characters, and different directions. That was the biggest part that kept this from being great in my eyes. Once you sort through everything, there is a great film noir mystery film lurking. No one is safe; the main character will stop at nothing to solve the case. It has all the elements it needs to be successful. I would probably see this again, but if after a second viewing I still didn't think much of it, I would probably consider it just average. Noir fans should definitely see this, but be ready to pay close attention.[/color][/size][/font]",

It doesn't outstrip the Burton films in every respect (Burton's Gotham, for instance, is far more imaginative and appropriately fantastic), but it does improve in ways significant enough to make those films look wanting by comparison.\n \n The key to Nolan's approach is that his film is [i]about [/i]Batman.  [i]Batman [/i]treated Batman's personal development is a paint-by-numbers skeleton for the confrontations and visual excess in which Burton glories.  And while those were quite fun, Batman the character remained an essentially opaque, iconic figure.  Parents killed, justice (revenge) sought, alter ego created.  By the time we got to him, however, the mask was already in place and what came before was lost.  The character then proceeded to fade into the background of his own movies, the romance with Catwoman in [i]Batman Returns[/i] being essentially the only instance where the Batman character was treated even equally with the various villains and sidekicks.\n \n In this movie, Batman's character is the constant focus of the film; from the moment the film opens it begins putting us into his head.  Nolan's deft interplay of past tragedy with Bruce Wayne's raging, obsessive present establishes an emotionally resonant starting point for the character.  Rather than just check off the familiar touchstones of the origin story, Nolan imbues them with depth and power and it makes Batman a living, breathing person for essentially the first time in a live action setting.\n \n The rest of the movie is full to the brim with Batman goodness - countless nods to Batman lore (especially Frank Miller's [i]Year One[/i]), an orgasmic tour of Arkham Asylum (located in \"The Narrows,\" the one part of Nolan's Gotham that felt as inspired as Burton's city), and some inspired touches with the villainy.  My personal favorite Bat-villain, the Scarecrow, is on hand and respectably rendered and Tom Wilkinson has some great scenes as Carmine Falcone, but the real centerpiece is Ra's al Ghul - Batman's most dangerous enemy in the comics effectively re-imagined here to suit the purposes of Nolan's re-telling of Batman's origin.  It's an eclectic, interesting group but it never threatens to steal the thunder of the protagonist like previous franchise's Joker, Catwoman, Riddler, and Mr. Freeze all did to varying degrees.\n \n Despite everything that goes right, this isn't the perfect Batman movie by any means.  There are action movie one-liners left and right, many of them seemingly without rhyme or reason (watch out for \"didn't you get the memo?\"), which is especially jarring in a Batman movie.  Much of the important dialogue is quite unnatural, with some of the conversations between Bruce and Rachel Dawes springing to mind; Rachel often sounds like she was instructed by some omniscient observer to say the precise thing to accentuate irony or parallel Batman's character arc, including a sequence near the end where essentially explains word-for-word to the viewer the Batman aphorism that the mask is Wayne's true identity and \"Bruce Wayne\" a foppish alter ego.  True, but plainly obvious from Bruce's burning obsession early in the film and his out-of-character behavior as a socialite.  \n \n Perhaps even more egregious is the god-awful costume.  One of the absolute thrills of seeing a movie like this for fans of the source material is to see the beloved character brought to life.  With the Superman and Spider-Man films, the costume survives intact and the effect is breathtaking on first viewing.  Even with Burton's tweaked costume, the profile of the character remained true to the comic incarnation.  When I see [i]Batman [/i]leap out of the Batmobile in Batman Returns, it looks exactly like I'd expect such a thing to look.  This costume never accomplishes that.  The profile of the costume is utterly wrong in several respects: it is too wide and has an enormous hump on the back of the neck - it looks like no Batman I've ever seen on the printed page and that shatters the illusion that I'm watching Batman come-to-life.  That mask also seems to force Bale to hunch down and lean his head forward, which is not at all an imposing posture.  He doesn't look iconic, he looks uncomfortable.  It's tough to see a movie doing so much so right but doing something so essential so wrong.  It jars the illusion for me in a non-fatal but certainly noticeable way.  The costume designer should never work again.\n \n Those don't seem like minor quibbles to me (the costume doesn't, at least), but the movie does get the broad strokes right and does give us a flesh-and-blood Bruce Wayne whose motivations and emotions are palpably accessible.  On that alone, the movie is a tremendous success and a welcome excursion for the Batman junkie.  It certainly did enough right that the final conversation between Batman and Gordon, with a key prop, produced an undeniable faboy-gasm.  Now when they make the sequel I just hope they'll fix the fucking costume.\n \n [b]The Big Heat[/b] (Fritz Lang, 1953) [b]62[/b]\n This is a pretty straight-forward noirish film that I found rather conventional.  It's fiery and tough, but doesn't take many steps that you wouldn't expect, despite what initially seemed to be a few opportunities to subvert the typical Hollywood convention.  Glenn Ford's protagonist, a homicide detective named Bannion, becomes so disgusted with the venality of the thriving metropolis of Kenport that he burns every bridge he has and a few more just for kicks.  It's the kind of righteous indignation that feels appropriate on one level, but on further inspection is dangerously excessive, which is brought out in one conversation that ends up being almost inconsequential.  No man is an island, we're told, but that's only because not long after Bannion moves off shore, everyone goes to great lengths to build a causeway to him.  Over-extended analogies aside, in the end, this is just a very well made formula picture.\n \n [b]Howl's Moving Castle[/b] (Hayao Miyazaki, 2005) [b]54[/b]\n This is easily the least impressive Miyazaki outing I've seen thus far (I'm missing [i]Castle of Cogliostro[/i], [i]Porco Rosso[/i], and [i]Nausicaa[/i]).  The visual imagination is still on display - the castle is brilliant, the highly detailed different cities, and the various flying machines, for which I have long been a sucker ([i]Laputa [/i]is probably my favorite Miyazaki movie).  This one has precious little to offer beyond that, however.  The motivations of the characters are extremely under-developed and many of their actions are almost inexplicable.  Certain things happen for the sake of keeping an interesting design on screen or providing future conflict, rather than for reasons legitimately arising from the film.  The result is a set of characters, a plot, and a grand scale in which it is very difficult to invest.  I genuinely cared about so little of what was going on (the reasons for the war ares so far in the background that its resolution seems to take up far more screentime than is warranted, although it's only a few seconds) that it was difficult to invest in much of anything here emotionally.  [i]Laputa[/i], [i]Spirited Away[/i], and [i]Mononoke [/i]have just as much visual splendor with much more to care about, so [i]Moving Castle[/i] is eminently unessential.\n \n \n ...\n \n ...\n \n \n [i]Dot the I[/i] spoiler warning\n \n \n ...\n \n ...\n \n \n [b]Dot the I[/b] (Matthew Parkhill, 2005)\n [i]Dot the I[/i] wants to be a serious mindfuck of a \"gear shift\" movie (Mike D'Angelo's term for a film that takes a dramatic turn in subject, tone, and/or atmosphere a good bit of the way in - examples being [i]Audition [/i]and [i]Something Wild[/i]), but the shift is pretty retrospectively appropriate (which is a credit to the build, I suppose, but sort of defeats the discombobulatory purpose) and in my opinion, was rather tame to boot.  Whatever positives it did have, however, were completely flushed by some monologuing from the villain that is so mind-numbingly exaggerated and drawn out that it would have made Syndrome blush, and extended bit of irony in the denouement.",
