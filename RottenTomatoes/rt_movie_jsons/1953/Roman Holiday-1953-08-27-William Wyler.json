When a sedative she took from her doctor kicks in, however, she falls asleep on a park bench and is found by an American reporter, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck),who takes her back to his apartment for safety. At work the next morning, Joe finds out Ann's regal identity and bets his editor he can get exclusive interview with her, but romance soon gets in the way.",

Aubrey Hepburn is superb in her film debut, looking every bit the royal princess while charming throughout.  You genuinely feel she is tired of her duties is just wants a day off, which she enjoys to the upmost.  She is matched perfectly by Gregory Peck, a jaded reporter looking to crack a huge story but instead finds himself following for her.  Behind the camera, director William Wyler delivers a charming romantic comedy, showing off the gorgeous city of Rome along with some fun hijinks.  Best of all, he never lets the story get to cheesy, leading up to a thoroughly satisfying ending that Hollywood pictures today would avoid.  All in all, a true classic in the genre.",

As another steppingstone towards finalizing the genre's standards we minimally watch in the present, it beautifully stuns and wondrously delights with familiar antics that garners amusing chuckles along an elegantly solid script amid brilliantly captured scenery. Audrey Hepburn's other breakthrough charismatically and innocently shines as it initially defines through her acclaimed roles afterwards while her shared, humanly humble chemistry with Gregory Peck, who performed naturally with praiseworthy ease, finally realizes the realism in romance that most of today's romantic pursuits rather sugarcoat to satisfy the desperate as realistic acceptance finds a way in gems.

The film gives an abundance of scenery. In Roman Holiday a princess escapes an embassy in Rome and then ends up falling in love with a news reporter. \n\tThe writing in Roman Holiday enables the characters named Princess Ann and Joe Bradley to be very involved with each other. Joe Bradley and Princess Ann don't fall in love instantly or the moment they meet because then she's sedated. Later on, they act as if they've known each other for months or even years.  They kiss and hug so passionately that it's philosophical because it makes us wonder which is more passionate a kiss or a hug? It's heartbreaking when Joe drives Ann to her embassy and they say goodbye. It's almost or just as distressing as losing a loved one through death.\n\tAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck give lots of attraction between the central characters with their acting abilities. When Joe drives Ann towards her embassy towards the end of the film he looks as if he wonders if she's sure she wants to go back to her castle.  He acts as if she has a choice or possibly has a choice. Audrey Hepburn brings plenty of connection between Ann and Joe. When she sees him at the news conference, and they both look at each other with so much emotion that you could swear they both are looking into each other's eyes.   \n\tRoman Holiday shows a great deal of scenery.  This is absolutely appropriate since it's actually shot in Rome. It shows a love interest between the central characters particularly with them going to well-known places like the Colosseum and the Trevi fountain. \n\tRoman Holiday is very romantic with creating unity between two characters and shows pretty scenery.",

            "content": "A timeless romantic affair.\n\nWilliam Wyler's romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953) is a sweet, classy, and beautiful picture of enduring warmth, charm, and craft. Wyler takes you on a neat Roman getaway as this film is practically a travel brochure that makes you want to visit Rome for 2 hours. Wyler's direction feels well honed and refined with a clear focus on the personal relationship building naturally as they visit Rome and get to know one another, instead of the romance genre's cliche of love at first sight.\n\nDalton Trumbo's story is very cute about a bored princess, sick of her responsibilities as a royal, who escapes into the night for a quick vacation throughout Rome. Trumbo's focus on deception, duties, and romance make for a grounded relationship. He juxtaposes a princess on tour across Europe with an American newspaperman stationed in Rome as mutually bored with life, longing for romance, and stumbling into genuine forbidden love. Trumbo's writing is deft and realistic with a zest for just relaxing and enjoying life for what it is no matter where you're supposed to be in that moment. Roman Holiday is as charming as romance comedy has ever been.\n\nRobert Swink keeps Roman Holiday moving at a steady pace, so you can relax and enjoy the ambiance of Rome alongside the heroes for 2 blissful hours. Henri Alekan and Franz Planer's cinematography is stunning with lovely wide shots all around Rome and intimate close-ups that capture a fleeting feeling or deep love alike. Georges Auric's score is dreamy and romantic, which helps the Roman backdrop feel all the more serene.\n\nI must mention Edith Head's adorable costumes for Audrey Hepburn. Head makes Hepburn look fashionable, comfortable, natural, and cool in every single scene. Her style choices are remarkably modern for an older picture. Wally Westmore and Alberto De Rossi's make-up is very cute and effortless for the adorable Audrey Hepburn. Her short pixie cut is refreshingly contemporary and brings out her pretty face. Hepburn herself is simply a darling of charismatic charm, flawless beauty, playful humor, forlorn dramatic longing, and timeless grace.\n\nGregory Peck is excellent as the funny man out for himself, who learns to love a curious lady with all the dreamy personality of a princess. His chemistry with Audrey Hepburn feels authentic because of Peck's grounded sternness. He never comes across like he's trying to fall in love, which makes his amorous fall all the sweeter to watch.\n\nIn all, Roman Holiday is one of those enduring classics of romantic comedy and sincere sympathy for its hero and heroine. Audrey Hepburn alone is worth watching Roman Holiday for honestly.",

The film merely assumes its viewers will share in the adoration.\n\nThen we have Gregory Peck's reporter. He is merely manipulating her for a story and a whopping fee and to suggest that he falls in love with her over a few hours is both narratively implausible and, by the evidence on film, non-existent. The climactic kiss appears more an impulsive and exploitative gesture, not motivated by love or even passing desire.\n\nGiven the huge publicity around this princess, is it reasonable to suggest she could wander the crowded Roman streets filled with tourists, including I presume many from her (unstated) Anglophone home nation without a single person recognising her? \n\nA great disappointment, considering the plaudits this film and its two leads received.",

Unfortunately the presence of the always annoying Audrey Hepburn spoiled the film and a lack of chemistry between herself and Gregory Peck, who I expect so much more from, sinks a film that has a decent premise from the outset. I simply cannot believe that Hepburn would be rewarded for her work in this film as she is sickening in how poorly she acts and her competition included Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Ava Gardner in Mogambo (1953). If you want a great romantic comedy from the early 1950s watch The Quiet Man (1952) or Singin' in the Rain (1952) both of which far exceed this overrated film in wit and charm.\n\nPrincess Ann, Audrey Hepburn, is bored with her lifestyle of being ferried around to various exotic locations and being forced into attending events she does not want to attend and having to follow certain etiquette. She finds freedom when she meets reporter Joe Bradley, Gregory Peck, after taking some sleeping pills and falling asleep on a park bench where he finds her and takes her back to his apartment. He decides to use her in order to have a decent story to publish in the newspaper he works as a journalist for but the two predictably fall in love as they spend more time together. The two end up apart however as she is still bound to her responsibilities while he decides not to publish the story and sadly leaves her.\n\nA good romantic comedy needs a likable female lead, think Claudette Colbert, Meg Ryan or Barbara Stanwyck, unfortunately Hepburn is not that. Her performance features her indulging in some of her worst habits as an actress as she fails to convince me that she is tired within the opening scenes, attracted to Peck during the mid section of the film and finally melancholy in the closing scenes which were presumably why the Academy felt safe in awarding her the Best Actress trophy. The other element that a good romantic comedy needs is chemistry between it's leads and despite Peck being a fantastic actor, as shown in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), he and Hepburn are flat as they spend time together. The dynamic between them seems off as we are meant to see him become less uptight through his romance with her while she experiences real freedom and love for the first time but I wasn't wrapped up in the excitement when they ride a Vespa through the city. Failing on both counts makes this film a poor representation of a wonderful genre and I am sad that this film gets more recognition than classics like The Lady Eve (1941) and A New Leaf (1971).\n\nThe big romantic set pieces in the film, the Vespa ride, the dance on the boat, the big kiss etc. lacked the sweetness or the sexiness of the best scenes in films like It Happened One Night (1934). I wasn't caught up in the childlike excitement of Hepburn as she carelessly zips about on her Vespa and the kiss landed with a dull thud instead of being the dramatic climax it would have been in a better film. The screenwriters seemed to run out of ideas as they moved beyond the basic premise as the fish out of water gags that the Princess receives are not particularly funny and there was no flirty banter between the two leads to occupy the first act of the film. A better screenplay would have used the same basic structure but included more interesting characters, stronger conflicts for both of the main characters and better execution of the big moments.\n\nI am shocked that this film came out in the same year as a classic of the romantic drama genre From Here to Eternity (1953) which features a better screenplay, performances and location. This is one of the lesser films nominated for Best Picture in 1953 along with The Robe (1953) and Julius Caesar (1953) while Shane (1953) and the aforementioned winner are absolutely fantastic films that earn their status as some of the best films of 1953.",

The comedy may not be up to the standards of those more contemporary rom-coms which owe their existence to this one, but the romance and passion and chemistry feel like they haven't aged a day, as eternal and impossibly phantasmic as the Eternal City of Rome itself, the city of perpetual desire, where nothing lasts forever except its self-perpetuation.",

            "content": "Watched Feb 26, 2018\n\nMatt Kerr's review published on Letterboxd :\nThis review may contain spoilers.\n\nThis is the second film I have seen in the last week where Audrey Hepburn gains confidence after getting her hair cut short in Europe, upon which she is manipulated by an older man who lies to her for their own financial benefit, only for the two of them to realise they have fallen in love and these fiscal plans to be abandoned. However, where Sabrina (1954) gets caught up in massive plot contrivances, irrational decisions and suffers from not writing its characters relateable enough, Roman Holiday (1953) [god were these two extremely similar films really released a year within each other?!] is able to mostly avoid lots of these problems. Instead of actively going into the situation with distructive intent, like the formers Linus Larabee (Humphrey Bogart), Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) falls into this situation, and acts impulsively on what he sees as an opportunistic offering, making him already more understandable, *spoiler* his decision to give up his plans in the end more admirable.\n\nI am of the opinion that it may be impossible to shoot a film badly in Rome (The Great Beauty is a personal favorite). Roman Holiday stands the test of time for a few reasons. One is its nostalgic tinge of Rome in the 1950s, a city that is ever changing yet hypocritically has also remained the same for a millennia. Another is its compelling casting, Peck and Hepburn both in their prime (sorry to fire more shots at Sabrina, but not something that could be said for Bogart at the time (sorry not sorry)). Finally, and most importantly, it manages to be pretty damn funny at times, although a lot of this is more likely to draw a sentimental smile rather than booming laughter. A compelling piece of Golden-age romantic comedy.",

It's a fun little flick, often looking like a travelogue of Rome, but they could hardly have picked a more perfect city to film in. The scenery and architecture are gorgeous, and they take advantage of all the areas they film in. The Vespa ride is a classic scene, as is the Liar's Mouth statue scene. Gregory Peck takes his first proper crack at comedy, and while he's often completely outmatched by his co-star, he still turns in a likable performance. The truth is, while it has its faults, Hepburn is the real reason we remember this film. She illuminates every shot with her eyes and lights up every moment with her smile. She's a joy to watch and makes the role completely her own. Hard to believe she almost received considerably lower billing.

Gregory Peck, less wooden than usual, is the American reporter who stumbles upon her when she makes a late-night break for freedom from her minders.  The next day, the two (along with photographer Eddie Albert) spend the day visiting Roman tourist destinations (shot on location) in a carefree way but comically underscored by the efforts of the journalists to conceal their identities and true purpose (to get a scoop for their paper).  Of course, Peck and Hepburn fall in love - but, after all is said and done, she is a princess and must return to her duties.  Or must she? Dalton Trumbo came up with the story (while blacklisted as part of the Hollywood 10) and received his Oscar posthumously in the 1990s.  Breezy and special, due primarily to Hepburn's charisma but Wyler also knew a thing or two about directing and hits the right emotional notes, expertly playing the audience.

It all makes for a very romantic film.   Hepburn played her part perfectly, expressing frustration and joy with such economy, as well as the restraint that comes from being a royal.  Among several others, the scene with her getting her hair cut short is captivating, and it's no wonder that she won an Oscar for her performance.    Peck's performance is also excellent, and Eddie Albert pulls off the part of a young rogue quite well despite being 47 at the time.   I won't spoil the ending, except to say it's touching and poignant, and so perfectly shot in the Palazzo Colonna.   At the end of the day this is 'just a romantic comedy', with its share of silliness, but it's so mature and magical, and with these stars in this setting, it stands head and shoulders above so many others.",

He was on the verge of getting fired for he sleeping in and missed an interview with HRH Princess Ann. Princess Ann runs away from her life and rescued from danger by handsome reporter. Comparing to the current a lot of rated R romantic movies, Roman Holiday did a really good job. First of all, director used all beautiful scenes to tell a charming love story instead of using sexual scenes, this makes Roman Holiday becomes the movie that whole family can enjoy together. Second, this movie taught audiences that love are no races, classes, and boundary. \nThe Mouth of Truth was considered the funniest scene of the whole movie. Joe Bradley puts his hand into the sculpture's mouth at The Mouth of Truth. According to legend, the sculpture would nip off the hand of liars who are put hands in its mouth.

Even if there was a whole different between them, the different class, different nationalities, we could even say they lived in two whole different society. But the pure love between them let them over came all the differences and has made Roman Holiday became the most remarkable movie for generations.   \n There is no doubt Roman Holiday is classical, sweet and charming romantic comedy.

Wie im M√§rchen verliebt die Prinzessin sich in einen normal Sterblichen und wer k√∂nnte den besser verk√∂rpern als Gregory Peck? Hepburn spielt Anne, die Prinzessin und tats√§chlich hatte die geb√ºrtige Belgierin auch blaues Blut.

Wir m√ºssen uns dazu in das Jahr 1953 zur√ºckfallen lassen, um zu begreifen, wie ungew√∂hnlich die Wahl dieses d√ºrren M√§dchens in der Zeit der platinblonden Sexbomben war! Das Drehbuch stammt von Dalton Trumbo, was 40 Jahre lang verschwiegen wurde, da er auf der Schwarzen Liste stand. William Wyler begann als \"ernsthafter\" Regisseur sozialer Stoffe, um sich schliesslich popul√§ren Hollywood Filmen zuzuwenden. Roman Holiday ist ein Hollywood M√§rchen in reinster Auspr√§gung. Wer sich bei uns die DVD ausleiht und die Bonus Materialien ansieht, bemerkt, wie Wyler geschickt seinen neuen Star aufbaute. Es gibt Szenen, in der er sie einfach √ºberrascht - Hepburn spielt darin nicht! Die Entscheidung, an Originalschaupl√§tzen zu drehen, ist einer der Gr√ºnde, weshalb Roman Holiday viel mehr ist als nur eine weitere romantische Kom√∂die. Peck und Hepburn verbringen einen ganzen Tag gemeinsam vor dieser √ºberirdischen \"Kulisse\". Der gr√∂sste Schauwert des Films aber ist (und wom√∂glich konnte es nur Rom mit ihr aufnehmen): Audrey Hepburn, die einmal als Hollywoods letzter Stummfilmstar bezeichnet wurde. Ihre Augen sprachen f√ºr sie, Worte waren da unn√∂tig! 20 Jahre lang sollte Hepburn ein Superstar bleiben und mehr als das: Sie war ein Role-Model. Teenager versuchten sich den Hepburn Pony zu stufen und sp√§ter ihre hochtoupierten Haare der fr√ºhen 60er. Was zuerst an Hepburn auff√§llt, ist ihre k√∂rperliche Pr√§senz. Ihr eleganter, unglaublich k√∂niglicher Nacken, ihre grossen Augen und die Lippen, die nur darauf warten, wieder lachen zu d√ºrfen. Hepburn war aber so viel mehr als bloss eine Sch√∂nheit. Sie war vor allem eine grosse Schauspielerin, spielte in ganz verschiedenen Genres, ganz unterschiedliche Charaktere. Ob sie eine Nonne verk√∂rperte oder eine nicht mehr ganz junge Ehefrau; sie hatte es, dieses Leuchten und das ganz unabh√§ngig von ihrem Alter. Es kam von innen.

The plot is always the same, it is about a famous person running away and meeting someone who lies about their identity to get something from the celebrity. Naturally they fall in love. This movie handled it in a very sweet fashion with rather innocent adventures that I couldn't imagine being all that embarrassing for her. That is the one thing that I had difficulty with when watching Roman Holiday. With the exception of a few details, which could have been left out, it felt like they could have written an article that wasn't even remotely salacious. In the end, I was genuinely worried about Gregory Peck's financial well-being because of how things are left. That little quibble aside, I found the ending simply magical. It was so different from any of my expectations that I had a huge smile on my face throughout that sequence. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn were excellent and showed why they are legends in the business. Eddie Albert offered good comic relief moments, and his interactions with Peck genuinely felt like 2 friends who totally understand one another. There were definitely slow moments in the story that I wish it had moved through more smoothly, but the overall experience of watching Roman Holiday was nice. It's a charming film that I would recommend to others.",

And he's a reporter who is just after the 5 grand his boss promised him which was a small fortune those days. And, you expect me to believe virtually no one recognizes her as she travels around Rome despite being on the front page of the newspaper? And, I found the brawl discomforting; the film would have been better off without it. And, you expect me to believe that after physically brawling with half a dozen men, he has no injuries, no cuts, no bruises, no black eye?? But, ultimately the allure of Audrey, and the chemistry between them overrides all this. And the ending is FANTASTIC. It's in the subtle way he lets her know he won't scandalize her by publishing what he knows. And when Eddie Albert terrifies her by showing her his camera, he quickly makes up for it by handing over the photos. And the greatest part of all, that haunting unforgettable last look she gives to Gregory Peck, full of pain, anguish, but overridden by gratitude and love. Yes, all that in just one unforgettable look.",

            "content": "4/4 stars. This is a fun, feel-good romantic comedy. It took the formula from \"It Happened One Night\" and cemented it into nearly every romantic comedy that followed. \n\nIf nothing else, this film is worth seeing because it is Hepburn's first major role. She is magnificent, and even won an Oscar for her performance. Gregory Peck is impeccable (ba-doom-crash) as well. William Wyler is an incredible director, and the most amazing thing about him to me is his incredible range (if you told me that this was the same guy who directed Ben-Hur and The Collector, I would have called BS). He does a great job here, making sure the actors are top-notch, as well as taking full advantage of shooting on location in Rome. The film as a result is always involving and pretty to the eyes. The plot is standard romantic comedy, with a few twists (especially the ending), and a few moments of real suspense. Luckily, things are kept lighthearted with some subtle humor. However, there are a few plot holes (i.e. ((spoiler alert)) Why did they just instantly fall in love? Why does he refuse to publish the story?). Character development isn't lengthy, but it doesn't really have to be. \n\nUltimately, the aforementioned flaws are just scratches on the surface of a great movie. The look is beautiful, the acting is great, the humor is very subtle and/or slapstick, but also funny. Modern day romantic comedies (i.e. impersonators) could learn a lot from this film. While modern day romantic comedies rely on explicit sex jokes to entertain, this one simply relies on a few slapstick gags and a feel-good vibe, and because of that is also about five times better than it's modern day impersonators.",

Although I believe that her performances in \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Wait Until Dark,\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" were more deserving of an Oscar, this is still one of her greatest films.  I cringed when she had her hair cut, and somehow she became even cuter.  This is why Audrey is one of my favorites.  As endearing as Hepburn's character is, she requires a boisterous man to provoke her and Gregory Peck is the perfect man for the job.  The setting is wonderful but it is the dialogue and the characters that really make this into something special.  Its perfect blend of comedy, romanticism, and curiosity as to which resolution the story will take makes for an emotional first time watch and a heartwarming second, third, and fifteenth watch.  Simply put, it is one of the greatest chick flicks of all time.  My favorite moment is when Peck puts his hand into the \"Mouth of Truth,\" not warning his co-star ahead of time of his planned visual gag and eliciting a 100% genuine scream from her.  Even better is the chemistry in the 10 seconds that follow that moment, as they laugh about it like two best friends - true love.  The plot is clever and sneaky, Hepburn is cute as a button, and the ending is incredible (although I have never pleaded so hard with the tv not to say \"The End\"...) - \"Roman Holiday\" is a perfect portrait of love.",

The two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are magical together.  It is one of those films that I never get tired of watching, especially since it introduced the world the lovely Audrey Hepburn to the world.\r\n\r\nHepburn plays Princess Anne who is in Rome on a diplimatic trip.  She decides to shake off her guards and see the city incognito.  She meets Joe Bradley (Peck), an american journalist covering a story.  Bradley recognizes Anne and sees a great story coming.  He offers to give her a tour of the city.  He, however, finds himself falling for her.\r\n\r\nWhen they were filmming the film Peck said that Audrey is so good that she will win an Oscar for her film debut.  He was right.  She was awarded the Best Actress trophy for her performance.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/RomanHoliday_zps3c9a6a7e.jpg[/IMG]",

And, again, another thing I feel I say all the time, but watching \"Roman Holiday\" reminded me that there's still yet room for movies like it in Hollywood. As in, even today. The last movie to really get this formula (I hate that word) right was \"Silver Linings Playbook\", a shamelessly traditional throwback to screwball movieland, that was also not afraid to touch on larger and more important themes than a happy ending (even if \"SLP\" ultimately and unfortunately feeds one to you anyway.) Both films land a big smile on your face without delving to sap, and those kind of rom-coms shouldn't be stoned for it. Life's enough of a bitch already. And as for \"Roman Holiday\", yeah, I kind of loved it.",

Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him.

Hepburn won Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in the film; movie also won two more in the categories of the screenplay and costume design. \r\n\r\nPrincess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) represents an unnamed European country. She is on a continental tour, and this is her latest in Rome. She's fed up with messy schedule and planned life. One night she slips out of the palace and into the city. She poses as a drunk, homeless girl. Finally spotted by reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) he brings her back to his apartment so she can sleep it off after seeing her in pitiful sleepy condition. Very next morning, he discovers the identity of his mysterious guest and fun starts.\r\n\r\nThis is most certainly unique story, and I must state here that having watched this movie I was so excited that I jumped in the air. Audrey Hepburn looks sweetheart and kissable every time her delicious persona appeared on screen. What a mesmerizing character she made out of it, changing the core and fundamental understanding of bubbly character. One thing I did come to accept, is that Audrey was truly a cheerful actress that lived in her times. Gregory Peck put humorous fun to his character, so much that I started questioning myself, is that Peck who I often envisioned to be rather dramatic and expressionist. \r\n\r\nWilliam Wyler's direction is superb; I cannot stop thinking how much fun and amusements the cast and crew might have had during the filming. Somewhere I read that this film bears extraordinary magnetism to pull audience (even) from modern era more forcibly than most of other b&w movies. A worth watching whimsical film.",

            "content": "When Roman Holiday was in the planning stages William Wyler envisioned either Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons in the role of the princess. When neither proved available, he and Paramount studios decided to do a Scarlett O'Hara type search for an unknown for the part. The film then would only have Gregory Peck as the star to draw the people in.\n\nBut when Peck saw the screen test and also realized the film would rise and fall on the performance of the princess part, he insisted on top billing for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey had only done a few small bit parts in some English films up till then, however Peck insisted on the billing of her right after him with 'introducing Audrey Hepburn' as her title credit. \n\nIn the same way that William Holden credited Barbara Stanwyck with helping him get through Golden Boy, Audrey Hepburn credited Gregory Peck with her performance in Roman Holiday. As well as William Wyler who still has a record of more people getting to the Oscar sweepstakes for his films than any other director.\n\nRoman Holiday is simple and delightful film about a young princess of some unnamed European country who gets tired of her programmed routine and wants a break from it. In Rome while on a European tour, princess Audrey fakes an illness and runs off for a day of fun.\n\nAn American wire service reporter Gregory Peck finds her and realizes he's got an exclusive. So he chaperones her around without letting her know she's on to him. He even gets photographer Eddie Albert to help him out.\n\nEddie Albert got the first of two nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Roman Holiday, the second one being The Goodbye Girl. He lost to Frank Sinatra for From Here to Eternity. Though Albert is funny in this film, for dramatic work I never understood why he was not nominated for Attack or for Captain Newman, MD.\n\nIf you're thinking that the film is starting to bear a resemblance to a continental It Happened One Night you would be right. And if that's your thinking it will come as no surprise to learn that Frank Capra originally had the idea to film this. The property reverted to Paramount as part of his settlement to leave that studio after doing two Bing Crosby films.\n\nI wish Paramount had done Roman Holiday in color though. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century did Three Coins in the Fountain in gorgeous color and later on MGM did The Seven Hills of Rome also in color. Still the Roman locations really add a lot to Audrey's adventure.\n\nWhen Oscar time Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and really first role of any consequence won an Oscar for Best Actress. Until the day she died Audrey Hepburn had charm enough for ten, you can't help but love her in anything she ever did. Even if the film she did was not that great, Audrey sparkles through.\n\nEven in black and white, the Eternal City with Audrey and Greg make anyone young at heart.",

My complaints with Roman Holiday have little to do with Hepburn, rather more so with the directing and her costar. Now I love Gregory Peck as much as the next guy, but he feels miscast and I never entirely bought his character's arc, especially the romance stuff. They have a decent enough chemistry, but I wouldn't describe it as from the classic mold. The directing I also feel lacks energy and is much too leisurely for a romantic comedy, even for one depicting a \"holiday\" in Rome. It's no surprise the guy who directed the borefest Ben Hur was behind this as well. The plot is as by the books as these things go, but it throws a slight wrinkle in towards the end and the bittersweet ending is a strong touch. Roman Holiday is a perfectly likeable and charming film, albeit one I feel is a bit overrated and one Hepburn would surpass a year later with the more well-rounded Sabrina.",

What eventually makes Roman Holiday a lovable romantic comedy is that it doesn't do away with just comedy - it adds tension and even a sense of sadness to the storyline. It's unique in its own right - and quite poignant as well. The ending is slightly bittersweet in my view, but that's also one of the beauties in this wonderful classic. Comedy is also plenty in it - the fight by the Tiber river being a high point.\n\nNeedless to say, all this could not have happened without the presence of Hepburn. She has a sense of simplicity that we perceive in her movements and words - she never spices her words with sophistication or royalty. And Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley is awesome too, as is his sidekick Eddie Albert. Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy with a touch of bitterness and pessimism towards the end: a much loved film that should never be forgotten and taken for granted. It is a Cinderella story turned upside down - a contortion that ultimately becomes even more delightful than that original fairy tale itself. It is also one of the most breathtakingly beautiful films I've ever encountered thus far.",

Roman Holiday is not only the Oscar winning debut of Audrey, but it sets a new high in the romantic comedy genre.\r\n\r\nStaring my 2 favourite classic actors, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, roman holiday debuts Ms. Hepburn as Princess Anne who is traveling all across Europe. And she hates every minute of it. Though administered a drug to sleep, Anne escapes her guarded palace and goes out into the city of Rome. Peck stars as a reporter for the American newspaper who finds Anne, drugged and passed out. Not knowing she is the princess her takes her into his apartment to sleep, but when he finds out her true identity he also finds a story of a lifetime. The 2 play a game of wits, both of them spending the next day together but not revealing who they really are. Even with the kind of cliches that have developed since this movie, Roman Holiday doesn't loose its romantic charm for an instance. This tale of deceit turns into a very romantic forbidden love tale to die for. And no one better could have been in to than Hepburn and Peck. Roman Holiday is incredibly romantic, very funny, and the last 10 minutes of the movie will leave you breathless.\r\n\r\nThe great William Wyler directs this movie wonderfully. He chose to direct this movie under the condition that they use absolutely NO BACKDROPS. Roman Holiday is entirely filmed in Rome. We see plenty of wonderful sights Rome has to offer. We're taken down various streets, we see wonderful architecture, and we even go into the Coliseum. We get a great view of the wonderful city, and it works wonderfully, making the movie even more romantic. The directing of scenes is just wonderful too, making a lot of moments very memorable, hilarious, and the hard to pull of romance that seems to appear naturally in the performances of Hepburn and Peck. But the best executed scene has to be \"The Mouth of Truth\" scene. You have to watch it. It's brilliant. The cinematography captures as much of the beauty of Rome as it does out of Audrey Hepburn. The camera angles and lighting for scenes are appropriate and fantastic, especially the ending. (seriously. I love the ending) And lets not forget the costumes of Audrey that make her look like a real princess. Very fashionable.\r\n\r\nOne of the best romance movies of all time, and it can be enjoyed by all. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck make a heartwarming pair on screen, and the way this movie was made just makes the entire movie brilliant. You don't have to be an Audrey Hepburn fan or a rom-com fan to enjoy this one. Roman Holiday is the perfect movie to cheer you up at any day.",

He wants to get an interview with her, and hides the fact he's a reporter, and Joe asks his photographer friend, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), to tag along and take photos while he and Ann enjoy the sights of Rome. But, Ann seems to enjoy her freedom just a little too much, and it isn't before long when officials are out looking all over Rome for her. It's a very well made film, very lavish and rich in local flavour. This was Hepburn's first big film, and she makes quite an impression, while Peck makes a smooth, charismatic lead male to rival Cary Grant. Nearly 60 years on, it still hasn't aged.",

            "content": "One of a kind! Princess Ann (Hepburn) is sick of the royal lifestyle, and suddenly decides to have a 24-hour break in the city. Once there, reporter Joe (Peck) finds her dazed and confused, and he helps her out. He and his friend Irving (Albert) then give Ann a day in the life. Coincidentally, Joe and Ann fall in love, which leaves you asking, will she choose her kingdom or romance? \"Roman Holiday\" is not just another chick flick like so many people are seeming to say here (it's most likely because Audrey Hepburn stars). This is an exceptional film that truly stands out from all of the other movies coming from the '50's. This isnt just another romantic comedy. It's stylish, witty, and in Rome, which is one of a kind considering how many rom-coms Paramount put out through the decade. This really captures the essence of the perfect movie. Audrey Hepburn does a superb job in her first role, doing things that most actresses usually don't do until years of experience. That Oscar win was correct for once, and somehow came to be her only win ever. Greg Peck is surprisingly excellent as well-- I was expecting him to not be too great considering he wasn't even nominated. What's wrong with the Academy? He really is almost equivalent to Hep on acting ability in this one, and I think though now it is realized that its one of his best roles, but then, he was just another leading man. The coincidence was, it seems like this film was what propelled Hep and Peck to stardom. This could possibly be in the top five list of William Wyler's best films. Though he was very experienced, you can see his genius shining through in every moment, especially in the ending when we finally see someone pick reality over happy ending. Bravo to him! \"Roman Holiday\" is a standout motion picture, and any fan of movies should have this on their must-watch list.",
