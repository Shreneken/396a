    "summary": "At an Army barracks in Hawaii in the days preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor, lone-wolf soldier and boxing champion \"Prew\" Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) refuses to box, preferring to play the bugle instead. Hard-hearted Capt. Holmes (Philip Ober) subjects Prew to a grueling series of punishments while, unknown to Holmes, the gruff but fair Sgt. Warden (Burt Lancaster) engages in a clandestine affair with the captain's mistreated wife (Deborah Kerr).",

There's some quite witty dialogue ('if you carry on drinking, you'll be as much use as a melted candle' etc.) and I found it to be an enjoyable watch for the most part. I suppose the plot partly reminded me of the recent drama series 'Catch-20'.\n\nI don't tend to be especially keen on some black and white older films but this one was enjoyable with the banter sort of aspect, the various male characters trying to out-do one another, the one-upmanship aspect and so on.  Speaking of that, I was almost surprised by how open the male characters are, when talking to the females.  I also liked that the female characters were quite good at standing up for themselves too, as necessary at different times. I suppose its perhaps a little sentimental but not entirely in a bad way. Oh and the bugle playing is pretty impressive!.\n\nI can certainly see why this is regarded as a classic film, with quite solid performances - its a fairly solid watch which I'd recommend.",

            "content": "It was on TCM's playlist and it's one of those iconic American films which I hadn't seen before. I can see why audiences went for this the year I was born - it pushed a lot of hot buttons in the immediate post-war era.   It's a pot boiler but limited by the Hollywood production code still in effect.  The crashing surf serving as a proxy for the passion between Lancaster and Kerr is a nice period touch.  It's hard to separate the performances of the various cast members from their roles and the shooting script. Do we think Burt was especially good in this, or did he get the most sympathetic part? As for Clift, I've given up trying to figure out why critics and film historians think he's so noteworthy; I saw him doing the same portrayal in this as he did in Hitchcock's \"I Confess.\"  A lot of the movie revolves around his character but I couldn't see his motivation for undergoing \"the treatment\" at all.  Another \"production code\" flaw is Donna Reed's involvement with him.  I would guess this was developed a lot more in a 900 page book than it was here, but why she did a One Eighty on her life plan for a buck private showing little out of the ordinary escaped me.  Women of any kind were a scarce commodity anywhere near a US military base in Hawaii at that time;  the lines outside Honolulu's brothels on Hotel Street stretched around the block on paydays and the \"New Congress Club\" is a laughably sanitized version of what soldiers and sailors went downtown for.  In accordance with movie-making of the time,  Ernest Borgnine's character gets what's coming to him and December 7th provides a convenient wrapup for the multiple plot threads.  Overall an acceptable watch but not All That and a Bag of Chips.",

Was my 1st time viewing ever and I tried hard to think like they did back in 1953 but that still did not work.  Just too much love interest, flirting and \"kissy kissy\" even for 1953.  The last 20 mins was long awaited for as Pearl Harbor was attacked and there was some half decent fight action finally but it was short lived and came too late in the movie.  Talk about build up to the max and then just to see one of the main actors just die so easily before the end credits.  I felt this was quite weak even for 1953 and the audience back then.  If you have not yet seen Eternity like me today for whatever reason...try Tora Tora Tora, Bridge on the River Kwai and Midway rather instead.  \nThe acting performances were good overall in Eternity by Lancaster and Sinatra and Borgnine, etc, but it just lacked action and flare and just way too much build up.  I had to pause and take a 20 min. cat nap half way through.\n2.5 stars of 5!",

Zinnemann's direction is striking with his realistic depiction of military hazing, but the romance drama stuff is really scarce here. For everyone talking about the amazing beach scene, which is like a minute long lovely romantic feeling, then turns into an argument, From Here to Eternity is pretty focused on how awful military life is at its heart. Zinnemann tried to do too much as you will go from a cute date, to a man getting beat up, then Pearl Harbor is getting bombed. It's really jarring and not emotionally gripping like it should be, honestly. From Here to Eternity has some good acting, but the script has not aged well.\n\nMontgomery Clift is awesome in From Here to Eternity as a tough new recruit, who gets hazed. His nuanced acting alongside Donna Reed feels real and genuine in every moment they are on screen. Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr are nice together, but awkwardly stilted with the strangely dated script. Everything romantic feels accusatory.\n\nFrank Sinatra is terrible. He's not funny as the playful sidekick who stands by Montgomery Clift. He doesn't make you laugh or smile as he's just an angry drunk. Ernest Borgnine is scary as the cruel stockade warden and a horrible racist in From Here to Eternity. It's hard to care about Sinatra's character arc when he is so unlikable. His acting is embarrassing and never feels authentic, especially compared Burt Lancaster or Montgomery Clift.\n\nIn all, you could watch it for some nice romantic scenes, but From Here to Eternity is more concerned about social commentary about military protocol.",

I don't think I am spoiling anything by stating that the source material did not look fondly on military hierarchy, and while apparently nowhere near as obscene, the film still manages to convey the same overall theme with multiple characters involved in concurrently running plot lines. The acting was solid all around and although most will immediately picture Lancaster and Kerr on the beach, a scene that apparently took three days to film, I found the performance of Clift and, surprisingly, Sinatra able to create the most feeling. At first I thought Sinatra's character was going to be reduced to a goofy stereotype but, in a role he was only paid $8,000 and had to beg for, 'Ol Blue Eyes may have brought more emotion to this picture than anyone else.",

Warden (Burt Lancaster) and Pvt. Maggio (Frank Sinatra), are settled in Hawaii on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attacks. Prewitt gets bullied for refusing to participate in a boxing tournament, Warden has a secret romance with the captain's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr), and Maggio gets imprisoned for his temperaments and brawls. While it does have iconic scenes, the bar fight, the kissing on the beach, and throwing a lei in the ocean, From Here to Eternity has problems. First, I never believed in Lancaster and Kerr's romance because not only does nothing go in jeopardy, but we also hardly see them together half the time. Second, I resented Lorene's (Donna Reed) confused motivations because at one point she wants to live in a \"proper\" lifestyle, but she gets engaged to Prewitt near the end anyway. However, I enjoyed most of the performances, particularly Sinatra's. Whenever he's on screen, he always steals the movie, with his New York/Italian mannerisms, cool suaveness and violent temperaments. Beyond that, From Here to Eternity was just okay and did not live up to the ‘classic romantic war movie' hype TCM was venerating. If you consider it a favorite, that's okay, but it just wasn't one for me. \n\n(3 Bugle Mouth Pieces out of 5)",

            "content": "This movie is a romance film, set against the backdrop of an Hawaiian military base in the weeks leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nAt its core, the story follows servicemen Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster), new arrival Private Pruett (Montgomery Clift), and the base's all around nice guy Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra). Watching this movie through a lens of the 1950's one can easily see why it was given so many accolades. The movie pulls the band-aid off of the sanitized and manufactured Ozzie and Harriett way of portraying American life and the American military. Warden has an affair with his commanding officer's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr); Pruett and Maggio often visit the Congress Gentleman's Club, a house of ill repute; Maggio is subjected to ethnic discrimination; Pruett is indefensibly bullied by commanding officers; and there is an immense amount of time that all three men are overly inebriated.\n\nThe affair portrayed by Lancaster and Kerr was often uneven and awkward. While they have some chemistry together, they are almost always portrayed going from an intensity of zero to one hundred in mere seconds. Their relationship seemed incredibly rushed and forced. I was much more drawn in by Pruitt's falling in love and eventual relationship with the Gentleman's Club \"hostess\" (prostitute) Lorene . Donna Reed excels as she inhabits the role of Lorene, a character completely contrary to the type of all-American women which Reed is most associated. In a wonderful bit of editing, the first beach hookup between Warden and Karen is juxtaposed with the first gentlemen's club hookup between Pruett and Lorene. As the music crescendos and the waves crash over the first couple, cut to couple number two as Pruett enjoys a cigarette while Lorene is seen putting her earrings back on. By today's standards it is incredibly chaste, but the sentiment of what was taking place is fully conveyed.\n\nThe two relationships are based entirely on immediate need and as soon as circumstances change and introspection begins, the relationships begin to crumble. Happiness and fairness are not guaranteed to anyone. This movie lays bare the efforts that people will still go to in order to at least try and obtain those outcomes, messy and complicated as it may be to do so. The character of Lorene tells Pruitt that she couldn't commit to a serviceman because she was going to have a proper husband with a proper job, and live a proper life. She holds to the much manufactured image of things that the movie itself works to unveil. As she heads back to the mainland at the movie's finale, one hopes that she might obtain her dream yet one can't help but to admit it's doubtful she ever did.\n\nI'm not sure this film holds up as well as some other older films I've recently seen, but I'm convinced it was certainly worthy of the Best Picture Oscar it received, along with 7 other Oscar wins including Best Director (Fred Zinnermann) Best Supporting Actress (Reed) and Best Supporting Actor (Sinatra).",

The attach by the Japanese is well stage, it's exciting, intense and dramatic. The events start as the army are none the wise and unprepared. The famous beach scene is very striking and sexy. The waves crashing suggesting so much more not just in the relationship but in what's yet to come. The tales and tribulations of the army as they drink their weekends away shows how they let their hair down. They are preparing themselves but are not expecting what is yet to come.

It’s not that I was confused, or didn’t follow any of the stories, because I thought they were all told well. In fact, I think most of this stuff comes together at the end to make a good cohesive film. However, when we’re bouncing around getting snippets of each character’s story, I started to feel overloaded with the drama and desired a bit more focus. I do think, now that I see how it all links up in the end, I might enjoy it more on a second watch. This is a well-told story, and I have a feeling the novel might be even better because the author would have more pages to tell each story that the director had to condense into 2 hours of film. The cast of From Here to Eternity is amazing. I was particularly impressed with Montgomery Clift. He brings a lot of heart to the film, and has a challenging part to play. I totally connected with his emotional journey as he resisted the pressure to go back to boxing, even when it meant he would have to endure punishment and ridicule. His choices later in the film all made sense to me, because of this difficult journey. I also thought Frank Sinatra’s subplot opposing Ernest Borgnine was powerful. Surprisingly, the romance between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr that leads to the most famous scene in the film, was probably the least interesting aspect to me. Before going in, I thought the entire movie was going to be about them, and by the end I found their story underwhelming. However, it’s hard to point to one thing that I found bad about From Here to Eternity. It’s a high-quality film, and I think over time it will go up in my estimation.

Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster give excellent performances, so good that William Holden, who won the Best Actor Oscar that year, said that they deserved it more than him. They're both very intense men, but with a distinctive soft side, and an ability to see past their military duties to recognise a person's true worth. Deborah Kerr & Donna Reed, despite their relatively little screen time, still provide the film with a lot of emotional weight. Frank Sinatra, in an Oscar-winning turn, is easily on of the film's standouts, giving a lot of laughs but also suppling a lot of heart. It might suffer some pacing issues, and the ending feels a little flat, but it deserves to be remembered for a lot more than an illicit kiss on a wave-battered beach.

            "content": "Now here is a war film that I can enjoy as we focus less on the warfare itself and more on the characters and their personal conflicts. The shadow of war looms over the events of the film throughout and when war finally does break out in the form of the attack on Pearl Harbor you really care about the men who put their lives at risk to defend their military base. This film is so much more than just the iconic Deborah Kerr/Burt Lancaster kiss as it portrays complex but charming romances that are tragically cut short by larger conflicts. The women take center stage at several points in this film and this allows for a movie that appeals to both men and women in how it deals with an admittedly important part of our society. This is the third greatest Best Picture winning war film I have seen yet, behind Schindler's List (1993) and The Hurt Locker (2009), because it's more interested in the lives of the humans behind the conflict than the conflict itself.\n\nSergeant Milton Warden, Burt Lancaster, begins a dangerous affair with the damaged Karen Holmes, Deborah Kerr, who is also the wife of his superior. Meanwhile Private Robert Prewitt, Montgomery Clift, arrives having been recently traumatized by the death of one of his friends as a result of his boxing punch which has caused him not to want to box much to the consternation of his superiors. Prewitt begins a relationship with Lorene, Donna Reed, but he is troubled by the role she plays in her profession as entertainment at a gentlemen's club and his refusal to leave the military and become a civilian as she wants him to causes them to grow apart. Lurking in the background are Prewitt's cantankerous friend Private Angelo Maggio, Frank Sinatra, and Fatso Judson, Ernest Borgnine, but with the advent of Pearl Harbor everybody's lives will be irrevocably changed.\n\nThe romances in the film both work for the same reason as we see the tragedy of two men falling in love with broken women who need love in order to be rebuilt but abandoning these same women for the excitement of war. What begins as a casual, sexy affair becomes a proper, committed relationship for Warden and Karen as her shock admission that her husband was more focused on his affairs than her miscarriage brings them closer together. Their drift apart due to his absolute commitment to his work feels inevitable and yet we root for them to be together because they are both such richly written characters and their undeniable chemistry is beautiful. Prewitt and Lorene also experience a shift as she allows a man into her home and her heart but expects him to offer her the same level of commitment as he continues to make idiotic decisions to prove that he is not a coward in the face of conflict. His abandonment of her so that he could return to the military base made me angry at him for just a moment but the final scene in which the two women lament the loss of their men even as they acknowledge that those men had the wrong priorities.\n\nI was swept up in the passions of these characters because of the writing and the handling of the characters but it was also the actors that brought this story to life so vividly. Reed in particular stands out as she is simply lovely in her role as the intelligent, beautiful but initially defensive Lorene. Little moments such a delightful scene in which Prewitt asks Lorene \"Is this what being married is like?\" and she responds \"It's better\" are where Reed really gets to shine. She earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as she is magnetic whenever she is on screen and even manages to overshadow the great Montgomery Clift at moments.

The tale depicted in here is way too subtle for a cinematic experience, there isn't enough crisp and loudness for it to flaunt, and yet it still manages to leave a heavy impression on the audience, as it allows homework for them which when the curtain drops, pays off. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like costume design, editing, songs and background score. The script in here is smarter for it doesn't compromise its quality for any commercial or in fact any aspects of the feature, delivering its own independent track that is, on beat. \n\nThe adaptive screenplay Daniel Taradash knows the characters from the book well enough to offer them enough range and room to factor in effectively to the bigger picture. Fred Zinnemann; the director, as always has delivered it without flinching on going deep into the inner politics among the soldiers and has molded an art worth exploring through his brilliant execution skills. The star cast being aware of the magnitude of the opportunity on telling the tale, has given their all in which is clearly visible where Montgomery Clift, Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra stands along with stellar performances. \n\nFrom Here To Eternity is a justification to the title for its bold and gutsy move on following the story and not worry about the structure or format of the script.",

This may just be a style of the early 50s for which I have yet to acquire a taste, but I would compare this movie to \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". As a viewer, you invest yourself in a movie's plot, assuming it will lead you to a well-thought out climax and resolution. That's one of my favorite aspects of a great movie - watching any plot (sometimes even a mundane one) take you to a grand, sufficiently developed finish line. If a plot just throws seemingly uncalculated events at you, however thought-provoking they are individually, you might as well mine for meaning in real life.",

            "content": "This is obsensibly a film about life before war breaks out - the climax (not a spoiler I dont think) is the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 - but it's also about how much it sucks to be a man.  And a woman.  Actually it is not something that is too appealing it would seem to be a part of an army base during peacetime from the looks of this. The women in this world are in miserable marriages or at miserable jobs, and the guys are stuck in the same super-masculine patterns: do some boxing, trust me, Pruitt, it'll be good for you (nevermind that he blinded a guy by accident in a fight years before), and make sure to have plenty of booze when it's the nighttime. \n\nEven the setting is deceptive: the beautiful beaches and sweet presence of Hawaii (those shirts!) are masking how if a person cant take being around other a-holes it doesnt change anything.  Through this it makes for a compelling batch of stories; you have Lancaster as a sergeant who falls for the Captains wife (Deborah Kerr in a performance that is so intense at times it nears going into being too much, but she always keeps a scene and her delivery of these lines in check) and the conflict in whether to go for it in the 'after all this' thing; Pruitt (Clift), who this feels like the movie is more about than its top billed star, is filled with guilt and angst and should also be too much to take, but also finds those lines of keeping it compelling and interesting, full of pain and fury and all that, but also not going too far.  \n\nThe only one who may be having 'fun' up to a point is Sinatras Maggio, who becomes the brunt of racist remarks (damn you Ernest Borgnine, whos great in his few scenes by the way and cuts a mean impression), and is the first to drown himself in booze when it becomes clear life is being much too oppresive.  Though one knows how this story is leading up to its eventual conclusion, it feels more like a post war story (and it is by way of it being filmed in 53) while coming before.  A guy like Maggio wouldve faced likely the same sort of bullies and pricks in post war life as pre, but in this world he has no escape from what this BS tough guy male world has to do to people.  Or does it have to?  Yeah, it does. \n\nThere are points where it likely has dated, where the hopes and aspirations for the women especially (or some of them men too) are different than it would be today or even like 20 years after the pre Pearl Harbor days.  What were the options then, one has to ask, and it leads to having to take things on the context when it was made.  What makes it work today from being dated is the power of the performances and that the writing is smart enough to recognize everyone as flawed to varying degrees, and that Zinneman keeps a strong hold on the dramatic tone scene to scene.  If theres anything flawed its minor, like leaving the Lancaster-Kerr relationship to the wayside for a good part of the runtime until returning to that in the third act.\n\nSo if you only expect like the romance of that iconic bit on the beach you may be in for not so much disappointment but a heavier and more empathetic tale of soldiers and women and the problems in trying to be true to feelings when its not possible.  Sure its a melodrama, but so what?  If its done this well its worth embracing to this day, and Sinatra, Clift and Jean Arthur are worth noting for their terrific acting.  \n\nthem reinlistment blues...",

I was given a box set of old movies a long time ago when I was a wee lad, and this movie, alongside The Guns of Navarone and The Bridge on the River Kwai, and upon viewing it, I didn't really like it all that much. Upon watching it for the first time in at least a decade, I want nothing more than to go back in time and punch my younger self in the groin.\nFrom Here to Eternity is a sweeping romantic tale, set against the backdrop of pre-war America. More specifically on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu just before the Japanese attack on December 7th, 1941. Our tale follows two lads: one being a tormented ex boxer and Army bugler, who's commanding officer is making his life a living hell in order to coax him into joining the company boxing team. The other is a veteran sergeant, who is falling in love with his commanding officer's neglected wife. It may sound like a pretty melo dramatic setup (and it is at times), but this movie is surprisingly enthralling and entertaining. The acting from all involved is remarkable, with scenes rife with emotion and intensity. The characters were actually likeable, and I was surprised at just how much I gave a damn about their troubles. The attack scenes, while contained to just one set piece, was also very well done, and surprisingly intense.\nThat being said, I do think the story arc with the love affair between the Sergeant and the Officer's wife overshadowed the tale of the tormented bugler. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained by both. But I just loved watching the dynamic between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. They were apparently romantically involved during the making of this film, and it really, really shows on screen. Some of the dialogue may be a bit dated, but I found it quite nostalgic.\nFrom Here to Eternity is a great film, and a bonafide classic. I hate myself for not watching it sooner, and it's one of my favourite romances to date.",

From Here to Eternity left me disappointed due to its inability to create a dramatic impact in its stories and its lack of resonance for contemporary audiences.\n\nThe film's plot starts itself off focusing on a young soldier's, Robert Prewitt, struggles of being independent in the army, not allowing his superiors to take control of his life and be exploited for political leverage. I found this idea to be fascinating as this was a tale that is empathetic; I think many of its audience, regardless of what generation, can understand the pain that Prewitt goes through. I was disappointed with the film's shift in its story, spending more time on the romantic elements that arises with two of the film's characters, including Prewitt. If this was written with more originality in its storylines and characters or if it was directed with more emotional impact then I wouldn't have mind the film's approach. The film finishes it second act with a disappointment sequence, but its final act started with a scene that gave me chills; it was the scene where Prewitt was playing a trumpet through the megaphone as a tribute. The rest of the final act explored the event of Pearl Harbor, which had me engaged for all of it but once it ended, I was left feeling disappointed with the decision that the writers had with having this important part of history be a bookend that barely scratched the emotional surface of its characters. If this film focused more on that tragic event rather than its romance, then this film would have resonated with me; I think this was the core reason of its poor aging, as it gives us a story that we have all seen before.\n\nAt least the film delivers two strong performances from its leading men, but their female counterparts however felt stagnant and forgettable; there were actually a couple of moments where they were on screen and my focus switched from active and passive.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity did not meet the expectations that its accolades prove it to be and I doubt my feelings towards this would improve in the future.",

Shoot, maybe they could have gotten an early start during WWII, because it doesn't seem like these guys are so much concerned about Japanese attacks, as much as they're concerned with bickering with one another and worrying about the women in their lives.

Well, you might be able to pull that off if you have Burt Lancaster's physique and grin, or if you looked like Montgomery Clift, or if you could sing like Frank Sinatra. This is one seriously Hollywood army, and there's still no action, which is fine, because this film is still plenty compelling, despite its issues, and its having plenty of time to run into issues.\r\n\r\nRunning not even a whole two hours, this film is by no means terribly long, but like I said, for a military film, it doesn't have much going on, so storytelling often struggles to find material to work with, until it gets to be kind of repetitious, and feels as though it's losing focus the more it spends too much time with one plot layer over the others. The film follows three intertwined, yet still distinct storylines, and each one is thoroughly compelling, but considering that pacing is so uneven, the transitions between each overdrawn layer go convoluted feel relatively sudden. The storytellers tend to fumble all of the layering which, to a certain extent, reflects the ambition which is further emphasized by refreshing dramatic touches that in turn emphasize the lapses in originality, of which there are many, to where a certain predictability often rears its ugly head in amidst surprises. It doesn't help that contrivances are among the tropes hit in the storytelling, for the plots are nothing if not melodramatic, and made all the more disingenuous in feel - despite all of the inspiration - by heavy-handed dialogue and contrived characterization. Through all of the film's grace is subtlety issues, some of which are a little cheesy, and all of which are either lazy or further reflective of an ambition to bloat the kick and structure of this drama, whose value is limited to begin with. I've said it time and again, but this isn't much of a military drama, and by that, I mean that's not a particularly dynamic drama at all, having enough potential to be made into a rewarding final product, but not enough for it to be easy to overlook all of the excess, unevenness, familiarity and melodramatics. The final product's reward value is well-threatened, but ultimately secured, and pretty firmly, partly because it knows how to immerse.\r\n\r\nSomething of an intimate character drama, this film isn't thoroughly exploratory of its Hawaiian setting, but a lot of the film's engagement value thrives on its boasting such a beautiful setting, which is both aesthetically pleasing, - in spite of a lack of color - and tight enough to actually help in complimenting the sense of intimacy which this story would be nothing without. Sure, the intimacy of the story concept minimalizes the scope of this drama of a limited sense of consequence, and is betrayed by some subtlety issues to storytelling, but as I said, each one of the plots in this melodrama is compelling, with human themes regarding men's principles and love that hold a lot of potential for a grace which was ahead of this time in dramatic filmmaking. Daniel Taradash's Oscar-winning screenplay, with its contrivances and other heavy-handed touches, does a degree of injustice to the depth of this film, while also shaking momentum through excess and inconsistencies, but more than anything, it's sharp, with solid dialogue and enough taste to characterization and audacity to the handling of worthy subject matter to carry some genuine heart. Fred Zinnemann brings resonance to this heart, because if momentum is sustained here, then it's through Zinnemann's well-paced scene structuring which draws upon the sharp highlights in scripting in order to sustain entertainment value, and your attention with it, through and through, until finding unexpected subtlety. There are times in which the film is rather moving, but there are few, if any times in which the drama is less than compelling, for no matter how much fumblings in ambition challenge your investment, the inspiration and taste found throughout the film endears about as much as the performers. This is a sizable cast full of talent, and just about every member is, at the very least, sparklingly charismatic, and that especially goes for leading men Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra, who also hit their share of dramatic highlights which, especially for the time, are powerful in their defining the vulnerability of the central focuses of this intimate character drama. These leads carry the final product about as assuredly as anyone, or at least highlight the reflections of heart which can be found in most every area of this drama, and although it is hard to completely disregard the shortcomings, they are decidedly overcome.\r\n\r\nOnce eternity is reached, the film takes a touch too long to unevenly unravel a sometimes formulaic, frequently melodramatic and somewhat thin narrative, but engagement value is consistently sustained by the lavish locations, noble subject matter, thoughtful writing, effective direction and strong performances by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra which make Fred Zinnemann's \"From Here to Eternity\" a compelling, intimate portrait on the challenges of soldiers which extent beyond the military.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

This movie was a little underwhelming, i had high hopes for it for some reason. I found Robert E lee Prewit (played by Montgomery Clift) character unrelatable and not that sympathetic. There are many good reason in the film to feel for him but there just something for me and clifts performance that doesn't make me feel bad for him. I do however like Burt Lancaster and the ultra competent lothario is a great role for him. I was a little let down by the famous beach make out scene, they only showed them kissing for half a second! Earnest Borgnine who is usually lovable in most films i have seen him in plays a very hateable abusive head of the stockade. I found the two leading ladies very attractive as well (not always the case in some of these older films). The biggest surprised for performance however was Frank Sinatra whom i though was very impressive. I always question when a singer tries to make a transition into acting but he proves in this film he has chops. I really missed him when he leaves about two thirds in. Ultimately this movies survives more on its characters then its story, but i wish it had both.",

            "content": "Since I had not been pleased with any films about Pearl Harbour to date and From Here to Eternity won Frank Sinatra the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, it was a win-win for me to be viewing.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity serves as a war-romance film and comes from the time in history where that was actually still a valid piece of cinema as it is no longer that popular these days with an example being Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour which was enjoyable for how terrible it was, although also for its exceptional action sequences. And so it is easy to kind elements to compare it to both Pearl Harbour and Tora! Tora! Tora!. While Pearl Harbour took forever to get to the action scenes and supplied nothing but melodrama and terrible acting until then and Tora! Tora! Tora! was packed with realistic yet repetitive and dull dialogue, From Here to Eternity is actually more focused on the characters so the fact that the bombing of Pearl Harbour doesn't come in until 100 minutes isn't actually that bothersome at all. From Here to Eternity is actually the best film about Pearl Harbour I have ever seen because it doesn't put too much emphasis on the event and plays it off as one which strikes the characters without expectations and does the same to viewers. By the 100 minute point of the film, From Here to Eternity has made its characters sympathetic and its story compelling which means that when the bombing of Pearl Harbour strikes, the viewers are genuinely worried about the fate of the characters. From Here to Eternity focuses on the small scale of characters but on the large scale of events that cover many of them, which means that it is balanced much of the time. Although this also can be the downfall of From Here to Eternity at times.\nFrom Here to Eternity does suffer from a surplus of characters. There are a lot of interesting characters in From Here to Eternity, but a few too many of them to really keep up with. The story deals with them all both facing issues regarding the military and romantic themes, so it has to constantly deviate back and forth between many characters and all of the experiences that they face. The film doesn't end up tracking them all that easily, and so it can be easy for viewers to end up finding themselves confused by the entire experience. As a whole, From Here to Eternity is a consistently interesting and complex war film, but it can be a little overwhelming at times due to the pure amount of ambition involved.\nBut still, director Fred Zinnemann manages to keep everything mostly intact. Although it is a little much at times, under his direction the film ends up being a powerful visual experience and a well-acted feature which capitalises on the potential of its script and the talents of the actors. \nVisually, From Here to Eternity is full of beautiful scenery and cinematography which captures the big scale of events, the small scale of its effect on the characters and the large scale that the climactic events had on everybody. And everything is edited nicely at a gently pace against the backdrop a good musical score with the only technical flaw being the fact that the sound effects aren't consistent throughout the story. Everything in From Here to Eternity feels thoroughly convincing, so its visual style is top notch.\nBut above all of that is the fact that the cast in From Here to Eternity give it their all and never look back which means that the final result of the film is thoroughly entertaining.\nBurt Lancaster supplies another powerful lead performance. Although he does face a battle of entertainment value with Montgomery Clift and others, he manages to make up for it with another heroic leading performance. His natural charisma makes him a capable foil for From Here to Eternity, and his powerful chemistry with the many surrounding actors make him an entertaining and compelling screen presence. Burt Lancaster is terrific in From Here to Eternity.\nMontgomery Clift projects a sense of shattered innocence in his portrayal of Private Robert E. Lee \"Prew\" Prewitt because he has a combination of both humanity and fearless dedication to his cause which is both his most determined aspect and his downfall. He has a lot of heroic patriotism in him, and it leads him to an excellent performance which is memorable for being both sympathetic as  a romantic character and admirable as a patriotic hero.\nFrank Sinatra's Academy Award winning performance is also terrific. While he doesn't receive as much screen time as you may hope, he gives a performance which is one of the most memorable of his career. His role as Private Angelo Maggio places him firmly in the character and he takes full advantage of the part in a performance which is compelling and dramatic while also a very likable character. Frank Sinatra is a screen stealer in From Here to Eternity, and even up against such a large cast he makes a significant impact in the matter of a limited amount of screen time, and so he is one of the best reasons to see From Here to Eternity.\nDeborah Kerr also makes a firm supporting effort, and Donna Reed's performance has her projecting a lot of powerful emotions in the span of a mere few scenes. \nErnest Borgnine's supporting performance is also a powerful one because his antagonistic nature is very intimidating, and he makes From Here to Eternity a memorable film even further.\n\nSo although From Here to Eternity features a surplus of characters and has a genre which is significantly lesser in popularity today, it is held together by a powerful script which has a lot of deep characters, a versatile cast of Academy Award nominated actors playing them with dead on dedication and the fact that it is genuinely a compelling war film.",

This is a powerful and emotionally charged war drama set before, during and after a pivotal moment during World War 2 when everything changed. It has a brilliant ensemble cast and it's a film which still stands strong today. Set in late 1941 at the Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The film focuses on three soldiers, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), who always seems to get picked on by Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes (Philip Ober). With Prewitt acting out against everyone, First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) is under pressure to have Prewitt placed under court martial, which he doesn't do. Prewitt is supported by his best friend and fellow army buddy Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra). Meanwhile, Warden is having an affair with Holmes's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr), while Prewitt falls for Lorene (Donna Reed). It's a complex story, but it does pay off, and the big climax is only a footnote to the drama that the characters all face, the bigger picture seems insignificant compared to their dramas and woes. This was the big Oscar winner of 1953, and unlike other years where the wrong films seem to win, this truly deserved it.",

The real story is Montgomery Clift pulling a Cool Hand Luke nearly 15 years before Paul Newman. There are differences yes, but Clift's Army Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt who just wants to be left to do his job and won't give in to the pressures and authority must have inspired some of the Luke character (or Newman at least). Lancaster is strong here as the tough but fair Sgt who runs the base for his Captain, who's busy trying to get a promotion between dates (cheating on his wife). Both Prewitt and Sgt Warden find love, Clift with Donna Reed as a men's club worker (Yes Mrs. George Bailey as a quasi-Hooker); Lancaster with Deborah Kerr's wife of his boss. Some of the best work here is in the small parts; Frank Sinatra single-handedly saved his career with this performance as Prew's pal Maggio, who always wants to have a good time until he runs across the sadistic Stockade officer played by Ernest Borgnine.\nAll this takes place in the time leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbour, and it is that event which leads the characters to make their stands and meet their fates. The picture won 8 of 13 Oscar nods, including Picture, Director (Fred Zinnemann - High Noon), Screenplay, Cinematography, Supporting Actor for Sinatra and Supporting Actress for Reed. Lancaster, Clift and Kerr were all nominated for Lead Roles as well. Well worth a watch, holds up well, as the story of outsiders and people who aren't really happy with life never get old when done well.",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\" Well, what am I? I'm a private no-class dogface. The way most civilians look at that, that's two steps up from nothin'.\"\n\nWhen you think of the 1950's, particularly 50's cinema, the majority of the films that come off the bat are films made to appeal to all members of a household. There were groundbreaking films made during this time, like The Ten Commandments, Singin' in the Rain, and The Searchers, but due to the Hay's Code, studios had to be sure that they don't violate some of it's stupid and idiotic restrictions in order to make a \"moral\" film. But the 1950's was also known as a decade where filmmakers decided to be a little sneaky with the code and get away with some of the restrictions, forever weakening its power and leading into more revolutionary works. Some of the first \"adult\" films were made in the 1950's, such as Sunset Boulevard, A Streetcar Named Desire, and On the Waterfront, but none will ever be so remembered and so acclaimed as From Here to Eternity, a film bases on an acclaimed war novel known for its \"explicit\" material that was considered extremely steamy for its time. And the risks certainly paid off, as From Here to Eternity was nominated for 13 Oscars, winning 8 of them, most memorable being Best Picture. While the film is certainly tame in its steamy situations, there's no denying that From Here to Eternity is still a great film.\n\nThe film is about the lives of soldiers stationed in Hawaii in 1941, shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and focuses on these soldiers' problems that they face in the barracks. We have Sergeant Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster), who develops a crush on the wife of his commanding officer (Deborah Kerr). There's Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), a former boxer who faces insults and taunts from other soldiers for quitting to fight, falls on love with showgirl Lorene (Donna Reed), and communicates well with a bugle. There's also Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who has a hated against stockade sergeant Fatso (Ernest Borgnine), a man that threatens to kill him off if he doesn't obey orders. But things get really heated up when these characters are faced with \"the day that will life in infamy\", the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity is forever well-known for it's \"infamous\" love scene between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach, with waves rolling around them. The story goes that Lancaster and Kerr were actually romantically involved on the set while making this movie, a rumor that makes the scene that more memorable to watch. When the film was first released, reaction to the scene was divided. 50's kids were loving this original scene of romantic passion, while parents of the day were heavily offended that such sexual activity was depicted on screen. I can honestly imagine how the scene would have played out if The Hay's Code was not around and it would have probably caused more controversy in the day. All controversy aside, while the scene is tame nowadays, as we only see them kissing for two seconds, this heavily iconic scene still remains memorable at it was in 1953, and it is the biggest highlight of this great, great movie.\n\nThe thing about From Here to Eternity is that it's well-acted, particularly from its five main stars in the film. The one that surprised me the most was Frank Sinatra as Maggio. I knew he did more dramatic roles in his career, but I didn't know he could play a role this strong. Sinatra did win the Oscar for this film, as Best Supporting Actor, and definitely earned it. So does Donna Reed, who gained the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as the showgirl. Deborah Kerr, while she's fine in the role, I wished she had a little more screen time than what we ended up getting. The beach scene was not enough for me. The two lead actors, Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift, were both nominated for Best Actor in this film. They didn't win, but they were both fantastic in their roles. Burt Lancaster, while he has top billing, is not the true star of the film in my book. That goes to Montgomery Clift, who easily knocks Lancaster's socks off when it comes to flawless acting. Clift is the heart and soul of the picture, perfectly conveying what his character is going through. If anyone deserved to win the Oscar, it would be Clift.\n\nEven more conveying than Clift's performance is the Pearl Harbor attack scene. What's strong about this movie is that while Pearl Harbor plays a huge role in the film, it doesn't scream \"ATTACK\" throughout the movie. The Pearl Harbor scene occurs in the last 20 minutes of the film, and it was well done. It doesn't go into full detail of the casualties lost on that tragic day, but what we got in the end was something that will always be remembered \"from here to eternity\" (pun intended).\n\nWhile the ending was a little weak, and definitely something that could have been better handled, I was really impressed with From Here to Eternity. It's a great, essential film truly because of its strong acting, especially Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, and especially Montgomery Clift. It's a difficult, slow movie to watch, especially those that are younger, but the acting, the wonderful cinematography, and definitely it's iconic, passionate love scene, is definitely worth everybody's time. It's a classic that's not to be missed.",

            "content": "Its power may have waned a little bit since it first came out over 50 years ago, but FROM HERE TO ETERNITY still remains one of the classic war films as well as an interesting look into military life circa 1941. The story follows a handful of characters whose lives all intersect in Hawaii during the months prior to the bombing at Pearl Harbor. You have Montgomery Clift as Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt: a loner with a troubled past, Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden: a tough, but understanding NCO, Deborah Kerr as Karen Holmes: the company commander's wife, and Frank Sinatra as Angelo Maggio: a wiry Italian fellow who befriends Prewitt and loves to drink. As was typical for films of the period, there is a romantic/melodramatic element which forms the basis for the story and informs the way we see the characters. This aspect was kind of dated, but it allows the casual viewer a window into these characters' lives the way a straight military picture couldn't have done. The two main romantic narrative threads are between Montgomery Clift and a girl, Loreen/Alma (Donna Reed) who works at a club he frequents, and Burt Lancaster with Deborah Kerr. Both of these couples lament the situation that life has put them in and desire to get away from it all. Montgomery Clift has become the target of cruel treatment based on his decision not to join the company's boxing team, while Donna Reed's character has grown weary of her employment at a gentleman's club where she has to entertain service members. Parallel to that, Burt Lancaster romances the wife of his CO, a philanderer who has lost interest in her. One common element is the desire to return to the States and get married, which would provide the stability that they all want. However, fate has other plans as the bombing at Pearl Harbor throws their somewhat stable world into chaos and the men of the Army must put aside petty differences to fight the bigger enemy. These are rather heady themes to be tackled in a film that could easily have been a fluff piece for the Armed Forces, yet FROM HERE TO ETERNITY never feels like propaganda. The biggest thing on its mind seems to be portraying what happens when something unexpected throws our best-laid plans into disarray. When that happens, the best we can do is to band together and make the best of a bad situation. In the end, our commitment to each other will outlast any temporary plans that we have. Overall, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY does feel \"of its time\" but it's also the only Pearl Harbor film worth watching.",

            "content": "One of the big blockbuster best sellers of the post World War II years is James Jones's From Here to Eternity, a tale of the peacetime army in Hawaii before Pearl Harbor. The book was definitely going to be made into a film and it was only a question of casting to make it a success.\n\nDirector Fred Zinneman had a good intuitive sense about casting here, even against type. The two principal female parts were done against type. Deborah Kerr who made a career of playing respectable women played a captain's wife who's drinking and playing around. Not that husband Philip Ober is letting grass grow under his feet either, but Kerr's latest sexual exploit involves her with the First Sergeant of her husband's company, Burt Lancaster. \n\nDonna Reed, who up to that point was best known for being Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life, plays a prostitute here. A girl from the wrong side of the tracks, jilted by a rich boyfriend stateside, she's in Hawaii to make money and then go home and buy some respectability. She's not looking for romance with any soldiers, but you can't plan these things.\n\nEspecially Montgomery Clift if he comes in your life. It's been argued that this is Clift's greatest role and a case can sure be made for it. His character of Robert E. Lee Pruitt is like so many who still join the army today, from small town America who have no future there and find a home in the Armed Services. What makes Clift unique is that strong sense of individualism he can't control in an organization that does not encourage individuality.\n\nClift and Lancaster are a great study in contrasts and that's what drives From Here to Eternity. Lancaster as Sergeant Milt Warden is the ultimate professional soldier, held in the highest regard by his men. Lancaster is someone who knows how to work the system, you see it in the way he manipulates his captain. Of course he's got to be a manipulator there since he's having an affair with Deborah Kerr. He tries to protect Clift from himself and ultimately fails.\n\nClift has transferred into an infantry company and he was at one time a boxer. But he blinded someone in a fight and quit boxing. Philip Ober who prides himself on having several champions in various weight classes worked to get Clift in his company. Clift upsets his plans by refusing to box so he has the various sergeants give him \"the treatment.\" \n\nClift's best friend in the company is a tough street wise soldier from the big city named Angelo Maggio, played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra read the book and knew this part was for him. He did everything he had to do to get that part, including working for scale. At the time Sinatra was considered a has been as singer and actor. Sinatra was right on the money in terms of picking a role. His faith in himself and Columbia Pictures and Fred Zinneman's faith in him netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of eight awards won by From Here to Eternity.\n\nBy the way Sinatra credited both Lancaster and Clift in helping him through this film as a dramatic actor. Lancaster and Sinatra didn't inhabit the same Hollywood orbit, but they remained friends for life. The same could not be said for Clift. Allegedly, some five or six years after From Here to Eternity and after Monty Clift's automobile accident while shooting Raintree County, Clift at some party at Sinatra's made a drunken pass at one of Sinatra's retainers. That got him kicked out of Sinatra's circle permanently.\n\nIn fact From Here to Eternity was also the Best Picture of 1953, with Zinneman getting his second Best Director Oscar in a row after the one he took home in 1952 for High Noon. Donna Reed won for Best Supporting Acress. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were both nominated for Best Actor, but split the vote allowing William Holden to win for Stalag 17. Another great acting job itself. And Kerr was up for Best Actress, but lost to Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holiday.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity is a film loaded with good actors in small roles who got their first notice in this film. Ernest Borgnine, Robert J. Wilkie, Claude Akins, Jack Warden, Mickey Shaughnessy, all play various soldiers and each one is memorable. Especially Borgnine as the vicious sadistic sergeant of the stockade.\n\nTV's Superman was in From Here to Eternity also. George Reeves who was looking to escape the typecasting from Superman has a part as another sergeant who warns Lancaster about Deborah Kerr. He gave a fine performance, but most of it wound up on the cutting room floor. That would have unforeseen tragic consequences.\n\nThis is not any kind of glamorous army. These people are all too real and not very noble. The original novel was toned down quite a bit for the screen. But when the attack on Pearl Harbor comes, the men rise to the occasion, do their jobs in a more than competent manner and led by Burt Lancaster in that company. It's these men who won that war in the Pacific and the one in Europe as well and From Here to Eternity despite the less than noble portrayals of them as individuals is a great tribute to them as a team.",

            "content": "This is another film that I keep looking at the cover of and keep wanting to see it to know what it's about. Here's my review for From Here to Eternity.\n\nPlot: set in 1941, Private Prewitt transfers from the Bugle Corps to a rifle unit at Company \"G\" at Schofield Barracks in Oahu. When captain Holmes hears his reputation as a middleweight boxer, he asks Prewitt to join their team but he refuses stating that he quit boxing. So Holmes tries to make things a living hell for Prewitt until he gives in. Meanwhile, First Sergeant Warden falls in love with Holmes' wife Karen on whom Holmes has been unfaithful to, and Prewitt falls for a woman named Lorene at a gentleman's club called the New Congress Club.\n\nOkay this didn't completely blow me away, but I liked it. The stories were interesting, the characters were enjoyable and were well acted, - Frank Sinatra seems to stand out the most which I would agree with, from his last scene in the film for sure. The general concept of what happens during most of the movie may not have aged well since it's a little familiar, (like I personally can't help but think of Top Fun a little with some parts of this film)  but I think it works out. But personally I think my only real issue is that I don't think the stories completely balance out. I generally say that because I kind of wanted more of Warden and Karen's story. They were already a little interesting in the beginning what with how he's having an affair with her against her husband who's always cheating her, but then you have the beach scene and she talks about what happened during the earlier years of her marriage and I ended up liking her character more. From that I personally wanted more from their story and thought they could've done more. I mean they did eventually but I don't think it paid off as much as I hoped it would. But anyway, I also liked the fighting during the very end. They did a good with that one stunt especially of a guy getting show down by a plane I thought they did a rather impressive job on.\n\nAnd that's my review for From Here to Eternity. The plot may be familiar and some of the stories aren't balanced out, but it still has great characters, very well acted, good action and is altogether an enjoyable film all around.",

The central themes to this movie from what I gathered was fear and love. It is full of masterful cinematography and brilliant acting, making it one of the most memorable films of all time.\n \n\n\nThere are two stories that this film revolves around. The first is Robert E. Lee. Prewitt's (Montgomery Clift), a private in the army who has just been transferred to a new regiment. He is a masterful boxer, but will never fight again after permanently injuring one of his friends whilst sparring. His regiment put him through hell to try to get him to box for them. The second story is about Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) and his love affair with the wife of his commanding officer, Karen (Deborah Kerr). From Here To Eternity isn't the most interesting of story's, but the brilliant acting and cinematography make it extremely entertaining.\n \n\nMontgomery Clift was spectacular in this, particularly in the scene where he plays the bugle for his friend who died. Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster had great chemistry, making their story the more interesting of the two. Frank Sinatra was surprisingly fantastic as well. He definitely earned his Oscar for this movie. Donna Reed played the girlfriend of Prewitt, and in one scene blew me away It was the scene where he was leaving her to return to the army.\n \nWhen someone mentions the \"Most Iconic Scenes of All Time,\" 9 times out of 10, the beach scene from 'From Here To Eternity' will be brought up. It is spectacular, there's no denying that. But for me, the best cinematography occurred when Pearl Harbour was getting bombed by the Japanese. It was so suspenseful and beautifully shot. For me, it was the highlight of the film and pushed it into the 'Great Movies' category. The music throughout the movie is lovely too, especially when Prewitt plays his bugle. It gives me chills.\n \nOverall, this is a very entertaining movie. I'd put the cinematography in From Here To Eternity up there with the greatest of all time. It's an almost perfect film that everyone should see.",
