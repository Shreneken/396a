            "content": "If you can get past the opening thirty minutes or so, which drags painfully and seems to serve little or no purpose, Henri-Georges Clouzot's Wages of Fear is a suspense classic that has rarely been matched in the almost seventy years since its release.  Set in a rugged landscape of both mountains and desert, four men desperate for money agree to drive two trucks filled with nitroglycerine on a dangerous mission to deliver their explosive cargo to an oil company in the hope of extinguishing an out-of-control oil well fire.  It is a story of courage, exploitation, and corporate greed that is an unrelentingly suspenseful experience, once the trucks start rolling, as the four men risk death in exchange for a lucrative pay cheque, the tension ratcheting up as they approach their destination. There is nothing quite like it.",

            "content": "An early blueprint for the suspense odyssey, The Wages of Fear takes its time (some may argue too long, at almost an hour before the journey itself starts) to establish its suite of characters, each demonstrating some fault that reflects on the harshness of the environment, be it greed, deceit, or simple callousness. The town of Las Piedras is a purgatory, an inescapable mire that draws in the sinful. The film seems to echo the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, but adding in elements of tension that go beyond human weakness, introducing a more exotic locale, a larger cast, and a cargo that threatens death constantly. The film constatnly reinforces its 'time bomb' premise, but instead of leaning on tropes of 'collaboration will carry the day', the writers let small victories cloud the atmosphere like soft lights in the dark, which only renders the film's surprise climaxes feel all the more devastating (I mean, killing half of your protagonists off-screen in such a moment of levity is just brilliant). The political and social satire may be rather overt, but it was a measure that would have simply been unthinkable in McCarthy-era America, and indeed led to the film's censorship. The editing is at times inspired and at others surprisingly straightforward or stark, the ending scene seems tacked-on, the length is a bit substantial, and the prologue does drag on beyond the needs of character establishment, but the film is still a landmark for its particular subgenre and carries an air of tension even today.

The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I've watched in my life.  \n\nA good character-drama too - the way the characters develop and the relationships between the four change adds a new dimension to the drama and makes for very engaging viewing.\n\nNot perfect though.  Some events and plot devices don't make much sense, though aren't crucial to the movie.  The ending felt quite silly and contrived.

            "content": "The one thing you can’t deny with The Wages of Fear is that it is built to create tension in the viewer. Every moment of the film could lead to the death of all the main characters if the smallest thing goes wrong. The drama of this made it hard for me to breathe at first. Some of that tension fizzled for me because it seemed that the volatility of the cargo varied based on certain situations. There were still some scary moments later in the film, but I didn’t feel like I had a good handle on the level of danger any more. They needed standard rules so I could track the risk of death at any given time. The interactions between the characters were nuanced and effective. I loved how things developed over time as the severity of what they were doing got to the characters. It reminded me of one of my favorite classic films, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, where relationships gradually deteriorate when the stress gets to them as well. I didn’t quite understand all the drama that was going on between these guys before the trip was started and why they weren’t getting along, but it all came to a head later in the film so the early scenes didn’t matter as much to me. Then the movie ended and I was mad. I don’t like to spoil much of anything when I write these reviews, but that conclusion drove me crazy. I could see it coming and tried to will The Wages of Fear into a different ending. It was so close to the perfect wrap up to the story, and then they had to go and do that. It wasn’t a dealbreaker, and I wouldn’t dissuade people from seeing the film because of the ending, but I don’t know if I’ll want to watch it again. The Wages of Fear excels at making you worry about and care for the characters, it’s just a shame that the writers hated them so much. ",

            "content": "Le salaire de la peur (1953)\nOnce The Engines of The Trucks Start Up, The Film Is Masterful\n20 March 2017\nI suppose if you were to tally up all the marks, The Wages of Fear is one of the few movies of all time to have a superior remake. That film is in the form of Sorcerer, a 1977 masterpiece from William Friedkin. Dramatically, Wages of Fear is better. And the main section of the film featuring the trucks is actually more suspenseful in the original. However, The Wages of Fear is so uneven with all its other aspects it's hard to ignore. For instance, the first hour or so plods and lacks quality. Its editing is strange, it comes off to be cliché, and what happens is genuinely uninteresting. Only the second time viewing Sorcerer did I realize how engaging the first two parts are. Each of the four protagonists' stories are so genuinely interesting that it hooks us to watch more. Only when the trucks start up in Wages of Fear does an audience member's eyes open. And by that, I mean completely ajar. Although structurally the half of the film featuring the trucks is a bit reminiscent of a board game (you hit different obstacles that could technically be put in any order), I found myself completely invested in the characters suddenly and I was dripping sweat in suspense. Even Sorcerer, although technically much better, doesn't really match this aspect, albeit coming inches close. Another plus is the ending, which reminds me a lot of my favorite film, The Italian Job (1969). Yet, through all its major advantages (which outweigh the negatives so much in fact that the 9 star rating proves adequate), Sorcerer is just a better film.\n\nP.S. If you're reading this and you just so happen to work at some major video game company, I suggest you consider this for one of the games. It would make one heck of a video game.",

            "content": "\"The Wages of Fear\" perfectly demonstrates what it means to be on the edge of your seat.  It is nothing but pure excitement made by the French director Henri-Georges Clouzot.  Films don't get much better than this and certainly films that are more than sixty years old don't get that much more exciting.  It's an absolute nailbiter.  Superbly adapted from the Georges Arnaud novel \"Le salaire de la peur\" by Clouzot and Jerome Geronimi, the characters come to life with fully realized ambitions, fears, anxieties and dreams.\nSet in a small Mexican village surrounded by desert with its only link to the outside world being a small airport whose airfare is much too expensive for the out of work foreigners who pass the time idly at the local tavern.  Some find work doing odd jobs here and there for enough money for food and alcohol, but not much more.  The village is dominated by an American oil company called Southern Oil Company (SOC) who controls many oil fields in the area.  For the most part, if you find yourself in this village with no money and no prospects for work, you're pretty much stranded there.\nMario is played by Yves Montand, a Frenchman who starts to bond with a newcomer to the area over their shared experience of living in Paris at one time.  Jo (Charles Vanel) is an aging gangster with a past relationship with the foreman at SOC named Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs), but this relationship isn't explained.  The Italian Luigi (Folco Lulli) has been saving up his money doing odd jobs, but he is constantly referred to as a miser.  Bimba then proceeds to buy the tavern a round of drinks prompting antagonism from Jo almost esculating into murder.  The Dutchman Bimba (Peter Van Eyck) is the fourth out of luck foreigner introduced.  They all dream of leaving southern Mexico and returning back home.\nTheir opportunity arises after a fire erupts at an oil field killing thirteen SOC employees.  The townspeople are furious that their lives are taken for granted and they are paid so little.  O'Brien and other executives come to the conclusion that the only way to put out the fire is to use nitroglycerine to cause an explosion to put the fire out.  The only way to get the nitroglycerine to the oil field is to drive it in jerrycans on the flatbed of a large truck across 300 miles of horrible roads making sure not to hit a bump too hard or go too fast or too slow.  The union would probably not let their members take such a dangerous job so O'Brien recruits the foreigners knowing they will do and offers to pay $2,000 each.  \nThe suspense that these four characters are literally sitting on a bomb that could go off at any time drives the film for the last hour and a half.  There's two truck driven by two men, Mario and Jo in one and Bimba and Luigi in the other.  Montand and Vanel are the stars and the film focuses on them more than the other two.  Jo, who O'Brien thought was too old, connives his way into being the fourth driver.  Once taking the wheel he seems unsure and scared and perhaps Mario is thinking he is too old, too careful driving to the point it may kill them both.  Jo's doubt and skittishness causes Mario to treat him horribly as the two get to know each other better along their 300 mile trek.\nSpeeding up, slowing down, backing up are all moments that cause alarm and Clouzot does it all with such precision and care.  Having two trucks trying to stay a good distance apart for fear of explosion leads to some miscommunication when the other team needs to be warned for dangers ahead.  There are many obstacles along the way that make for some exciting action.  As the audience, you want nothing more than to see these guys succeed.  Much of the suspense in the film contain no music and it's just painful silence.\nThe film was supposed to be filmed in Spain but Montand refused to film in Spain as long as Franco was in power so Southern France filled in for Southern Mexico.  The role of Jo was originally offered to Jean Gabin but he turned it down and Vanel jumped to the opportunity.  Montand was not known as a dramatic actor before this film but he does a terrific job and has good chemistry with Vanel.\nFor the U.S. release about seven minutes was cut from the film because it was deemed too anti-American because of the film's depiction of the oil company in Central America.  At one point, Jo even asks Mario, \"There's Americans here?\" to which Mario responds, \"Wherever there's oil.\"  The cuts led to a confused movie with unclear motives and maybe to some this is \"anti-American\" but it seems more against foreign businesses exploiting local workers for cheap wages and horrible working conditions.",

            "content": "The Wages of Fear is filmmaking at its absolute finest. The tension and anxiety you'll feel watching this film is unlike anything I've ever experienced. My body was still, my breathing sporadic for nearly two and a half hours as director Henri-Georges Clouzot's accomplishes something I rarely see (and may have never seen done this well): Create a film that's simultaneously plot-driven and character-focused. It's so hard to not lose sight of one of them, but Clouzot never does-not even for a scene. It's an marvelous achievement, and earns an instant spot in my all-time top five.\n\nThe film is constructed around the basic premise that those stranded in Las Piedras, a woebegone town in a nameless Latin American country, would do anything to get out. Sure, there are small pleasures-the constant feeling of leisure, for example-but the town has been so ravaged by the Southern Oil Company that those pleasures are almost immediately overtaken by a sense of isolation and helplessness. If you're unfortunate enough to find yourself in Las Piedras, there's a good reason for it, and you aren't likely to be getting out soon.\n\nWhen an opportunity presents itself, however, the stranded are ready to jump at it. Mario (Yves Montand), Jo (Charles Vanel), Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are drafted by SOC for a dangerous mission-transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin over 300 miles of rocky terrain. Why would anyone undertake such a job? Easy-the $2000 waiting for them if they make it back alive.\n\nThe Wages of Fear is constructed in such a smart way (a way that's been duplicated in many films since). The first hour is all character and setting development. I won't lie and say it's the most exciting hour I've ever seen in film (that award would go to this very film's final hour), but it's essential in order grasp why these men choose to take the job. We need to empathize with their desperation, or else we'll feel they are just reckless adventure seekers. Clouzot takes his time showing us this, but in hindsight, every second of this build-up is necessary.\n\nThe way Clouzot presents his characters is also fascinating. Though he never makes us lose focus of who these people are, none of them is all that sympathetic. Mario is a downright scoundrel-one of the most dislikable protagonists I've ever seen. He's abusive toward his girlfriend, Linda (Clouzot's own wife, Vera), and he treats his companion, Jo, with utter disdain as soon as the older man shows any sign of weakness. Jo, meanwhile, is all bark and no bite. In the safe confines of Las Piedras, he's like Don Corleone, insisting that everyone call him Mr. Jo, and threatening anyone who disrupts his power. As the journey gets rough, however, he's the first to crack, and ironically, he becomes something of an underdog. Bimba and Luigi we know a little less about, though they are far from one-dimensional. Bimba is like a robotic Aryan. He's easily the toughest of the bunch and shows little emotion over the course of the entire journey. He's also blonde-haired and blue-eyed enough that Hitler would envy him. Luigi is the most personable of the bunch. He seems like a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, but we do learn early on that he is to die within a year of lung injuries sustained during his time working for SOC.\n\nAll four characters have flaws, but our interest in them never wanes, even when we become fully engrossed in the white-knuckle suspense of their journey. It's been said before that generating surprise is easy, but suspense is trickier. Maintaining such a fierce suspense is something I've honestly never seen before. There's not a moment during the second half of The Wages of Fear when I didn't feel uneasy, nervous, or unsure about the outcome of this journey. As they encounter obstacle after obstacle (from a rickety bridge they must drive on to a several-ton boulder they need to blow up to pass), the odds of their survival decrease. And how do they react when the survive one challenge? Not with increased confidence as you might expect, but rather with greater dread and a more fatalistic attitude. In that way, The Wages of Fear is a very unique movie for its time. There's little hope to be found. It's almost as if the characters know their journey is a fool's errand. But that doesn't make it any less compelling-the contrary is true, actually. As they become more hopeless, we feel more tension and suspense.\n\nThere was a great deal of controversy surrounding The Wages of Fear back in 1953 for its portrayal of Americans. In fact, the film was cut for its American release (only to be restored much later in its complete form). The SOC is your typical corporation-it feigns caring about its community, but behind closed doors, its leaders don't care about the people or the environment. The first time we're introduced to the company, it's because the family members of some dead SOC workers are protesting the company and the dangerous conditions on the job. It's also quite clear the reason Las Piedras is so down and out is because SOC has sapped any potential from this town. Whether Clouzot modeled the company after any real one I couldn't say. But as far as I'm concerned, it might as well be called BP or Exxon-Mobil because nothing is taboo for its leaders as long as its profitable.\n\nThe Wages of Fear is considered one of two Clouzot masterpieces (the other is Diabolique). While the latter is great, it doesn't mark the pinnacle of a genre the way the former does. This is the gold standard as far as thrillers are concerned. It has more suspense than every thriller I've seen in the last few years combined, with every major scene in the latter half of the film offering at least one heart-stopping moment. It's brilliant cinema that deserves its status as a classic. I think everyone should watch it, and as soon as possible. You'll never view thrillers in the same way again.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/wages-of-fear-review/",

            "content": "Crazy suspenseful. It's amazing how dangerous their job is. Every step of the way something goes wrong like they're cursed. I think the best part is when one truck is speeding up and the other one is behind it going so fast you think for sure they're going to crash. A little spoiler here, but I love how when a truck finally does blow up it happens suddenly and with no suspense. Brilliant. The movie finally gives you a chance to relax, and \"boom!\"\n\nIt's good that the movie is in different languages. The foreign languages and subtitles make the artsy dialogue easier to digest, while the english speaking parts make the Hollywood, Hitchcock-like action easier to adjust to once the men leave the town. \n\nThere's a lot of suspense in the quick pace and suggestive dialogue in the beginning. Going into the film knowing it was very suspenseful, maybe I saw some suspense that wasn't there. I guess I felt suspense anticipating the suspense. Regardless, the beginning is enjoyable. Quick timing, poetic dialogue and many eccentric characters. The town is very dramatic and sweet, and also a little cruel. Vera Clouzot is the most unusual, in a fun way. I think she might be masochistic or something. She's definitely the most interesting character Very passionate and playful, but not very smart. Imagine if she went along on the trip. I don't think it would have made it a better film because there would be added emotion, femininity and an overall less raw experience, but it would create a different kind of movie which would be equally interesting and probably more existential.",

            "content": "Man, that's an awesome title, at least by comparison, because at least it makes more sense than \"Sorcerer\". That title is so misleading that it just has to be some kind of an abstract symbolism, which goes to show you that between this adaptation of Georges Arnaud's \"Le salaire de la peur\" and the one by William Friedkin, the latter is the more pretentious. I think I may be the most pretentious for comparing existential, European-style thrillers in the first place, and for actually saying the series of words, \"Georges Arnaud's 'Le salaire de la peur'\", although, in all fairness, \"Sorcerer\" doesn't set the highest standard for artsy fartsy. Still, I never thought I'd the day in which the Americans take a French property and make it even more abstract, and poor ol' Henri-Georges Clouzot didn't get the chance to see that day either, as he passed away but a few months before the \"remake\" of this film came out. ...Fun facts which aren't in the strictest sense fun aside, to be fair, this film was made 24 years before \"Sorcerer\", in the '50s, when they didn't have the raw guts to... see how well they can bore someone. People, I'm joking, but \"Sorcerer\" did get a little slow, whereas this film keeps momentum adequate, as well it should if it's going to flirt with a runtime of two-and-a-half hours. Well, sure enough, the film holds your attention just fine, but it also challenges it, partly because of that length, quite frankly.\r\n\r\nFlirting with two hours and quarter, and two-and-a-half hours in the case of the director's cut, this film is too long, no matter which way you look at it, being bloated, not by those European meanderings one might fear when they enter what is supposedly an art film, but simply be excessive material that overdraws the development segment, as well as other segments whose eventual shifts feel jarring. If nothing else establishes a sense of unevenness in the storytelling as it goes along, it's tone, which is so light, - sometimes even rather satirical - then suddenly so intense, at least for the '50s, when there is, in fact, kick to tone, that is. This isn't one of those distinctly European sort of dry affairs, but it is a little subdued with its atmosphere at times, and when such atmospheric delicacy runs into all of the dragging and unevenness, the film begins to feel rather monotonous, and it doesn't help that it's not that difficult to see what exactly this plot is meandering to. This film promises to be unique for the '50s, maybe even for today, but it's not even unique for the former, having its shocking moments, but not enough to overcome some sense of predictability deriving from clichéd dialogue and dated tropes, many of which include superficialities of the time. I've gone on and on about how this film isn't as experimental of a European drama as I was expecting, but really, what I mean to say is that this film has no more edge that one of the less sugar-coated Hollywood pieces of the '50s, being either too unsubtle with its contrived dramatics, or too subtle in its portrayal of potentially biting conflicts that are toned down, if not overlooked. The film is plenty effective, as it's subject matter is so intriguing, and its storytelling highlights are so compelling, but when the film goes relatively flat, it simply can't get a grip on pacing, tone, originality and subtlety. The film's grip on my investment loosened to the point of me feeling underwhelmed, but just a little more than barely, for even the aesthetic value of the film has its commendable attributes.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's because this film is so blasted dated or because this film was perhaps so blasted cheap, but Armand Thirard's black-and-white cinematography isn't particularly pretty, and yet, that kind of adds to the film, because if there is a sense of bleakness within this often superficial leader, it is found within a gritty visual style which immerses you into gritty, well-selected locations. There isn't much technical value here, at least in retrospect, but it is very much so present, and it is pretty immersive when realized, bringing more life to the grit of this drama than plenty of aspects to the telling of a promising story. On the surface, this film's subject matter seems to simply deal with a quartet of European men on a grimy adventure to douse an oil fire and pick up money to help them overcome their respective woes, and when you get deeper into this narrative, even as an idea, it's hard to ignore themes regarding comradery and self-preservation in the midst of a dangerous journey which keep up an immediate degree of intrigue, no matter how much limp storytelling limits it. Really, I suppose you can blame most of the bloatings and superficialities on Henri-Georges Clouzot's and Jérome Geronimi's script, for although Clouzot's direction gets a little flimsy in tone, whether it be handling it unevenly, or simply abandoning it to a dull point, it isn't afraid to get thoughtful, and upon finding material to draw upon with his meditations without getting too uneven, he bites. There is a fair bit of tension sustained here and there throughout the film, as well as plenty of gracefully subtle moments, and in between those heights in engagement value is enough nuance and immersion value that the final product flirts with a rewarding state as a meditative character study that wouldn't be so endearing if the performances weren't so much more spirited than the storytelling is in a lot of ways. The cast's material kicks in slowly, but surely, but once it gets here, after every performer has gotten you invested through individual charisma and collective chemistry, dramatic heights that were arguably above the acting standards for thrillers of this time and nature anchor what resonance there is in this drama. Yes, resonance finds itself seriously limited by questionable pacing and tone which are both overwrought and paper-thin, but when it's all said and done, with patience, you'd be pressed to not get invested enough to find a final product that at least comes to the brink of out-and-out rewarding.\r\n\r\nWhen the journey is done, exhaustingly overdrawn, somewhat disjointed, and formulaic plot structuring, and a tone which is either uneven or cold, yet frequently superficial in its bite, secure the final product as rather underwhelming, but not so underwhelming that immersively gritty cinematography and locations, intriguing subject matter, biting direction, and solid performances aren't able to make Henri-Georges Clouzot's \"The Wages of Fear\" (Ah, that title is so awesome!) a decent and often gripping thriller, even though it isn't consistently thrilling.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

I didn't believe most of it for a moment. If this is any indication of what Clouzot's other work is like, I will pass. I still can't figure out certain actions and choices made by certain characters. Worse, I fail to understand the choices made by the director/writer. And the existentialism was in your face at the end. This was not a subtle film. And Clouzot is NOT the French Hitchcock or ANY Hitchcock. This is just not a great film at all. And the raving critics destroyed it by their absurd overrating. And the suspense was not non-stop. It was stop and go, with the first half of the film having ZERO suspense. Never again will I believe critics writing about such films. There is a reason most people have not heard of this film.

She serves no purpose whatsoever, other than to have a reason to have his wife or relative in the film.",

With no money to return home, they accept a job transporting a cargo of nitroglycerin across a trecherous mountain route where hazards impede their progress at every turn, with some genuine, nail-biting moments of tension.\nDirector Henri-Georges Clouzet has often been referred to as the French Alfred Hitchcock.

That, and this film is often considered to be one of, if not the greatest suspense thrillers of all time.\n\nSo yeah, I finally saw it, and, you know what, it is quite good. Unfortunately I didn't find it to be quite the masterpiece it's reputed to be, but yeah, when this film hits the mark, it really hits it quite well and hard.\n\nThe plot follows four desperate foreigners in an impoverished Latin American  country who are picked by The Southern Oil Company (basically the king of kings in the area) to drive two trucks loaded down with nitroglycerin across some of the world's most treacherous terrain to help put out a raging oil fie on the other side of the country. The men know it's essentially a suicide mission, but hey, the pay is $2,000 per man, and, they are desperate, and it would add excitement to their dismal lives, so why not do it?\n\nAnd that is the key to this film: it's a solid study in cynicism, greed, imperialism, desperation, and tension. This two and a half hour romp spends the first half slowly building up the characters and their situations while the second half (the best part), focuses on the gripping and nail biting expedition.\n\nI do think that, even though slow burning films can be good, the first half is too slow and drawn out, and get fairly tedious at times. It's not a total bore, but, compared to the second half, it's pretty uneven, And, while I did love the suspense and tension of the trek, I don't think it's quite as nerve racking as I was led to believe. Maybe that's because I was worn out from getting through the exposition.\n\nEven though the exposition could be tighter, these are some great characters, and the dynamics between them are pretty well done. It kinda reminded me of Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and even The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and, while I like those films more, the comparisons are definitely a compliment.\n\nI must say too that the film is pretty ballsy with how cynical, gritty, and uncompromising it is, especially for the time. Some charged it with being Anti-AMerican, but that's not totally right, This film isn't exclusive with its condemnations- it's an equal opportunity kind of affair.\n\nBesides the great set up, good characters, and great acting, I loved the subtext, and especially the cinematography and editing. The ending, too, is probably one of the darkest and bleakest I've seen in a while.\n\nIf you want a movie that is tense, gritty, and intelligent, definitely check this out, even if it is flawed and overrated.",

            "content": "Sans équivoque, l'ancêtre du film d'action anti-hollywoodien. Enfin, tout dépendant de la version visionnée. Parce qu'il ne faut pas oublier qu'on est alors en 1953, coincés dans une ère réformiste qui peine encore à se relever de la tragédie de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. La censure devient alors partie intégrante de l'art et le cinéma est loin d'y échapper, quand bien même il s'agirait de la cinématographique française. C'est donc dans cette optique d'idée qu'une version fut relâchée avec une fin alternative, très loin de traduire l'essence même du film qui, tout compte fait, se termine d'une manière abrupte et surprenante, tout juste alors de quoi redéfinir les standards de l'originalité et d'avant-garde en manière de film populaire.\n\nDeux Français, un Allemand et un Italien. Quatre hommes dans une ville pauvre de l'Amérique du Sud là où le travail est loin de pleuvoir. Et les quatre, de leur plein gré, s'embarquent dans une mission suicide pour transporter de la nitroglycérine à profusion sur une centaine de kilomètres dans le terrain cahoteux de la jungle sauvage. N'étant moi-même pas un fervent amateur du genre, certains passages ne m'ont pas du tout accroché, mais il faut spécifier que les dialogues sont tout de même très bien écrits et que c'est là un autre film typique dont la fin en vaut amplement la chandelle, tragique et inattendue. Et puis, je ne sais pas si c'est un reproche ou une qualité, mais le film pourrait se qualifier de réalisation multi-linguistique, en ce sens où, majoritairement dans le premier quart, les dialogues basculent entre le français, l'anglais et l'espagnol (surtout ce dernier), sans qu'il y ait le moindre sous-titre pour nous accompagner dans notre écoute. Certes, cela témoigne d'une belle ouverture d'esprit et d'un certain sentiment de fraternité interculturelle, mais à certains moments, même si je me laissais bercer par l'exotisme d'une langue que je ne connaissais pas, mon incompréhension en est peut-être venue à nuire à la qualité de mon écoute.\n\nSomme toute, Clouzot élève le squelette de ce qui deviendra plus tard l'un des schémas traditionnels du film d'action anti-hollywoodien.",

The Wages of Fear was a film just like that. It was cut up by American distributors upon its initial release stateside, but is now fully restored and available for all of our viewing pleasure. Even if you consider yourself a pretty deep film historian or just an avid movie watcher who can handle the suspense without getting caught up in it, I guarantee you that The Wages of Fear will have you holding your breath and glued to the screen. You couldn't ask for a more inviting audience participation premise than watching four men driving trucks full of explosive nitroglycerin over rocky terrain in Central America. Despite that premise, the focus is also strongly held on the characters before the premise of the film takes place, which is well into its second act. That's a very brave move screenplay-wise because you run the risk of boring your audience. Thankfully the characters are so rich with, well, character, that you want to know just as much about them, which of course leads to the tension once they get in gear (pun intended). My only gripe with the film (and it's a minor gripe) is that the ending felt anti-climactic. It felt right, but for me the film was over once the characters' journey had ended both figuratively and physically. The film was remade by William Friedkin in 1977 under the title of Sorcerer, and while both are considered to be masterpieces in their own right, Clouzot's original is the film that is most championed as being both an answer to Hitchcock and a superbly well-made film.",
