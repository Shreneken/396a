    "summary": "One night in 1944 in a German POW camp housing American airmen, two prisoners try to escape the compound and are quickly discovered and shot dead. Among the remaining men, suspicion grows that one of their own is a spy for the Germans. All eyes fall on Sgt. Sefton (William Holden) who everybody knows frequently makes exchanges with German guards for small luxuries. To protect himself from a mob of his enraged fellow inmates, Sgt. Sefton resolves to find the true traitor within their midst.",

            "content": "\"If I ever run into any of you bums on the street corner, let's just pretend we've never met before.\"\n\nWilliam Holden stars as cigar-gnashing 'general store' operator J.J. Sefton, whose crude attitude and stiff prices make him persona non grata in his barracks. When everyone in the bunks suspects a rat is hiding among them, leaking information about escaping POWs and clandestine equipment, the eyes naturally turn to Sefton; to stop good men from going to their deaths (or perhaps to prevent more bruises from appearing on his face), Sefton takes it upon himself to find the real spy among them. An early war thriller with elements of black comedy, Stalag 17 is somewhere between The Great Escape and M*A*S*H, and spends even more time building up the camaraderie between its characters than it does developing the main plot, with surprisingly ample opportunity for director Billy Wilder to use the same crossdressing humor that he would refine in Some Like it Hot a few years later. But despite the mixing of war film and comedy, Stalag 17 never feels jagged, as he constantly uses levity to allow his prisoners a brief escape from their dark reality. As a result, it's funny and exciting without being disrespectful to what was still a fresh memory for many veterans. \n\nAnother great one from one of the best midcentury American directors. Wonder if Robert Strauss ever got his date with Betty Grable. (4/5)",

Watching the chubby German guard get all giddy while playing volleyball was hilarious. Animal and Harry are the power duo. Like Abbott and Costello. They're really funny. \n\nQuite an entrepreneur this Sefton guy was. Running little horse races with mice, opening up his own distillery and even letting the boys have a little peep show so they could check out the women on the other side. One of the more interesting things in the movie that kept me attentive was wondering who it was that was giving information to the Krauts. \n\nThat scene with all the boys making fun of Hitler was priceless. I'm glad that they we're making films that parodied Hitler back then. Interesting how the Commandant puts his boots on for the call to his chief just so his chief knows that he's still in full uniform. That was a nice little piece of detail. Holy shit! I was not expecting the informant to be who it ended up being. That was some brilliant casting for that role. You would have never expected it to be him since he seems to be part of the boys and he kind keeps to himself. But thinking back, his restraint on talking a lot makes more sense now. The informer plays the game really nicely, has a great poker face. Terrific ending. \n\nLike I've said with every Billy Wilder movie - his way of taking a serious topic and making it lighthearted and funny is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. Charming to a fault, you really get to see just how Wilder's view on the world and life is like. Clever and witty like all of Wilder's movies but this one is definitely special to me. \n\nI definitely have to own this one. It was that good.",

William Holden only took the Sefton role under orders from the studio, and did not feel comfortable accepting the Oscar for the part. And there's no question the award was an apology for SUNSET BLVD. The script gives depth to even minor characters, right down to Tommy Cook's mailman, while Franz Waxman's uncredited score is a clinic on minimalism.

The different personalities of the POWs makes for some good chuckles when that\u0092s what they\u0092re attempting. However, there are other times when the mood of the film transitions and things get more serious. This is a German POW camp during WWII, so it makes sense that there would be some heavy stuff going on. The movie created a fairly good mystery about who was the snitch, because we could safely assume as an audience that William Holden wasn\u0092t really the guilty party. I\u0092m still not decided on whether the shifts in tone always work, but it never felt awkward so I just went with it.\n\nThe choice to use a voiceover was not a smart one for a number of reasons. For one, it was a pretty lazy way to set up the story. Also, Cookie wasn\u0092t a significant character and I kept wondering why they chose him as the person presenting this story. Finally, there just wasn\u0092t enough voiceover included. If you\u0092re going to go this route for setting up your story, then there should be more moments where the voice shows up, to transition from one set piece to the next. It\u0092s just one nitpick I had with the movie, there were a few other flaws but I don\u0092t want to seem like I\u0092m trashing this enjoyable film. I had a good time watching Stalag 17. It has some good actors, and they clearly are having an enjoyable time making the movie, which translates into a good time for me too.",

A beautifully performed and singularly contained character dramedy that is as timeless as it is old-fashioned.",

Stalag 17 explores the life of these prisoners, showing us their physical and emotional problems, which I felt is the most interesting aspect of the film, but sadly the impact of it was dampened by the lightness of Wilder's direction. These are stories and feelings that I personally feel should be handled with a bit more solemnity in order for it to be emotionally impacting. The comedy in this film was too strong for my tastes, as it overwhelmed the film's story and characters; though I did thoroughly enjoyed the Betty Grable gags. Even the film's antagonists, the Germans, don't pose a certain sense of danger; I understand that they aren't the film's primary villain but shouldn't I feel a sense of danger if they do get caught? The prisoners converse with the German guards like as if they were buddies. At least Wilder was able to create the danger in the film's mystery, the informant, not knowing who it actually is and anything they say in the barracks may be leaked out. Though I couldn't let myself get in deep with this film, I was superficially entertained throughout this film, not one moment did I feel like it was getting dull. The film's large moments are the ones that truly shined in this film, particularly the film's end, possessing this sense of excitement and suspense that I haven't seen from Wilder before. Stalag 17 also features a great protagonist, J.J. Sefton, who is an opportunist, doing whatever he can to make his stay in the barracks more comfortable and catered to his liking, equality and brotherhood are at the back of his mind; it is by the end of the film that you would debate in your mind whether or not his intentions were truly virtuous.

The television program had too many similarities in character and plot to be coincidental, and when Don and Ed sued the network they won a huge award.\"\r\n\r\n3     In spite of its three Emmy nominations, TV Guide in 2002 named Hogan's Heroes the fifth worst TV show of all time (p 180, Running Press, Philadelphia, 2007).\r\n\r\n4   Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

Like the previous Wilder film ('Sunset Boulevard') Holden isn't playing a likeable character but the unknown traitor in the hut is the real villain and therefore you still end up rooting for him. Comparing this to 'The Great Escape' or even 'Kwai' shows the difference in attitude between the British and Americans. You get a feeling in 'Escape' that all the British soldiers will stay friends for life. In 'Stalag' you get the feeling that all the Americans hate each others guts!

William Holden, Peter Graves, Harvey Lembeck, Robert Strauss, Don Taylor, and Neville Brand are all brilliant. Lembeck and Strauss bring a lot of humour that both lightens and underlines the drama and tension. Wilder casts fellow director Otto Preminger in an acting role as the Camp Commandant. It's the story of a group of American prisoners in Stalag 17 as they come to realise that one of their number is an informant. Everyone suspects Sefton (William Holden) because he has a lot of sweet deals with the camp commanders, wheeling and dealing to get privileges. The tension builds around whether he really is the informant and if not then who it is. Once you find out who it is, the tension shifts to what Sefton will do and how he can expose the informant or whether the informant will continue to get away with reporting his information to the Nazis. Interesting to compare this to the tv series \"Hogan's Heroes\" which was set around a group of allied prisoners in Stalag 13, and which also featured a somewhat bumbling German Sergeant named Schultz. (Everyone involved in \"Hogan's Heroes\" has always denied that there was any direct influence between the film and the sitcom). Stalag 17 is a brilliant film that shifts from humour to tension and drama and the finale is a little edge of the seat.",

It's a good, tight ensemble and it's a different kind of POW film, instead of being dark and gloomy, it's engaging, entertaining and exciting. Set in Stalag 17, somewhere near the Danube River, the camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian females and in the American compound, 640 Sergeants. In Barracks Four, there is J.J. Sefton (William Holden), Harry Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck), Stanislas \"Animal\" Kasava (Robert Strauss), Joey (Robinson Stone) and Price (Peter Graves). Morale in Barracks Four is down after Manfredi (Michael Moore) and Johnson (Peter Baldwin) were shot dead trying to escape. The camp is ruled with an iron yet fair fist by Colonel Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger). After Barracks Four are punished, suspicion grows amongst the men that one of them is working for the Nazi's. This is a clever and thrilling film, and it's one of the best POW films ever made, with good, tight direction and writing by Wilder, who gets the best from his cast, (Holden won an Oscar for this), and it's got moments of inspired comedic dialogue through the drama of surviving in the camp.",

The Nazis aren't really portrayed as villians here, merely as rivals on the other side of a contest, and Wilder innovatively uses deft camera setups and a quick breathless pace to dispense of the weight of adapting a play to the screen.  The end result is fun and entertaining, and has to be viewed with an iota of sympathy, but Otto Preminger as a German commander and the film's entertaining payoff are well worth the effort.

The similarities are astounding - from a tubby guard named Schultz to the \"no escape\" record of the Kommandant to the fraternizing and trading between prisoners and Germans. It was humorously incredible!\n\nBut the movie was as well, standing on its own. The opening scene with the overview of the huge prison camp really let us know what we were in for. I loved that they made a movie out of this concept. War and other dark subjects are frequently expounded and explained on film; the plight, struggles, hope, and humor of prisoners of war should get their share of attention from a civilian world that so often is ignorant of these military realities. A little introduction to this world can easily lead to more research, greater appreciation, and perhaps even a lifelong study (as what happened with me for my WWII appreciation, courtesy Hogan's Heroes).\n\nBut on with the movie - I was really surprised by the rich combination of drama and humor, laughter and poignancy, and of the brief character studies of many of the occupants of Barracks 4. Robert Strauss (as \"Animal\") and Harvey Lembeck (as Shapiro) really stole the show; their characters and acting really shine. The plot picks up about halfway through the film and doesn't let up from there. There are many memorable scenes (getting to the Russian women), laugh-out-loud moments (the reading of Mein Kamph), and heart-clutching moments (the lieutenant's interrogation).\n\nThe Collector Edition's accompanying mini-documentary on the real POWs of Stalag 17 puts the film in perspective and really made me appreciate what they went through.\n\nOverall, a fantastic movie - rich and richly acted.",

I knew beforehand that it was directed by Billy Wilder but for some reason, likely as I was aware William Holden won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sefton in it, I was expecting a rather grim, more seriously-played war film. What I got was a very funny comedy that just so happens to be set in a German POW camp. The duo of 'Animal' and Shapiro provide a lot of the laughs, and were seemingly granted as much screentime or thereabouts as Holden himself. This equality amongst those cast in Stalag 17, combined with the fact that the lead character of Sefton often comes across as selfish and cynical, shows just what a brave director Wilder was, and helps give the film an 'all in this together' type spirit - vital to a POW camp - that some 'star vehicles' would not be able to achieve. There is tension and excitement involved in the plot in addition to the plentiful humour, and it all works together really well. A genuine classic.",

Not alive, anyway.\"\n Absorbing drama about American POWs in a German World War II camp. Apparently, someone amongst the prisoners is a traitor, but who? Fascinating assortment of characters exhibit real camaraderie. Although there is an expected gravity underlying the proceedings, never before has a POW camp been enlivened by so much humor. Even legendary film director Otto Preminger as the evil camp commander, appears humorously benevolent. In the hands of a lesser director, the mix of comedy and drama would be jarring, but writer-director Billy Wilder flawlessly adapts the 1951 Broadway play with a discerning eye. Actor William Holden is also brilliant as the cynical and self centered prisoner, J.J. Sefton, ostracized for the preferential treatment he receives from the enemy. It's a brilliant achievement that earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. His portrayal anchors a film already overflowing with brilliant performances. Another great escape was found.",

            "content": "Perfectly balanced World War II film(or a POW film to be more specific), with the elements of comedy and drama contrasting and merging at the same time to great effect. On one hand, the whole humorous tone of the film was incredibly, almost single-handedly carried by the characters of Shapiro and Animal(Harvey Lembeck and Robert Strauss, respectively). While the complex tone of human spirit and survival against all odds flawlessly embodied by William Holden(in an Oscar-winning performance) as J.J. Sefton on the other. In the expansive magnitude of films such as those of the war genre, it's very rare for a picture of this kind to play with the \"whodunit\" plot device. But the screenplay(based on a theatrical play) has brought the film into its revelatory climax without being very obvious of what(or who)it is pertaining to. Besides its thrilling suspense and trivial comedy contained throughout as it heads into a surprise ending, \"Stalag 17\" also shows the side of soldiers unblemished even by captivity; that of their extreme devotion of preserving a much-admired \"war hero\"(Lt. Dunbar) from certain death. But once they looked at J.J. Sefton with disdain and brow-raising judgments, both to his stance, his cigarette-trading antics, and their hunch of him being a \"stoolie\", they never were aware that they're looking at yet another hero. He conforms with his captors, he's a loner in their ranks, but his ultimate gallantry's what really counted.",
