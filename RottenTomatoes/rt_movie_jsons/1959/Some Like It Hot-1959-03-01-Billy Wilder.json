    "summary": "After witnessing a Mafia murder, slick saxophone player Joe (Tony Curtis) and his long-suffering buddy, Jerry (Jack Lemmon), improvise a quick plan to escape from Chicago with their lives. Disguising themselves as women, they join an all-female jazz band and hop a train bound for sunny Florida. While Joe pretends to be a millionaire to win the band's sexy singer, Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), Jerry finds himself pursued by a real millionaire (Joe E. Brown) as things heat up and the mobsters close in.",

A lot of this film is very good, my main problem is the way in which the two genders and their relationship with one another are portrayed. Monroe is portrayed aswell... not very bright, good looking but easy to take advantage of while the men only seem to want women for their looks and are willing to do anything to get them. Monroe on the other hand wants a \"Rich man that owns a yacht and has glasses....\". They seem to have no sense of morality. Its pretty sickening to be honest. That being said a lot of the humor is incredibly good, and very much ahead of its times. I think in comedy sometimes you \"have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette\". That being said I think the sociopathic, immoral nature of both men and women in this film is a bit much.",

Interspersed within the comic highjinks and subversive connotations are moments of poignancy and tenderness which elevate straightforward screwball material to a status approaching truly robust comedy. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon create many moments of hilarity through their brilliantly individualized interpretations of female mannerisms, and the daft yet undeniably sincere Marylin Monroe supplies the lynch-pin that binds the dynamic together. Despite an unnecessary subplot involving forgettable mafia antics which cause the film to drag a little bit in the final quarter, \"Some Like it Hot\" lives up to the promise of its screwball premise and stellar cast through a synthesis of charm and humor that touches the heart while tickling the funny bone.",

The film is unevenly paced in places, and some scenes, especially the one with Curtis and Monroe on the yacht together, go on for way too long. It's a film that, while undoubtably hilarious, is in need of editing down, with about 20 minutes that could easily be lost. But with that said, I can see why its still popular over 50 years after its release. Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe all have fantastic chemistry with each other, and the ease with which they play off each other is what usually makes the film shine. For me, Jack Lemmon's performance is the one that stands out the most, since a man of his energy and charisma is nigh impossible to overshadow, and he gives it his all in every scene he's in. There are other comedies I laughed at more, and others I have greater appreciation for, but I can safely say that Some Like It Hot is a movie that every earnest film buff absolutely needs to see, whether for its crazy antics, its laugh out loud jokes or the way it gleefully stomped all over the uptight standards of its day.",

I have always been a huge Jack Lemmon fan but am way more familiar with his work from my lifetime so really appreciate seeing him so young and could recognize many mannerisms and affects that were still visible in his performances 40 years later.

Then I saw it, and I must say it is probably the funniest, most imaginative and sharp comedy I have seen, even surpassing Dr. Strangelove and Tootsie on the AFI 100 comedies list (#1), The plot concerns a down on their luck duo of musicians, Joe and Jerry (impeccably played with wit and soul by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) who cannot seem to find a steady job at an orchestra, The last straw breaks when they witness a horrible massacre. Now, fugitives and in need of money, decide to dress up as women and join a female only orchestra. Things from this point just go even more downhill for our dynamic duo. They make friends with the lead singer of the orchestra, a drop dead gorgeous Mairilyn Monroe, and have to perform at a hotel where the ones responsible for the massacre have gone and are looking for Joe and Jerry. The whole absurdly comical premise is completed with a desperate Curtis trying to seduce Monroe by pretending to be a wealthy enterpreneur and a disguised Lemmon trying to deal with a sweet, gullible and extremely funny businessman Joe Brown(Well, nobody's perfect.). Billy Wilder, who was really productive that period (he went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and Director for The Apartment, another fine satire) manages to take full advantage of the preposterous and controversial for its time screenplay and premise, and with amazing leads, great music and just right pacing and timing he creates what could possibly be the greatest comedy film of the 20st century.

I hadn't seen this in many years; I'd forgotten just how good it is—the quick timing, the reprises of George Raft and Pat O'Brian, the deft camerawork, a slim cast who lift many times their own weight. Great film: memorable; remarkable in its casting, performances and production; one to be emulated but never repeated; a true classic.",

The actors are superb across the board, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon giving two of the funniest performances ever as two musicians disguising themselves as girls to escape the mob, while Marilyn Monroe has never been sexier or more appealing.  The scene-stealer, though, is Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, who somehow finds himself in love with a Jack Lemmon in drag, resulting in some of the funniest moments of the movie.  Behind the camera, Wilder crafts a screwball comedy like no other that has only gotten better with age.  Even the notion of men dressing in drag for comedy still works, as its done as a genuine disguise and not trying to make fun of women (only Curtis & Lemmon are the butt of the jokes her).  In fact, based on the film's classic film line, one could argue this is the first major film with a gay romance.  All in all, one of the funniest movies era.",

            "content": "A deliriously funny comedy bordering on the absurd.\n\nBilly Wilder's farcical comedy Some Like It Hot (1959) is a delightful breeze of wit and good times. Wilder's direction is sleek and fast paced. He always focuses on the character exchanges in order to keep you grounded by their dramatic emotions during all the silly antics. The scenarios are clever setups for ludicrous punchlines. I think Wilder knew exactly how to bring out the best in each actor.\n\nTony Curtis is excellent dressing up in drag as he plays it with a subtle grace. His lady persona is fun to watch as he grapples with loving Marilyn Monroe and staying in character. Curtis also pulls off a hilarious Cary Grant impression when he pretends to be a billionaire. Curtis gives a funny performance as a woman that is nuanced enough where you might believe him, an outrageous delivery with his Cary Grant impersonation as a rich bachelor, and an endearing role as a saxophonist down on his luck with desires to seduce Marilyn Monroe. You like Curtis because his character knows he's no good, so he tries to be honest, but it all works out in the end.\n\nThen, there's Jack Lemmon. The always funny comedic actor is forced into his dress and cannot resist the ladies. Ironically, his is the character that must woo the man for his fortune and favors, while Curtis gets to make out with Marilyn Monroe. Lemmon's comedic chemistry and timing alongside Tony Curtis is wonderful. They play well off each other and find the humor in each increasingly ridiculous situation. Lemmon's character is over the top and never believable as a woman, but that is really where the laughter comes from with him.\n\nNotably, Marilyn Monroe is gorgeous, voluptuous, and alluring. But Monroe is so memorable in Some Like It Hot, not because of her near nude outfits or tantalizing figure, but also because she comes across as so sweet and genuine. Monroe makes her \"Sugar\" character a likable lady trying to find love after a string of bad romances. You want her to be happy and she feels so devastating in the dramatic moments with Tony Curtis. Her singing voice is lovely and fun to get lost in as she was a born performer. I only would criticize the fact that she's clearly not playing her ukulele, but that's part of the joke at times.\n\nIn short, Some Like It Hot is a pleasant watch as the writing is so sharp and the direction is so brisk. Tony Curtis is cool and hilarious. Jack Lemmon is insanely funny. Lastly, Marilyn Monroe is a lovely dream of easy personality and sultry looks. Some Like It Hot is just sublime comedy in masterful cinematic technique.",
