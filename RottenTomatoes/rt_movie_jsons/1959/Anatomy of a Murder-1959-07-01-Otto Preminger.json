    "summary": "Semi-retired Michigan lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) takes the case of Army Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara), who murdered a local innkeeper after his wife (Lee Remick) claimed that he raped her. Over the course of an extensive trial, Biegler parries with District Attorney Lodwick (Brooks West) and out-of-town prosecutor Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) to set his client free, but his case rests on the victim's mysterious business partner (Kathryn Grant), who's hiding a dark secret.",

            "content": "There are some truly great courtroom dramas (\"Witness for the Prosecution\" \"The Verdict\" \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"), but I would argue that Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of the Murder\" is the best cinematic courtroom drama of all time. Jimmy Stewart plays a lawyer in a sleepy resort community in the upper peninsula of Michigan who's hired to defend serviceman Fredrick Manion (Ben Gazarra in his only second film appearance) for gunning down a local bar owner who he believes raped his wife, Laura (Lee Remick in only her fourth film appearance). There's no mystery who did the murder, but the case hinges on whether Gazarra was in his right mind at the time or was in the grips of an \"irresistible impulse\" at the time of the murder. \"Anatomy\" features an amazing cast of young actors. Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, and Eve Arden are veteran Hollywood actors of the group, and besides Gazarra and Remick you also have a young George C. Scott in his second film role and also early roles for Kathryn Grant, Orson Bean, and Murray Hamilton. Perhaps the most interesting casting is of Joseph N. Welch as the trial judge, who's best know as the real-life lead counsel for the Army in the Army-McCarthy hearings where he uttered the famous line \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\" This was Welch's first and only acting role, but he's terrific. The folks behind the camera are just as impressive. Produced and directed by Hollywood veteran Otto Preminger (\"Man with the Golden Arm\" \"Advise & Consent\" \"Laura\"), Saul Bass (\"Vertigo,\"Ocean's 11\" and \"Goodfellas\") made an ultra cool title sequence, how can you not love the knockout jazz score by Duke Ellington. Ellington even makes a cameo as \"Pie-Eye\" during a dancehall scene. There's a lot that sets \"Anatomy\" apart from other courtroom dramas. I'm no lawyer, but I've read multiple times how this film is one of the more accurate representations of courtroom proceedings, taking it's time to go through pre-trial research, interviews, and investigations, jury selection, and getting into the minutia of nitpicking objections or manipulating juries throughout the trial. It takes its time to show the court proceedings from start to finish and is almost the entirety of the film. That immersiveness is only part of what makes this film such a classic. The verbal sparing between Stewart, who plays himself up as a simple country lawyer to the jury (when he's anything but), tying fishing lures throughout the trial, setting himself up as the little guy going up against big city prosecutors, the most formidable of which is the great George C. Scott. Their back and forth are simply magic to watch. These courtroom scenes make it the kind of film where if your'e flipping channels and happen upon it, there's no way you can turn it off. And the verbal sparing is not limited to the courtroom. The dialogue between characters outside the courtroom is just as riveting, which gets at what the film is really about, how people endlessly play games with one another. There's always something beneath the surface, or an agenda, or even outright lies in just about every interaction. Sometimes it's just playing around with one another, like when Stewart plays coy about what's he has in a brown bag (it's booze) with a colleague, or Remick flirting with Steward in order manipulate him, or the more consequential moments whether Gazarra was gripped by an irresistible impulse or if he was committing pre-meditated murder. This cynical theme of \"don't trust what anyone says or does at face value\" is given emphasis when Stewart's Paul Biegler states, \"As a lawyer, I've had to learn that people aren't just good or just bad. People are many things.\" This is a must see film that everyone should watch at least once.",

The script is just a beautiful, ambiguous, masterpiece that leaves the audience torn, dumbfounded yet deeply understanding of the character, the situation at hand and the law as practiced in it.

            "content": "\"How can a jury disregard what they've already heard?\"\n\"They can't, Lieutenant. They can't.\"\n\nThis movie might unironically hold the record for the number of the mentions of the word 'panties' in its script. \"Simple country lawyer\" Jimmy Stewart (always wondered where that phrase actually came from) and city suit George C. Scott clash in an early courtroom drama that combined much of what would come to be standard practice in not only legal films but their television counterparts - unsure circumstances, a range of characters with checkered or mysterious pasts, an investigation in the field, and a hotly contested legal battle. \n\nThe film is almost split in half, between the focus on the crime itself as its own little thriller, and the dramatic proclamations of the courtroom. Hard to deny that the film is solidly put together and sustains itself reasonably well through solid performances and just enough breadcrumbs to prevent the audience from nodding off, but it's pretty darn protracted at 2 hours and 40 minutes, and reflecting back relatively little is actually much of a revelation throughout the case. \n\nFortunately, Preminger takes more of a cynical look at the legal system than a Jimmy Stewart character would have if he were back to working with Frank Capra; the similarities between the practices of Stewart's supposedly noble Biegler and Scott's stuffy prosecutor Dancer are notable and could easily be interpreted as an indictment of the legal profession as a whole. There is also some great, simple characterization at play that can easily go unnoticed, as in the case of Brooks West's DA Lodwick; \"Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print\". Immediate establishment as obsessed with the superficial and the appearance of intelligence and taste, good stuff.\n\nFunny to have Duke Ellington in a film in 1959 (after he had already been famous for decades), a film that literally calls out a character's unusual love of jazz, and not even give him a credit.

He's the cinema's patron saint of the average man who assures us - and shows us - that every life is something more than we know.\n\nHere he is a less-than-successful attorney who has to defend a very young and beautiful Ben Gazzara, who murdered a man that his wife, Lee Remick, says raped her. Half investigation and half courtroom drama (with solid support from Eve Arden and Arthur O'Connell), the film was pretty racy for its time and still packs a solid punch of a finale.",

            "content": "The most riveting courtroom drama ever directed for the screen.\n\nOtto Preminger's massive courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder (1959) features a full murder trial carried out with meticulous detail and rigorous procedural accuracy. Preminger takes care with his stunningly focused direction. No scene is unnecessary, despite the heavy run-time, as Preminger ensures you are engaged and fascinated by every line, fact, witness, reveal, and outcome. Anatomy of a Murder is taught by law professors for a reason as it is entertaining, realistic, responsible, and thoughtful. You can honestly teach law through each encounter and cross-examination in Anatomy of a Murder it is that good.\n\nI have to say that the two leading performances from James Stewart and George C. Scott are riveting to the end. You get to witness and enjoy arguably the two greatest character actors ever go head to head as opposing lawyers on the defense and prosecution, respectively. James Stewart is funny and likable with a sly manipulation of the facts to a fresh perspective against each testimony. Stewart is ever present in Anatomy of a Murder as we see and understand his thought process and the way in which he builds his case slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, George C. Scott appears halfway through the film and steals many scenes. Scott's relentless line of questioning breaks down his witnesses to admit or reveal facts again and again. Whereas James Stewart finds intrigue in outbursts and performance, Scott thrives in subtle observation and then ceaseless logical tying together of ideas. It's a shame one of them had to lose this cinematic case, but they both fight hard for it. Stewart's slow burn ends up frying his methodical opponent with great flair. I love both James Stewart and George C. Scott's acting within Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nThe cinematography and editing are so interesting. Most of Anatomy of a Murder consists of mid shots of the torso on up to get a feel for the scene. We get a few choice close-ups that wring every ounce of suspense from a character's situation. Sam Leavitt's cinematography is breathtaking with smooth panning shots down roads, through crowds, and across the courtroom. You never see a character that you are not supposed to focus in on in a stylistic decision that I find quite impressive. Likewise, Louis R. Loeffler brings a suddenness to his editing that keeps Anatomy of a Murder moving. The steady pace holds you in suspense, while keeps the audience guessing. Anatomy of a Murder's cinematography and editing are simply top notch.\n\nDuke Ellington's jazz score is mesmerizing and adds a dreamy layer on top of Anatomy of a Murder. The subtle piano passages are as enthralling as the louder horns and lively jazz drumming. The score is iconic and influential, but really contributes a mysterious atmosphere to the entirety of Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nI must mention the adorable dog of Lee Remick's character Laura Manion. This little dog captures your heart with neat tricks and cute faces. I will always remember this sweet dog that brings a lighter mood to darker scenes within Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nLee Remick herself is outstanding as the flirtatious and misguiding Laura Manion. Remick kills with a glance and reveals everything with a look or a word. Her use of seductive and hurt body language alike is very impressive for a young actress. Remick is phenomenal in Anatomy of a Murder just like she is as captivating in The Omen and Thief.\n\nFurthermore, Anatomy of a Murder has a series of stellar supporting roles filled by intriguing characters. Ben Gazzara's fierce army lieutenant is questionable from the beginning and only gets more intense as the film progresses. Arthur O'Connell and Eve Arden are both hilarious and charming as James Stewart's legal aids. Kathryn Grant gives a sweet and mysterious performance that ends up being the final nail in the case's coffin.\n\nLastly, I adored the real lawyer Joseph N. Welch's performance as the amiable judge. His performance rings true with a delightful smile and easy going attitude that makes him a unique film judge. His only anger and frustration comes from Stewart and Scott sending jabs each other's way. He makes Anatomy of a Murder feel all the more genuine for having him included in its already impressive cast.\n\nOverall, Anatomy of a Murder is a beautifully directed film that is well written by Wendell Mayes as based off of Robert Travers' novel Anatomy of a Murder. You will be dazzled by the lead actors, James Stewart and George C. Scott, with their accurate and meticulous courtroom analysis. Anatomy of a Murder will always be worth watching for a frighteningly detailed trial case procedure on screen, but is simultaneously a masterfully directed film from Otto Preminger. Give it a go if you've got some time.",

            "content": "Stewart loses the case and we as the viewers lost in the case, Preminger trails the taste of success far before the climax hits.\n\nAnatomy Of A Murder\n\nPreminger has done his homework. He is not a pro, just as James Stewart claims himself to be, but a smart cookie like him in the room, could manipulate even the experts of the expensive city lawyers. Armed with such a hefty content embedded by the infamous lawyer-turned-novelist John D. Voelker, this is one of those rare events, where the execution by the director, Otto Preminger, still has managed to surpass the kinetic energy of the film. The entire courtroom seems to be chasing for something it doesn't care for and even after it might get it, Preminger, the trickster, isn't going to reveal the secrets, for his target was never to win the game, but play it, fairly.\n\nWatch him swoosh in camera with a smoothness that is derived more from the flamboyant choreography that stages these characters like chess pieces. And these moments remains to be my favourite. When the lawyers switch in their position or come across a new revelation or cast another perspective in their case, the way they gaze each other as they cross or block or overpower each other.\n\nThis dance is so charming and elegant, that for a brief period, I got lost into their chemistry, forgetting what this fuss was all about. Another major asset is the levity in their narration. The characters never tries hard to lighten the mood, it is just that their nature impacts the humor as a by product- hey, that is the best kind of comedy you can get in a drama like such. James Stewart has a lot in common with the audience. Struggling and shooting in dark aiming to score the points, his confidence in these dodgy testimonies is both absurd and dutiful, he calls it Anatomy Of A Murder, we, the courtroom, the case.",

            "content": "Warning, this review contains spoilers...\n\nFantastic acting, excellent shots on location in Michigan, entertaining courtroom scenes, but a flawed script, and a little overrated.  The premise is simple.  A former prosecutor (Jimmy Stewart) is convinced to come out of retirement to defend a man (Ben Gazzara) accused of murder.  There really isn't any doubt he's done it, since he's confessed.  After some encouragement from Stewart, his plea is not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, that he simply 'lost it' after finding out that his wife (Lee Remick) was raped, and went out and killed the guy.\n\nStewart turns in an outstanding performance, effortlessly combining intelligence and wit, and sparring with the prosecutor brought in from Lansing (George C. Scott).  The scene where he questions his own client after a surprise piece of evidence is introduced by another inmate, real doubt in his eyes, is wonderful.  Scott is also brilliant, sharp and reptilian, quickly surpassing the local prosecutor.  The scene where he deliberately moves back and forth to obscure Stewart's view of a witness is great, and well shot by director Otto Preminger.  Joseph N. Welch as the judge is also strong and such a natural, in one scene appearing in the background with this arm wrapped around his head so that his hand rests on his opposite cheek as he listens intently.  It was also nice to hear jazz from Duke Ellington, and in one scene to see him playing briefly with Jimmy Stewart, though I'm not sure the music always fits.\n\nThe trouble is, even if this is based on a real case, legally and morally, it's a mess.  I certainly didn't want Stewart as protagonist in the role of the defense attorney, where it feels he's in the wrong, starting with him nudging the guy to claim he was temporarily insane.  It's apparent that the only real question is whether that was true, and yet, most of the trial revolves around whether his wife was actually raped, and worse yet, what her possible culpability was in that.  Was she wearing clothing that was too suggestive, was she promiscuous, etc.  Even if you can get past the misogyny of attacking a rape victim, which is a disturbing reality, it's absurd to me that it became so central to the trial, Stewart's 'apple core' argument notwithstanding.  Also, her missing panties get far too much attention throughout the movie, including the dramatic find at the end, when they're irrelevant.  \n\nIn tone, there are several aspects that didn't ring true.  Remick's playfulness and flirtation with Stewart a short while after being brutally beaten and raped, and with her husband charged with murder.  The victim's daughter (played unconvincingly by a constantly wide-eyed Kathryn Grant) remotely considering helping the defense.  The level of levity in the courtroom for a trial involving rape and murder.  In one absurd sidebar, the judge and attorneys sidebar to discuss what panties should be referred to as.  With a very serious look on his face, Scott says \"When I was overseas during the war, Your Honor, I learned a French word. I'm afraid that might be slightly suggestive\", to which the Welch replies \"Most French words are\".   The courtroom then cracks up when he announces that the garment in question will be referred to as panties.  More than once, one attorney or another is surprised by a witness being produced, without having had a chance to independently interview them.  More than once, an attorney will ask a question that he clearly doesn't know the answer to, one that he has no business asking. \n\nMost likely, Preminger amplified all of these theatrics - the jokes, the obsession with Remick and her panties, the banter between attorneys, the little doggie inexplicably being brought into the trial so he can jump up into Stewart's arms - all for entertainment value.  The central theme of what justice should be doesn't get explored enough.  Perhaps that's Preminger's point, that in the circus of a trial with sharp minds on both sides, circling each other like sharks, the system of justice is fallible.  If it was though, the ending doesn't bear that out.  During the 160 minute run time, I kept hoping for a plot twist that never came.  That the guy doesn't just skip out on his bill at the end, he kills his wife in a rage, and calmly deadpans that he did that one too because of an \"irresistible impulse\".  That the wife reveals she was never raped that night, and manipulated her husband into killing.  That either the fellow bartender or the victim's daughter were somehow involved in a setup, for the money.  Nope.  As it is, Stewart's a hero, and if anyone has any qualms about it, they try to pin a happy face on the whole thing by saying his next case is going to be helping the victim's daughter with her estate.  Oh, wow, well that makes it all right then, and let's all leave the theater happy.  \n\nThe film is still worth seeing for the performances - Stewart at 51 is still quite an actor, and endearing as well - but prepare to be conflicted, and a little irritated.",

            "content": "When you throw together actors I love and a genre that I am passionate about, its bound to be a hit for me. I was totally riveted by Anatomy of a Murder and the time flew by so fast I never would have guessed it was more than 2.5 hours. Jimmy Stewart delivers brilliantly as the defense attorney, and he has the kind of small-town vibe that feels appropriate for a guy from the Upper Peninsula. (Just a side note: there is not a single person in this movie who sounds like they are from the U.P., but lack of accents is not a big deal.) I loved when George C. Scott showed up as the big-shot lawyer (from my hometown) because he matched Stewarts intensity. The back and forth between these two great actors was delightful, and I could have taken another hour of it. It was particularly great because the amiable judge was in the middle of it all adding some levity when things got a little overheated.\n\nI think I might be heading into a territory that some might think of as spoilers, so those who want to avoid them, you should probably skip this paragraph of the review: The big risk that Anatomy of a Murder took was leaving it all somewhat ambiguous. A typical movie about a murder trial makes it clear by the end precisely what happened and why. They make it clear that the defendant is either guilty or innocent, and often that is telegraphed very early on so we know who to root for throughout the case. But in this film they stick to the case, they present facts as they are brought up in court, and they never tell you how to feel. Was the murder justified? You decide. Did a rape occur? Maybe. Was justice served? I dont know. Its frustratingly open to interpretation, and my own opinion kept shifting throughout the entire runtime. I think this might grow on me if I watch Anatomy of a Murder again, because it puts you in the mind of the jury, but for now I find the lack of clear-cut answers a little aggravating.\n\nI love the way law is practiced in movies. I know that much of the drama and surprises dont really happen this way in reality, but it is so exciting for me to watch. There are lots of twists and turns in this film that kept me guessing, and the results of the verdict were a mystery to me right up to the end. It did feel like there were some odd rabbit trails taken in the investigation of the case, and I think people who dont love this kind of movie could get bored with Anatomy of a Murder. However, I took it all in stride and found that many of these things became significant later, so it was all worth the journey. Perhaps the one aspect that never totally clicked for me was the relationship between Jimmy Stewart and his coworkers (the overworked/underpaid secretary, and the drunk partner.) Otherwise, this is a unique film that took some chances and most of the time they paid off big for me. It had moments that made me laugh, and it also had some gripping drama that had me holding my breath. Im anxious to watch it again and see if it clicks even more on a rewatch.",

Feeling betrayed by his community, he has his own legal practice but hardly tends to it, preferring to go fishing.  Now he gets a huge case - an army Lieutenant has apparently murdered another man after that man allegedly raped his wife.  The case will require every ounce of Biegler's cunning, experience and courtroom theatrical ability, especially when the prosecution bring in a famed hotshot attorney from the state's capital.\n\nBrilliant - the greatest courtroom drama film ever made.  The only similar movies that come close are To Kill A Mockingbird (1962) and Witness For The Prosecution (1957) and though while these have other great qualities neither matches Anatomy of a Murder for sheer courtroom realism and tension. (The TV mini series The Night Of also deserves a mention, I might add).\n\nDirected by Otto Preminger (Laura, Exodus, The Man With The Golden Arm, In Harm's Way, among others), the movie holds your attention for every second of its 160-minute duration.  Engaging, watertight plot with some clever legal twists and turns.  Very realistic and edifying look into the justice system.\n\nAdd to this Preminger's superb direction.  One of the reasons you can't look away is that Preminger wrings the maximum out of every scene and shot - great use of actor's body language and subtle little things that help the plot, mood and intrigue.\n\nCompleting it all is the nagging feeling that you aren't sure whether the accused is guilty or not.  There's no good guys vs bad guys, just prosecution vs defense (like in real life).  It's this ambiguity and mystery that make the movie so gritty and utterly compelling. \n\nAnatomy of a Murder was nominated for seven Oscars in 1960, including for Best Picture, but won none.  1960 was the year of Ben Hur.",

By dealing with rape and the subsequent revenge murder in detail, the cast is able to use descriptive details and words such as sperm or panties that would be too much for younger (or conservative) viewers at home.  Jimmy Stewart is the \"humble country lawyer\" who is craftier than he looks and may or may not be allowing sullen Ben Gazzara to use the temporary insanity defense to excuse his shooting of the man who raped his wife, Lee Remick.  Remick plays the flirt well and allows the film to explore the question of victim-blame - although rather than suggest that she brought it on herself, the script implies that there wasn't a rape at all but rather consensual sex which led Gazzara to fly into a jealous rage.  But was he insane at the time?  George C. Scott plays the slick prosecuting attorney brought up from Lansing (to the Upper Peninsula where the film takes place) to combat Stewart.  What results is a suspenseful drama with a few surprises and some panache (particularly in the context of 1959) from all concerned.  Eve Arden and Arthur O'Connell are solid in supporting roles (on Stewart's team) but this is Stewart's show and he doesn't disappoint (but he doesn't push himself into darker territory like he would in Vertigo or the westerns he filmed with Anthony Mann).

            "content": "I found it interesting the sets and decor. I recognized early on that a lot of thought and a strong emphasis went into the details, the look to make each scene appear appealing and interesting to look at to the audience such as the backgrounds, signs in jail, the shadows of the words Sherif Office stood out in the scenes or designs of the wallpaper or curtains, paintings to make long conversation scenes seem not so boring. \nKeep the eye moving. And for a film largely verbal with very little seen of the crime itself it was very necessary for the audience to be able to look at other things to stay interested in the story. A great deal of this story requires the audience to infer and use your imagination to create the picture of what the troubles were and what happened at the crime scene.  \n\nOne of the things I found it interesting how the audience of the film is not told upfront what the case is all about. so in many ways the perspective or point of view which the audience is learning about what is going on with the case is just like a jury verses from the aspect of the victims or lawyer. \n\nI also realized fairly early on that there is a lot of smoking and alcohol beverage drinking within the film. \n\nI thought is was interesting to watch how the wife acted totally different once Jimmy Stewart mentioned her husband may be watching by looking out the window. She went from very close to her own car door window. She moved to the other side of the car away from the jail window or Jimmy Stewart giving a lot of personal space. \n\nI think that one of the scenes could have been edited out cut when they showed that the victim was with the Psychiatrist.  \n\nPsychiatrist evaluation Temporarily insane. What does that mean? \n\nI was surprised by how Large the courtroom was with two floors and large paintings above that may be 8 or more feet tall. It surprised me because usually you don't see court rooms that large in a film. \n\nI find it interesting yet funny how Jimmy Stewart was seen at the beginning working on something to catch fish while sitting in court to keep him focused. \n\nI find the story interesting in that it is about a controversial issue in the late 1950's like sex or rape. That was an issue rarely heard of fir its time. Things like panties are seen as funny by the Jury in court yet today it is heard more often therefore more common and viewed as not as funny.\n\nOne line that fascinated me that Jimmy Stewart mentioned was somewhat on the lines that; People are not just merely good or bad but are many things. I thought it was an interesting point for its day to bring up. \n\nThe other line that Jimmy Stewarts character brings up is that \"Everyone loves something\" weather it's fishing or any other personal interest. \n\nOne scene that stood out to me from a film aspect was The momentary pause/stare between the husband and wife on the way for the wife to go to the stand. It was a great scene with a lot of tension that leaves the audience curious what exactly could she reveal that may hurt either both herself or her husband whatever she may say. \n\nI thought it was interesting when the Council sued by George C. Scott purposely blocking view of Jimmy Stewart's character. \n\nI enjoyed the realism with ill-relevant discussions that are unrelated to the main story. \n\nThis film stands interesting as this film explores different elements such as  Psychology, fishing, court, police investigation, military aspects are looked at in the film as aspects yet they all come together in the story to create one story.\n\nI found it interesting when Jimmy Stewart brought up the aspect of Country lawyer Jimmy Stewart verses big city lawyer George C. Scott in the courtroom. It identified that there was a major difference in technics or styles how each lawyers went about facing the case. Such as in how the city lawyers has an associate to go to for information verses a small lawyer who had fewer resources to go to. An old style verses the new style of law.\n\nGood points were brought up about how the side with George C. Scott consistently tried repeatedly to not bring up the rape case in court but rather a murder case.",

            "content": "Though this adaptation of a best-selling novel may not seem like it now, it was quite a groundbreaking big deal when it came out.\n\nThe story, a stirring courtroom drama, follows an alcoholic, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants small town lawyer (Jimmy Stewart going against type), defending a man who openly admits to murdering someone, but only because said individual raped his wife, who, admittedly, is kinda a floozy.  Stewart's character understandably has a lot going against him, and that's not including the fact that the prosecution is made up of some slick, hard-cased big city guys led by George C. Scott.\n\nLike I said, this was a big deal at the time, mostly due to the subject matter, and how director Otto Preminger dealt with it. He did a great job of dealing with stuff that, until then, hadn't really been covered in cinema. Yeah, like I said, some of the impact has diminished, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a powerful and engaging piece of work.\n\nThe opening titles by Saul Bass are the stuff of legend, the score by Duke Ellington is a jazz classic, and the performances, as one may expect, are quite good. I mean, there's Stewart, Scott, and Lee Remick as the floozy wife, all of whom are quite great. Oh yeah, and Ben Gazzara as the man on trial. \n\nThis one kinda set the standard for a lot of courtroom dramas to come, and it is quite realistic, accurate, and does a fine job of trying to show things in a pretty down to Earth way. \n\nSo yeah, I dig the film a lot, but I'll admit that the running time could be cut down a bit, and some of the pacing trimmed as well. It's quite engaging, but once in a while it gets slightly boring, but not enough to really derail things. While I don't feel like a lot of people do, I still think this is a fine film worth seeing, even if I don't regard it as a masterpiece like a lot of others do.",

            "content": "160 minutes, this film better actually give me a detailed study on the process of murder on a cellular level that dissects the mentality of a killer. ... Oh yes, because that would be infinitely less boring than a little bit of filler around the edges of a juicy drama. If this film doesn't tell us that you can pull off really long legal dramas, then it's Oliver Stone's \"JFK\"... as well as \"A Few Good Men\", F.F. Coppola's \"The Rainmaker\", \"The Firm\", \"Amistad\", \"A Time to Kill\", \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", Nikita Mikhalkov's \"12\" and \"...And Justice for All\", which feels like it runs somewhere between 130 minutes and two-and-a-half hours. Jeez, people, I know you're able to find plenty of material outside of the courtroom to sustain a hefty length, but for goodness' sake, at least make an attempt at tightening things up. Hey, maybe this film has earned the right to be overlong, not just because Otto Preminger was nothing if not a man who knew a thing or two about making really long films (Dude, why did it take Paul Newman three-and-a-half hours to get around to occupying a boat, then going on a small-scale military mission in \"Exodus\"?), but because it's audacious enough as an extensive discussion on rape and murder in 1959, which is why it's a masterpiece... I guess. Yes, critics, I know that this film was edgy when it first came out, but forget nostalgia, I just want this film to be good on a general standard. Well, in that case, it's a good thing that this film is, in fact, quite good, though this effort would be even better if it wasn't guilty of making some mistakes.\n\nThis talkative thriller has plenty of time to flesh out the depths of its substance, and certainly does do a generally decent job of breathing life into development in certain spots, though not as many as there probably should be, thus making for an exposition-driven drama that doesn't wholly fulfill its expository potential, and leaves enough holes in substance to feel kind of undercooked to the point of slowing down momentum, though not as much as the atmosphere's, well, actual slow spots, of which there are more than I expected. The film is adequately entertaining, but when things slow donw, as they very often do, while dullness never ensues, momentum limps out pretty considerably, and atmosphere dries up just as considerably, blanding things up to a disengaging point that very rarely, if ever leaves the film to dip its toes in underwhelming waters, but decidedly throw things off. Films this talkative need to be careful if they're going to slow down and dry up, and luckily, this film doesn't limp out so often that it falls flat as consistently bland, but there are bland spells, and they retard kick, or at least assist padding in retarding kick. With all of my talk about how this film, at a whopping 160 minutes, is too long, this somewhat minimalist story's execution's relatively sprawling runtime is not simply highly unexpected, but highly unnecessary, being partially achieved through material that outstays its welcome, often going so far as not simply bloat, but tread circles. This film's formula is too tight for the final product to be as lengthy at it is, rarely doing anything outside of building information outside of the courtoom, then dissecting the information found earlier within the coutrtoom, and such a formula, while backed by enough juice to compel through and through, can be drawn out for only so long before it begins to slip into repetition, and sure enough, it doesn't take long for the dynamicity of this over two-and-a-half-hour dialogue drama to grow thin. Whether it be because repetition isn't as severe as it could have been, or simply because compensation for shortcomings is reasonably strong, this film keeps you going as genuinely gripping, but there are nonetheless moments in which grip loosens, occasionally thanks to lulls in exposition, and mostly thanks to bland bloating that could have driven this promising effort into underwhelmingness. Needless to say, underwhelmingness does not claim this film, which is flawed, most certainly, but boasts even more strengths, even within the underexplored musical aspects, which, in all honesty, aren't entirely cleansed of their own issues.\n\nArguably lengedary musician Duke Ellington composes a score for this film that is not used too often, and often has its share of issues when it does, in fact, finally show up, having a lively jazziness that is hardly all that dynamic, and doesn't always gel with this film's conceptually heavy subject matter, but more often than not, Ellington's efforts, when heard, throw in a worthy color to this film that reinforces entertainment value and, to a certain degree, artistic integrity. Even more explored and fitting artistic touches include, of course, Sam Leavitt's cinematography, which, in all honesty, isn't too terribly striking, even for the time, but was still impressive for its time, and has sustained impressiveness throughout the ages, playing with black-and-white limitations of the '50s through clever lighting that graces visuals with a kind of bleak depth that compliments the intrigue of this subject matter, and sometimes proves to be fairly handsome by its own right. Both the musical touches and photographic efforts behind this film play an adequate role in livening up the telling of this tale, though not too large of a role, as the film's more stylish aspects feel a bit underexplored, both in terms of quantity and in terms in richness, thus substance must sustain itself primarily by its own hand, which, of course, makes it a good thing that this film's substance is so valuable. It's not like this film's subject matter is all that unique in concept, and it's not like the ultimate telling of this story is all that smooth, having undercooked spots and relatively limp spells, though not so many that you don't still get a pretty firm grip on the intrigue of this story, because we are dealing with fairly promising material that some filmmakers of the '50s probably could have brought to life more, but wouldn't be done as much justice by most '50s filmmakers as it is in this film, largely thanks to Wendell Mayes' script. Sure, the censors had to draw lines somewhere, so we're not really looking at a legal thriller that is as unapologetically mature in its dialogue as something along the lines of \"JFK\", but when they say that this film, for 1959, got to be pretty edgy with its references during the courtroom sequences, they weren't kidding, as there is some down and dirty talk in the discussions pertaining crimes as brutal as rape and subsequent vengeful murder that are not too shocking in this day and age, but were daringly made at the time so that this film could break down barriers and further flesh out its story's depths, and such flesh-out, unlike shock value, can never be taken away from the final product, whose audacious and extensive exploration of its depths as a legal thriller is still not too terribly profound, but just insightful enough to create some well-rounded thrills in the dialogue department, thus putting some degree of reinforcement behind unevenly distributed exposition, which is further complimented by believable characterization that is itself complimented by pretty strong portrayals behind most every major note to this film's character roster. Whether it be the subtly soulful George C. Scott, or the lovely Lee Remick, or the charismatic James Stewart, most everyone has his or her opportunity to command your attention and breathe some life into this film's depths, though not as much as a certain offscreen performance, because without the inspiration of Otto Preminger, the final product would have collapsed as underwhelming. Preminger's efforts aren't too outstanding, but when his storytelling hits, it grips, sometimes with dramatic intrigue, sometimes with a bit of tension, and consistently with a soul that may not be able to obscure this film's flaws or predictable spots, but manages to grip you, for although there is no getting around this film's behind flawed, Preminger, backed by worthy writing, acting and other touches, drives this courtroom drama as genuinely rewarding.\n\nWhen the case is closed, the film is left wounded by some underdeveloped spots, and takes some serious damage from slow spots that intensify the sting excessive padding, which eventually inspires the repetition that could have driven the final product into underwhelmingness, but doesn't, as there is enough fair liveliness to score work and cinematography, audacity to writing, compellingness to writing and inspiration to direction to subtly, but surely sustain intrigue through and through, and make \"Anatomy of a Murder\" an intriguing legal drama that could have slipped from bonafide goodness, but makes up for its mistakes enough to reward as compelling, maybe even reasonably worthwhile.\n\n3/5 - Good",

It was quite a bold film in its time and stick packs a pretty darn good wallop today.\r\n\r\nStewart plays Paul Biegler, a Michigan based defense lawyer.  He reluctantly takes the case of a man who admits to killing another man.  Biegler hopes he can get the man, Lt. Manion (Ben Gazzara) off with a term called \"irresitable impulse\".  The man killed had just raped Manion's seductive wife, played by Lee Remick.\r\n\r\nGeorge C. Scott stars as the the presecuting attorney and always great Arthur O'Connell plays Biegler's alcoholic associate.\r\n\r\nThe film is intriguing and very well staged.  It received much deserved Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Actor for Stewart, Supporting Actors for George C. Scott and Arthur O'Connell.  The great Duke Ellington Jazz score also adds to the films uniqueness.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/AnatomyofaMurder_zps95f8fa5f.jpg[/IMG]",

Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, Marcello Mastroianni in 8 1/2, Anthony Quinn in La Strada but I must admit, no one of these beats Jimmy Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nHe's pitch perfect as Paul Biegler, the kinda slacky and slow-acting but clever and theatralic small town lawyer and former district attorney who defends Army lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara in the second best performance of the film) who is accused of murdering the rapist of his wife.\n\nCourt room dramas are awesome. As much as I love some of the 90s adaptations of John Grisham's novels (A Time to Kill, Runaway Jury) or Sidney Lumet's classic 12 Angry Men, Anatomy of a Murder is both the most realistic court room film (as far as I can tell) and overall the best one I've seen yet.\n\nThe 160 minutes fly by, although much of the film is concerned with Paul Biegler's investigations and the cross-examinations in court (which is not really action film material), it's pretty tense and perfectly paced.\nThere are things going on all the time and the film's ending (although it might be unsatisfying for some) is just a work of genius. Anatomy of a Murder has one of the best scripts of all-time (not so much the dialogue, but the structure and plot) - how it reveals the moral ambiguity of all the characters and the weaknesses of the juridical system (without being too abrasive) is remarkable.\n\nFor all fans of detailed and elaborated storytelling, court room action and great acting - and for all others too - expand your horizons, basterds!",

What is the truth, and will he win his case?''\n\nBrilliant movie. It's probably a bit lengthy, though I wouldn't say unnecessarily so. It's practically flawless. One of the greatest courtroom dramas and entertainments I've seen so far. Uniformly outstanding performances, but I have to single out the James Stewart and George C. Scott performances. Stellar directing by Otto Preminger. Duke Ellington composed a fabulous, though unusual jazz score. Wikipedia: ''This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to address sex and rape in graphic terms'' -- I was indeed pleasantly surprised to hear such words like ''panties,'' ''slut,'' ''bitch,'' and ''sperm'' being mentioned. A groundbreaking film for sure. The only misstep for me was right at the very end, the last scene (this is where the SPOILERS come in). He's (the Ben Gazzara character) been found not guilty, by virtue of insanity, yet he's just free to go? Doesn't he at least have to go to an institution or something? At the end of the film, he just takes off with his wife in their trailer... I mean, shouldn't there be some kind of justice for the murdered victim? Maybe I misinterpreted something, and it's not *that* big a thing, but that's the only part that bothered me. Oh, and also as it regards the outcome, I think it was pretty obvious the husband was never (temporarily) insane, nor do I think the wife was raped. The wife's character was just too shallow and sluttish to be innocent. She was most likely having an affair, and the husband knew all about it. I think he just made up the whole rape thing and beat his wife to go along with the story after he killed her lover. But I'm just speculating. I could be totally wrong. You really have to admire how the film doesn't tell us the truth. It's left up to the viewer, in the same way ''Doubt'' was left up to the viewer. Excellent. Anyway, enough of me babbling nonsense. The movie has rocketed into my top 150 favourite films. Storytelling at its finest. Highly recommended!",

Former District Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) who has lost his re-election bid. Biegler now choosing to use his spare time fishing, playing the piano and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell), as well as his cynical  secretary Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden). Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion wanting to secure his services to defend her incarcerated husband.  Biegler after much deliberation makes the decision to represent Lieutenant Manion.  Biegler realising the chance of getting him off such a charge even with such a strong motivation decides irresistible impulse a version of a temporary insanity as his defence.  Biegler finds himself facing District Attorney Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West), the man who ousted him from office, and Assistant State Attorney General Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) an incredibly smart and ambitious man, when the case comes to trial, holding court is Judge Weaver (Joseph N. Welch, a former U.S. Army Head Council).\n\nAdapted by Wendell Mayes from the best-selling novel of the same name written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker under the pen name Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney. Most likely Hollywood director Otto Premingerâ(TM)s most well known and successful film.  The language used while now would seem tame was considered explicit and in one case saw Preminger go to federal court to defend it when Chicago Police Commissioner and Mayor Richard J. Daley startled by its language banned it in the city, the director won the case and the film was shown, the court found the use of the clinical language that Daley objected to, to be appropriate within the context of the film.  While  well received on release, the film was nominated for 7 academy awards and Stewart received the best actor award at both the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and Venice Film Festival,  the filmâ(TM)s appreciation has grown even more over the years.   The American Bar Association rated this as one of the 12 best trial films of all time and UCLA law professor Michael Asimow calls the picture \"probably the finest pure trial movie ever made.\" It was also listed as Number 4 of 25 \"Greatest Legal Movies\" by the American Bar Association.  \n\nWhile this clocks in at 161 minutes rarely does it drag or lose your interest, the director uses the first half to introduce the characters and set the scene, the bulk of the second half being the court room. All the actors equip themselves brilliantly both Gazzara and Remick are fine form in the role of the young couple embroiled in the case, Scottâ(TM)s Dancer is a formidable opponent and makes for some effective scenes sparring with Stewartâ(TM)s Biegler.  Stewart an actor by this time with a filmography so impressive adds yet another assured and memorable turn, adding his usual intelligent and humorous character to Bieglerâ(TM)s crusading Lawyer, not below goading his opponents and intimidating the witnesses and testing Judge Welchâ(TM)s patience. Welch former Head Council for the U.S army gives a dry reading with subtle humour along with Stewartâ(TM)s lighter hearted persona, offering a contrast to the serious clinical nature of the case. \n\nAnother impressive element of the film is Duke Ellingtonâ(TM)s terrific score, which won him a Grammy for best soundtrack, one of the first times Jazz was used predominately in a film. Bieglerâ(TM)s character himself a jazz fan duets with Ellington on the piano in a cameo appearance as Pie Eye the owner of a roadhouse that Biegler and Laura  have a confrontation at featured early in the film.\n\nHaving only caught this film only once before good 25 years ago or so as teenager one night with my Dad, Despite the time gone by the film as always stuck with me but never had a chance to see it again until now.  I recently purchased a region free blu ray player, one of the main reasons for this was to take advantage of the Criterion Collection, a home entertainment studio devoted to releasing classic films in HD restored using the latest of technology.  Sometimes I feel some people misunderstand the blu ray format, whereas DVD was designed to present a sharper clearer image, blu ray while doing this also allows the film makers and studios to restore the picture closest to when it was originally released. \n\nOne of my friends remarked to me last year when I said was buying my Wife a copy of Some Like It Hot on blu ray for Christmas that he thought this pointless and felt that the charm of old black & white films was their old scratchy appearance and the digital medium would ruin this.  Although I feel if an old film can be restored to look as impressive or more than on original release then this is a plus and the film can still maintain its character as well as have an appearance that would been only seen by those who witnessed when originally exhibited.  This is my first foray into the Criterion studio and Iâ(TM)m incredibly impressed, this a new high definition transfer was created on a Spirit 4K in 4K resolution from a new 35mm fine-grain master positive struck from the original camera negative at Cinetech laboratory in Valencia, California. The picture was restored at Technicolor in Los Angeles and Reliance Media Works in Burbank, California.   The film still retains its grain but the contrast is maintained throughout , colours appear rich and strong.  Having the option of both a new 5.1 DTS HD audio track as well as LPCM 1.0 mono track for more purists.  This is indeed an impressive presentation and a suitable treatment  of undoubted classic piece of celluloid.",

Voelker. Despite an epic running time, it manages to hold your attention and it benefits from sharp direction and a jazzy music score. Small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is struggling to get by and he's trying to get back into the big league of politics after losing the seat of district attorney, he's helped out by friend Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (Eve Arden). Biegler gets a call from Laura Manion (Lee Remick), wife of the boorish army lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara), who has been accused of the murder of a man called Barney Quill, who Manion claims raped his wife. It goes to court, where Biegler agrees to defend Manion, but he meets his match in the courtroom when he's up against prosecution lawyer Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) and D.A Mitch Lodwick (Brooks West). It's a good drama with good sharp dialogue and Preminger gets the best out of his cast. James Stewart puts in another dine performance while this put George C. Scott on the map as a great actor. It's got noirish cinematography by Sam Leavitt and a memorable jazzy score by Duke Ellington, who appears in the film, jamming with Stewart.",

Jimmy Stewart in both lusts after a blonde, of course more vividly in \"Vertigo,\" since it is the central theme. What strikes me most is that Stewart is actually doing a wrong deed in both movies; while in \"Vertigo,\" he is (supposedly) after a married woman, in \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" he is helping out a murderer. Even in all this, we the viewer side with him, because of his charming appearance and how he conducts himself. Excluding the similarities, Preminger has developed a fine courtroom drama with stellar performances from George C. Scott and James Stewart, this being one of Stewart's best films. Rather than finding a verdict, the film is cunningly interested in demonstrating what goes on in a trial in detail; the back and forth debate sequences between Scott and Stewart are the most compelling parts. I still am unsure about the motives of Stewart's character to take the case, unless he needed money or simply because he is an attorney. I have read \"Anatomy of a Murder\" being one of the first films to address sex and rape in explicit terms; you essentially hear Stewart say \"panties\" and \"sperm,\" which was quite unusual. It also has a wonderful music score by Duke Ellington, widely considered one of the greatest composers ever. Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of a Murder\" is one of the better films to come out of the 1950s.",

The immediate assumption is that someone overdid it.Hire an editor for god's sake. Instead, I'm left feeling that all other courtroom dramas are pale in comparison and must have left out pieces of what was probably more compelling of a story.\n\nIt kicks off like a noir. James Stewart is a recently voted-out prosecutor just about to give up like his alcoholic partner; but instead get a call. Simple defense case. Woman gets raped, husband kills the rapist, now he wants help getting off. A couple of things stand in the way of making it an easy case. A. the guy pretty much a hothead asshole. B. The rape victim is more than a little unsympathetic. Part of the noirness of the first act. Lee Remick is flirty; not really sad when describing the rape, dresses in a way that attracts dog-like attention, loves that attention. Her dog is named \"Muff\", which I'm sure is lost on no one.\n\nIn this noirness, I would have liked to have seen Bogart replace Stewart who was teetering on the edge of inapprpriateness with his new client. Seemed out of character for Jimmy. But when the court drama starts, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the forefront.\n\nThis is one of the best courtroom films I have ever seen. The largest part of the greatness is how George C. Scott dances in from the big-city prosecutor's office. He's astute and rude, but plays it with class- as if you're supposed to be impressed with being treated this way. And Stewart himself vollys back. Playing the shy local boy who's getting railroaded by the big important men.\n\nThe movie doesn't rely on big twists or plot reveals. They fight about the motivation of killing a man. And whether to talk about his wife at all. When they do, they step right into the \"isn't she really just a tramp?\" rhetoric. Not because of some nasty legal boy's club. But simply because one side wants to",

            "content": "I don't know why more judges don't write books based on some of the more interesting cases they've seen. They're judges, they're probably smart, they could throw a book together, and after awhile your bound to have seen a few noteworthy cases that people would be interested in. I guess today the book just wouldn't succeed though for the same reason most courtroom dramas no longer do well at the box office, Audiences are inundated with TV shows about criminal proceedings. Without fail millions of people every week watch serialized retellings of interesting court cases through Law & Order, CSI, NCIS and their countless spinoffs to the point where you've probably seen a lot of the twists and turns court cases and police proceedings have to offer from a story telling perspective. But this film comes from a simpler time, when TVs weren't showing the same boring and unrealistic criminal cases every waking hour of the day, and IS based on a book written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker about a case he oversaw. It was adapted and brought to the screen by at the time controversial director Otto Preminger who had entered the phase in his career where he challenged Hollywood norms, fresh off of filming The Man With the Golden Arm about a drug addict. Preminger was notoriously hard to work with and caused some people to leave production, but ran a tight ship and made one of the most important films in his day. It challenged the Hollywood taboo of rape, with perfectly open and frank dialogue regarding the crime and attempted to capture the events with documentary like realism. Despite the limitations of the time he filmed much of it on location, even using a lot of the same jury members who sat in on the original case and casting actual Judge Joe Welch as the big city judge who famously during the McCarthy hearings told the man \"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\" But as always the big question is, how does it hold up? Is it worth your time or has it aged laughably poorly? Let's take a pantied look.\r\n\r\nOur film is actually more about the small town Upper Michigan Lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart, still taking challenging roles and acting the hell out of them midway through his career) who recently lost a reelection bid for DA than the subjects of the case. Biegler spends most of his time fishing, and reading law with his elderly friend Parnell McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell who's character I found very annoying) and becoming a regular recluse to the chagrin of his secretary Maida (Eve Arden, who has some pretty witty lines from time to time). He is brought out of his self imposed exile however when he is contacted by Ms. Laura Manion (Lee Remick, giving one of the most spirited and challenging turns of the whole movie) who's husband has recently murdered a local bartender under the belief the man had raped her. Against his better judgement after a rocky first meeting Paul takes the case of Lt. Manny Manion (a young Ben Gazzara who gives the best performance here to the easily most interesting and least black and white character) under the grounds he had an \"irresistible impulse\" to kill the man due to temporary insanity. And so begins the legal dogfight between Paul and the man who beat him for the DA position as well as revered city prosecutor Claude Dancer (George C. Scott, he doesn't talk much in this but when he does hold on to your hats because it blows them all away).\r\n\r\nThis is actually a very good movie, it's well done and despite being mostly dialogue driven is consistently interesting and captivating for its over two and a half hour run time that would feel bloated for some films. The performances are all top notch, even if I found the character of Parnell to be insufferably annoying and unlikeable, and I really enjoyed how no one here is really 100% in the right or in the wrong. These characters walk the line in the grey area of morality and that's certainly part of what drives it. Duke Ellington (who actually makes an appearance playing piano with Stewart at one point) delivers some of his freshest work for the score, and despite being over fifty years old now and in black and white the cinematography captures the small town and its many settings rustically and realistically. One of the main things I enjoyed about it though, is that the lawyer who's acting the fool in court and putting on all the theatrics is the protagonist this time not the other way around. Paul is painted as a hometown hero of sorts, against the big city outsider of Claude and yet he's the one putting on a show and making all the jokes and basically doing the types of things that should end with a man being held in contempt. He even at one point deliberately makes an accusation on no grounds whatsoever that he knows will be stricken from the record on the basis that the jury can't \"un-hear it\" as a matter of fact this is one of his main tactics. But it's also not a perfect movie mostly due to its strange ending so I'll throw up a SPOILER here right quick. As the movie ends Paul has put his faith in Lt. Manion and he successfully gets him off on the \"irresistible impulse\" defense. Well than when he heads by Manion's trailer to collect the fee he waived till after the proceedings he sees the Lieutenant has flown the coop without paying and left him a sarcastic letter implying he was in full control of his faculties during the murder. There's even evidence that he beat his wife and took her against her will with him, and despite having shown compassion and desire to protect the naiive little nymph Paul and Parnell laugh it off and make a joke. Alright, the defendant ending up being the piece of shit the prosecution made him out to be, a good twist and even a refreshingly dark ending but the fact that Paul doesn't seem to care at all made him very unlikeable to me in that last scene. I don't expect him to rush to the girls rescue, but at the very least it would have been nice to see him show some remorse for having ruined her life and gotten a murdering douche off Scott-free. Oh well.\r\n\r\nI really did enjoy this, I wasn't sure I would but due to its uncharacteristic for the time period frankness it ends up being a movie far ahead of its time and holds up pretty damn well today. I hesitate to call it perfect, but it's an ethically complex and suitably well made courtroom drama from a time when this was a suitable and effective genre. Furthermore it's one of the best performances I've seen from Jimmy Stewart who is usually a very good actor but one I dare say is often times just playing himself. Not to mention the fact that anyone else his age would have seemed creepy talking about panties and girdles as much as his character does. If any of these things appeal to you I'd say this is well worth checking out but if not that's understandable and I wouldn't call it a must see.",

Lawyer Paul Biegler (Stewart) has just started a case involving a man, (Gazzara) who killed his wife's (Remick) alleged rapist. Once Paul finds out more, he decides for sure that he wants to support them, and that's when the movie begins. Otto Preminger certainly proved his genius in this 1959 courtroom drama. This film is so pure and original, and every single actors performance is taut and believable. James Stewart certainly showed his chops as his lawyer, and whoever won the Oscar didn't deserve it because Jimmy did! As well as Stewart, Remick and Gazzara do great with those small but important roles they had, as well as Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott who definitely deserved their nominations. Surprisingly too, this movie is full of language that was known for being one of the first movies to challenge the Hays Code, and, it was one of the first movies to do with rape, so as well as being so good, it's groundbreaking. Duke Ellington's music adds so much, and the witty script with dry jokes ease the tense mood. Anatomy of a Murder is a spectacular film, and if you like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", you'll love this.",

One law professor labeled this one of the best \"pure trial\" movies ever made. Had the film merely stuck with the trial, rather than the circumstances around it, that assessment would seem more accurate. \n\nSemi-retired attorney Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart, excellent as always) is called upon by Laura Manion (Lee Remick) to assist in the defense of her husband (Ben Gazzara), a cad of an Army officer on trial for murdering a bar tender. In addition to getting his client off though the odds -- a crime of passion filled with less-than-savory circumstances -- are stacked against the defense, Biegler also takes it upon himself to protect Laura from accusations against her character -- accusations that may have more than just a grounding in reality. \n\nBiegler's chief opponent in the courtroom is Dancer (George C. Scott), a highly professional lawyer who, despite his outward calm and decorum, is more like a feral animal making concentrated attacks against anyone who crosses his path. The finest scenes revolve around Stewart and Scott going toe-to-toe in the courtroom, the simple country lawyer (who possesses more cunning than he lets on) and the big-city prosecutor frequently at odds. \n\nDirector Otto Preminger often seemed a filmmaker unwilling to tell a straightforward story, loading each frame with character flourishes which, despite giving color to the smoky, monochromatic, tense yarns he commonly brought to the screen, tended to trade personality for storytelling. Though it's an admirable trait (especially in this era of plot-driven, flavorless, forgettable spectacle), the sacrifice of pacing makes his films difficult to sit through. The introduction of a witness who turns out to be the victim's daughter, for example, proves less integral to the film than Preminger might like us to believe (though it does lead to a major obstacle for the prosecution).\n\nLike the earlier \"The Man with the Golden Arm,\" Preminger makes us spend time with his characters and makes them into three-dimensional individuals. Unfortunately, he uses less discretion in knowing whom the audience would NEED to spend time with to best advance the story, tarnishing the luster of the passionate, truly peerless scenes in the courtroom.",

It is a brilliant tale of a rape, a murder, a pair of panties, a colorful trial, and a savvy southern lawyer.\r\nThe story centers around Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart), a former District Attorney who takes on the case of a military man who's murdered his wife's rapist.  The man in question is Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazarra).  Manion is a cold man who really doesn't mourn the loss of the man he killed.  His wife, Laura Manion (Lee Remick), is about as loose as a woman could be in those days without being fully promiscuous, though one can't help but wonder about that.  Laura has no reservations about being flirty with anyone, even Biegler.  She wears form-fitting clothing and is constantly suggestive.  Frederick is a jealous man when it comes to his wife, and her nature certainly doesn't help.  Biegler, along with us in the audience, obviously wonders if this jealousy was the real reason behind the murder, and even whether or not Laura was even raped.  In the end, however, what matters in this film isn't just the facts, but the courtroom procedure itself.\r\nBiegler is never presented as some kind of hero, nor is his client or the wife.  Biegler isn't a bad man, but he can be a very unscrupulous lawyer, as can they all.  His legal battle in the courtroom with the adequate but overmatched D.A. and his far more qualified partner, Claude Dancer (an excellent George C. Scott) is brilliantly written, highly entertaining, and surprisingly cavalier.  The atmosphere created by the animated attorneys and the less-than-overbearing Judge Weaver (Joseph Welch) makes for the most colorful courtroom I've ever seen in a serious-minded film.  The effect is marvelous.\r\nAnatomy of a Murder is one of the most exceptional courtroom dramas ever filmed.  Jimmy Stewart, whom I believe to be the greatest American actor of his day, is brilliant as always and his verbal sparrings with George C. Scott are a treat to watch.  The only thing the film lacks is a person to like or root for, particularly in the defendant or his wife.  They're highly unlikeable, though not so flawed that we hate them, we just don't feel too sorry for them.  A minor flaw in an otherwise masterful film, one that was way ahead of its time in both content and writing.  The screenplay is one of the best I have ever heard.\r\nAnatomy of a Murder is a true masterpiece.",

It appears that he takes on the case because of the fact that it centers around a woman, rather than he insatiable need for justice. \nThe courtroom scenes itself are very interesting. Rather than try to just bedazzle the audience with big speeches and wild twists, Preminger paces the twists and turns in a way that makes the viewer feel as though this could have been a real court case. There are no John Grisham moments, but the drama is still very palpable.  \nStewart actually surprised me as the morally ambivalent man of the law. George C. Scott is also terrific as the prosecutor. \nIt I had not recently watched Judgment at Nuremberg and have Kramer's flawless camera work in that film fresh in my mind, I would have rated it higher.

Oh, and the insanity plea is used less than 1% of all criminal cases and has but a 26% success rate and 90% of the successes have histories of mental illnesses. Now, even assuming that the defendant of this film fit into the 1%, 26%, and 10% respectively, he still needs to be committed by the end of the film. He won't be able to just walk free.\r\nThat's my biggest problem with this film, and it is a big problem because that was in the back of my mind throughout the whole picture.\r\nStill, this is a beautifully directed film with a lot of great actors working together to craft a lovely story, including George C. Scott, Lee Remick, Murray Hamilton, and James Stewart. This pretty much over turns a lot of the story's flaws, although not all of them.

Probably the best film of 1959 (though I have not seen \"Ben-Hur\" or \"Rio Bravo,\" but for me, better than \"Some Like it Hot\" and \"North By Northwest\"), Otto Preminger's best film, and one of the finest films for James Stewart, George C. Scott, and all others involved. At 160 minutes long, it is intense, thought provoking, and uses excellent dialogue and terminology. For a film from 1959, it could mistaken for something much more recent and it has hardly aged. It is a must-see for all. What a truly great film.",

            "content": "When Laura Manion (Lee Remick) comes home and tells her husband that she has been raped, he instantly goes and kills the man who raped his wife. Paul Biegler (James Stewart) a humble small-town lawyer, is asked to defend him. Biegler originally wants to plead guilty, but soon discovers the idea that they might have a shot for insanity. But this case will not be an easy one. Biegler finds himself up against the State's Deputy Attorney General (George C. Scott), and Biegler must search everywhere for evidence to prove that Laura was raped, and possibly win the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnatomy of a Murder was one of the most brilliant courtroom dramas I have ever seen. The story was pretty similar to a lot of movies such as these, but the direction by Otto Preminger was fantastic. Despite the long length of this film, unlike many courtroom dramas Anatomy of a Murder really keeps you interested throughout the entire film. The screenplay was also very good. I laughed out loud several times in the film, and I can tell you there is no better battle then James Stewart and George C. Scott for a courtroom drama.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acting was superb by everyone. I found no one in the film to be a bad actor, and I really loved some of the performances. James Stewart delivered one of the best I have ever seen him. I still believe that It's a Wonderful Life was his career performance, but this was definitely up there in his best. This is one of the only films I have seen with George C. Scott, but he was amazing in this film. The most interesting parts of the film was hearing James Stewart and George C. Scott yell \"objection!\" every single time one of them would say something.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, Anatomy of a Murder is probably the greatest, or at least one of the greatest, courtroom dramas I have ever seen. With perfect direction, and great acting by some of the greatest actors ever, this movie quickly became one of my favorites in film history.\r\n\r\nFinal rating: Fresh-100%",

            "content": "Anatomy of a Murder might seem dated and borish. (especially because of it's long running time) But this movie in the day did break the boundaries for openness of sex and rape, and presents some great acting from James Stewart and  George C. Scott.\r\n\r\nThis film is a courtroom drama about James Stewart who plays a lawyer defending a former officer of war for the murder of a man who raped his wife. Stewart's character is slick and a smoothtalker when on the job, and he pulls many dramatic expressions and statements when in court. He is going to need everything he's got to persuade the jury, especially when he's defending a man with such an unclear motive for his actions. This movie was very well written and portrays a courtroom case in a very dramatic but natural fasion. But most of the entire movie is in the courtroom and the movie does stretch out too much, especially when it constantly leans towards the innocence of Stewart's client.\r\n\r\nThere are some very interesting shots throughout the movie, which is always great to see in older movies. This film was also nominated of 7 Oscars, including one for Stewart and Scott, Best Cinematography, Editing, and Best Picture.\r\n\r\nThough as slow as this film may be, and though it's pretty mild to today's standards, it is none the less a movie that made an impact in the day, and it is supported with great acting for James Stewart fans. When in the mood, it can be a very intriguing courtroom drama because the movie gives you that feeling that you really can't trust the defendant and his wife. And that's always a good direction.",

            "content": "Pretty edgy stuff for its time, but even in hindsight, the sexual politics feel awfully retrograde (good guy and bad alike seem to believe that, yes, there's a certain type of woman that does deserve rape). Also, am I the only one that thinks the ending would have been completely different in the real world? I can't discuss it without spoilers, but...yeah. Anyway, this is something of a barrier-breaker morally for its time, but not much more about it sets it apart from today's typical episode of Law and Order, short of its sweet soundtrack and a couple of strong performances. Lee Remick and George C. Scott really stand out, even despite the lesser offerings, like the prosecutor who is not George C. Scott and the judge, who is obviously trying too hard. Anatomy of a Murder is also really fucking long and not all that well paced and that subplot jaunt into Canada is completely, totally unnecessary. \n\nDespite the infirmities of technique, the movie still holds up fairly well and is definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a Jimmy Stewart fan.",

Remick delivers tart fairly well; it's really the only other interesting performance. George C.

The performances by all the actors is particularly good but especially so by Stewart and Lee Remick.  The film seems to border itself with noir traits and Remick's performance hammers this home.  The film was one of many to frankly attack the censorship of the era and it tackles the socio-psychological issues prevalent to the time.

            "content": "Who can argue a Jimmy Stewart movie where Jim's playing a down-and-out lawyer who comes back to life to fight a case of murder, in defense of a man who shot another man for raping his wife. It's enough that the centerpiece of the film is an argument about allowing the fact of the rape to be considered in the testimony. This alone puts this 1959 near-masterpiece in the realm of timeless, and squarely in the modern mode. The erosion of the code is in full swing, and swing is a good word for it. Along with a script that crackles with fun at each turn of the courtroom statement, how can you go wrong with a movie that shows Jimmy Stewart in a juke joint sitting beside Duke Ellington on the piano bench and jamming along? The joys of this one never seem to end, and the trump card, along with a handsome full frame presentation on dvd, gorgeous noirish shooting, and Preminger's perfectionism, we get a cast turning out aces, whether it's Lee Remick's wolf-whistling strut as the young and peachy wife, or Ben Gazzera's not-so-innocent ego-wounded husband. The real pearls, apart from Stewart doing what he does best, are Eve Arden's stalwart girl friday and Joseph Welch's utterly and endlessly delightful role as the judge. Knowing the background of Joseph Welch, that he was in fact a real judge who trounced Senator McCarthy during the famous hearings, only adds to the pleasure of the performance. The film on all levels is eloquent, and sharp, and very funny, and nuanced to the point that we forget at times the tenuousness of the argument in the protagonist's favor, or the apparently obtusely skewed values when it comes to viewing Remick's situation, certain articles of clothing, and the significance of the harm done to her. Sometimes it's alarming how great film art can be, in all the best ambiguous ways.",
