I can see this movie being one of those that evolve as I get older considering the subject matter so it could be one worth revisiting as I inevitably get older.

Absolutely and one of his better ones however there was many missed parts for further exploration. I get it that he is all about symbolism and I love his surrealism styles (several dream sequences r genuis). His dialogue while lengthy of course is thoughtful and intriguing. The main actor is wonderful, but I felt like this film should've been longer and detail was lacking. We never see the main actor with his wife or showing his hard exterior in much of any scene. I just didn't feel for him like I should've. Also his emphasis on human cruelty is always over the top n seems like he likes to dwell in it a lil too much. I get it humans can be cruel but life is more cruel IMO. Still any cinephile should check this one out. I really liked the idea behind this film on reflecting back on ur life n feel like old age is like this well done in this aspect n good message about life's meaning. The ending is absolutely horrible tho n left in the air ughhhh if he could just close what he starts. Frustrating.",

            "content": "(a \"you know so much, but you don't know anything\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nI remember seeing WILD STRAWBERRIES the first time when I was maybe in my late 20s or early 30s. I had already grown accustomed to the marvelous majesty of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, but I'm afraid this film at that time was a little lost on me. Cut to me now, age 54, and I can honestly tell you that there is NOTHING lost on me about this film. I TOTALLY \"get it\" now and what I \"get\" is encapsulated in the line Sara delivers to the main character, Isak Borg, wherein she is holding up a mirror to Isak and says, \"you know so much, but you don't know anything.\" Yes, indeed, do I EVER \"get\" that!\n\nIsak Borg is a doctor of much knowledge but also much disappointment and much loneliness. The film begins with Isak taking a trip to Stockholm to receive a medal of honor for this much knowledge. What he doesn't receive is much peace on the way to Stockholm by car, for he is treated to flashbacks and \"flashforwards\" that make him question who he really is minus this much knowledge. What he really is, as mentioned, is much disappointment and much loneliness. Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, a most definite favorite actor of Bergman ever since he saw Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE, plays Isak Borg, and this performance is wonderfully nuanced and wonderfully \"naked.\" Borg flashbacks to the girl, Sara, he wished he had married. He flashbacks that he has not been kind at all to his son, Evald, or Evald's wife, Marriane, who accompanies Isak on his trip to Stockholm. These flashbacks collide with \"flashforwards.\" One such as these was when Isak and Marianne picked up a husband-and-wife hitchhiker whose marriage was infused with humiliation and mean words, all taking place in the back seat of their car. It is Marianne who eventually stops the car to let these troubled souls out, but we know Isak wants them out, too, because they remind him of his humiliating and mean words spoken to his wife, Karin, who has passed away. There are also three young people they give a ride to, and they also are \"flashforwards\" but also flashbacks, because they remind Isak of his lost youth.\n\nWILD STRAWBERRIES has two (BOTH) dream sequences that are the sheer genius of Ingmar Bergman. Isak has a dream at the beginning of the film where he is walking down a deserted street with a blazing yellow sun (you can feel the heat, although the film is in black-and-white). He spots a clock tower that has no hands and an eventual meet-up with someone who has a smudged face and when touched crumbles and bleeds (blood? water? Jesus? (\"one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water\"-John 19:34). A horse-drawn carriage (never one of my favorite things) comes around the corner carrying a coffin that eventually falls to the ground and then a hand with the face of Isak protrudes out, attempting to pull him into the coffin. The other dream sequence midway through the film is Isak being tested for all his much knowledge, only to realize that this much knowledge has led him to \"you know so much, but you don't know anything.\" If there is anything Isak comes to realize, it is that his life up until now has been resentments, coldness, and, yes, loneliness. In fact, it is the medical record from this testing that reveals Isak's diagnosis. And what is that diagnosis? Yep, you guessed it\u2026.loneliness! In fact, almost every character in the many Ingmar Bergman films I have seen have this same diagnosis of loneliness. I know for a fact it's my diagnosis.\n\n\"You know so much, but you don't know anything.\" What does this really mean for all of us? It means, like Isak, we can know so much but not know anything. It means we can think we know so much but actually not know anything. This is such a struggle for the intellectual ones like Bergman and like myself. We have all this knowledge. We have our intellect, we have our words, we have our careers, and we even have our family and friends. But do we know anything about any of these things? Of course not! We don't really know what any of these things will mean in the end. We won't really know until the end if any of these things have meant anything. I have often been quoted as saying (or thinking): \"I know God and yet I am still coming to know God. But, outside of knowing God, I don't know anything.\" I sure do try to know anything about anything, but I only know God and yet I am still coming to know God. The irony here is that there can be much freedom in admitting I don't know anything. I think I am going to lose something by admitting I don't know anything (can you relate?) but, in reality, I know EVERYTHING because I know FREEDOM! When I detach from anything, I have EVERYTHING which is I have FREEDOM!\n\nWriting this film review of WILD STRAWBERRIES made me think of a comment I received once from someone who was reading one of my Ingmar Bergman film reviews. The one commenting said, and I'm paraphrasing, \"Your film reviews are too much of a love fest of Ingmar Bergman.\" I think this one commenting meant that as an insult, but I took it as a HUGE compliment! My film reviews of Ingmar Bergman's films ARE a love fest because I LOVE INGMAR BERGMAN'S FILMS! Should I be hesitant to \"drip\" this love fest all over these reviews I write about Ingmar Bergman's films? I want them to \"drip\" a love fest and, in fact, I want them to downright \"bleed.\" My blog website here has the mission statement of \"I'm gonna to need to bleed for God!\" I still hold steadfast to that statement, but I also can have BOTH by \"I'm gonna need to bleed for Ingmar Bergman!\" Can't I?\n\nTo close this film review out is the closing image of Isak in WILD STRAWBERRIES. Isak has received his medal of much knowledge and after such a long day of flashbacks and \"flashforwards\" of much disappointment and much loneliness, he is seen lying in his bed, quickly falling asleep, and he has a face of TOTAL peace. I think Isak has come to realize, like me, he has detached from anything, and he, like me, has EVERYTHING which is he, like me, NOW has FREEDOM!",

            "content": "A moving tribute to the aging among us.\n\nIngmar Bergman directed Wild Strawberries (1957) with a tender affection for the plight of the elderly. He allows for reminiscing on the past with old memories brought about by Bergman's surreal dream sequences. I marvel at Bergman's creative visual aesthetic. He constantly keeps you entertained and questioning what you are watching with each new scene.\n\nBergman displays his masterful craftsmanship as a director with clever dream sequences brought to life by clever editing and wondrous cinematography. The edit to the car wreck is so sudden it appears before the audience as the actual crash happens before the characters. The fades to the childhood house of old is so beautiful as Bergman depicts pastoral scenes of serenity of happiness next to uncertainty and adolescence. I adored the hard cuts to Isak's face as he discovers his son hates him, his wife cheated on him, and his first love left him. Bergman holds no punches and goes for the most emotionally poignant moments in Wild Strawberries.\n\nThe gorgeous Swedish setting is matched by the beauty of how Bergman uses the camera lens. From slowly panning down a building hallway or following Isak down a deserted street, Bergman finds the most intriguing perspective for each shot. I particularly loved Isak watching his wife's infidelity behind a wooden pillar and the scene towards the end by the lake. They are picturesque in their quiet serenity, but convey a much deeper emotion alongside their striking visual nature.\n\nFurthermore, Ingmar Bergman proves his lovely pen work as Wild Strawberries' writer. His contemplation on happiness, love, marriage, death and many more themes made Wild Strawberries his most profound cinematic experience yet. Bergman brings a thoughtfulness and truthfulness to his words. His themes are universal as are the multiple perspectives of generations he wrote into Wild Strawberries. We see people of all ages experiencing life as Isak is remembering it.\n\nSpeaking of Isak Borg, his character is so movingly portrayed by legendary director Victor Sjostrom. His demonstration of age's wisdom and care is astonishing. Sjostrom brings a humanity and empathy to his role as Isak. You really come to care about this old man and his retrospective. Sjostrom's final role is admirable as it is he who made Bergman's Wild Strawberries shine with emotional depth during Isak's character study.\n\nI must mention the dual role of the adorable and lovely Bibi Andersson. She plays Isak's former flame Sara as well as the lively hitchhiker Sara. She is so sweet and endearing and adds such youthful life and excitement to Wild Strawberries. She is a phenomenal actress displaying the deep regret of the past Sara's indiscretions to the young Sara's uncertainty in choosing a love. Her sweet goodbye to Isak is unforgettable as is her bright smile. Bibi Andersson could play it all!\n\nSimilarly, the stunning actress Ingrid Thulin plays Marianne Borg. Her convincing depiction of a miserable wife hoping for a child and happiness is quite touching. I found myself liking Thulin more and more as Wild Strawberries continued. Her speeches to Isak about her husband not liking him and not desiring a child are captivating to say the least. Thulin was a remarkable actress!\n\nLastly, there are to neat cameo roles that I have to touch upon as Max von Sydow plays an engaging gas attendant for a scene. Sydow shows his acting prowess as you remember him even though he's just a cameo in a short scene, but he manages to convey his character's respect and love to Isak. You even learn how great a doctor Isak is in this scene. It's a nice uplifting sequence, if brief. On the other hand, Gunnar Bjornstrand plays Isak's horrid son Evald Borg. His stern rejection of parenthood is shocking as is his hesitation towards his father and his wife. He gives a great supporting role in Wild Strawberries.\n\nIn all, Wild Strawberries is the most moving film I have seen in a long time. It captures the fears of aging and dying, while showing sincere empathy for a life well lived. Watch Wild Strawberries!",

I thought there were moments full of emotion, and I appreciated the shifting relationship with his daughter-in-law. However the strange kids he meets did nothing for me, and the bickering couple were even worse. I realize that the intent was to use people in the present to get him reflecting on his past, but I was more interested in just watching his flashbacks. The whole film was paced slowly and had many quiet contemplative moments, just as you might expect from Ingmar Bergman. That style of film has never clicked with me unless I\u2019m very deeply connected with the characters. Since Dr. Borg starts the film as a stoic man, it was tough for me to find that deep connection. I wasn\u2019t completely put off by Wild Strawberries, and I could see what it was trying to do. While it isn\u2019t my kind of thing, at least I could see why others love it. ",

I don't know that it offered many more insights or facts beyond what I already knew - and it may have impacted on my appreciation of the film this time (too distracting).  That said, Wild Strawberries is still undoubtedly a masterpiece from film titan Ingmar Bergman.  His regular troupe of actors is here: Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Naima Wifstrand - but the lead role goes to Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, then 79-years-old and a fabled film director and star actor in his own right (known most famously for The Phantom Carriage, 1921, He Who Gets Slapped, 1924, and The Wind, 1928).  Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m plays Isak Borg (note the initials), a retired professor of medicine who will travel from Stockholm to Lund over the course of the film (a 14 hour car journey) in order to receive an honorary degree.  The journey becomes a psychic exploration of Borg's past and principally his relationships with women; it seems that his has been a lonely existence, possibly due to his own cold selfish nature, which may in turn be a result of his relations with his parents (an autobiographical note from Bergman himself).  This subtext is told primarily through dream sequences that offer some glimpses of reality as it may have been and some nightmarish eruptions of anxiety filled with symbolism (clocks with no hands) and a foreboding sense of imminent death.  We see fond reveries of his first crush, Sara (Bibi Andersson), in the wild strawberry patch - and then we later see her in a frightening scene where she holds a mirror up to Borg to show him his flaws (surely not something that really happened).  Sara is also mirrored by her modern day doppelganger, a modern young Sara who Borg and his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) pick up hitchhiking with two male travelling companions on their way to Italy.  While Marianne gives Borg a piece of her mind (informing him how his own son hates him for the way he has been treated), the new young Sara gives Borg a chance to amend his ways, soften his personality, and reflect on his own behaviour. Marianne and her estranged husband (Borg's son; Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) have fought over whether to have children (he thinks that it is cruel to bring anyone into this terrible world - an existential truism for Bergman, perhaps) but by the end of the film, they will reconcile and Borg's own anxieties will have calmed.  Yet overall, the film seems ambivalent toward life and relationships - Bergman sees them as affording both great torment and the opportunity for beautiful communion.  Each generation passes along its successes and failures to the next one - yet there is still hope that one can escape this determinism, if perhaps only on our deathbeds!  A rich and provocative film that would reward closer study.",

Interesting the snappy pants outfits for the women in the late '50's.  | - Norm de Guerre",

He has also been having strange dreams, dreams that remind him of the person he has become, and potentially what lies ahead for him.\n\nIncredibly thought-provoking and emotional movie.  A metaphor for life and what you make of it.  As someone who could understand how Isak could get that way, and even endorse how he feels, this was an eye-opening, and potentially life-changing, movie.\n\nWhile many of Bergman's movies are sombre and depressing, this, having started that way, turns it all around, channeling the negativity to find something positive.  A very nostalgic and uplifting movie.  Also, not that predictable in its positivity.  The upliftment sneaks up on you...\n\nWonderful film.",

It may sound too sedate to hold one's interest, but it does.  Through dream sequences filled with symbolism and dialog with people he meets along the way, we get a picture painted of his life, its key moments, and how he evolved over time.  We see the common thread - his serious, intelligent, considerate, yet cool and judgmental personality - and how that made him a very successful doctor, but created difficulties in his personal life.  We see how he lost the real love of his life when she was picking wild strawberries and his own more passionate brother pursued her, and how his subsequent marriage to another was plagued with strife and his wife's infidelity.   We see how this carried down to his son, his unhappy childhood, his depression, and the difficulty he has in his own marriage.  We also see the perils of old age, seeing death coming, being sentimental, and fearing becoming obsolete.  We see that despite his brilliant career and the very prestigious award he's just been given, the most meaningful, happy moment in his life was simply fishing on a peaceful day with his father, a sentiment which has a 'Rosebud' feel to it.\n\nThe film is not heavy or hard to watch and just enjoy Bergman's storytelling, but at the same time it does have a weightiness to it - in recalling the soul-crushing moments of sadness in life, in his sentimental reflections of his childhood, in his weighing in on two younger men's debate about God's existence (\"I see His traces wherever flowers bloom\"), and as he thinks about his mortality.   Some comic relief is provided in his relationship with housekeeper, who brings a smile when she leaves her door ajar as she goes to bed in case he \"wants anything\", after having bickered with him for the entire movie (and presumably decades of their lives).    \n\nI don't see the film as being optimistic or pessimistic, or as much 'warmer' than his other work, though other viewers certainly seem to and there are moments of charm, such as when the young woman of the three he gives a ride to talks to him, asks him for advice, and sweetly says she loves him as they part.  Bibi Andersson played both this role and the role of the girl in the strawberry patch that he lost, which has a certain symmetry and renewal to it.  However, I think the movie is realistic and balanced, with just as much bittersweetness as sweetness - even the married couple they nearly get into a car accident with make endless snide comments about one another - and its genius is in showing us truths about life that are common to us all.   \n\nWhile the movie doesn't preach or overtly push a message, you realize just how hard it is to lead a virtuous, positive life without regrets - and reflect on your own life, where you place priorities, how you treat people, whether you appreciate the small moments, or recognize the pivotal ones - all the things that you will probably remember at the end.  Great art does this, spur reflection, and that's the case with 'Wild Strawberries'.   Don't believe all the hype, but at the same time, don't be intimidated either - this would be a good one to see.",

A sentimental story of an elderly man reaching the end of his life while looking back on it, Wild Strawberries is a film more traditional than Bergman's known for, sweet, funny, and emotionally affecting in a way that most of his work intentionally avoids.\n\nHis signature themes are at play here (existentialism, an awareness of death, religion), but this specific story allows him to move into territory he had not explored previously. Nightmarish dream sequences inform the life of Isak Borg, warning him of his impending death and forcing him into bouts of nostalgia. His story addresses ideas that deal with how life can turn kind people into cruel cynics, how single events completely change a person's trajectory, the guilt associated with devoting your life to a single path and the fear that you've wasted it all in the process, how life's greater mysteries remain even after a lifetime of living, and how we gloss over bad memories in order to coddle ourselves as we move forward. These themes are heady, but coalesce into a genuinely moving portrait of an old man who's going through what all people must go through eventually, a quietly brilliant piece of heartfelt filmmaking from a director known for dealing more with the cerebral but capable of adeptly addressing all aspects of the human experience.",

It's genuinely touching, and I love that there's actually a happy ending for once. I was really invested in Isak, and I really loved Sara, both because of her innate charm and the fact that Bibi Andersson was playing her. I really liked the dynamic with the group, for some reason, and I was actually touched when Sara, Anders, and Viktor sang for Isak at the end. I felt so happy for Isak, and I was so glad he got to make peace with his lot in life.\n\nThere were less fantastical elements than usual in this film, which I also liked, since I've always preferred the Bergman movies that just have a touch of fantasy or mystery, not a whole plot based around disorientation. In this case, the 'fantasy' was the dreams Isak had, but none of them deeply confused me, really.

Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, in his last screen performance, does a tumultuous performance as a man both benevolent and bitter, and really connects to audience's during the film's warmest moments. A very transient script (perhaps a result of Bergman's hospitalization) also makes the film have a particular mantra for the director's filmography, complete with vivid dream sequences that make the film surreal in parts, yet never distract from it's plausibility. Another masterpiece from Sweeden's most revered auteur, and a singular entry for him if only because it ends so optimistically for a change.",

A life that has impacted those around him in ways he has not realized. Though sentimental, there are classic Bergman surreal moments captured in dreams and memories.

It's an intellectual, less schmaltzy European version of 'It's a Wonderful Life'.  \n\nThe film is the odyssey of a rather cold, cerebral and elderly highly respected professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) as he goes on the road with his sensitive and prickly daughter in law to receive an out of town honor.  Along the way, they visit Borg's even older and even colder 90 something mother.\n\nDon't give up.  The film initially seems to meander aimlessly.  Numerous apparently unrelated events unfold, including a submersion into Borg's past memories, picking up a trio of young and naive hitchhikers, the rather prickly exchanges with the mother, an encounter with a bitter and unpleasant middle aged couple that have had a car crash, and various dark revelations by Marianne the daughter in law about her teetering marriage to Borg's difficult son, who has inherited his father's cold and isolating tendencies. \n\nBy the end, the film presents a unified whole of a man coming to terms with his life and taking down the high walls from others with which he has isolated himself.  He forgives himself for his choices and his treatment of others, and is able to not only reconcile but express love for his pregnant daughter in law, the sensual and expressive Marianne, played by iconic Swedish beauty Ingrid Thulin. Look also for Bergman's favorite screen performer Max Von Sydow in a cameo performance as a small town gas station owner who reminds Borg of the good he has done in his life.  He shows some range as he is convincing as a simple goodhearted working man, a contrast from his usual high minded, tortured intellectual characters.\n\nThe crisp and gorgeous black and white photography of Bergman's early collaborator Gunnar Fischer presents the story not in gritty documentary style, but in picturesque, highly contrasting stylized compositions.  This is appropriate to the memories and elegiac retrospective of Borg's life.  Rarely cited as a Bergman favorite due to it's rambling nature, quiet introspection and the subtlety of its revelations, it may be his best film.  It's certainly his gentlest.",

Whatever these ideals are, it doesn't matter, all that matters is that we capture them because we believe that achieving such subjective desires will provide us with a sense of purpose. However, if we capture such ideals will that guaranteed our happiness? Maybe so, maybe not. 'Wild Strawberries'  illuminates the occasion and the question that lingers over humanity, a question and a reflective state that everyone will eventually have to answer: Has the pursue of my personal ideals gave me a sense of satisfaction? Or have I only accomplished neglecting the moments of happiness that matter most? It's a question that I know I will have to face, and I hope I find an answer that contains resolution.  \r\n\r\n'Wild Strawberries' situates it's story around Dr. Isak Borg (Sjostrom), an aged professor who is near the end of his life. Bergman's choice to develop the narrative around an aged man obviously reflects the notion to what extent does an individuals life contain a sense of purpose; as when we reach such an age, we reflect over the regrets and decisions that we have contributed to the universe and wonder if our life was a failure or an achievement. Borg is man who has achieved such accomplishing ideals; he is regarded as an honorary scientist and is being rewarded a prestige honor for his contribution. However, despite such virtues, Borg is also a man surrounded by isolation and regrets. Through a self reflective journey and a number of typical, but always memorable dream sequences; Bergman ultimately question such ideals that humanity continually stride for and that they only end with a superfluous purpose.\r\n\r\nBorg introduces us into his life; he inhabits a world that revolves around a sense of isolation which has been contributed from his egotistical nature. After we learn Borg's nature, Bergman introduces his favorite motif: Dream sequences. Borg's first dream takes place within a mysterious street. The street consist of clock that has no handles, a 'man' with a seriously weird head with the accompany of a hearse. Each separate figure represents a form of deterioration: the clock has lost its ability to tell time, the man eventually losses his head and there is a dead body within the hearse that resembles Borg's figure. Through this dream, Bergman is suggesting that death is just around the corner for Borg. Similar to the other sequences, Bergman deploys dreams and memories as a self-reflective state to display Borg's past. Each separate sequence contains it's importance, whether it consist of moments of revelation or innocence, they are moments that Borg wishes he could correct.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a fan of Bergman's brilliant ability in conveying the subconscious, Don't be afraid! 'Wild Strawberries' is obviously one of Bergman's most accessible films, contributed greatly from Victor Sjostrom performance. With a film that focuses a substantial amount of it's plot around the actions of a single man, it's important for the audience that we share an emotional connection, to which Sjostrom excels brilliantly in conveying his characters isolation and the lost of his true love. Through a reflective state of his innocence, Borg reveals that his true love left him for another man. In one particular and truly poignant dream sequence, Borg's love holds a mirror to his face and proceeds in mocking and situating Borg to a subordinate position as she tells him \"I'm going to marry your brother.\" We see Borg on the verge of tears as he whimpers \"But it hurts so.\" Undeniably heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, 'Wild strawberries' functions as a self-reflective journey of an individual. Through typical Fashion, Bergman uses Borg's life as an examination of the human condition in relation to our obsession of pursuing ideals that will ultimately eventuate in reminiscing over the sacred moments that we have neglected. Bergman solidifies this through the final sequences. Borg receives his prestige honor through an empty ritual; his reward contains no purpose. However, through the ending many of characters seem to find a sense of resolution, consider Borg's and Sara's (Andersson) final conversation,  \"Good-bye, father Isak. Can't you see you're the one I love? Today, tomorrow and forever\" to which Borg replies  \"I'll keep that in mind,\" and then for the final time we enter Borg's dreams to find that his mother and father are fishing by the river. Surprisingly, Borg's dream contains a sense of happiness rather than a sense of gloom. Borg now contains peace and tranquility,  he can die in happiness.\r\n\r\nEssential Bergman.",

With him his judgmental daughter-in-law and young hitchhikers caught in a love triangle. While 90% of the film was in the car ride only 50% of that was Isak actively in the car. We had many flashbacks and strange dreams which brought out David Lynches \"Eraserhead\" type of feeling out. The directing was almost perfect except I believe the camera work for the car crash scene was a tad off, making it confusing. It's still a good Ingmar Bergman film that I enjoyed.

Victor Sj\u00c3\u00b6str\u00c3\u00b6m is undeniably convincing, as the intelligent professor, who shut out all of the relationship that he had and concentrated only on his selfish life made up of hard work and materialistic needs.

            "content": "\"may contain spoiler\"\nIt looks like Wild Strawberries implies the nostalgia and the translation has lost the true meaning. This is because Wild Strawberries are the memory of the short nice warm summer in the normally cold Sweden. In this movie, Bergman digs into the layers of the personality of the protagonist once more, this time with everything being around the concept of love (he later made \"through a glass darkly\" where he talks about faith and love. However, love is not the main theme there). \nThere are to time directions in the movie as the movie goes on: 1- in the forward direction, the memories of the protagonist, Dr. Isak Borg, from his childhood to his more mature state of being. He deals with his memories in the face of death. As it is captured in a scene from his car, everything is forward, youth, middle ages, and current state, from back to the front seat of the car. He is in a state composed of dreams (his dreams) and intellectualism (discussions with his daughter in law) and he can clearly understand his remorse (unsuccessful loveless marriage in the shadow of his conceitedness; his life which is wasted on his passion with abstract science, something that he cannot remember anything of it in a surreal scene of his ridiculing examination in an exam room, something that cannot help him; his refrain from approaching Sarah (the way he sees the event. however the event might have happened in another way: Sarah has chosen Victor-Isak's brother- over him, which can be supported by hitchhiker Sarah's argument over her decision between the two other hitchhikers); being betrayed by his wife; not staying at the small town of the gas station, where his science would not remain abstract, where the people would admire him and his work; and finally his relationship with his mother) and remembers his happy moments of life (Sarah and his parents).\nHowever, 2 - as the hand-less clock in his dream depicts, time does not have a neither meaning nor direction here. He lives concurrent with the events from the past (memories) in different time directions. In fact, time and time direction are both undefined. The second direction is how Isak captures himself: from an old age university professor at the beginning of the movie towards his childhood at the end of the movie when he encounters his parents at a scenery lake, next to his childhood house, from his outer-most level of personality towards the inner-most level. There is only one character who represents Isak at all ages, but the sensuality and dreams define him.\nNow let's see what makes Isak happy and calm out of this turbulent journey and what does he remember right before death. The answer is love, and looks like Bergman has a special credit for the love of Isak for his parents (something that he does not utter but it is sunk at the deepest level of his mind). This claim might be disputed based on Bergman's self relationship with his parents, specifically his father.\nThe Wild Strawberries has inspired the movie, \"eternity and a day\" directed by Theodoros Angelopoulos. Despite being strong, the latter falls short with respect to the Wild Strawberries.",

Wild Strawberries has intelligent and well thought out cinematography, and if there's one overwhelming positive to be walked away with, it's that this is worth watching for the sheer craft of it.  There's always a lot going on, from the visuals to the conversational topics, and that's in spite of this not the fastest paced of films.  I wouldn't say you have to be patient with it, but if you're going to watch this and have already grown accustomed to the modern sense of structure and flow in movies, you should see this when you're in the mood for something quieter.

Superbly written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, we all follow the doctor on a journey where he will be honoured for the fiftieth anniversary of receiving his degree. We find out through the real directing poetry, that for Doctor Borg, this journey is from  life to death while he travels besieged by memories. \r\n\r\nThe original Swedish title is Smultronst\u00e4llet, which literally means \"the wild strawberry patch\", but idiomatically means an underrated gem of a place (often with personal or sentimental value) - and that is a perfect title for this classical work of art. . I watched it few times, since I was 13 and always managed to find something new in it... but Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's acting wasn't new... it was seen and perfect together with my favourite Ingrid Thulin.  Bergman's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (Bergman's silent film idol) and they both did a great job working together while Ingrid Thulin plays Marianne, the sad gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. The interesting thing is that Bergman wrote the screenplay of Wild Strawberries in Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital (the workplace of Isak Borg).  \r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest films ever, if you ask me! It won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival, \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actor\" at the Mar del Plata Film Festival and won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film in 1960. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Original Screenplay. The film is included on the Vatican Best Films List, recommended for its portrayal of a man's \"interior journey from pangs of regret and anxiety to a refreshing sense of peace and reconciliation\". In a 1963 interview with Cinema magazine Stanley Kubrick listed the film as his second favourite of all time.\r\n\r\nIt should be on everyone's \"must see\" list!",

Yet the way it has stuck with me is a testament to Bergman's intimate understanding of the human psyche: fear, desire, regret, loss, cynicism. Bergman managed to coax legendary silent film director, Victor Sjostrom, out of retirement to star as Isak Borg, an aging professor who is traveling to receive an honourary degree. His performance is poweful, and much of the impact of the film's meditation on loss and mortality comes from the metanarrative similarities between Borg, Sjostrom, and Bergman himself. The story is structured as an early road movie, in which Borg recounts memories of the past during his trip, meeting people along the way who remind him of others he once knew. While Bergman's masterful use of symbolism is a subject that could fill a graduate thesis, and is too much to explore in this short review, it is sufficient to state it is in prime form here, and much of the joy of watching the film comes from seeing the ways Bergman weaves symbolism with narrative. Ultimately, Wild Strawberries is a humanist piece that suggests it is our relationships with people, rather than our accomplishments, that will come to define us in our final hour. Surprisingly uplifting  in the end, this is a film worth visiting again and again.",

This film came along at a time in my life when i needed it the most. This is without question one of Bergman's best and for sentimental reasons it's probably my favorite but that's a tough task picking a favorite of his films.",

Elderly doctor journeys from Stockholm to Lund, the location of his alma mater, in order to pick up honorary degree, meeting some likeable, and some unlikeable characters along the way, and pausing for a break at the house of his childhood. That's pretty much all that actually happens in this film, so if you're looking for plot thrills then don't bother to spend 100 minutes of your life watching this. However, if you have the appetite for a dense character study whereby you'll encounter a crotchety, egotistical buffoon at first and end up rooting for him as he finally realises what has been missing all of his life then this is for you. The dream and daydream sequences, particularly the distressingly recognisable nightmare Dr Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sjostrom in his final role; just 3 years away from his own death he lends a completely natural performance to a character who knows it's all coming to an end and there is so much that could have been different and better) has at the beginning of the film, where he dreams his own funeral in a small deserted town are captivating and visually the strongest part of the work.\n\nA wonderful film which bears any number of repeated, regular viewings.",

Don't get me wrong \"Wild Strawberries\" is a strong film that is quite brilliant at times, but I'll take something like \"The Seventh Seal\" or \"Persona\" over this any day. Now, I'll admit, I'm not too good at analyzing these type of films, but like most of Bergman films there's a deeper meaning hidden with everything. Some deal with the harsh realities of life and others ask the question if God exists. I think \"Wild Strawberries\" does a bit a both, and that's probably why it has become one of the most critically lauded films in the European canon. Again, like all other Bergman films, \"Wild Strawberries\" is technically great. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is wonderful and story is rather touching at times.\r\n\r\nThe film does a magnificent job of taking the viewer inside the life of Isak Borg. While watching the viewer sees that Borg has lived a cold existence and because of this he is all alone, with the exception of his house maid. He lost the one true love of his life, Sara, to his brother and as he got older he became more and more selfish. Borg senses that he is approaching his inevitable death and during his trip to receive his honorary award he is haunted by his past memories. He must deal with his faults and worry wether or not he will be judged for all his wrong doings once he is dead. \"Wild Strawberries\" is a good film that beautifully ask some important questions, however, I just find this to be inferior to Bergman's other work.",

The dream sequences are haunting and emotionally powerful and definitely something anyone, especially me, can relate to. Who doesn't have confusing dreams that screw around with our thoughts and frighten us severely when we wake up?

What a flipped charmer. What a knock out of the park. What a way to serialize mortality with enlightenment, and carefully translate the familiarity of everyday life with the specific resemblance of teatime dreams. With that \"Wild Strawberries\" romanticizes so surreally a single man's intellectual cripple that he enters the modern age kicking and screaming and breaks Ingmar Bergman's fourth wall. It's clear he doesn't just have connections with each of his characters, but shaped relationships, personal because they're each united states.\n\nEveryone's different degrees of lost in \"Wild Strawberries\", starting first and foremost with patriarch Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), a physician under a gravely influence and the remarkable ability to recall his past lives in slumber. His dreams are all that keep him running, and the only falsities he should choose to trust. Daughter-in-law Marianna (Ingrid Thulin) is unsettled to discover she can relate with Isak's doubts, being pregnant and thinking of splitting with Isak's son Evlund and all. Watch the two in the front seat of Isak's car, as Isak discloses to her his having to imagine being dead in order to convince others there's still something beating inside of him. Then a trio of hitchhikers Marianne and Isak have picked up en route to Lund, Sweden, where the latter is to accept a landmark medical award, approach Isak's window and hand him a picked bouquet of flowers. He knows the world by heart, they tell him. If only he could just appreciate the gesture; he's too broken from the aged decease of his wife to comprehend the arms open around him. \n\nIsak isn't a martyr, nor is Bergman. They both of them believe that only through blood can the light of truth be crystal. Isak might have seen his wife as his own, and the kid in Marianne's belly his last untouched heir, but he's moreover jealous of either. He knows the world's heart well enough to understand there isn't much of one to listen for.",

Like DET SJUNDE INSEGLET (The Seventh Seal) and JUNGFRUKAELLAN (The Virgin Spring), it treats issues of religious faith and fear of death, but in a much less coherent way. Yet, SMULTRONSTAELLET may be the most charming and endearing of the trilogy, as we watch a crusty old man examine his past and decide to treat those around him better.\n\nThe Scrooge-like figure is Isak Borg (Viktor Sjostrom), a retired professor of medicine now in his 78th year. Invited from his Stockholm home to receive an honourary degree at Lund University, he decides to travel the distance by car. Accompanying him on this outing is his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is experiencing marital troubles with his son Evald (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Along the way, Borg stops at some old stomping grounds, such as the summer house he spent his childhood at, and the area where he first practiced medicine. As Borg drifts into reveries of old memories, we discover how he became so bitter and hostile, but Marianne's incisive comments push him towards rediscovering his humanity.\n\nOf course death is an ever-present spectre when Borg is pushing 80. But the strong religious element comes when Borg and Marianne pick up three hitchhikers, a young lady (Bibi Andersson) with her boyfriend and a family-appointed chaperone. One of these lads wants to be a priest and has strong faith, while the other is hoping to become a doctor and doubts the existence of a god. They quarrel, but somehow this entire matter seems unrelated to the main arc of the film. Similarly baffling is Evald's babblings about how he doesn't want a child because he himself does not want to exist, in which the writing almost seems parody Bergman. \n\nThe acting, however, is superb. Sjostrom really brings his character to life with his initial bah-humbug mannerisms and his later senile puzzlement that he cannot win everyone back to him right away. It's amusing to see Bibi Andersson playing a ditzy teenager, a role light years away from her intense turn in Bergman's PERSONA almost a decade later.\n\nThe most economic way to see SMULTRONSTAELLET is in the Criterion Collection set of four Bergman films from the 1950s.",

But I should come to expect deep when watching Bergman. This film to me was about of course, life, death, existentialism, the existence of god (common Bergman so far) and our being for ourselves and of course others.\r\n\r\nI'm always amazed how he comes out with these stories though. They seem to keep my attention when they shouldn't. Bergman was an innovator in the way stories are told on the screen, they feel so natural. His touch is very sophisticated. But maybe it's the black and white, it's mesmerizing. It could also be the babe combo of Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin....wa wa wee wa.\r\n\r\nI think all the actors did a fine job. I believe that Bergman's strength is the conviction of his actors and the way his stories so effortlessly unfold like onions. This one felt like a road trip movie, which it was. I almost always like those because in film the characters tend to find themselves during those trips, which makes for entertaining cinema for the most part. This one in particular. I love how we see the relationships form on screen, and how subtle the story is tolf through the characters and not by beating us over the head or insulting our intelligence. \r\n\r\n(List of road trip favorites off the top of my head: National Lampoons Vacation, Little Miss Sunshine, Sideways, 28 Days Later, Children of Men....well all of these are to some extent).",

Bergman fleshes out the life of Dr. Isak Borg while at the same time bringing us more intimately closer to the universal fear of death.

            "content": "Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries\" is one of a kind because of its utterly unique exploration of an old man's life as time pass by; his guilt, his love, and the times where he perceived \"coldness and death\" as a way of life. The film's focus is to a contemplating doctor(I cannot say protagonist or  hero) way past his prime, whose existence and mortality was emotionally awaken by a nightmare, where him, standing on an empty street, encounters a version of himself lying inside a coffin.It may have been a more than obvious metaphysical symbolism inserted by Bergman, but I think it's the only way to convey his intent: That a man, when encountered by the very hands of death, even in dreams, is an ironic catalyst for a final salvo to re-discover, appreciate, and face life as it is. This simple plot has since been adapted by mainstream cinema, using a 'roadtrip' to further the exploration of the characters. And it is from that sub-genre alone that I can really set apart \"Wild Strawberries\" from other film of the same type. Although some films derived from the idea has been great pieces of cinema all by itself(e.g. \"About Schmidt\"), this film's approach is what made the difference. \"Wild Strawberries\" gets an omniscient insight through man's regrets, guilt and insecurities not through relatives and some problems that are placed on the end of the road to serve as life-affirming plot devices. Bergman found another alternative: The interior world of one's mind. It's so effective that in the end, even though nothing but a bit of subtle change has transpired in the tangible reality, he was much, much better, and refurnished inside. He may not have expressed everything that he would have said and done before to make it all better, but alas, he already knew, that he can just 'fade' away with a smile.\n\nP.S. Ingrid Thulin was extremely beautiful in this film.",

A man, jaded by old age, revisits his past on his way to a recognition ceremony.  The dream sequences is are dream-like (no small feat) and the subtle transformation, not only of Isak Borg, but of everyone that he crosses paths with, feels natural and emotionally rewarding.  It's an ultimately satisfying and positive outlook on life, but it doesn't sweep up the sadness that comes with a life long-lived.  As someone who fears old age, the profundity of its \"message\" is comforting.  One of my favorite films.  Ever.",

The journey he takes, both literally to get his honorary degree and the metaphorical journey of his soul, is quiet, serene, and always breathtaking.  Fine acting, impeccable staging and beautiful filmmaking define the first of Bergman's (for me) two definitive masterpieces, which makes his later films all the more frustrating due to their ambitious emptiness.

This amongst other quandaries in his indefinite classic, Wild Strawberries, the coming of death film that takes a top down approach to the typical formula of coming of age. Mind you, this movie was made at the turn of the old world approach so in retrospect over half a century later.\nOther questions:\nIs the post-modern world where expressing ones feelings, removal of old world manners and habits more productive?\nWhat does it mean to be a Swedish woman at the turn from traditional to contemporary?\nIs having ten kids still necessary?\nWhat really happens when one dies?\nHow does someone young judge someone so old?\n\n?A doctor earns more money and ministers are out of date.?says a young Bibi Anderson while discussing her potential marriage partners. As the youngest member of the film, her role carries significant weight as to the effect she has on her elder, Professor Borg.\n\nComing out of age or coming into it, the traditional, rational professor enters the modern world and sees the old traditions being thrown out the window. He doesn?t mind despite appearances as he sees the day devoted to his professorship (he is driving to the ceremony for a well-known achievement in academic award). \nIn his death sentence, the professor observes his childhood crush crush him by marrying his brother, later he observes his deceased wife having a rough and wild rendezvous in the forest, his daughter-in-law accuse him of being rude, callous and unaware of his son?s feelings. The only true praise the old man receives is when he stops at a gas station in a small country town and is admired by the gas attendant and his wife for his service of the town in the past. If only my daughter-in-law could hear this, he thinks and then drives on. Well, she drives on for he may or may not be dead at this point. Of course, the film is blurred between the professor?s dream state and his waking state, divided in Bergman?s brilliant fashion. To observe it from a generation standpoint: Every other line in this film is tumblr quotepic worthy. \n\nThe most important scene could be when the professor, after his day of youthful follies, jumbled events, and death dreams, he asks his maid of thirty odd years who is as stubborn as any old woman could be, if possibly they could call each other by their first names. Of course not, Mr. Borg! First of all, the old lady, who the professor is forced to refer to as Ms. Agada, will not take part in any intimacies. Secondly, what would people think? It would ruin their reputation and have people laugh at them. ?But we?re so old now?, why should that matter contemplates the professor. He realizes she is right as his active maid cleans out his mouth guard and busies herself with something housework related. The old man remains the old man, unable to escape his old world ties as he falls asleep alone. Whether he dies or not, we do not know but at least the professor has his childhood memories to put his mind at ease. \nThe man is too humble, caught in his ways of his cold mother, everyone sees him as cold, dead, and lonely and he only realizes it when it is too late. Is this Bergman?s attempt at telling the rather depressed Swedes to brighten up, and live, after all they have his films to watch and can them understand from a perspective I can only dream about. Probably a death dream at that.",

Particularly interesting are the peculiar dreams Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00c3\u00b6str\u00c3\u00b6m) has and the fears and other depressing thoughts they encompass. Similarly I could really appreciate the artistic value of the childhood flashbacks with the protagonist taking an anachronistic walk right through the scenes, making it even more clear that all this very much concerns him, especially in his old-age reveries. The good thing about Smultronst\u00c3\u00a4llet, I think, is that its theme is basic and serious without resulting in the depressing movie one might have expected to ensue from this. The people in the flashbacks and the servant even have some silly caricature qualities, and the quarreling friends and couples also add to the amusement. The various cases of marital friction (in past and present) that are not so jolly could at least be called very realistic and recognizable. This movie is the first Bergman production I ever saw, and I must admit it well exceeded my expectations, effacing the fearful hopes I had of his work.",

I revisited it twice; therefore I am completely certain of this unfortunate revelation. \"Wild Strawberries\" stars Victor Sjostrom as Professor Isak Borg, a seventy-eight year old man who is about to receive an award for his long time profession as a doctor. Except for the opening scene, the film is set in one day; basically a long car ride with few other companions and some people he meets on the way, including his very old mother. As a whole it is about self-discovery; the most impressive parts are the dream sequences where the old man goes back to his childhood. The very first dream is astonishing, no words are spoken and the old man is lost in empty streets which involve a corpse; it has a darker tone to it. Another one later in the film reveals Isak Borg's relationship with his wife, I felt it should have been limited, darker dreams have more power if there aren't any words spoken; the images tell the story. The great Bibi Andersson along with Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Bjornstrand also appear; I was particularly impressed with Andersson who plays two roles, one in the past and the other in the present. She is incredibly jubilant! I don't really have any eye-opening issues with it. I did felt the characters were a bit constricted. My disappointment is mainly because I had such high hopes, having loved it in my initial viewing (it was my first Bergman), otherwise it's a good, essential work that simply lacks a sort of transcendence, a substance that \"Persona\" has. As of now \"Persona\" and \"Cries and Whispers\" are his two greatest.",

            "content": "Wild Strawberries is a film by Ingmar Bergman that deals with the fear of death.  The film follows Professor Isak Borg as he is on his way to receive an honorary degree.  Along his journey he is confronted with dreams and flashbacks that show the shortcomings of his life and his approaching death.  Through these experiences Isak begins to learn where he failed and how, even later on he can change and rediscover himself.  \r\n\r\nThe film shows what really matter in the end in an interesting and true way.  Isak consistently has flashbacks to his childhood and the times of life he most treasured.  These are vivid, clear, and consistent.  What Isak does not seem to recall much of is what the world would call his prime.  In one dream he fails his examination and cannot remember anything he learned and proceeds to relive a moment where he caught his wife with someone else.  This dream implies that the prime of life is fleeting and ultimately forgotten; it is one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood that often is what returns the closer to death one gets.  As Isak recognizes his coming death it makes his childhood seem so much clearer and he realizes that there really wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that long in between.\r\n\r\nBergman again addresses his own fears of death and the fact that as he gets older the things from his childhood become clearer again.  Throughout the film there are hints of birth and death being close together symbolizes how close our birth and death really is.  There are many allegories within the film and it would take more than one watch to fully understand all that is within the film.  Bergman directs another masterpiece and it is one that can easily and directly relate to all kinds of people.\r\n\r\nWild Strawberries is an impressive technical achievement too.  The music is perfectly matched to the scenes and themes and the sounds (as Bergman always does) enhance the viewing experience and completely add impact to the scene they are in.  The acting is great and the photography and editing is perfect.  The opening scene with him at his desk is beautiful and the following scene of his dream/nightmare the night before is haunting and inspired.  Bergman took great effort to make that scene perfect and it is fully captured that way from the sound of the heartbeats in silence to the extreme light to the body that virtually disintegrates to the coffin which falls off the buggy and contains a frightening discovery for Isak.  The whole film is a work of art and a masterpiece and is yet another one of Bergman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proving his greatness as a director.",

            "content": "This did not disappoint. From the opening nightmare, which is strikingly haunting, to the final look on Victor Sjostrom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, as his Professor Borg lays in bed and contemplates the fullness of his life, I found the film to be a wonderfully sophisticated work. I found it to be different from the other films of his I have seen, Winter Light and The Seventh Seal, in a sense that it felt warmer and more elegant overall, especially with Borg finally conceding and reciprocating his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love at the end.\n\nHowever, the surreal imagery and chastising dark revelations to the main character are still there, and I think that Bergman hits a flawless balance between handling his themes with gentle commisseration and with penetrating consequence. Sjostrom wonderfully plays Isak Borg, as we see the character change so genuinely throughout the course of his reinacted memories, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever seem forced or trite. He does most of the acting with his facial expressions as he watches his childhood memories unfold before him. The same originality and honesty goes for the things that press Borg about his life, as Bergman decides the most prevalent flaw for the Professor: underneath his mechanical \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice\u00e2\u0080\u009d behavior, he is selfish and ruthless, which is a powerful thing to address about anyone. It is open for interpretation, as the ending is bittersweet. Borg realizes his flaws and makes amends with his family, and is told that he is now well-liked. However, he is still an old man who feels he has wasted his life.\n\nAs usual, this is beautifully shot, with very heavy light and dark contrasts. Borg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dreamscapes seem surreal with blurred shadow here and there. The music is forboding yet somber. Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Bjornstrand are their usual selves, providing an incredible supporting cast. Thulin really shone the most for me, as Marianne wound up being one of the best female characters I have seen in quite some time. She is empathetic and forgiving of Borg, yet she is also the one who is the most blunt with him about his behaviors as a human being. While we may fault her for being as blunt as she is, we can only thank her for her help by the end. When all is said and done, these words from Bibi Anderrson provide hope of reconcile for our main character:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodbye, Father Isak. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one I love? Today, tomorrow, and forever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

His camera is his tool which he uses to its fullest capacity.  He shows us emotions through his movements, everything very subtle but still there.  While hollywood still had a backdrop-hollywood feel to it, with very over the top performances which reminded us more of theater, Bergman wanted realism out of his actors, which is proven by the performances which are all fantastic, and as I said, feel real.  I must also mention the score which is extremely beautiful (I actually sat and watched the DVD Menu for a couple of minutes to listen to it)\nA touching story about life and death and memories well done.

Besides the typical Ingmar Bergman's camera angles, visual style and melancholy theme, this film showcases a more optimistic side of the director. It's about a 76-years old professor who goes on a road trip with his daughter in-law to receive an honorary doctorate degree. On their way, he had weird dreams, going back to his past. In these dreams and day-time imaginations, he's able to see the girl he loved, Sara, who married to his good-for-nothing brother. Besides remembering these unhappy moments, he also remembers his own bitter marriage, and self-reflection of his deeds and his punishment, \"loneliness\". As the plot seems sad and boring, I had to force myself to watch it, but surprisingly it's very enjoyable and sweet. He meets another Sara on the way, a young girl, who is accompanied by two men. They hitched a ride with the old man and his daughter in-law. They have an accident with another car on the way, and that car breaks down, the couple in the car, who are constantly arguing with each other in comedic ways, hitched a ride with the old man's group, adding to the lively dialogues, mood and comedy of the film.
