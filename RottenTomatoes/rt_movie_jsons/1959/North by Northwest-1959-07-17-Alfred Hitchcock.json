There's the female character, Eve, who all but swoons for the main character, Roger Thornhill (its relatively cheesy at times, I think its fair to say) but of course its hardly a new film. I quite liked that what was really going on wasn't made clear from the get go - seeing things through Roger's eyes was quite intriguing. I could certainly understand his frustration, given the situations he found himself in. I liked that there had clearly been some thought put into the script and there were some instances of amusing and sharp-witted dialogue, such as when a ticket seller at a train starion asks if there's something wrong with his eyes (he's wearing sunglasses to conceal who he is) and he replies 'their sensitive to questions'.\n\nThis film features a decent cast with Cary Grant as Roger and James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, among others. Plus there's the usual Hitchcock cameo at the very start of the film. If your a fan of mystery thrillers and/or Hitchcock films then yes, I would certainly recommend it.",

The master of the genre doesn't seem to be aiming high here (he admitted it himself)--he was just trying to make a fun, exciting thriller. And in that respect he passed with flying colors. The sturdy plotting allows the tension to remain throughout but gives us momentary lapses of relaxation. Here's a chase film that gives us time to breathe and care about what happens to the characters. But when the suspense kicks into high gear, the heat is on. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint play off each other deliciously and give the film some of it's wicked wit. The lighter moments don't all work, and without Hitchcock's symbolic polish there's not a whole lot to chew over here. But take it in, and here is a pulse-pounder to get your adrenaline pumping. Simply terrific",

Hitchcock has a couple of shots at the United Nations that are mid-century modern amazing \u2014 I also loved the campiness of the ending at Mt. Rushmore. Cary Grant is the definition of cool \u2014 he also wore the coolest thing ever, probably. During his entire trek, Roger Thornhill (Grant) is suited up, his hair never breaking from the perfect 50s comb-over. At 6'1 and slender, Grant is slithery and smooth, whether he's fighting fist-to-cuffs or sweet-talking the love interest, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). It's a classic that has succumbed to parody, but that's a compliment. It's a must-watch for the cinephile, but still an enjoyable (if not sometimes silly) ride for most.",

I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",

It's a spy thriller, adventure mystery, and romantic comedy bundled into one masterclass film that's able to balance these varied tones and narrative archetypes in inventive ways. The film is home to one of my all-time favorite shots: the top-down view of Thornhill running from the U.N. building right after the assassination. It perfectly captures how looming the dangers are, how large the stakes are, and how infinitesimal he is against these circumstances. The crop duster scene is superb in its build-up and in those iconic shots of the plane screaming by. It has the absolute sexiest flirtation scene on a train ever put to film. The dialogue is still smart and riveting 60 years later. The twists and turns are compelling. The ending is abrupt but I can see the appeal in that sort of match cut. This film legitimately fires on all cylinders. Full five.",

Some of the dialogue and quips are hilarious and Cary Grant is great however I don't find myself being that engrossed in the characters the way I do with vertigo, rope or rear window. Cary grants character doesn't seem to be that bothered by the fact that he has suddenly been swept up in a murder mystery. He just kinda goes along with it which again is contrasted by the real emotional stakes of vertigo, rear window and psycho. However, I'd say the story is well written but is lacking the interesting characters of Hitchcock's other films.",

I can forgive the non-4K footage, but I will not be forgiving things like bad acting. With this in mind, I did not like this film. In fact, this type of film most likely inspired lots of other plot centered films in the more recent decades. Plain and simple, a story should be about a character, not the plot. This movie was not a story at all, rather a situation. The acting was not good at all, from anyone involved. Quite frankly I would have rather read this film then watched it. All of this being said, my least favorite part of this film is the terrible choice in cinematography. Now, don't get me wrong. There are some amazing landscape shots, and this is mainly the case because EVERY SINGLE SHOT IN THIS FILM IS A WIDE SHOT! It's the most frustrating thing to watch ever, there is nothing personal at all about this film because of it. You will never get close to the characters if the camera can't. It just seems like such an amateur film with a insanely pretentious runtime. I don't think 2h and 16 minutes is a long movie, for some movies 3 hours isn't long. This movie would have been great with a tight 100 minutes. Instead it overvalued itself and let the movie really hang out in the wind to let the audience have time to breath in every single scene. This is great in a slow film, but this is a spy film that is attempting to be intense and exciting. For a film to be fast, the scenes must be fast. The fact that I walked away from an action packed film feeling like nothing happened plot wise is a bad sign. All of this being said, this is clearly a film that has inspired many of the best spy and suspense films out there. For that reason I believe that it's a 6/10 purely for inspiration to filmmakers.",

The premise is enjoyable, and clearly inspired many other movies to come decades after, but I just think this movie okay.

That the whole game of intrigue turns on such a sliver of a misunderstanding at the beginning and then turns in to not just any cat-and-mouse game with crosses and double-crosses, the whole plot is played out based on an unexpected and nationally publicized murder. The directing, the set ups and the scenery, the timing and, most of all, the stellar acting by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint make for a superlatively seamless film.

Even the iconic cropduster chase is sort of dumb when you think about it; the villain planned to send Grant's Thornhill to a remote Midwestern bus stop, so a low-flying prop plane could swing down and hit him, maybe spray a few bullets for fun? There is plenty more; Thornhill being framed for a stabbing in the UN and then just sort of walking out, and a nameless thug waiting to actually jump out with a piano wire while dangling over Mt. Rushmore rather than any of the 100,000 more convenient ways to kill someone in that situation. The story is often sacrificed for the shot, though there are a few shots in there that make you stand up and take notice. Saint's Kendall is an almost comically over-the-top honeypot character, though her role markedly improves as she is presented as more of a 'conventional' spy further on. There's a leaner film based on the mistaken identity spy caper plot begging to get out, but the production team opted for over-the-top instead. I can hardly call this near the top of Hitchcock's output (Rebecca, Vertigo, and Rear Window easily outstrip it, in my opinion), and certainly not near the greatest films of all time. (3.5/5)",

Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a man on the run. Mistaken by a group of thugs to be a federal agent/spy, Roger is taken to the mysterious Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Phillip doesn't believe Roger's story that he isn't the spy named George Kaplan. Roger escapes a murder attemp by Vandamm and his thugs and is on the run after being blamed for a murder. Trying to clear his name Roger finds help in a lady named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) who has some intentions of her own. This is a non stop ride where it starts out with a mistaken identity that branches off to a full spy film featuring some great sequences. I enjoy a lot of this movie.

He never lets the content go damp which often happens in such husky script. There is a sense of similarity in here to Polanski's Chinatown, starring Nicholson. And similar to it, the uncertainty is the key to its success.\n\nThe makers are consistently revealing cards in order to keep the audience tangled in the whirls of these flips and turns that can be difficult to swallow. It is a mature script that always chooses over leaving the room with a cutthroat message rather than an explosion. The euphoric energy of the ping pong that the writers play of who is with whom theories, with Hitchcock's sharp execution it never wears off. Also, there is real ruggedness in here, the characters have the range to look elegant and also pull out the most sinister deed of all.\n\nGrant as the real victim proving his innocence isn't always in his A game, his performance isn't persistent in its tone. But what saves the day is both Saint's performance and her character, her alluring suave nature and guns blazing unflinchingly puts her on top of the list. Armed with a smart and meticulous adaptation, Hitchcock takes his time, he is milking out the best from each moment. North By Northwest is less Hitchcock-ish than usual, and it is certainly refreshing.",

            "content": "The best spy film!\n\nNorth by Northwest (1959) is one of Hitchcock's best films. Cary Grant plays a superb everyman that falls into the spy game. Grant is subjected to the worst case of mistaken identity that you can imagine. His good looks, genuine charm, and humorous take on his situation will have you rooting for him the whole way. Grant proves his acting chops in the romantic and dramatic moments, while remaining a compelling lead in North by Northwest.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's direction is filled with creative perspectives and panning shots you'll be hard pressed to find elsewhere. North by Northwest is exquisitely filmed and perfectly framed. The characters are charming and likable, while the romance is believable and grounded. The plot twists and espionage narrative are fascinating to watch unfold. \n\nEva Marie Saint is the embodiment of a femme fatale in North by Northwest. She is drop dead gorgeous and immaculately dressed by Hitchcock's costume department. Her dresses and make-up are as iconic as her wit and smoldering appearance. Saint is the perfect foil to Grant's everyman. She is lovely and sweet and plays the dramatic moments with a subtle grace. The dangerous vibe about her is offset by her clever dialogue and delivery. \n\nI must mention Bernard Herrmann's iconic score. Herrmann keeps your heart pounding along with the action thanks to his dire soundtrack and symphony. The melodies are catchy unto themselves, but the music ups the pace into a sprint to safety. I love North by Northwest's score.\n\nLastly, James Mason and Martin Landau are excellent as the ever plotting villains in North by Northwest. They maintain an easy charm and charisma, while displaying a sheer vicious nature underneath it all. I think the James Bond series had to have taken influence from North by Northwest due to these villain, the score, and the spy narrative.\n\nIn all, North by Northwest is Hitchcock at his finest.",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock. This was probably my favorite of his movies I have seen thus far. \nHitchcock essentially invented this psychological thriller. An innocent man that finds himself in the middle of a ploy much bigger than himself. \n When our main character Roger Thornhill is framed for being Ian Caplin, he is suddenly followed but some very dangerous, killer characters. Though the odds are stacked against him, Roger trudges on to find out the truth of this situation. \nThe movie feels fresh when compared to the thrillers of today. Our main character Roger is no rugged man. He's almost feminine in his mannerisms and dialect. He has no love interest, he's not particularly likable although he is handsome. He's a mama's boy. We are not following the story of some ferocious or disconcerted man. Ruger is us, clueless, imperfect, and trying to make sense of a life he simply doesn't understand. I think that's why this movie is so damn attractive. We watch Rodger transform into a hero, and we subconsciously think I bet we would do that too! \nAny movie fan will tell you that this is a movie, so I won't go into the nitty gritty details of why. You could find a whole book on it online! In general, the filming technique that combines classic Hollywood cinema and Soviet Montage results in an utterly exhilarating experience. A comical and quirky dialogue bestowed upon handsome actors. A convoluted plot that the audience has the satisfaction of watching be resolved. I believe that Hitchcock's movie is what other film makers today look to for inspiration. He made a thriller that incorporates love, comedy, and doesn't leave the viewer feeling befuddled or bored (think inception or X-Men). \nIf you're looking for a movie that reminds you how thrillers became a genre in Hollywood, this is the movie for you!",

Hitchcock weaves a smooth story and directs a nail-biting thriller that is groundbreaking for its time. Eva Marie Saint is stunningly sexy as the double agent, Eve Kendall, who changes Rogers's life as the adventure takes twists and turns into false endings and confusing directions, bordering on overkill by the time the famous Mt. Rushmore escape from the antagonist, Vandamm, occurs. While a typical film might have been viewed as entirely too long, North by Northwest's maze of a story is classic Hitchcock-ian confusion and, as a result, gets a pass.",

Often touted as one of the best thrillers of all time, I think its fair to say that North by Northwest is considered a \"great\" movie. However, the charms that won over audiences in '59 have worn thin. Cary Grant's performance (and the entire Cary Grant character for that matter) fall flat now that sensibilities on acting have changed. He comes off as more of a snarky jerk than a charismatic everyman. The plot isn't anything remarkable, and none of the characters really have arcs. The protagonist is pretty much the same at the end as he is at the beginning. NxNW does boast revolutionary camerawork (i.e. the plane sequence) but many scenes look just awful (i.e. the Mount Rushmore set). Especially compared to Japanese films of the same era like Seven Samurai and Throne of Blood, North by Northwest feels more like an antique of film history than a piece of recommendable cinema.",

Thornhill gets mistaken for a U.S. secret agent in a chase across the country that involves scenes of death, amazing action sequences of suspense and the love of an attractive female.\nI've heard of Cary Grant of course but I admit to never seeing any of his many films.\nHe immediately reminded me of Sir. Roger Moore with his suave demeanour, one liners whilst under pressure and getting the girl.\nHitchcock films are of course well known for their technical wizardry. North By Northwest doesn't disappoint in this respect.\nSimple scenes of cars and the interior of train carriages filmed in the studio look realistic long before CGI ever existed.\nThe film has several dramatic action sequences that wouldn't have looked out of place in a modern spy film. I'm thinking of a chase sequence whilst being followed by an overhead crop duster and scenes in Mount Rushmore.\nThe film has comedic moments intertwined with scenes of murder. Look out for Thornhill acting the fool at an auction.\nI never expected to be as entertained by such an old film.\nI've missed the countless television showings and cinema rereleases but I will ensure I get to the next one. Their will be one I'm sure for such a good film.\nWhy did Hitchcock never direct a Bond film?",

            "content": "Hitchcock is notorious for many things: Eccentric cartoonish opening credits, a single cameo in the first quarter, extreme attention to detail, an energetic soundtrack, and above all, the twist--A twist that everyone knows is coming but somehow still manages to sneak up on the audience. North by Northwest is no exception. Using camera movements, editing, and sound to help tell the story, Hitchcock's 1959 thriller is a suspenseful, entertaining, cinematic masterpiece. The story begins with Roger Thornhill getting kidnapped, mistaken for a government spy named George Kaplan. After he continually claims innocence, Vandamm--his captor--arranges for his staged death. When Thornhill escapes, the chaos further commences; Thornhill searches for Kaplan and Vandamm, or rather his thugs, search for Thornhill. What makes this movie so unpredictable is the scatteredness of the story. Plot twist: Kaplan isn\u2019t real. Plot twist: Eve Kendall--a woman who helps Thornhill hide from the police--is secretly working for Vandamm. Plot twist: Eve is actually working for the government agency that made Kaplan up. Throughout the chaotic series of events, there is one twist after another twist after another. I went into it trying ridiculously hard to predict these twists. Does Vandamm actually know Thornhill isn\u2019t Kaplan? Or is Thornhill secretly Kaplan? All these assumptions were very possible. I should have know better though. If I was able to think of them so quickly, they were insultingly too obvious for a Hitchcock film. Aside from the twists alone, the story is enhanced by many other factors. The editing in stands out in a couple particular scenes. For example, the scene where Thornhill is put behind the wheel after being forced to consume alcohol is edited like a rollercoaster. It fluctuates back and forth between a shot of Thornhill, half-conscious and without control over his driving, and quickly cuts to an intensely zoomed in perspective shot right before each time he is about crash into to something. Eventually his sight becomes skewed as two separate perspective shots overlap, building up the craziness of the scene even more. A scene that build suspense in a more subtle way is when Thornhill thinks he is meeting Kaplan by a bus stop in the middle of nowhere. How alone he is established through the cinematography, the scene opening with an extreme wide shot. After many cars pass along the freeway, a man drives up from the field across. Immediately, it is suspected to be Kaplan. When the man gets out of the car though and waits by the stop, he doesn\u2019t say anything. Once again, the editing fluctuates back and forth as Thornhill begins to approach him, the cuts becoming quicker the closer he gets. Another factor is the sound. In the car scene mentioned earlier, the music plays to the editing as it intensifies with the action. Surprisingly enough though, I noticed more of where the soundtrack wasn\u2019t used. In the scene where a plane targets Thornhill, repeatedly attempting to murder him, all the suspense is through the pure sounds of the scene. I found that to be just as effective, if not more so. All these wonderful efforts make North by Northwest a great movie. While it\u2019s not Hitchcock\u2019s best, it has something in it for almost everyone. It\u2019s suspenseful, clever, funny, romantic, and surprisingly light-hearted (especially compared to Hitchcock's other classics.) With such admirable direction and a well executed, entertaining story, North by Northwest is without a doubt a recommendation.",

Why? Well it does something rather rare in balancing genuine tension and excitement, with real charm and whit to make for a far more rounded experience than many subsequent films have managed to bring. Yes for one the story facilitates this brilliantly, but there's no doubt that Hitchcock provides plenty of genius suspense with his innovative scenes and techniques, whilst he also brings buckets of humour and enjoyment thanks to a well-directed portrayal? from Cary Grant and another brilliant script from Ernest Lehman. As a result it genuinely captures both sides of that coin simultaneously, and thankfully creates a thing of incredible life and engaging excitement.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The plot does get a little caught up with itself at times\nVERDICT: A classic for all the right reasons; 'North by Northwest' is a piece of cinematic gold that stands on its own just as confidently as it does in its place in cinema history.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock was at the top of his game at the end of the 1950s (he made Vertigo, this film, and then Psycho and The Birds).  You can see his themes very clearly - this is a mistaken identity picture and, similar to The Wrong Man (1956), a picture in which a man is wanted for a crime that he didn't commit (running from both the police and the villains).  Cary Grant is that man and in his later years he has transmogrified under Hitch's watch from a somewhat sinister character (Suspicion, 1941) to an ambiguous one (Notorious, 1946; To Catch a Thief, 1955) to a lovable buffoon caught in a complex web that he can't begin to understand (NxNW). Complexity is necessary because the film is also an espionage flick and the MacGuffin is some microfilm that chief baddie James Mason is seeking to take out of the country.  Hitch builds very carefully on his earlier work - instead of the hero being chased up the Statue of Liberty (Saboteur, 1942), we find him strung out on Mount Rushmore's iconic faces. Hitch injects a fair dose of humour and along with the usual air of artificiality (studio sets, art direction), this distracts from the true horror of Grant's position. Having seen the film multiple times adds to this problem - you really need to work hard to imagine what it would be like to be suddenly kidnapped by thugs and accused of being someone else, a presumed spy.  Why Grant (or Roger O. Thornhill, I mean) allows himself to be lured/confused by Eva Marie Saint's femme fatale is hard to say but perhaps any friendly face in a storm is a likely choice by someone in his confused state.  This is a minor quibble because Hitch's goal here seems to be less an investigation of deeper serious themes (as in The Wrong Man or Vertigo, 1958) and more a demonstration of the way that film craft can be used to create a masterful thriller.  He succeeds!",

            "content": "A recent trip to Mt. Rushmore in the U.S. state of South Dakota brought to mind an old classic film I hadn't seen in ages. NORTH BY NORTHWEST has been called by some as master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock's romantic comedy. The film stars Cary Grant as Madison Avenue advertising exec Roger O. Thornhill (think Don Draper with a sense of humour), who finds himself mixed up in a Spy vs. Spy case of mistaken identity. Eva Marie Saint co-stars as Eve Kendall, a sultry industrial designer who isn't all she appears to be. James Mason plays the mysterious Phillip Vandamm, who abducts Thornhill to find out what he knows about him, and Martin Landau plays Vandamm's effeminate henchman, Leonard. The plot climaxes at Mt. Rushmore in a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase on the rock's presidential faces.\n\nReleased in 1959, the film still holds plenty of suspense today - the crop dusting scene is classic - but it really is a product of its time. The Cold War was in full swing then, and suspicion was flying in the U.S. about who might be spying for the Russians. In today's world of mobile phones, global news and heightened security, the story's premise seems rather absurd but spying was the hot topic back in the day.\n\nJames Stewart, a Hitchcock regular, wanted to play Roger Thornhill but the director considered the actor, at age 51, to be too old for the part. When Grant was announced as the film's star, many in Hollywood believed that Hitchcock and Stewart must have had a falling out as Grant was 55. Stewart was already committed to do another film and couldn't have done both. Whether that was intentional on Hitchcock's part or not, no one knows for sure. But Cary Grant certainly had a style that James Stewart never had, and the grey-blue glen plaid suit that the actor wore through most of the film has now achieved iconic status. (There were apparently six such suits that Grant wore during the filming - and kept, as per the terms of his contract.)\n\nEven today, it is a matter of debate as to who actually made the suit. Many sources point to Kilgour, French & Stanbury, with Arthur Lyons, the Duke of Windsor's suitmaker, doing the tailoring. However, eagle-eyed film buffs have noticed a label bearing the name \"Quintino\" inside the jacket. It may be that the Saville Row tailor made the original and the Beverly Hills tailor the copies. In an interview given many years later, Martin Landau said that Hitchcock wanted him to be better dressed than Grant so he took the actor to Grant's tailor - Quintino - to get him kitted out. Grant didn't know this and, when he saw how nice Landau looked in his new suit, Grant sent his personal assistant over to Landau to find out where he got it. According to Landau, the PA told him that only two people in the world make a suit like that - one in Beverly Hills and the other in Hong Kong.\n\nBy today's standards, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is sloppy filmmaking with its numerous continuity and factual errors (such as which side of the train Lake Michigan should be on), and wobbly sets. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service had barred Hitchcock from filming the chase scene at Mt. Rushmore so a replica was built in California. Today we can see that it was a fake but back then many respected film critics were praising both Hitchcock and MGM for their apparent cinematic coup. Government officials fought back though, and they insisted that the acknowledgement their agency received at the end of the film be removed from all prints, lest audiences think they approved of their perceived desecration of the national monument.\n\nEven though NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a relic of days gone by, it still makes for enjoyable viewing today.",

The film does a great job of building tension and mystery. I was so far removed from the first time I saw this movie that I didn't remember what was coming next, and it surprised me more than once. It's a good twisting and turning plot that I find completely engaging from start to finish. Also, unlike many films in this genre, I totally understood the motivations for each action that Cary Grant took. He actually behaved sensibly instead of stupidly, which isn't what you usually find when a man is running from the law and some bad guys in a film. Naturally the genius of Hitchcock and his cinematographer Robert Burks really shines in the look of North By Northwest. They know how to utilize shadow for dramatic effect, and they create some of the most iconic visuals in movie history. There's a reason that even people who have never seen this film would recognize the shot of the biplane chasing Grant through a field, it is expertly framed and creates a genuine feeling of danger. This is a brilliant film, and one that I think all movie buffs need to watch, and even those who don't obsess over movies like me should find it enjoyable.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest is a unique mystery thriller filmed from an original screenplay written by Ernest Lehman. Starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, North By Northwest leads the viewer from Madison Avenue to Mount Rushmore with twists and turns aplenty. Lehman's screenplay is celebrated as a classic of the spy thriller genre. Coming in at 181 pages, the screenplay exists as a voluminous example of Hollywood yesteryear.\n\t\tAs opposed to what screenplay craft has evolved into, Lehman's work, especially in action descriptions stands as ancestral predecessor. The iconic crop duster scene is laden with verbosity and camera instruction. (Lehman 94-100) Two things frowned upon by modern screenplay reading tastes. The signature of Lehman's work is to provide a blueprint for directors to work with. In this way, his screenplays act as a melding and deep focus of dialogue and action. \n\t\tThe act of providing camera direction seems a natural way to both formulate and tell a story. The unbelievable part of the collaboration between Hitchcock and Lehman on North By Northwest is the adherence of the director to the written vision on the page. In this instance, the brilliance of both artists shines through. This could be evidence of the six to nine month preproduction schedule wherein Hitchcock provided Lehman time and support to formulate the original screenplay. There are multiple spots where Hitchcock follows the script to the letter and spots where he deviates in imagery.  \n\t\tIn a 2000 interview, Lehman spoke to the mercurial nature of writing an original screenplay:\n\"...when you're writing an original screenplay, you can't help but wonder where some of your ideas come from. Often, they just pop into your head in response to the questions you ask yourself. \"How do I get out of this?\" or \"How do I get them to say that?\" \n\t\tThis conceit from a legendary screenwriter speaks to the classic struggle of being able to generate within the craft while paying respect to the tangential part of the creative process. According to Lehman, Hitchcock forwarded the idea of ending the film at Mt. Rushmore. This suggested scene acted as the endpoint that Lehman reverse engineered the entire script from. This gives credence to the old adage that it helps to come up with the ending first.",

            "content": "Considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, North by Northwest sounded like an exciting thriller.\n\n\nThe spy thriller genre is one which has evoked mixed feelings for me in the way that Alfred Hitchcock has handled it, mainly because his political thriller Torn Curtain and espionage thriller Topaz failed to really make an impact on me. I expected a bit of that to happen in North by Northwest, but the overwhelming critical acclaim for the film set it up to be a high quality feature. And although I couldn't set my standards too high, I just knew that it would be difficult to walk away from North by Northwest having not embraced the film for its Hitchcockian elements.\nBy comparison to Torn Curtain and Topaz, North by Northwest is far better as a spy themed thriller. While the thrills in the film are mostly as subtle, there are some more intense scenes such as the iconic one depicting protagonist Roger Thornhill is pursued by a cropduster. This is the most memorable moment of the film, and the large scale reality of the stunt makes it one of the most memorable things that Alfred Hitchcock has ever filmed. But even then, North by Northwest maintains a small scale. The thrills in the film are based on subtle politics, but the dialogue is so engaging that it captures the premise extremely well. It may be slow and long, but the pace is expected of an Alfred Hitchcock film due to the fact that his features tend to use this to build up a tense atmosphere before unleashing it on the audience. In north by Northwest, he does just that, and he does it with a very interesting story. \nThe premise in North by Northwest is a very character driven one, but at the same time it has a much larger scale at heart regarding conspiracies and identity. The journey in the film goes across America without going too far, and so it feels like a very serious and complicated story. Yet it is not difficult to keep up with. Unlike in Alfred Hitchcock's later spy thrillers, North by Northwest has dialogue which is intelligent and a clever premise which is easy to keep up with and not weighed down by an abundance of boring and confusing dialogue. The dialogue in North by Northwest is always key and never overdone, but it is Alfred Hitchcock that really brings it to life. \nEasily capturing the intended legitimacy of the setting in North by Northwest, Alfred Hitchcock uses as strong production design and powerful scenery to establish the setting of the tale. With the use of Mount Rushmore and empty fields among other places as the basis for the story, there is a lot of effective imagery in the film. It is all captured with perfectly atmospheric cinematography which is able to capture the intricate nature of the more intense scenes as well as the larger scale of some of the more open settings. There are some creative styles used, and a lot of the time viewers are given the perspective of the protagonist so that it feels all the more realistic. Frankly, for one of his more larger scale stories, Alfred Hitchcock proves that he still has no problem depicting how much of a brilliant filmmaker he is and that he is easily able to take on a challenge. Not a stranger to manipulating his low budget, Alfred Hitchcock manages to take a small amount of money a long way in North by Northwest. It is a low budget film, and it cleverly works around that by relying more on a good screenplay which cleverly makes use of its settings and not demanding it to be a spectacle first, but actually just a good thriller first.\nThe music in North by Northwest is excellent. With Bernard Herrmann once again teaming up with Alfred Hitchcock, he is able to deliver his best. The music in the film is intense in an eerie sense, but it also has a good sense of energy to it so that it is not too subtle. The music is key to the atmosphere in North by Northwest, and it is also moderated very well over the course of the film so that the majority of the feature uses silence while the music only comes along when it is an absolute necessity. It is unforgettable work, and it is edited into the feature extremely well.\nAnd to ensure that the North by Northwest has a sense of character, Cary Grant gives it his all.\nCary Grant delives an incredibly dedicated performance in North by Northwest. Never stepping out of his role for a second, Cary Grant puts his natural sense of sophisticated charm into his role which makes him a likable character, and as the story progresses he finds a way to develop himself really well. While the charm and emotion is always in his line delivery, the more impressive aspects of his performance fall into the category of his physical acting. He is always on a tense edge in his performance, standing with a slight shake in him and making use of facial expressions. For a man of 55 to be leading such a tense thriller with such physical dedication is thoroughly impressive, and it just goes to show that he never really lost touch with his acting skills. His performance is a nostalgic one because it is a reminder of the distinctive charm that leading men of the Hollywood golden era maintained carried into the context of an edgy thriller, and Alfred Hitchcock manages to really get the best out of him. Cary Grant adds the human touch to North by Northwest extremely well.\n\nSo due to a strong leading performance from Cary Grant and predictably brilliant directorial work from Alfred Hitchcock, it is not a challenge to see why North by Northwest is considered a masterpiece, even if some of the dated aspects of the story aren't perfect.",

There were definitely some interesting twists throughout, like the shifting allegiances of Eve, who went from being a charming romantic interest to a villain, then back to a good guy.\n\nThe movie has an odd kind of structure. It's a little weird how they showed us early on the scene of the Professor, revealing that Mr. Kaplan isn't real, because the majority of the movie then goes on without Roger knowing. It feels a little belated when he does finally find out. It's also a little strange because most of the movie, the police have been almost as important to avoid as Vandamme and his henchmen have been; we don't want Roger to get caught. But then we find out that all along, he probably would've just been delivered to the Professor, one of the good guys, and he would've understood everything easier. It's kind of hard not to be annoyed that they didn't get in touch earlier.\n\nAnd then the last act is almost a different movie, because most of the facts are known and the movie has a bigger focus: mainly Roger trying to protect Eve from Vandamme. I like that about the last act, and there are some cool touches, like his scrawled message on the matchbox and the various uses of the gun with blanks. That said, the last scene feels very rushed and odd, mainly because I'm just not used to those older kinds of endings where there's virtually no falling action, only quick resolution. But it's also a little jarring just because the movie was pretty long, and the movie felt like an epic; we watched Roger cross the U.S. and encounter all sorts of unexpected obstacles, from a devious femme fatale to an auction to a crop duster trying to kill him. So when he pulls Eve up and suddenly they're on a train, sharing one quick quip before the movie ends, it felt off.\n\nI feel like these issues I bring up shouldn't really matter, and I'm sure to critics and audiences of the time, they didn't. These minor flaws were probably minor compared to the big things the movie accomplishes and the influence the movie has on later cinema. The movie does still succeed on its own today, but it's really hard for me to distance myself from all the movies I've watched previously and just watch old movies as if I'm growing up and watching cinema evolve. So no Hitchcock movie, I've accepted, is probably going to blow my mind the way it blew everyone else's when it came out.\n\nThat said, these movies are still fun to watch and pretty fast-paced, with a lot of witty dialogue and funny moments that aren't dated. It's just that I can't exactly rave about the new and amazingly smart things the movie does when I'm so used to them now.",

That being said, I am so glad that I did see it.\n\nMost movies I see are exceptionally predictable.  So many directors an screen writers seem to have such a low opinion of viewers that they telegraph major plot points ahead of time as if to prepare the viewer to a plot twist that is coming.  The effect is to remove all surprise from the movie.  In North by Northwest Hitchcock rarely did this.\n\nThe cinematography in North by Northwest is excellent.  The film is not pretty by today's standards, but for the technology of the time it is great.  The acting is top notch and the casting superb.  The casting of Martin Landau as Leonard was perfect.  The man oozes sinister.  Grant and Saint were also great casting choices for the lovers.  Grant, despite being 55 years old, was still debonair and attractive.  Saint was gorgeous and at 35 was still able to play a 26 year old sex interest.  Their chemistry was believable and their performances were exceptional.  \n\nOverall the only thing negative I can think to say about the film is that the volume of the dialogue is low compared to the rest of the movie.  I had to have the television up loud in order to fully hear all of the dialogue.  The score is obviously dated, but still highly effective.\n\nI ended up completely drawn into the story and even watched it twice.  The only other movie I have watched twice in short order was Avatar when I took my wife to go see it after I had already watched it with a buddy.  I didn't even watch The Godfather a second time.This is now one of my favorite movies and I will be recommending it to my friends.  I give it 5 / 5 (Must see).",

Hitchcock weaves a smooth story and directs a nail-biting thriller that is groundbreaking for its time.  Eva Marie Saint is stunningly sexy as the double agent, Eve Kendall, who changes Rogers's life as the adventure takes twists and turns into false endings and confusing directions, bordering on overkill by the time the famous Mt.

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock, a name synonymous with the horror genre, is one of the more interesting characters of early cinema, and one of the frontrunners in modern cinema.  Everything you see in a film right now, most likely wouldn't have been the same had it not been for Hitchcock.  Orsen Welles was the innovator.  Hitchcock was the force.  Of course, that's not to say Hitchcock's films are really that great.  Most of them, or at least the ones I've seen, have all become very dated, and it shows in most of them.  After having seen movies like the Birds and Dial M for Murder, I started to question the director's legendary status.  So, I decided to watch his most critically lauded film: North By Northwest.  I can honestly say that this film will stand the test of time.  It's witty, fun, and engaging.  With a very likable lead, and some very hilarious moments, this is what most thrillers should strive to be: Fun.  Something that's lacking in most films today.\n\nNorth By Northwest starts almost immediately in it's plotting.  10 minutes in and we're already thrusted into the mystery.  Cary Grant, the Tom Cruise of the past minus the Scientology, stars as Roger O. Thornhill, a New York exec, who is kidnapped, and is mistaken as another man: George Kaplan.  He's soon in a race against time in order to save his life and clear his name.  It's short (well, not really), sweet, and simple.  It's fast past and once the 2 hour 16 minute runtime is over (oh, and it's really 2 hours and 16 minutes long), you'll be confused at how fast it went by.\n\nPositives early on, include Cary Grant's spectacular performance as Thornhill.  He deftly combines humor and drama with his character, and I'll never forgive Hollywood for his mistreatment (just like Tom Cruise).  Another great thing to note is the scope of this film.  In all honesty, it's sort of like what all James Bond movies should be, in my opinion.  I think if you change the names up a bit, and a couple of roles, you'll have a typical James Bond film.  And, if I say so myself, it's much funner than those films, especially the newer ones.  \n\nAnother positive to note is how funny the movie can be at times.  I went in expecting cheesy 1960s humor that would make me cringe rather than laugh (80s is when comedy hit a high point), but I got to give it to this film.  I laughed at a lot of the jokes.  Yes, some of them are cheesy, but it adds to the charm of the film, and I really enjoyed it.  On a smaller, but equally positive, note, Bernard Herrmann's score was absolutely gorgeous, capturing a grand scale and making the movie feel much more like an epic than a spy film.\n\nAnd finally, I can't discuss this film without mentioning the iconic plane scene.  *MINOR SPOILERS* I'm sure most of everyone in this world knows of the plane scene.  The slow, tense build up to it adds a lot to the film.  You knew what was coming, but you didn't know when, and that's what Hitchcock pulled off right.  The plane attacks Thornhill unexpectedly and I must say that very little action films of this time could pull of the sheer thrills of this.  Yeah, nothing blows up...well, until the end.  But the fact that they pulled this off in 1960 is just amazing.\n\nNow, with all the positives of this film, there comes a couple of negatives.  I'll put a *SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PARAGRAPH* notice because most of my complaints deal with the ending. First off, the main villain, Van Damme, isn't the main villain, or at least, someone else upstages him.  It's kind of a shame, considering that the entire film, I was promised a Van Damme vs Thornhill fight, and instead, Van Damme's henchmen become the main villains.  Then, there's the ending, which if you have watched the film, you'll hopefully understand.  After both the henchmen are killed, Thornhill is trying to save his girlfriend from falling, and then, it jump cuts to Thornhill pulling her up on a bed.  And I felt like that was Hitchcock giving me a middle finger.  Not only did it feel rushed, but there were many things that still needed to be explained.  What ever happened to VanDamme?  I know, we're supposed to think he got caught, but his jet was ready to fly off and he most likely saw the cops.  Also, why did the cops just randomly show up right before Thornhill was going to die?  Convenient?  Of course it is.  Then, there's the fact that the jump cut actually took away tension from the film.  I don't know about most of the people, but I kinda felt like the suspense just died automatically.  Kinda hurt the film as a whole.\n\n*SPOILERS DONE*\n\nOverall, North by Northwest is a good, but unfortunately not great, Hitchcock film.  There are moments where the film shines and outdoes many films, but then, it falls apart during the ending.  Fans of Hitchcock most likely will adore this film, and so might the uninitiated.  Viewing it as a cinephile, I kind of loved seeing all the innovations Hitchcock threw into this film.  It's a film I think most directors should study and follow, but not copy.  However, I just wished that Hitchcock could've given us a much more satisfying ending.",

The whole movie feels real and like you could be there yourself, except maybe the Mount Rushmore scene and even that was still done very well. Cary Grant might be the character he always plays, but he is so perfect for the role that you could never imagine someone else playing it.

A silly movie, intentionally silly, very well done with a spice of lighthearted comedy with its proper dose of intelligence. I like this movie more than I would presume in light of its apparently lighthearted premiss, mostly due to the wonderful cinematography (OH WHY?!! Why didn't Hitchcock shoot Vertigo like this? ARGGHHH!!!) and of course Hitchcock masterful cinematic skills. At numerous moments of the film, Hitchcock really shows he knows how to move and place the camera like few others, like a genius. The famous cereal crop scene deserves all notoriety, I'll never forget it, I can only imagine how off guard people were caught by it when the film was released, fantastically accomplished. Several others scenes got hard printed in my memory just as well as Eva Marie Saint soothing eye magnet beauty! Oh how I would love to be the reckless Roger Thornhill myself!",

            "content": "Man, this film is too long, which would mean that the leads shouldn't really notice this film's title while they're on their adventure, because the dirty secret, men, is that asking for directions often really does get you where you need to go a little quicker. Seriously though, you can try and escape, but I hate to tell you, Cary Grant, that Alfred Hitchcock will eventually find you. Well, at least James Stewart was able to get away, but the fact of the matter is that no matter how many blondes come and go, Hitch always had Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. Yeah, good ol' fat boy did seem to alternate between the two of them, just as he alternated between muder-mysteries and spy thriller, because in case you haven't noticed, Hitch was really into espionage. You probably didn't notice, because no one really kept up with Americanized spy films orchestrated by Brits before James Bond came along, and it probably didn't help that, whether he was doing murder-mysteries or spy thrillers, Hitchcock always had to use some kind of a story involving a case of mistaken identity. You would figure that before too long, if authorities in Hitchcock films suspected that a crime was committed by someone who looked either like Cary Grant or James Stewart, they would start double-checking, although if they did that, then they would likely find the guy they're really looking for right away. At that point, there wouldn't be much of a film, and we can't have that, because this is a pretty good flick as it stands, in spite of some problems.\n\nSomething of an ambitious pseudo-fluff thriller, the film juggles plenty of tone, generally pretty well, but not consistently, for there are times in which tension is broken a touch too harshly by more lighthearted aspects that are themselves effective, yet would be more so if the didn't jeopardize the effectiveness of this drama's other tonal extremes. That being said, it's not like there isn't something a little too light, or rather, Hollywood about plenty of points in this melodramatic affair, which tests its probability with questionable character actions and conflict set-ups, many of which are major. As well-done as the film is in enough places for you to run with whatever it makes an effort to throw at you, there are plenty of places in which you need to suspend your disbelief, and it's occasionally a little too difficult to meet such a demand, partly because a lot of those Hollywood bloatings seem as though they're compensating for something. Natural shortcomings are limited in this adventurous thriller of grand scope and intriguing mystery, yet there is still something rather dramatically lacking in this spy thriller, and when meat does kick into the concept, it ironically gets to be overblown to the point of convolution, although that might simply be the doing of Ernest Lehman's script. I opened this article joking about the film's being overlong at almost 140 minutes, but in all seriousness, the film, as one of Alfred Hitchcock's longest, is too long, getting so caught up in inconsequential filler and confusingly excessive material that, before too long, it doesn't simply start to lose momentum, it loses focus. The film is plenty entertaining through and through, but there's only so much fun to have in an adventure opus so aimless, as you have plenty of time to pick up on the natural shortcomings to this under-dramatic, histrionic and tonally uneven Hollywood fluff piece. The film could easily be secured as underwhelming by its natural shortcomings, alone, and yet, the strengths carry the final product quite the distance, enough so for entertainment value to reward, but not alone.\n\nAesthetically, the film really stands out, at least in terms of musical style, as Bernard Herrmann delivers on an almost superheroic style to his score that offers sweeping dynamicity which ranges from smoothly light to grandly thrilling, just as Robert Burks delivers on yet another cinematographic performance that is rich with handsomely gritty coloration and lighting, as well as tight framing and other nifty filming styles, courtesy of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock delivers on plenty of memorable visuals to help hold your attention time and again, and while he does more than just that, the fact of the matter is that even his style breathes plenty of life to this affair's substance. Again, dramatically, the substance is thin, as surely as it is narratively overblown in plenty of other ways, but the story concept's sheer intricacy is just so intriguing, initially being an interesting minimal story on mistaken identity that gradually expands into a grand adventure which goes backed by themes dealing with conspiracy and other worthy matters. Even as an idea, the film's story is grand and dynamic enough to make up for a lack of dramatic depth, and the interpretation of such an idea really does help, with Ernest Lehman turning in a script that, while too overblown to keep consistent in tone, believability and pacing, never abates with clever dialogue, - whose many humorous bits range from witty to just about hilarious - and delivers on plenty of thoughtful characters which establishes a colorful character roster, sold by a cast which Cary Grant heads remarkably. You really do have to witness Grant's performance to believe just how thoroughly charismatic as a lead who does so much justice to colorful characterization that the Roger Thornhill stands as iconic in his memorability as a lead so worthy that Grant plays about as instrumental of a part as Lehman's writing in carrying this affair. Of course, what really secures engagement value is Hitchcock's efforts, because as much as I rave about Hitchcock's style being in top-form here, Hitchcock's keeps pacing just as realized, maybe not to where he can overshadow the pacing problems found within Lehman's script, but decidedly to where momentum is kept steady enough for you to get a firm feel for the setting, as well as brisk enough to keep entertainment value consistent and thorough. I don't know if the film is busy enough to be a real wild ride, but for its time, and even now, it really is really fun, and while you shouldn't really expect the dramatic weight found in many of Hitchcock's other thrillers, style, intrigue and entertainment value converge tightly enough to make this one of, if not the legendary filmmaker's crowning achievement.\n\nWhen the run is done, the final product goes worn down by dramatic limitations, as well as tonal unevenness, believability lapses and, of course, an overblown structure, but through excellent score work by Bernard Herrmann, sharp cinematography by Robert Burks, thoroughly clever writing by Ernest Lehman, an electrically charismatic lead performance by Cary Grant, and a lively directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock, all behind a grandly adventurous and intriguing story concept, \"North by Northwest\" stands strong as a thoroughly entertaining affair that may be Hitchcock's most realized classic.\n\n3/5 - Good",

Then again I haven't seen it in such a long time and the action packed adventure is not one to miss out on and one that should be revisited for any who love Hitchcock and movies really. Diverting from his usual tone of suspense, mystery and chills, Hitchcock places grander thrills and designs before our eyes this time around. Grant is the cool leading man. His world is taken from him and the movie primarily deals with how a person goes through life when they don't have control of it or even understand why it's been usurped. Hitch doesn't explain why this happens or how but rather forces us to consider that if one day we became mixed up in something so interruptive and threatening, would we let it wash over us, go insane, or find the truth no matter the cost. Eva Marie Saint lends her sensual touch to the film and she plays the femme fatale role with brilliance. Mason matches Grant's cool elegance as a villain of soft smiles and maddening invisible threats. In a word, a puppet master. This is one of the definitive \"framed\" films and has inspired countless others. While not my favorite and considered overrated by some, I enjoy North for its scale and iconic set pieces. Of course Hermann's score has to be mentioned. Arguably one of Hitchcock's big 5.",

            "content": "Hitchcock is highly praised by critics and the general public as one of the most influential directors of his time and they are not wrong. I have not yet seen all of Hitchcock's work but I have seen most of his films that are commonly regarded as \"essential\". North By Northwest is one of those \"essential\" films and it was the one that I felt was the weakest. I am sure that most people will disagree with me but this is how I perceived it after viewing the film three times.\n\nNorth By Northwest is written by Ernest Lehman, who has worked on highly regarded films like The Sound of Music, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and a personal favorite of mine Sabrina. Lehman has written very ambitious films, showing off things that other writers have not yet thought of. North By Northwest is a prime example on how grand his vision was for the action thriller. The film's premise is quite funny and it does get you intrigued. The film starts small, then it gets bigger and bigger as the film progresses. The set pieces in the film are daring and at times ridiculous (though not entirely in a bad way). My main issue with the script is the way the protagonist is written. Roger Thornhill is too self-centred and at times cocky for his own good which many may appealingly engaging, I found it to be difficult for me to show any empathy or sympathy of his unfortunate conditions. Towards the end of the film after a certain gunshot has been fired, there is a moment where Thornhill and Eve Kendall discuss about being together and this is the first time where Thornhill showed some sort of emotional vulnerability and had me caring and started to see the side of him that refused to be shown during the first three-quarters of the film.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is not shy in pushing the boundaries once in a while, and this one is definitely a huge push. This Hitchcock film has definitely inspired many action/thriller films in the future and still being used as inspiration in modern filmmaking. I do admire the fact that Hitchcock wants us following a man who in most situations is helpless to do anything. North By Northwest is a film that contains the most memorable action sequences, but ironically the main reason that these set pieces lacked the impact for me is the influence it has made on contemporary films. These scenes have time and time again been replicated and taken inspiration from it that when I actually give this a watch, it loses the magic that these scenes can give off. The effects that are used in this film are very ambitious, and because of this ambition it has aged poorly as time passes. Though these is heading towards late Hitchcock, he still has not lost his touch to create mystery and suspense.\n\nRobert Burks is a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock starting from Strangers on a Train and ending with Marnie (The only film between that he did not work in was Psycho). The relationship between Hitchcock and Burks are an example where both members are in tune with one another. Burks understands Hitchcock's vision, this is why the films they work together are very different from one another and each one has their own style. North By Northwest may be the biggest film that they both have worked on, second being To Catch A Thief. Burks has chosen very wide and huge shots of the environment that the action is taking place, which is one of the key factors that makes this film feel large and ambitious. The crop duster scene or the climax are the key moments where his photography shines. Hitchcock's leading ladies are always a highlight in his films and part of it is due to Burks' soft focus photography when close ups are used to film their beautiful faces. Eva Marie Saint looks gorgeous here because of it. Personally, I much prefer Burks' work on Rear Window and Vertigo but North By Northwest is a force of its own that it cannot be dismissed.\n\nBernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who has worked on the most iconic of films delivering the most iconic of scores. North By Northwest's score is an example of that brilliant craft with an upbeat and tense composition that sticks with you throughout the movie. The score often builds up throughout and then the action and suspense occurs then it comes in full force. It adds on to the sense of desperation to survive which is something Roger Thornhill constantly has to go through.\n\nCary Grant is the protagonist of this film and I'm just going to say that currently I am not a fan of him. I am not sure whether it's the roles he picks, or that I just haven't seen enough of his films. Grant comes off here as a hero or invincible even though he is meant to play a man who is very vulnerable and lacks the skills to survive in the face of danger. Grant constantly has an answer for everything and has a sarcastic joke to say with every response, but this may be more due to the writing than his acting abilities. James Stewart in my opinion gives off a better performance when working under the mind of Hitchcock in comparison to Cary Grant but this is just a personal opinion. Eva Marie Saint is another member Hitchcock's list of leading ladies but if I had to rank them, she isn't up there with Grace Kelly and Janet Leigh. Saint still does her role well though, able to project that sexuality that many actresses cannot do and still maintains to be just as equally witty and as Grant. James Mason was a treat to see, he brings this class in his role as the antagonist of the film. The accent and delivery of his lines make gives him a unique quality that other actors of it's time just lack.\n\nNorth By Northwest will stand the test of time as a classic but in a personal level it just didn't impact me the same way as Rear Window or Psycho had on me. I came into this film open minded with every time I watch it and it does get better with each viewing.",

This film has good visuals and great acting and what surprised me was Hitchcock's use of comedy which I did not expect after watching the intensely crafted Psycho(1960). This film has a relatively simple and used up plot which has some thrilling moments in the first half, other than which I found this to be pretty ordinary. Psycho too had an ordinary plot, but what was good about it was the way it was made. I believe that this film is overrated, not that it is bad, but just that it doesn't deserve the 100% rating. The sound effects were in particular mind blowing and you don't get to hear such sort of wonders these days. This film has a prolonged running time, which also irritated me, knowing that Psycho was just an hour and 3 quarter long. North by Northwest is watchable, but too silly in the end and it has a disappointing finale.",

Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint gave an exceptional acting and chemistry mixed with a plot both suspenseful and imaginative.

Eva Marie Saint is the temptress, seductive but also not what she seems. \n\nThis film is very well structured and from start to finish is without a doubt a thrill ride.

It is constantly moving and builds to an awesome climax.\n\nThis film is still one of the definitive thrillers known for its iconic scene with the crop duster air plane and Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock knows how to deliver suspense in his films with its awesome music, camera work and buildup with a great screenplay by Ernest Lehman. The cat and mouse game between Thornhill (Grant) and his would-be assassins is very well filmed, and edge of your seat fun.\n\nNorth By Northwest is dark, deceptive and a very engaging film.

            "content": "Over the years, Alfred Hitchcock has made famed, suspenseful classics, such as Rebecca, Vertigo, The Birds, and The 39 Steps. North by Northwest is another one of these classics.\r\n\r\nIn North by Northwest, businessman Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for American agent George Kaplan. From then on, he is abducted by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), who has a secret agenda in his brain, and is framed for the murder of United Nations diplomat Lester Townsend (Philip Ober). Thornhill goes cross country to discover who Kaplin really is and to stop Vandamm from whatever sneaky move he's about to make.\r\n\r\nAlso in the film, Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall, a woman who seduces Thornhill along the way, Martin Landau plays Leonard, Vandamm's henchman, Jesse Royce Landis plays Thornhill's mother, and Alfred Hitchcock makes a memorable cameo as a man who misses a bus.\r\n\r\nNorth by Northwest laid the foundation for many action films, such as the James Bond films and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is an important piece of American film, and one of Hitchcock's best films.\r\n\r\nIf you have read my review for To Catch a Thief, you probably remember that I wasn't fond of Cary Grant's performance in the film. Here, he's spectacular. From his personality, smart dialogue, and good charms, Grant is hard to resist and you'd think he was James Bond. Eva Marie Saint is attractive and also plays a great role as the love interest. The love scene is a highlight in the film, so big that it was considered raunchy at the time that Hitchcock had to change some of Saint's dialogue (\"I never make love on an empty stomach\" was changed to \"I never discuss love on an empty stomach.\"). I felt that unnecessary, but oh well... \r\n\r\nJames Mason plays a great villain, and his voice sounds like pure evil. Hitchcock picked him well.\r\n\r\nThe score by Bernard Hermann is also a suspense. Like in Vertigo, the score chills and thrills.\r\n\r\nMany of the sequences in this film are some of Hitchcock's most well-crafted scenes. The most famous includes Grant and Saint climbing down Mount Rushmore, Grant using knowledge to get out of an auction filled with thugs, and the film's biggest highlight, Grant being chased by a crop duster. That scene alone is worth the price of admission.\r\n\r\nWith a smart script, a suspenseful plot, a thrilling score, and wonderful performances, North by Northwest is a Hitchcock classic. It's not as phenomenal as Vertigo, but it's a great film just the same.",

            "content": "\"When I was a little boy, I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.\"\n\nNorth by Northwest is considered by many to be one of the best films of all time. It is highly rated by many critics and film review sites. And understandably so, to a certain extent. It's a light adventure/comedy that's good at what it does, and to top it off, it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.\n\nNow, I'm not going to sit here and delve into all the cinematic techniques and themes in the film that are signatures to Hitchcock's glory. I'm going to, in a modern standpoint, conclude on the entertainment value of the movie. And there is no doubt in my mind that North by Northwest is entertainment gold - to the people of the 50?s and 60?s. But now, the film is undeniably outdated and a bit corny. It's like watching a structurally well made James Bond film from the 60?s. The orchestral music during the romantic scenes and the cheesy one liners make it a bit difficult to be fully entertained, especially to those who are so used to the stunning visuals and CGI of the 21st century.\n\nThe film's protagonist, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), gets mixed up with the CIA trying to capture a foreign spy, Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Throughout the film, Roger is in conflict with the love interest, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Trust is a big theme that gets tossed around at every twist and turn in the story. The film is filled with sexual symbols, play on words, and subtle hints that are characteristic of a Hitchcock film. Therefore, the film is a great educational piece that can be analyzed and studied. I feel North by Northwest is more of a film you'd see in a classroom setting than a film you'd like to see during movie night with friends.\n\nErnest Lehman, the writer of the film, said that he wanted to write \"the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures.\" He couldn't have been more wrong. Not only did Hitchcock continue to make seven more films, Psycho was the very next one. And everyone knows that Hitchcock is best known for his psychological thrillers, like Vertigo and Rear Window, rather than his adventure films. Light comedy just doesn't suit him as well as dark humor. Hitchcock fanatics will probably be pissed at the 3.5 rating, but let's face it, we live in a time where even The Matrix is considered visually outdated.\n\nhttp://www.mrwickedproductions.com/wickquoting/",

Cary Grant does a great job and makes for a really enjoyable lead in this film as you really feel the exasperation with his situation that his character feels. The thrills were certainly there in this one, helped out a lot by the twists and turns throughout that really helped to elevate the film. \n\nMy main problem with this one is that Eva Marie Saint's acting is not always up to snuff. There are moments when it is entirely cringe worthy. Also, maybe this is because this one is so old, but the plot became slightly predictable and cheesy. Not to a large degree, of course, but enough where it was worth mentioning. Regardless, this one was really enjoyable and very entertaining.",

It works on all levels and is simply a great piece of entertainment.\r\n\r\nCary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an advertising exeuctive.  While dining at New York's Plaza Hotel, he is mistaken for a man named George Kaplan.  Within minutes he is abducted by armed men and taken to a mansion in the country.\r\n\r\nThere he tries to persuade his interrogator (James Mason) of his true idenntity.  Thornhill escapes and begins a frantic chase across several states.\r\n\r\nThe script is fun with plenty of humor thrown in and witty lines delivered as only Cary Grant can deliver them.  Eva Marie Saint is warm and lovely as she helps Thornhill.\r\n\r\nA great classic by one of my favorite directors. I don't know why it took me so long to post a review of it.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/NorthByNorthwest_zpsdfafd123.jpg[/IMG]",

            "content": "While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",

It is a suspense story that gets used a lot today, but was entirely original when it was first used.  Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill; a man who is being mistaken for another man named \"George Kaplan,\" and kidnapped.  He is brought to a house where he is interrogated, and is forced to drink burban so he can stage a drunk driving accident.  When he gets released a man he is talking to gets stabbed in the back right in front of him, and he pulls the knife out of the mans back, and it looks like he murdered him.  Now he is wanted for murder, and a manhunt begins.  That starts an awesome chain of events that truly do prove that Alfred Hitchcock is the master of suspense.  This type of suspense story gets used a lot today, but it had never been done before this.  A man running from the law trying to prove himself innocent, and find the person who is setting him up.  That is a formula that is clich\u00e9d now, but completely original back then.\n\nCary grant to me is the original Sean Connery.  He sounds like him, acts like him, and even resembles him slightly.  If Hitchcock made a Bond film it would be like this.  When he talks with women he has the same charm that Sean Connery's James bond had.  I find that a lot of the actors and actresses in old films were all-similar to each other.  Now Hitchcock obviously loved blondes because all of the women in his films are blonde, and they do take on the same personality in each film.  Grace Kelly is still my favorite actress in any of his films.\n\nAfter he did this film he did Psycho, which may be his most famous movie, but is not his absolute best in my opinion.  This film and Rear Window are his two bets films in my opinion.  All of his films have something that stick out from the others.  This one was much more of an adventure.  It was a manhunt, and it had actions scenes at places like Mt. Rushmore.  Rear Window was unique because it all took place in his house, and all you saw was inside his place and what he could see out the window.  Psycho was much more of a scary flick, and it was creepier.  Vertigo was unique for the dolly zoom.  This film was the one that I felt like had more effects and action.  The famous scene when he is getting chased by a crop dusting plane is awesome, because it is suspenseful.  They give you little hints as to what is about to happen, and leave you guessing as to what will happen.  You know something is going to happen but not sure what.  Once it happens it looks really cool, and pretty realistic for a 1950's movie.  The ending at Mt. Rushmore it all looked pretty fake, but it was still a great scene.  Old films tend to be more reliant on story and suspense then effects, which is actually good.",

There wasn't a moment in this movie when I was bored. Hitchcock had the tendency to be dark at times, but not with this movie. This movie is full-on fun, and I don't know if Hitchcock has ever purely entertained me more. \n\nAdvertising executive Roger O. Thornhill lives a rather normal and peaceful life. When at lunch with some friends, Roger is mistaken for George Kaplan. He is abducted and taken to Philip Vandamm. Roger is clearly confused and cannot answer any of Vandamm's questions.  He winds up being released, but now he wants to figure out this mystery. When Thornhill is horribly framed for a murder, he must go on the run and figure out this mystery at the same time.\n\nThis is \"fun\" Alfred Hitchcock at his peak. Everything just clicked with this movie: iconic set-pieces, an engrossing story, lots of humor, a great musical score, and first-rate performances. Headlining the movie is Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill. Honestly, Grant has played similar characters dozens of times. And yet each time I see him play this kind of character, I'm struck with what a great actor he was. His Thornhill is spot-on.\n\nEva Marie Saint plays the mysterious love interest, Eve. Supposedly, Grace Kelly was the first choice for the part, but by 1959 she was a Princess consort of Monaco. No Grace Kelly, so out of dozens of other candidates, Hitchcock picked Saint. She works just fine in her role, providing a good foil to Grant's witticisms.\n\nThe supporting cast all turn in solid performances. James Mason is appropriately villain-like as Vandamm. Jesse Royce Landis is pretty comical as Thornhill's mother. But my favorite supporting performance is Martin Landau as Leonard. Maybe it's because I've seen him many times on Mission Impossible, but I think he plays an excellent villain.\n\nThe story isn't really original. Hitchcock made at least three movies like this. But what really sets this movie apart from Hitchcock's classic \"falsely accused man on the run\" movies, other than its sharp sense of humor, is its iconic action scenes. Probably the most notable is the crop-duster chase. If only action scenes could be this original today. And the finale, Mount Rushmore chase is another incredible action scene with spectacle, originality, and tension.\n\nOverall, North by Northwest vaulted itself into my favorite Hitchcock movies. Full of suspense, humor, intrigue, and original action; this movie hits the mark. \n\n\"Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.\" 9/10",

This is one of Hitchcock's finest works that is engaging from start to finish. Cary Grant is terrific in the role of Roger Thornhill, a man who is plunged in a mysterious situation. The actors that star opposite Grant are wonderful as well; an Eva Marie and James Mason are fine choices and bring a memorable presence to the screen. Hitchcock directs great film and this is among his greater efforts as a director. What makes him so unique as a director is his style in terms of delivering thrills and suspense. Hitchcock is in a class by himself. North by Northwest is an accomplished picture that is confident, thrilling and above all, memorable. The film contains one of the most recognizable scenes in any Hitchcock film, the scene where Cary Grant gets chased by the crop dusting plane ranks as one of the best scenes along with the shower scene in Psycho. This is a great film that will surely please Hitchcock fans. At times the film does have a few weak areas, however the strong performances and effective directing keep things together well enough to make this a worthwhile film to watch. This is a blend great suspense and thriller elements that truly make this one of the standout pictures of the genre. As it stands, North by Northwest is a near flawless film that is aided by a strong cast, an engaging story and effective directing that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you love a well executed suspense film, North by Northwest will surely appeal to you, and is a must see.",
