    "summary": "When gunslinger Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) kills a man in a saloon, Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) arrests him with the aid of the town drunk, Dude (Dean Martin). Before long, Burdette's brother, Nathan (John Russell), comes around, indicating that he's prepared to bust his brother out of jail if necessary. Chance decides to make a stand until reinforcements arrive, enlisting Dude, an old cripple named Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and baby-faced cowboy Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson) to help.",

            "content": "It definitely is a Western Classic but it is nothing like I expected it to be. There isn't much fighting or action for 95% of the runtime which shocked me and I'm shocked how well Nelson, Martin, Wayne and Brennan work together. The acting is very good with great chemistry between everyone and good humor as well which gives lots of charm. The secret is the dialogue is actually very good and carries a lot of the slower moments in this well. The cinematography is very well done also with well framed shots and memorable scenes. Though the town can feel a bit generic and the action is ok it is a bit of a letdown. The music is very good also though it isn't used that much in this which is surprising that this never really feels dry. The editing is excellent overall, this is very focused and really is a character driven drama more than a action western which I didn't expect and more so didn't mind really. It's also paced very well though it definitely felt like it could've had more action in between than what is here. What's impressive again is for over 2 hours despite the lack of action it never feels unfocused or boring because of how well the editing, dialogue and chemistry is amongst everyone. The end battle is ok but it's a bit of a letdown, definitely would've liked a bigger more action packed ending. But regardless anyone who is a fan of any of the actors in this, Hawks, or Westerns will like this a lot. It's a tad bit overrated in my opinion but its still really good.",

            "content": "A stalwart Western from a legendary director.\n\nDirector Howard Hawks' Western drama Rio Bravo (1959) is a sturdy story of real justice full of robust men and their bravery. I'm glad Hawks produced great Westerns like Red River and Rio Bravo among his crime drama classics like Scarface. Hawks' silent opening confrontation is amazing just like every violent encounter in Rio Bravo.\n\nEditor Folmar Blangsted's sharp cuts keep Rio Brave moving steadily for 141 minutes. I found Hawks' direction captivating as he reels you in with particular camera movements to let you know where a gunman is coming from or hiding. Cinematographer Russell Harlan's smooth panning shots and careful framing show off men standing up against numerous gunmen and hard calls. Rio Bravo is certainly one of Howard Hawks' best films.\n\nWriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett take a tough guy sheriff with morals and his drunken deputy and thrust them into a tale of courage against a gang of criminals seeking to release a murderer. It's a cool holdout in a town kind of Western with sterling performances from John Wayne and Dean Martin. Rio Bravo is a neat anti-alcohol movie as Dean Martin's alcoholic Dude only suffers because of his withdrawal. You see him ridiculed for his day drinking and he can only succeed sober.\n\nIt's thoughtfully written and pretty to watch. Leo K. Kuter's art direction leans into desolate saloons and the small wooden town atmosphere for a striking Western. Ralph S. Hurst's set decoration has fairly fancy lanterns, and furniture props among all the long rifles and pistols. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's film score is very nice every time it chimes in during Rio Bravo. Sound designer Robert B. Lee lets Tiomkin's music gently fade in and gunshots ring out clearly.\n\nJohn Wayne is cool as the principled sheriff as John T. Chance. He's a tough guy Western hero with actual values of obeying the law, being kind to friends, and decent to women. Dean Martin is pretty solid as the drunkard deputy Dude. His conflicted feelings over whether or not to quit or drink again. His somber singing shows off his deep voice and mournful tone. Ricky Nelson is excellent as the nice and helpful gunslinger Colorado Ryan. His quickdraw pistol firing and sweet higher singing is quite cool in Rio Bravo. Ricky Nelson honestly may be a better actor than Dean Martin in Rio Bravo.\n\nAngie Dickinson is stunning as the femme fatale gambling lady Feathers. She's charming, smart, and kind. It's easy to see why Angie Dickinson became famous for Feathers. Both Colorado Ryan & Feathers constantly help out Chance so often that I started thinking Rio Bravo is the opposite of High Noon. No one will help Gary Cooper in High Noon, whereas everyone helps John Wayne in Rio Bravo despite him not wanting aid from strangers to get them involved in such dangerous business.\n\nWalter Brennan is a riot as the high pitched deputy Stumpy with his endless complaining. Ward Bond is friendly as Pat Wheeler until his shocking death sequence. John Russell is real quietly vicious as the wealthy ranch owner Nathan Burdette, who is out for blood on behalf of his brother Joe Burdette. Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez is funny and pleasant as the amiable saloon and hotel owner Carlos Robante. Estelita Rodriguez is pretty and fiery as Consuela Robante. Claude Akins is fierce as hothead criminal Joe Burdette, who is quick to fire. It's a fun fact that Kurt Russell's father Bing Russell is the cowboy gunned down by Claude Akins in the stellar opener.\n\nCostume designer Marjorie Best's tan jacket, pants, and hat for John Wayne's Chance's look cool paired with his red collared shirt and brown rifle. Dean Martin's initial jacket with holes is so trash. Dude's blue shirt and brown vest look cool with his black pants once he shaves and cleans up. Angie Dickinson looks breathtaking with her feathered scarf, golden blouse, thin waisted black belt, and checkered skirt and suit jacket. She's a real vision in gold like her combed up dark golden hair. Make-up artist Gordon Bau did a wonderful job with Angie's stylish hairdo.\n\nIn short, Rio Bravo is an excellent Western from the Golden Age of Hollywood.",

The film offered plenty of exuberant fun in the form of the comical interchanges between its colorful characters, yet the story felt a little too comfortably inert; too pleased with the prospect of simply existing on the screen to provide the kind of journey that might have been needed to focus its efforts. To reiterate, the witty banter and colorful characterizations are fun to behold, but they never really transcend the status of superficial novelty. By the end of \"Rio Bravo,\" you feel pleased to have enjoyed the company of a refreshingly lighthearted Western, but still yearn for the kind of sustenance offered by more substantive and dynamic works.",

Probably the last great Hollywood western before the arrival of Sergio Leone and his genre-shaking films. The main theme that unites the 3 main characters is that no one is going to beg for help and no one is going to compromise their dignity or what's left of it in the case of Dean Martin. They do not need the whole town constructing a live meat shield. John Wayne is adamantly sure that people who are \"good enough\" will step up either way. Which is a very idealistic way of seeing things. But what are Hollywood westerns from the golden age but idolized depictions of American frontiers with a very expository dialogue.",

            "content": "The sorry bunch.  So this is about an aging sheriff (John Wayne) in a small Texan town.  He has jailed a murderer (Claude Akins) and intends on holding him for the marshal, but the murderer's brother (John Russell) is in town to break him out.  The numbers are not on the sheriff's side, and he only has the aid of a drunk (Dean Martin), a disabled man (Walter Brennan), and a young gunfighter (Ricky Nelson) to maintain law and order.  Now I didn't know a ton about this one; all I really knew was that it is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite Westerns.  If you couldn't tell by his entire library, that is a man who knows his Westerns.  I'm still working through some genre staples for my birthday week, so I figured this would be a welcome addition to my knowledge on film.  I'm glad that I did, and I had a great time watching it.  Now somewhat shockingly, this is actually my first experience with John Wayne.  I seriously started watching movies back in 2008, and for whatever reason, I just chose Eastwood over Wayne.  Maybe I felt like I owed loyalty to one over the other, like how people will frequent their favorite burger joint over the competition.  I can now say that I see the appeal.  John Wayne has screen presence and this intangible way of commanding the room.  I thought all of those impressions from countless comedians that I've seen over the years were all exaggerated, but for the most part, they are right on the money.  He has a very distinctive line delivery and cadence in his voice, and he always comes off like he is the toughest guy in the room.  Rio Bravo has a fun script that is all about characters.  In fact, I would say that it is more about talking than it is about actual action.  You get to know the group you are spending time with, and as a result, you care what happens to them.  You watch a man go through real struggles with alcohol, and you get true comedic relief from the disabled deputy who complains that nobody tells him anything.  This builds character, and you want to see the group form a plan that will work.  While I did very much enjoy this, I don't feel like Rio Bravo is perfect.  I think that they could have gotten this to run under the two-hour mark if they tried hard enough, and I did feel somewhat fatigued with the length coming in at 141 minutes.  There are pieces featured that could have been cut.  I get that you have Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in the same film together, but the jail concert they put on could have been scrapped, and it would have zero impact on the story.  Overall, I am content with the selection for my introduction to John Wayne.",

            "content": "This Western movie works in large part because of the interaction of the main three characters: John Chance the town sheriff, Dude as an alcoholic cowboy trying to get clean, and Stumpy as an elderly cripple who serves in the sheriff's office. They argue and spar throughout the movie, adding much comic relief to an otherwise conventional story.\n\nJoe Burnett is a powerful local rancher who kills an innocent bystander during a fight he provoked, and is arrested and taken to the town jail for it, where the sheriff and the deputized Dude and Stumpy hold him in wait for the marshal. They hold off the rancher's brother and his hired hands, while in the meantime an old friend of Chance comes to town with his group, as well as a woman named Feathers who is a card player and possible cheater. The questions are whether Chance and company can hold off the hired hands, and whether Dude can stay clean and competent as he withdraws from his alcoholism, and how good is Stumpy with his health problems anyway. Also what is the story with Colorado, the young man who came with the supply train, and will he get involved? Not until after watching the movie did I learn about this movie being a deliberate answer to \"High Noon\", where that sheriff kept going to the townspeople begging them for help, only they were too cowardly. Chance is different; he refuses outside help but gets it anyway. A more convincing scenario when you think about it.",

But on watching this with that context in mind, you realise that High Noon is a better movie on almost every level. The earlier film is a masterclass in tight pacing and building dramatic tension. Bravo, on the other hand, is waaay too long, and needs at least a third of the script shaving off. Wayne is deeply average, verging on robotic, and Walter Brennan as the supposed \"comic\" character is borderline incomprehensible and frequently plain irritating. Dean Martin is the best thing here as the talented drunk (one wonders how much acting was required), and Angie Dickinson is also excellent but is let down by a poorly written role in which she continually throws herself at Wayne (a storyline as incomprehensible as Brennan's accent). Overall this is a far more simplistic, blunt instrument than the film it was designed to surpass. If you intend to make it through all 135 minutes of it, I recommend you have some strong coffee to hand.",

A (100/91) on RT, I had high standards for Rio Bravo, which inexplicably felt too slow given all of the rifle-firing action. My inexperience with Westerns will likely come through here, but was everyone really so chill about people getting shot in bars and on the dirt roads separating hotels and saloons? John Wayne, the Western King, plays Sheriff John T. Chance, a lawman who, along with his on-the-wagon deputy, Dude (Dean Martin), handicapped assistant, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), who has a notable, yokel laugh, and young-gun, Colorado (Ricky Nelson), take on Nathan Burdette (John Russell) and his gang who seek to remove Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) from custody. The film would've benefited much more had it actually been a single-location, \"Call of Duty-Zombies\" style hold-out. The opening bar fight felt kinda dumb and I was nervous there would be a lot of eye-rolling, but the action itself is pretty good \u2014 especially the shoot-out when Chance and Co. go on the offensive. I actually enjoyed Dude's struggle with alcoholism, as it wasn't just a character trait but helped propel the plot. Dino and Nelson had the kind of chemistry singing together you'd expect to see in High School Musical. I did a dog-head tilt when first hearing \"The Cutthroat Song,\" before realizing its connection to Kill Bill. The most notable line, which I've been repeating in my terrible John Wayne impression, was \"You want that gun? Pick it up. I wish you would.\" Would've it made more sense just to release the prisoner and have the U.S. Marshals, who were six days away at the start of the film, pick him up at the Burdette Ranch or its environs later? Sure, but this is the Wild West, baby! Less jukin', more shootin'.",

That said, calling it one of the greatest films of all time (looking at you, Sight & Sound), or even one of the greatest Westerns of all time, is absolutely ridiculous. Its contemporary motivation as a response to High Noon is still perfectly relevant today; High Noon is a cynical, thought-provoking, and intelligent look at human nature that transcends the genre, while Rio Bravo is a functionally formulaic devotee to all its conventions, one that stands for nothing beyond \"ol'-fashioned American values\". Good guys are good (and always win), bad guys are bad, women swoon, and nuance doesn't exist. It's just the perception of the world that a host of conservative actors would put together to make a political statement in response to what they perceived as a Communist invasion. None of that means that the film is bad, but it does prevent it from being great, especially when so many other genre representatives have done so much more. It's still a great representative of the Wayne dynamic, a hugely influential piece of popular culture. One major criticism: the antagonists, who seldom seem to form any sort of effective force, and hardly feel threatening despite frequent clashes. (4/5)",

Here the director reunited with his RED RIVER stars Wayne and Brennan\u2014with left-leaning Clift replaced by teen idol Nelson\u2014as a sort of response to the pessimistic anti-McCarthyism of HIGH NOON with a story about the standard conservative platitudes about principled professionalism, personal responsibility, and homosocial camaraderie (not to mention a sense of just barely concealed contempt). In this way, as Richard Brody put it in his review while noting Hawks' authorial signature, \"[t]he movie is simultaneously an apogee of the classic Western style, with its principled violence in defense of just law, and an eccentrically hyperbolic work of modernism, which yokes both bumptious erotic comedy and soul-searing rawness to the mission.\" Nonetheless, today the moralism falls flat and Wayne's larger-than-life persona (even on a smaller-than-scale set) doesn't carry the same weight, yet the sheer craft at work and the nonchalant humor on display keep things engaging and moving, making for a movie and characters (if not the actual cast) you want to hang out with though not hang on to every word and shot.",

I didn\u2019t know what was coming because the cast was such a strange group of actors, including a couple of singers I never imagined in the old west. The first scene was enough to convince me that Dean Martin could fit in despite the fact that I\u2019m used to seeing him in a more suave role. His charisma was used in a different way in this movie, and I thought it was a good method of creating a sympathetic hero. Ricky Nelson also works because they put him in the role of the baby-faced new kid in town. Between these two guys, Walter Brennan, and Angie Dickinson, I was happy with the amount of humor and charm in the movie. They did so much for the film that I could overlook the flat acting of John Wayne. He was allowed to be the straight, boring guy while everyone around him brought energy. Rio Bravo had potential to be one of the more tense movies I\u2019ve ever seen. Every moment it felt like danger was knocking at the door, and the enemy could strike. But I had some trouble understanding the behavior of the characters in the film. For instance there were long stretches when the bad guys would do nothing, despite the fact that they seemed to have an advantage the entire time. There were scenes when the sheriff and his deputies would wander out on pointless errands, and I couldn\u2019t fathom why that was a good decision. Establishing a ticking clock would have helped a lot. I think the result of all these strange choices was a longer runtime than the movie warranted. It dragged more than I would have liked, and I was worried that boredom was going to strike at any moment, but there was just enough tension in the story to keep me engaged. The end was everything that I wanted, and made up for a lot of the slow parts. I think Rio Bravo knew what the audience was waiting to see, and loaded that finale with all of it. Each moment was one more that made me smile like a fool. It was the ideal showdown with some levity, and a healthy dose of drama all mixed into one scene. I was cheering like a fool while sitting alone in a room watching it unfold. It was so delightful and satisfying that I started to forget about the complaints that I had in earlier scenes. The slow pace seemed worthwhile because I started to see it like the pressure building before the cork pops out of the bottle with a glorious fountain of champagne. I don\u2019t think Rio Bravo is one of the greatest Westerns, because they needed to edit somewhat to get the pacing right, but it ended up being a fun ride that was worth the time investment.",

Something to do with some ridiculous love subplot between John Wayne's character and a woman young enough to be his daughter and some other character's backstories that were just unnecessary.

Howard Hawks directed this film out of his dislike of the anti-McCarthyism Gary Cooper western, \"High Noon.\" Star John Wayne hated that film because of it's politics, while Hawks reportedly disliked the film over it's namby-pamby sheriff who has to go around asking for help and can't man-up and do it himself. As with most Hawks films and just about every Wayne film, it's a very masculine picture. Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance arrests no good Claude Akins, who drunkenly kills someone. However, Akins is connected and part of a powerful family, so Wayne has to hold off Akins' brother and his henchmen from busting Claude out of jail. Wayne does have the assistance of the town drunk, Dean Martin, and old man, Walter Brennan, a new kid in town, Ricky Nelson (who does sing a duet with Dean at one point), and also the very leggy Angie Dickinson. Ward Bond is also around too. The film honestly does meander at times and is a western that would seem dated to modern viewers, but for me, it's just a perfect western that has been influential on so many action films, everything from John Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\" to James Cameron's \"Aliens\" to Robert Rodriguez & Quentin Tarantino's \"From Dusk Till Dawn.\" Also of note, the film was written by Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. On a more personal note, \"Rio Bravo\" was my go-to movie for testing girlfriends. And for those who know me, my wife did pass the Rio Bravo test, sitting all the way through it's 141 minutes of it and pretended to like it.",

            "content": "It's Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and, of course, the most dynamite musician of all, Mr. John Wayne, pilgrims. This is a weird cast line-up for a western, which could have just stuck with the singer theme, but seriously, what, were they just supposed to not involve John Wayne in this western? As long as this film is, Wayne would had to have showed up eventually, which is where \"High Noon\" really blew it when it was trying to get Wayne in the lead role... which was probably a little more compelling because Gary Cooper didn't play the same John Wayne role that you couldn't get rid of in the western film industry of '50s. ...No, I'm kidding; there's no getting tired of that good old-fashioned John Wayne charm, especially when it combines with that good old-fashioned Dean Martin charm. Wow, this sounds like one seriously charismatic duo, as well it should be, because two-and-a-half hours might just be a little too long for John Wayne, or at least that's probably what they thought back in 1959, a little bit before Wayne decided to really challenge that theory. Well, folks, this film is at least less overlong and exhausting than \"The Alamo\" and \"The [u]Longest[/u] Day\", which is probably why it's so endearing, you know, outside of that good old-fashioned John Wayne and Dean Martin Charm. With that said, while this film isn't exactly two-and-a-half hours wasted, if it isn't Wayne's voice, then something ought to try your patience.\r\n\r\nIt's debatable just how refreshing the film is in certain places, but it's even harder to deny the film's still often devolving to conventions, with little to say that's new in the unraveling of a story that makes matters worse by taking from melodramatic roots. As with many westerns of this nature, melodramatics play an instrumental role in driving a very Hollywood narrative, and that's fine, but for only so long, before it becomes a touch too obvious that the near-overwrought histrionic plotting seems to be attempting to compensate for natural shortcomings. This is a less adventurous and more intimate Hollywood western that has plenty of intrigue on paper, but also has plenty of natural shortcomings and minimalisms which probably shouldn't be crafted into something of a pseudo-epic. At just shy of two-and-a-half hours, the film tends to seriously outstay its welcome, meandering along with expendable material, as well as potentially dismissible material that seems to be forcibly clung onto the narrative, usually as those aforementioned histrionics. All of this dramatic bloating and structural dragging aren't especially severe issues, but they're recurrent throughout a questionably hefty runtime, and that tires your patience about as much as the times in which, of all things, storytelling falls flat, not just with the thin spells to characterization or anything like that, but with certain thin spells to direction that are near-blanding, and all too often distancing in their sense of stylistic laziness. There's something vacant about this film, and that's a shame, because this film could have done a lot with its length, rather than laze through it, with too much familiarity, bloating and thinness to truly thrive. Still, no matter how much potential goes betrayed, it is still done enough justice to make a pretty decent, and even well-produced western.\r\n\r\nThe production value of this particular, light-scale western is a little too subtle to be especially outstanding, but it is there, orchestrated by art director Leo K. Kuter in a tight fashion that is distinguished enough to draw you into the environment and draw this world about as, if not more colorfully than Jules Furthman's and Leigh Brackett's script. Well, perhaps the art direction does a more consistent job of selling the film, as the screenplay is formulaic, melodramatic and, of course, overblown, but it is still nonetheless clever, with some humor and memorable characterization, in addition to biting dramatic highlights that rally shine a light on the story concept's potential, no matter how limited. The 142-minute runtime wouldn't be as unreasonable as it very much is if the story concept was meaty enough to be more worthy of meaty ambition, which is still not unreasonable itself, as there is still a potential to this intriguing and sometimes colorful portrait on a sheriff's struggles on a path to fulfill justice, and the script, no matter how flawed, does more justice to such potential than Howard Hawks' direction. Hawks seems to understand the limitations of this drama, and therefore feels flat in enough ways for momentum to be retarded to the point of losing reward value, but when Hawks wakes up, momentum is restored, at least enough to entertain, with some effective highlights in genuine tension that actually use the cold storytelling effectively in establishing a certain quiet intrigue. Make no mistake, more than anything, the directorial highlights beget entertainment value that is still pretty limited in the long run, but it's not the only highlight, of which there are enough spread out throughout the near-two-and-a-half-hour runtime for the final product to border on rewarding, at least on the back of what is arguably the most consistently strong aspect. The acting is pretty decent, maybe even solid, for what it is, and while there isn't much to do here, whether it be Angie Dickinson as an intriguingly mysterious woman, or Walter Brennan as the colorfully chatty old deputy, or Dean Martin as a more frustrated and flawed man of justice, or John Wayne as a more soberly engaging, yet also flawed man of justice, there is deliverance across the board, as well as chemistry. Although the film boasts the length of an epic, it's about its characters, and their interactions, and no matter how flat the storytelling is, the performances have heart, of which there is still enough in other areas of filmmaking to make the final product endearing, even though it could have been more.\r\n\r\nAll in all, there's little that's new and plenty that's melodramatic in the draggy and often lazy-feeling telling of a story of only so much meat, thus, the final product falls as underwhelming, but not so deeply that production value, writing highlights, direction highlights and across-the-board enjoyable performances fail to drive Howard Hawks' \"Rio Bravo\" as a plenty entertaining, if plenty flawed western classic.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

It is long and takes awhile to get into it, but it turns out that the film actually needed the earlier length to help add character development.\r\n\r\nWayne plays John Chance, a sheriff in a small Texas frontier town.  When a rough cowboy bully (Claude Akins) kills a man he is jailed, but his wealthy and ruthless brother (John Russell) is enmassing a rowdy group to break him out.\r\n\r\nChance is backed up by a not-so-stellar group of guys.  He has his drunk deputy (Dean Martin), an old crippled deputy (Walter Brennan) and a 17 year old kid (Ricky Nelson)\r\n\r\nThe actors all play well off each other.  The romance between Wayne and Angie Dickinson doesn't really work...maybe the fact that he is in his fifties and she is about 25.  It just seems off.

Probably the best performance comes from Dean Martin, as his character has the most depth, and demons.\n\nAs if one singer in the cast wasn't enough, we have Ricky Nelson too.  Wasn't expecting much from him, but he is fine in his role as the Colorado kid.\n\nHaving Martin and Nelson in the movie means the producers are obliged to have a musical interlude.  It is fairly gratuitous, but I didn't mind it. Good music, well played and sung.\n\nAngie Dickinson provides the love interest, and does so very well.\n\nOnly blemishes are two of the supporting cast: Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as Carlos and Walter Brennan as Stumpy.  You'd swear Gonzalez-Gonzalez's  performance inspired the character of Manuel in Fawlty Towers.  So clumsy and stereotypical it is irritating.  At least Manuel was funny.\n\nWalter Brennan's Stumpy talks far too much and complains far too much, about nothing.  Very irritating.  Hawks should have dialed him down a bit. \n\nA classic western.",

I had been wanting to see this for a while now, finally decided to watch it; John Wayne was the only person I was familiar with so I did not know what to expect. Wayne is more of a great personality than a great actor, still he is always convincing in his trademark role. The other actors are pleasant surprises, so is the film. The main story is about Sheriff Chance (Wayne) holding the brother of a wealthy land owner as a prisoner for murder as the wealthy brother tries to get him out with whatever means. It's quite unconventional for a Western and for the 50s; the romance, the eroticism between the lines, and the film's conclusion. The age difference between Wayne and Dickinson doesn't seem strange, I was pleasantly surprised at how well their romance works, and how much clever humor is put into the screenplay. John Wayne never gets out of his tough persona and he and Angie Dickinson are still able to melt my heart. The only thing that prevents it from being a masterpiece is its lack of a great (or even a decent) villain, when the main event takes place, it sort of falls flat; whatever potential John Russell as Nathan Burdette in his introductory scene had disappears in the climax because he doesn't get any scope. To some extent I did like the aftermath of it, which is why I think it's unconventional, it reminded me of a film made decades after in \"No Country for Old Men.\" Because of how it concludes, the decision the director takes regarding its climax, I am unsure about what the film is really trying to say. It works as a romance and a traditional Western, but I am not sure if it completely puts those two together into a single entity. \n\nThe other films I've seen of Hawks are: \"Bringing Up Baby,\" \"Scarface,\" \"His Girl Friday,\" and \"The Big Sleep.\" I really want to see \"Red River\" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\"",

I found that for a film with a similar concept to High Noon which got its message across in 85 minutes which had finished its buildup of serious drama with a coup de grace of the one and only shootout in the film which made it awesome and memorable, whereas Rio Bravo took 141 long minutes, sub-intense drama, two short boring shootouts and the stereotypical slow pace. For a film with such a high-concept plot, really the key plot line1 sounds Better than it was actually executed since it's buried beneath a load of boring drama, western traditions and hilarious moments with Walter Brennan. Rio Bravo has an important story to tell and some interesting subplots, but it has way too many of them which prevents audiences from being easily able to connect with them or take interest in what is really going on with them.\nFor a film with such a high concept dramatic plot, I just found Rio Bravo to be a little too childish at the intro due to the way its musical score made so many moments into being cartoonish slapstick jokes, moments such as when people are getting injured or killed. It just isn't gritty, and grit is what John Wayne westerns are all about. I mean, one of his most famous is called True Grit, and there isn't much true grit in Rio Bravo. It falls under the more somewhat comedic category of his poor quality film Rooster Cogburn, and that's what it foreshadows the film to be. That's not what Rio Bravo turns out to be about, but even then that's a misleading intro. There are comedic elements\nThe drama of the story really surrounds the final shootout, but it fails to live up to all the buildup and hype that the characters put on it and frankly it's just dull and generic. It isn't intense, and really by that point with all the colours and humour it's been brought down to a family friendly level that it's more reminiscent of a cartoon with Road Runner and Elmer Fudd than a legitimate western. I mean elements of it are serious and some are fun, but director Howard Hawks fails find a balance between these or to balance the themes or pacing well, and so Rio Bravo is left as a film that you really have to save time to watch.\n\nBut visually, Rio Bravo is great because it's well lit and well shot with strong cinematography, and it's very colourful since the visual quality of the camera captures everything in each ground of the screen, and it breathes a good amount of colour into elements such as the tones of wood on the fence and the life in the grass of the background. It prevents Rio Bravo from falling into a visually dull quality that many other westerns before it have. Plus it's sufficiently scripted by ______ and _______, and so the drama the characters experience is explained well by them or to them, and therefore to the viewer.\nAnd John Wayne does make a powerful lead again. At 51 he never stops the heroism on screen and gives a strong performance which ties the scenes together. His natural western charisma is one of the best strengths of Rio Bravo.\nBut Walter Brennan gives the standout performance, one which is so comedically befitting that either the Academy Awards or Golden Globes should have been willing to recognise it. His stereotypical hillbilly character Stumpy is both strong and even more importantly, hilarious. For the man with 3 Academy Awards for Best Supporting actor, he again reminds us what makes him an excellent man of the supporting role by keeping the charms of Rio Bravo alive with a performance which is so goddamned funny that he saves Rio Bravo from being a generic western and makes it a comedic romp with hilarious voice articulation and line delivery. He is a man worth a million laughs, because half the time it's not what he says, it's how he says it. And sometimes it's even the fact that he is saying it. He alone is what makes Rio Bravo a positive quality film in my eyes, and he should have gotten a lot more screen time. Stumpy is an iconic western character thanks to Rio Bravo.\nAngie Dickinson was also a good mix of seductive and swift in her sexual appeal and line delivery respectively, and even though she was inconsistent at times and her character had some poorly written lines.\nDean Martin and Ricky Nelson were also good, Ricky Nelson in particular.\n\nSo Rio Bravo is overrated and overlong, but it's well acted and largely benefits from the comedic efforts of Walter Brennan, as well as being a very influential film.",

Rio Bravo is a Western classic combining the best from it ensemble with deep characters and direction that's perfect for the genre.\n\nRio Bravo is about a small-town sheriff in the American West enlisting the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy. The pacing starts out slow and stays simple for quite awhile but once things start getting interesting you'll be hooked into it. The characters are fleshed out and full of depth. They are funny, serious, flawed, and most of all have a interesting friendship between our heroes. I did feel that the character of Colorado had little to do and only appeared when the plot needed him. The plot keeps getting better the longer you watch it as it's filled with intelligent heroes and a equally intelligent outlaw. These outlaw don't simply just walk into a saloon and starts shooting up the place. These outlaws devise plans that are interesting to see unfolding and builds tension as you'll never sure if our heroes will make it out alive. The dialogue is great and becomes memorable thanks the cast delivery of them. It filled with enough humor to make it enjoyable even when the drama starts building up. The plot might start out slow but great deep characters and a plot that takes interesting turns makes it worth sitting through.\n\nThe ensemble cast have great chemistry on screen, especially when John Wayne and Dean Martin share scenes. Walter Brennan is hilarious as the comic foil, John Wayne does a great job playing himself, and Dean Martin plays the complex and troubled drunk man convincingly. Ricky Nelson  was good as Colorado and manage to hold own screen convincingly with the legendary actors. He unfortunately didn't have much lines in the film which means you'll see him as part of the background. The cinematography is phenomenal doing more than just capturing the beauty of it scenery of it's setting. You'll always see characters placed in interesting places in a frame and adds atmospheric music to setup to scene if necessary to build a particular emotion. Great cinematography and a great cast helps Rio Bravo stand above in the Western gene.\n\nRio Bravo has a great plot, interesting characters, wonderful cast that deliver great performances as well being enjoyable in their roles, and perfect direction that does more than shows us great scenery. Rio Bravo is worth watching whether or not if you're a fan of Westerns.",

In a way the film is overrated by some, but it has just about everything a western needs (besides a terrific theme) and gets better upon multiple viewings. Perhaps the best character driven Western since Stagecoach. Fantastic final shootout, writing, and sets. Short warning: Manly, conservative underlings may turn off feminist and liberal viewers.",

It has everything that the makes the genre great. It has tough leader, with two under respected helpers against a lot of bad guys. Then comes the young gunslinger to help out the undermanned sheriff. The setting looks great as a backdrop to the violence that ensues. It may be a tad bit longwinded, but the actors and plot will keep your attention for the 140 minute runtime.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Chance arrests Joe Burdette for murder and locks him in the local jail. Joe's brother assembles a team to of hired hands to watch the town and make sure that the sheriff can't take Joe away from the town. Soon, a battle ensues between the authorities and Burdette. This plot has been used a million times since Rio Bravo, but never has it been done as well as it was here.\u00a0\n\nThis isn't my favorite Western, nor is it my favorite John Wayne movie, but it is one of the best in both categories. If you're a fan of the genre, there isn't much you can find to complain about here. It's right up there with Stagecoach, Once Upon a Time in the West, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, when talking about the best of the genre. What makes it so great is Howard Hawk's wonderful direction and a big name cast that includes John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson.\n\nRio Bravo is a must see for the casual and die hard film fan alike. There's a reason it has acquired its status as a genre masterpiece.\u00a0\n\nJohn T. Chance: Sorry don't get it done, Dude. That's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again.\u00a0",

Every Saturday he watched a western so I was force-fed the genre.  Somehow, I missed this one.\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n1)  This film was made after John Wayne was firmly entrenched as 'The Duke'.  The camera is all on him and he shines as his standard character type -- strong and not overly-wordy.\r\n2)  Originally, Montgomery Clift was cast as Dude, but Dean Martin stepped into the role surprisingly well, in one of his best roles.  \r\n3)  The pace of the film lags in places, and modern audiences may become impatient with the lack of action in areas.\r\n4)  The age gap between Wayne and his love interest (Angie Dickinson) is 25 years -- and it shows.  Dickinson holds her own against Wayne, but its not completely believable.\r\n\r\nWhy I gave it a 60%?  The \"romance\" was actually a distraction from the story.",

However, Wayne's likable performance coupled with Dean Martin's surprising turn as a drunk gunslinger makes this film worth watching, as well as occasionally funny and exciting, especially the closing sequence. Still though, how this is seen by many as one of the best movies ever is beyond me. It's just like \"The Searchers\", it bogs down from time to time and it goes on a little long, but when you have a master actor like Wayne at the helms, more than likely it will somehow, someway, still win you over at the end due to its irresistible charm despite its faults.",

The Duke's acting is more natural and understated than a lot of the hammy over-the-top performances he's put in. Dean Martin is great as Wayne's deputy trying his utmost to stay on the wagon. Walter Brennan's crazy turn is superb and even Ricky Nelson isn't bad. There are a couple of nice musical moments and Angie Dickcinson is gorgeous. Very good and highly recommended.",

            "content": "Hawk's 2 & 1/2 hour celebration of heroism is actually an intimate and leisurely paced western. Partially a response to Zimmerman's indictment of cold war cowardice \"High Noon\", Hawks exhaustively explores redemption and bravado. Yet, what sets this film apart from other testosterone charged westerns is that Hawks looks at the price of such courage.  Martin's ongoing quest for redemption amid the battle with the brutes feels very authentic and adds a surprising amount of emotional depth to a genre that allows no time for tears. \nAlso, Hawks adds a dose of realism to the film by having characters feel physically ill after a bout of violence.\nHowever, other than the touching character studies, I never really got a sense of what was at stake during this battle between good and evil. \nThe so called villians aren't really explored and by the time we reach the climactic final shoot out, it becomes really hard to care about who wins.\nThis is made worse by Hawks' idealism, which  often suffocates the realism that could have really made this film incredible. The good seem to always be in the right and one gets the feeling that Wayne's life is never at stake. In the final battle, Wayne is able to pretty much stand out in the open and experiences no danger. He is also able to hammer out any one liner he wants to, regardless of the impending doom.\nWayne's character is of the ilk that if a man is given a chance to do the right thing, he will. While I think this was probably a message that cold war audiences really needed to be fed, it detracts from the realism that Hawks explores elsewhere in the film. Sure Martin's character experiences hard times, but you know he will come surely come around. \nI suppose I set myself up for failure by watching a lot of Italian Westerns before this. After spending so much time with morally ambivalent characters, these characters seem a little too puffy at times to be taken too seriously.\nIt is an entertaining watch and Hawks is a phenomenal storyteller, I just think tonally he wanted it all in this film and it makes it feel inconsistent.",

            "content": "Just watched this for the first time.  Wanted to watch the original True grit, but it wasnt streaming on Netflix so I settled for another of John Waynes pictures.  \r\n\r\nOk, this is from 1959, so it looks old.  Though, it doesn't look 1959 old.  It looks 70s TV western old.  Still, it looks quite dated and doesnt seem to have the nice large EPIC shots of wagons roaming and lone men marching across desserts.  This movie does NOT feel epic in scope.  It feels contained and a little cheap for that reason (although it suits the story fine.)\r\n\r\nThe basic story is that John wayne is the sheriff and he has a guy in jail who his gangleading brother or friend wants to bust out.  Sherrif wayne needs to prevent a jailbreak for a few days until the county or state marshall comes to get the prisoner or something.  This is a simple story, but the movie is quite long and the focus often shifts to Dean Martins (good actor for a singer, the justin timberlake of his time) character who is a recovering alcoholic deputy and John Waynes love interest.  \r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this western is that it didn't feel like a western.  It felt like a romance set in the old west.  The conflict with the prisoner and the gang was more like a problem for the developing relationship than a problem in and of itself.  Lots of old time \"romantic\" lines like, \"why'd you have to go and say a thing like that\".  But man Angie Dickinson is great in this.  Definately my favorite character in this flick.  SO while I liked the romance, I felt it detracted from the \"westerness\" of the picture.\r\n\r\nIve read that this film is supposed to be a reaction of sorts to High Noon, and maybe a greater understanding of that issue may lend some more weight to this picture, but it just feels so light.  They even break into a ridiculous song in the jail cell (now I get that scene in The Three Amigos).  All in all it was alright and maybe was GREAT back in 59.  It just doesn't hold up like the great spaghetti westerns or other John wayne movies like The Searches and Stagecoach.",

I only watched this film because I have always been a big Dean Martin Fan. However I like to watch all different kinds of movies, and study them, I guess that includes the American Western. I did like \"The Searchers\" though. Rio Bravo is a lot of fun with drama on the side. John Wayne does his usual, sort of \"acting\" but its mainly just him trying to look more manly and tougher than he actually is, however he actually kind of acts in the film, I guess he was so popular because he represented the stereotypical \"patriot\" a guy who used his words and was afraid to use violence. Dean Martin was actually a pretty damn good actor. Ricky Nelson did not have too hard of a role, he just kind of had to sit there and sing a little bit and there would be millions of girls flocking to the theater. Angie Dickinson really did not have to do a lot of acting either, she just had to sit there and look beautiful and maybe cry a little bit, just so she could say she did some acting. With this review one might think that I did not like the movie, well that's wrong. It probably the most enjoyable western I've ever seen, it's actually pretty well written and directed, and it's one that I would love to see again",

What I love about westerns so much is that they show us a way of life that we are unfamiliar with, they show us a world where law sometimes doesn't exist, where both heroes and criminals can be larger than life. That's a huge reason why John Wayne was such a larger than life star because he was in so many westerns. Wayne gives an average performance as usual, and he's never been that great, but he's played some great characters and he doesn't so much do that here. However, Dean Martin stole the show as a former drunk turned deputy. I was skeptical at first. I'm like yeah, Sinatra could act, but what about Dean Martin? Twenty minutes in I'm like oh, he's good. Not heavy on plot but this western is heavy on action, some memorable characters, and some rich direction from Howard Hawks.",

Chance is holding Joe in prison with Dude, Colorado, and Stumpy and they have to wait a week for him to be collected.  The only problem is that his brother is in town and he wants to get Joe no matter what it takes.  Dude is freshly off the booze and he is constantly being tempted by alcohol.  Colorado is a young gunman who is stuck because the man he came with was shot.  Stumpy is a crippled old man.  But as a team these guys are unstoppable.  Feathers is a woman who came to town and could leave, but instead she falls in love with Chance and skips out on the stagecoach leaving town.  Here comes the \"John Wayne is the man\" part of the story.  Even though he can lead these people to stop a gang of men from taking a prisoner out of jail, he also gets the most beautiful woman in town.  Everyone has their flaws, and everyone is a believable human being.  Howard Hawks creates a film that is exciting on plot, but is also filled as a character driven film.  Much better than I expected when it started.",

            "content": "\"Rio Bravo\" will always be inextricably linked with \"High Noon.\" The genesis of the film started with director Howard Hawks' dissatisfaction with contemporary Fred Zinnemann's movie \"High Noon,\" an allegory for McCarthyism set in the Old West. \n\nHawks' retort came seven years later with a superstar cast, including standards of the genre (John Wayne, the incomparable Walter Brennan) and unusual faces (Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson) alike. The result is a remarkably entertaining film that takes a simple premise -- a sheriff, his deputies, and a handful of decent folk must guard their town from criminal gunslingers -- and finds many moods, ranging from comical to tense to even introspective (thanks mainly to Martin's revelatory turn as a lawman trying to shake alcoholism). \n\nSo, between \"Noon\" and \"Bravo,\" which of these rival films is better? The answer is \"High Noon;\" it's tighter, more intense, more enduring, and more satisfactory than Hawks' rebuttal. However, \"Rio Bravo\" is still a classic of the Western genre, and though it meanders a bit too much, it's a master class in Hawks' ability to wrangle a great cast and dip his toe in multiple genres to almost peerless effect.",

Now with the outlaw's team of thugs trying to kill the law and break their leader out, the sheriff must deal with protecting the town, calming his troubled friend, and keeping his mind on his job and not the seductive lady coming on to him. This is a good Western with The Duke in his most heroic role. The mission of one man up against many problems. But no matter what, he always stays the hero and finds a way. The movie might be too long for my liking, and Walter Brennan doesn't help that he is the Western equivilant to Jar Jar Binks.\r\n\r\nAll set in a little, seemingly quiet town, the creation of the town is very well done and kept up with a good Western feel. But I like most of all how the movie's director, Howard Hawks, is able to show some really good emotional scenes with Dean Martin, and some really good suspenceful scenes. (my favourite being Dean Martin entering the tavern through the front door).\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of John Waynes most iconic movies, and being one of my favourite roles of Dean Martin. This is a great Western, for the fact that it portrays it's sheriff as a man who would do anything to keep the peace, which was actually how it was back then. Some good emotion mixed with good action, Rio Bravo is one of the best American made Westerns.",

            "content": "Along with True Grit, I finally got to see the classic Rio Bravo on TCM. So this was supposed to be the \"real\" spirit of the West opposed to Cooper's \"High Noon\". A fashion conscious sheriff who wears a red shirt on one day and a blue on the next, I wonder who does his laundry? A drunkard and an old geezer as his wingmen, a \"funny\" stereotype Mexican couple who run a hotel, a dance hall girl who has a crush on the sheriff, and a saloon keeper. Not to mention lots and lots of firearms and ammo for everybody. In the beginning there are quite a few people on the streets, later the town seems to be deserted except for the mentioned individuals plus an unspecified amount of hired gunmen out to free an imprisoned murderer.\r\n\r\nWhere did all the people of the little town go? They just disappear without any trace. My guess is that there was much more gun action than shown on screen and that many good citizens succumbed under the \"friendly fire\" of the forces of the law. John Wayne and his companions are nervous and extremely trigger happy, the sheriff's plan to hold out alone and wait for the Marshall to pass through the town does not seem to be dictated by common sense (there would have been alternatives) but by personal pride. There is no interaction whatsoever between him and the community he is supposed to serve. Frankly, the sheriff seems to be a pretty irresponsible guy with the mind of an adolescent - and responsibility was the main theme of High Noon, a film, it must be said, of a different league.\r\n\r\nThe main protagonists have to deliver long, winding, unnatural monologues as to their motives and feelings, which makes the movie also slow at times. This surplus of talk unfortunately does not give it or its message more substance but harms it suspense-wise. As for the performances, John Wayne is always John Wayne. He doesn't really act (Stagecoach the exception) but his mere presence just finalizes the job. Ricky Nelson was also a complete misfit, simply in this film because of his heartthrob status he had back then. Amidst the general mediocrity, the brilliant performance of Dean Martin (I was surprised since I heard he was a terrible actor) as the alcoholic who wants to regain his standing among men stands out clearly. The same can be said for the use of music which is beautiful but somewhat irrelevant. In the end, I found Rio Bravo unconvincing and filled with inconsistencies with the filmmaking; the only bright spot was Martins role. \r\n\r\nStory: C\r\nActing: B\r\nDirection: C-\r\nVisuals: C+ \r\nOverall: C\r\n\r\n** out of 4 stars",

Though it was made in response to the film \"High Noon,\" it follows patterns similar to the masterpiece and my favourite western of them all, \"Shane,\" in which a bunch of mysterious characters (played by John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson) protect a town from a bunch of villainess cowboys from running in. It is like \"Shane\" times three, since there are more heroes and villains alike. Also noticeable is the reluctant affair between Angie Dickinson and Waynes' characters, similar to that of Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur potential love interest in \"Shane,\" only in \"Rio Bravo,\" it does blossom by the end in something big. Despite its relaxed pace, Rio Bravo is an absolutely beautiful western under Howard Hawks. It is fascinating to watch, well-acted, filled with a unique array characters, and has a bizarrely intriguing plot. It is indeed a great piece of work, and, like \"Shane,\" one of the best westerns of them all.",

Well, if this is his masterpiece, then he certainly is as much legend as Ed Wood or Mel Brooks.\r\nI know that Rio Bravo is kind of a comedy. But isn't it sad if the funniest scene is one that isn't supposed to be funny?

Some well-meaning amatuers, most of 'em worried about their wives and kids. Burdette has 30 or 40 men, all professionals. Only thing they're worried about is earning their pay. No, Pat. I'd just be giving them more targets to shoot at. A lot of people'd get hurt. Joe Burdette isn't worth it. He isn't worth one of them that'd get killed. \r\nPat Wheeler: Then what are you gonna do?

Chance: I'd say he is. \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he's so good, he doesn't feel he has to prove it. \r\n\r\n\r\nStumpy: Joe don't get no sugar in his coffee; he just gets water poured over the grounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n[last lines] \r\nStumpy: You think I'll ever get to be a sheriff? \r\nDude: Not unless you mind your own business. \r\n[Stumpy cackles]",

I did like \"The Searchers\" though. Rio Bravo is a lot of fun with drama on the side. John Wayne does his usual, sort of \"acting\" but its mainly just him trying to look more manly and tougher than he actually is, however he actually kind of acts in the film, I guess he was so popular because he represented the stereotypical \"patriot\" a guy who used his words and was afraid to use violence. Dean Martin was actually a pretty damn good actor. Ricky Nelson did not have too hard of a role, he just kind of had to sit there and sing a little bit and there would be millions of girls flocking to the theater. Angie Dickinson really did not have to do a lot of acting either, she just had to sit there and look beautiful and maybe cry a little bit, just so she could say she did some acting. With this review one might think that I did not like the movie, well that's wrong. It probably the most enjoyable western I've ever seen, it's actually pretty well written and directed, and it's one that I would love to see again.",

            "content": "It's been said that John Wayne was so appalled at the notion that a U.S. Marshall would beg his townsfolk, townsfolk with families, for help in a showdown that he and director Howard Hawks responded to it with Rio Bravo, a film that is the complete opposite of High Noon in every way. Unlike other westerns, Hawks' film takes place mostly in claustrophobic areas such as the hotel rooms and hallways as well as the jailhouse. Furthermore, where High Noon's run time takes place in almost real time around 85 minutes, Rio Bravo takes it's time with a leisurely pace of nearly 2 and a half hours (taking place in three days) to tell this tale of Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) on a border town who arrests a murderer, who's gang, he promises, will take revenge on Chance. Unlike Gary Cooper's character in High Noon, John Wayne's character has a handful of people that are willing to help him out, all of which he entrusts to do so because he knows they can handle the job. One of the people he puts his trust on is a drunken deputy named Dude (Dean Martin) who, while he hasn't lost all of his skill, just isn't the same as he used to be. Walter Brennan is the toothless, crippled old deputy who guards the jail cells. Ricky Nelson plays Colorado Ryan, a young gunman who arrives in town with Chance's old friend, trail boss Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond in his final film). Wheeler offers his and his men's services in helping Chance as deputies but Chance turns his offers down as they're not \"professionals\" but Chance does ask Colorado for his services, though he initially turns him down. Angie Dickinson, a very sexy Dickinson, plays Wayne's love interest, Feathers, a dance hall entertainer that arrives in town and nearly gets locked up by Chance for cheating at cards, until he finds out that he was wrong and that she isn't guilty. Wheeler is later murdered by one of Nathan Burdette's (John Russell) hired guns. Dude kills the hired gun in a confrontation inside a saloon. Colorado joins Chance after his boss is killed and takes over for what Dude can't handle. Burdette eventually takes Dude and holds him up for an exchange for his brother Joe (Claude Akins). This leads the men to the final confrontation between Chance and Burdette, where the dynamite-filled wagons brought into town by the murdered Wheeler play a crucial role in beating Burdette and his men.\n\nRight-wingers John Wayne and Howard Hawks created a classic western that is in many ways, THE quintessential western. It is a western that holds up as high as any of John Ford's classics. It works on all levels with great character development, some good shootouts and masterful direction from one of the best, Howard Hawks. John Wayne is as good as ever as the sheriff of the small town; Dean Martin is great as alcoholic deputy who tries to lay off of the hooch but whenever he does he begins to get the shakes and ends up back on the bottle, causing him to be less skillful with his gun; and Walter Brennan as usual brings most of the humor to film. Ricky Nelson and the beautiful Angie Dickinson are also excellent in their roles. It's safe to say everyone brings their A game. Besides the exploding (literally!) finale, one of the highlights of the film is a very light moment where Dean Martin sings a song with Ricky Nelson playing his acoustic guitar and Walter Brennan on the harmonica. It just wouldn't be right to have a movie starring Martin and Nelson and not have them sing something; luckily for us, they sing two songs. The scene where Dean Martin kills the man hiding at the top of the saloon is another big highlight of the film. In fact, the whole film is one long, leisurely paced highlight. It's just a movie that is enjoyable from beginning to end. It stands as one of the best examples of a truly great western, one that ranks high on the list of classic traditional westerns along with The Searchers, Stagecoach, Red River, Shane and High Noon. Rio Bravo is essential viewing for fans of the western genre, there's no other way to put it. 10/10",

Only three appear in \"Rio Bravo.\" In the opening scene where Joe shoots an unarmed man: Joe's revolver is shown in close-up, when he rolls a cigarette, and later when Dude pours the whiskey back into a bottle. It features a long opening scene with absolutely no dialogue.\r\nThe musical score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. His score contains the haunting tune \"El Deg\u00fcello\", which is played several times to build tension. A character (Colorado, played by Nelson) identifies the tune as \"The Cutthroat Song\". He relates the song's historical playing on the orders of Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna to the Texans holed up in the Alamo to signify that no quarter would be given. The tune was used in the following year, over the opening credits of Wayne's film, The Alamo. Composer Ennio Morricone recalled director Sergio Leone requesting him to write \"Dimitri Tiomkin music\" for A Fistful of Dollars. The trumpet theme is similar to Tiomkin's \"Deguella\" while the Italian title of Rio Bravo was Un Dollaro D'onore.\r\nBecause the film starred a crooner, Martin, and a teen idol, Nelson, Hawks included three songs in the soundtrack. Before the big showdown, in the jail house, Martin sings \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" (which contained new lyrics to a Tiomkin tune that appeared in Red River) accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of \"Get Along Home, Cindy\", accompanied by Martin and Brennan. Over the closing credits, Martin, backed by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, sings a specially composed song, \"Rio Bravo.\" Nelson later paid homage to both the film and his character, Colorado, by including the song \"Restless Kid\" on his 1959 LP, Ricky Sings Again.\r\nA brief clip from Rio Bravo was among the archive footage later incorporated into the opening sequence of Wayne's last film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character.\r\nSimply one of the best westwrns ever made.Dry and direct like a shot this movie makes we want to see more and more westerns.In my collection now.",

            "content": "It's not hard to recognize a classic when you'll see one. In most cases the great movies are established with great characters. It shows also in this 50's piece of US Wester brilliance.\n\nSheriff Chance is the main character -who played by John Wayne- has a very minimalistic approach on everything, a sturdy presence of a man who mostly communicates only when needed and even then with only simple lines or complete one-liners. That is enough because he (both Wayne and his character) suit the movie really well and it's easy to see there's good chemistry between the leading man and the supporting acts. \n\nBut supporting acts are really the ones that steal the show here. Stumpy (Brennan) is one of the most memorable characters I've witnessed on the screen in a long time. A grumpy old man who has crippled leg but is still the most reliable foe when needed. He deliveres some really good dialogue and is also the welcomed comic relief (still not in a corny way!) amonside the drama and action. \"Feathers\", the woman in the centre of the movie (Dickinson) stays a bit distant at times but that is good as the westerns are not about romance. She still stands her ground with cleverly delivered dialogue and is equipped with nice looks suited well for this era. Colorado (Nelson) is a good characted also as a \"trigger happy youth\" but I'm not sure about the casting of Nelson as he seems a bit too polished with his white smirk amongs the more grittier characters usually spotted around the West.\n\nLast centric character, \"Dude\", is played by Dean Martin. Martin of course more known as a singer and part of the \"Rat pack\" that included Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. I will just tell you that I'm sure he surprises a lot of people with his performance, at least the uneducated ones who are not familiar with his acting side. It was usual for the stars in the early-midst 20th century to both sing and act (Elvis, Sinatra all did it) but if you forget for a while that he is a singer you just notice his delivering a really good performance. He has a sort of problem with the alcohol to say the least ;)\n\nHaving seen a bunch of westerns I think Rio Bravo stands on it's own table in it's own saloon. It isn't the usual American Western with the indians and trains etc, nor does it have the artistic touch and feel of the Italo Westerns a'la Leone. Even being situated in a singe town the movie has everything to be worth of one's free time; action, drama, good dialogue, great characters and even some western type singing. I'm glad I have a couple of more westerns still waiting to be watched as Rio Bravo has set the bar pretty high for the non-Leone classics I haven't seen yet.",

            "content": "Who says that the old west is out of style? This is my first exposure to director Howard Hawks, and I am now more than sold on his character building abilities. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out he was an inspiration to J.J Abrams, another director who creates such fascinating characters with uncanny depth. With Rio Bravo, Sheriff Chance (John Wayne) has captured a brother of a famous ranch owner for murder. The ranch owner named Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) vows that he will do everything he can to break his brother free. Chance enlists the help of a drunk sharpshooter simply named \"Dude\" (Dean Martin), an old geyser Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a sharp, young quick draw Colorado (Ricky Nelson). Together they form an alliance to fight off all the accomplices and plans that Joe throws at them. Hawks dives right into the thick of things with an opening bar sequence that is wordless. Off we go to the jail, then the fun begins. Rio Bravo is not only satisfying on a level of excitement, but also on a level of intimacy with the characters. Many scenes hold your interest as the characters banter and converse back and forth. Sometimes it is comedic, sometimes dramatic. It even gets romantic when a mysterious woman card player only known as Feathers (Angie Dickinson) enters the mix. These performances are so good. They are forced to face their faults and the scenes are delivered so well. I wish I knew these characters in real life. Rio Bravo is a great western that has an incredibly high entertainment value, even for today's generation. Bravo Mr. Hawks, bravo!\r\n\r\nThe plot is simple enough which allows for these characters to grow. Wayne has the straight man role as Sheriff Chance. It's obvious he is a good sheriff and he always means well, which is why he doesn't just shoot first and ask questions later. He believes in giving an honest man a chance. \"Wait for the Marshall,\" he always says. Colorado enters the fray when a stagecoach escort enters town. You can tell Chance sees himself in Colorado. Young, smart, full of ambition and promise. Colorado is such a fascinating character because he seems to be so much smarter than the average teen around those times. He is not out getting drunk and making a fool out of himself, he can shoot a gun and he is crafty. The scene where some gun men hold up Chance is a fantastic scene that is so slick, if you blink you miss it. \r\n\r\nThen, we have two performances that really outshine the rest of the stellar cast. Dean Martin as Dude is so complex and motivational. He is a man who finds his refuge in drinking his sorrows away. The only problem with this is, he is trying to quit. His hands shake as he tries to fight off the urge. He has lost his youth to a stupid addiction. You fall so hard for him as he breaks down and gives up. When Colorado is given a deputy job in place of Dude, he asks Chance \"Is he as good as I used to be?\" These devastating lines strip Dude down to rags. He has lost his way and all hope seems to be lost for this honest and well-meaning man. \r\n\r\nThen we have the gorgeous Angie Dickinson playing Feathers, a woman who seems to be a gambling con thief who Chance accuses and finds out that she isn't exactly guilty. She finds immediate interest for the man in uniform, but she isn't a simple bimbo. Chance wants her to get on the stagecoach and head out of town for safety, but she stays, because she wants to be around Chance some more. When she is confronted by Chance as to why she didn't leave, she nails him with her wit. He says she should stop wearing those feathers, and she replies \"That's what I would do if I were the kind of girl you think I am.\" This girl plays mind games like there is no tomorrow. The edge between Chance and Feathers is infectious. In an incredible drunk scene, Feathers rambles on and on, sometimes not even making sense. Dickinson steals all of the scenes she is in because of her beauty and her sly, sensual tone she adds to her lines. \r\n\r\nIf I had any complaints about Rio Bravo its that some of these characters were underused. The Mexican bar owner named Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) just comes in and out of the movie like a chicken with his head cut off delivering news or panic. He was a tad annoying because he really had no purpose other than a few sporadic laughs and necessary lines to move the plot forward. He was definitely out of place in the films finale when he brought some shells to help Chance. Why would he do something like this? We see he can't even shoot a gun properly.\r\n\r\nThere is also a massive under-usage of the villain Joe Burdette. Much like Carlos, he arrives and leaves very quickly. He is sort of the mysterious, distant villain that I really wanted to know better. It's obvious this guy is smart, with all the plans he set up for Chance and the gang, but I would have preferred to see him more. Instead of being the ghost running the show, why not be the bad guy with balls? I would have preferred he showed his face more often and was more of a threat. He only seems to threaten with his social status and large amount of money to pay off his villains. The pay off would have been better if Joe proved he can shoot with the best of them. Still, Joe is a decent villain with obvious motivation, he just seemed to be missing from many scenes.\r\n \r\nHowever, when the film reaches the grand finale, only then do you start to realize just how awesome all of these characters were. Stumpy is a prime example of comic relief. He is always mumbling and grumbling especially when he gets made fun of. He is a cantankerous old man, he knows that, so he has a ball with it. Particularly in the finale when the dynamite starts to fly, he spouts a classic line. \"Hey Dude! How do you like them apples?\" Classic. Once the characters begin to sing \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" you know that we have something special. Over a simple moment of peace and relaxation, these characters flourish. Howard Hawks fills these characters with so much emotion and credibility, you wish that they existed. Who wouldn't want to just hang out and have a beer with people like this? Hawks uses that audience bondage to craft an impeccable western that is simple and striking. Rio Bravo flies on the strength of its actors, the simplicity of its plot and the wonderful direction by Hawks. After Rio Bravo was done, I was shouting for an encore.",

People of all ages and gender can appreciate this classic because it covers so much ground and truly depicts the lifestyle and attitude of the time period. John T. Chance, easily one of John Wayne?s most memorable roles. He?s as charming as he is quick with a shotgun. The cast doesn?t end there though, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson are a wonderful supporting team that gives so much to the lovable nature of the film itself. Walter Brennan as Stumpy still makes me laugh, by far the greatest comedic relief to ever exist in a single movie. The story is pretty interesting in that it has about four central plots going on at the same time, but it works wonderfully and feels more natural than just having a simple jail defense for two and a half hours. Howard Hawks never fails to make a visually stunning screen, this is one of the most beautiful westerns that rivals John Ford. This is a movie that should be seen by all, it?s truly remarkable and in my opinion flawless.",

I still slightly prefer the grittiness of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or McCabe and Mrs Miller, but Rio Bravo is an entertaining, lovable western complete with clear-cut good and bad guys. The plot is smart and suspenseful, peppered with some memorable shootouts, but the true appeal of Rio Bravo is the characters. They're deeply likable in general, and the movie's leisurely, down-to-earth pacing lets them just hang out plenty, with witty dialogue and one warm scene where they all sing together. So while Rio Bravo might not be the most overwhelmingly impressive movie ever made, it's so likable, cozy and (at times) suspenseful that I easily fell in love with it.",

            "content": "Grade: A+\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Films\r\n\r\nRio Bravo is a Howard Hawks Western. As far as archetypal Westerns go, this film is pretty damn great. John Wayne plays Sheriff John t. Chance of a small western town, as he and his 3 deputies attempt to stave off a posse of bandits working for a rich rancher  for six days as they hold the rancher's murderer brother in jail; the bandits would like him released. Chance intends to turn the murderer over to the marshal, who supposedly will arrive in six days. \r\n\r\nWalter Brennan plays a cripple whose job it is to guard the cell. He does a good job of bringing a little straight humour to a sometimes overly dry film as far as dialogue (the formality is sometimes overbearing). Then there is Dean Martin who plays Dude, an extremely talented sharpshooter officer, except he has a serious vice in his alcoholism; the film basically follows Dean's character in his  moral and mental struggle between upholding the law while keeping a job or falling back into alcoholic binges. Dean's character Dude is attempting to keep it together during this particularly dangerous time.\r\n\r\nAngie Dickinson is the Sheriff's love interest, who doubles as an aid to him in some tight spots with the bandits as well. The love story is mildly interesting, and perhaps a bit risqu\u00e9 for a Western and it's better than most Western love stories. Thankfully though, it never gets in the way of the main plot, and invites a bit of Western style relationship humour.\r\n\r\nThe film is very deliberately paced, sometimes a bit too slow, but the pace does evoke the long haul of the six days, as they wait for the murderer's brother to arrive, and then stave him and his posse off repeatedly. A handful of tense encounters between both sides, both using dialogue and with gun slinging, add excitement to the film.  \r\n\r\nAs the days wear on, a young gunslinger by the name of Colorado (Ricky Nelson) catches the eye of Chance, who feels he could use his skills to fight the bandits. Part of the plot involves the increasing trust between Chance and Colorado, and the building of their mutual respect. As the sheriff and his men speak of Colorado: \r\n\r\nJohn T. Chance: [Referring to Colorado] it's nice to see a smart kid for a change. \r\nStumpy: Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun. \r\nDude: Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said? \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he is. \r\nJohn T. Chance: I'd say he's so good, he doesn't feel he has to prove it.\r\n\r\nColorado is an interesting part to the film, and pretty much represents the antithesis of Dean Martin's character, even if they both have similar qualities.\r\n\r\nThe film has a number of great sequences, including one in a bar when Chance and Dude are looking for a hiding bandit, and enter the bar looking for him. The final shootout is pretty wild and entertaining as well; its funny how all the main players show up during the climax; contrived yes, but the way they are depicted in these situations is what makes it memorable, despite any notion of implausibility.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of Westerns is over time becoming more and more, and this is one of the better ones I have seen. With a cast like this and a Director of Hawks stature, I knew this was one I had to cross off my invisible must-see list; I was more than satisfied.",

In the years since its release in 1959,the film has been re-made twice as a Western , and also provided the inspiration for John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' (1976.) Hawks' film itself was actually inspired by another Western, which was released seven years earlier. Fred Zinnemann's 'High Noon' (1952), starred Gary Cooper as a town sheriff, who finds himself the target of a vengeful criminal, whom he bought to justice years earlier. Alone against his enemy, Cooper's sheriff appeals to his townspeople for help, and none of them answer this call, leaving him to fight alone. Both Hawks and Wayne believed that a sheriff would never act in this manner and consequently, whilst various people offer to help Wayne's sheriff, he rejects their assistance, preferring to stand alone. For the most part the film eschews the expansive outdoor locales and vistas which characterise many Westerns, and is principally shot inside, which helps create a sense of claustrophobia. The performances of the lead characters complement each other very well, with Walter Brennan providing some very funny comic relief. Meanwhile Hawks' direction is typically assured throughout, not least in the opening scenes of the film, completely bereft of dialogue.",
