Kudos to Criterion for including two commentary tracks, one in French (with subtitles) from Truffaut's friend since childhood, who was the inspiration for one of the characters.\n\nThe single negative review \u2013 mistakenly dated by Rotten Tomatoes as 15 September 2021 \u2013 is by Manny Farber in a publication called \"The New Leader\" and was published in the issue dated 22 February 1960.  Farber's article is entitled \"New Low Pressure Films by French Amateurs Start Small and Cold and Stay That Way\".  The magazine's last print edition was in 2006 and it's last online edition in 2010.\n\nDoes this sound open-minded and relative to any of today's readers?\n\nWere it not for this \"review\" the film would take its rightful place as 100% Fresh.",

Francois Truffaut's debut film is a powerful examination of disaffected youth, filled with memorable and explosive scenes that never fail to ring true.  While often considered a cornerstone of the French New Wave, Truffaut's film lacks many of the stylistic excesses (no jump cuts!!) of the movement and is content to let the events play out in a more traditional visual style.  The 400 Blows is quality cinema from beginning to end, thanks to Truffaut's restrained direction and the performance of Jean-Pierre Leaud as the young protagonist.",

Furthermore, the acting was well done, the sets/props/costumes were excellent, there was some nice cinematography and symbolism (e.g. the shots through the bars/fences), the visual effects (e.g. for the spinning ride) were decent, and the soundtrack had some beautiful bits in it.

            "content": "An honest look at childhood without the frills.\n\nThe 400 Blows (1959) is Francois Truffaut's brutally honest and emotionally in tuned take on a coming of age drama with his French New Wave style. Truffaut wrote a devilish clever script full of euphemisms and wit. He brings up his own past with the autobiographical story told through the lens of the young boy Antoine Doinel.\n\nTruffaut's direction is stunning with long panning shots down Parisian streets, extended tracking shots of running down a road, steady close ups, and aerial perspectives alike. Truffaut's use of the camera gives us full view of all the events in The 400 Blows. He makes sure you see each hit against his adolescence. The cruel words, hard strikes, and devastating decisions made herein are fascinating to witness.\n\nLean-Pierre Leaud is remarkable as Antoine Doinel. His youthful rebellion and affectionate despair is very believable for such a young actor. His face reveals an inner sadness and thoughtfulness most actors never achieve after a lifetime of acting, yet Leaud transforms the film into something deeply empathetic. You feel his pain and excitement with each scene and face.\n\nThe supporting cast in The 400 Blows is incredible as it is full of intriguing figures. Patrick Auffay is great as the mischievous friend Rene Bigey. Claire Maurier is fantastic as the disaffected and disheartened mother Mme. Doinel. Similarly, the father M. Doinel is wonderfully portrayed by the amiable and stern Albert Remy. Lastly, the horrifyingly cruel and abysmally serious teacher is excellently executed by Guy Decombie.\n\nLastly, Jean Constantin's score to The 400 Blows is unforgettable. The classical and French  jazz influence is palpable. The sweet melodies start to feel sadder and more depressing as they repeat. The music really makes the finale on the beach all the more hopeless and poignant. I love The 400 Blows' score.\n\nOverall, Truffaut directed a dramatic masterpiece as his directorial debut film. The 400 Blows will stay with me long after I have seen it. I cannot stop thinking about it.",

            "content": "Please, allow me to describe this movie with two overused idioms without blaming me that I use clich\u00e9s; The 400 Blows is a movie that avoids mawkish melodrama, and has a story that is often imitated, but never duplicated. Because, honestly, I haven't seen any movie in my life that deserves these two phrases more than Les Quarte Centre Coups!\n\nIn his directorial debut, Truffaut gave us a very sympathetic, and beautifully heart-wrenching story of a troubled young boy that you can easily tell that it came out of the legendary filmmaker's heart. I don't say that because this movie is, quite literally, the director's autobiographical story, but because it's impossible to relate to a protagonist such as Antoine Doinel so much like this unless his story is told by someone who really put his heart into this masterwork.\n\nWe see Antoine as a class clown and troublemaker student, then we see him as a thief. He is also a liar, and above all that, his character is very stoic. So it's very clear that this character doesn't ask for sympathy, neither the movie, in its first act, wants us to empathize with and feel for Antoine.\n\nNevertheless, and as I mentioned above, The 400 Blows is, in fact, a very touching and heartbreaking movie, but how it can be so with such a hateful protagonist. Simply, because Truffaut wittily builds sympathy in the audience by displaying both his misdeeds and the reasons he commits them that are also more than enough to justify them. But both the free technique Truffaut used to unfold the movie's plot, and the freewheeling use of the wide-screen frame also added up to the experience, and made the movie exceptionally engaging and relatable.\n\nJean-Pierre L\u00e9aud would go on to a major career in films, but in this movie he gave a truly outstanding performance that I think is one of the best child performances I've seen ever! As the bad qualities of Antoine are displayed on screen, it was necessary that the actor who plays this character would be very talented so he can prove that Antoine is actually a poor down-on-his luck kid, and it's his uncaring parents are those who are responsible for making what Antoine is. And L\u00e9aud's expressive and honest facial expressions, and genuine and authentic acting were perfectly adequate to convey all that.\n\nHowever, Francois Truffaut did tend to our feelings a little bit at the end of the second act by using a sensitive score and showing some emotional moments that added an extra layer to Antoine's character, which is his sensitivity. But he didn't do that until he really became totally sympathized with Antoine due to the misfortunes he suffered from. That said, I think that could have happened more gradually.\n\nI found the second act a bit hollow, and I think it would have been more captivating if it was richer. But, this very act really grew on me after the movie's final act. I don't want to delve deeper, but there are some similar heart-wrenching moments the two final acts share that became more stronger and meaningful at the third act. In fact, they turned out to be quite disturbing and overwhelming, and made me say; this is how to cause a catharsis in the audience!\n\nThe real major unforgivable issue I have with this movie is how Antoine's mother's feelings for him changed a great deal halfway through the movie. I understand what Truffaut wanted to do with the story, and why he shifted her character like this, but that didn't work for me at all. I think this shift made Gilberte an extremely problematic character instead of serving the plot. Also, I think by doing so, Truffaut had wasted a great chance to make this character more compelling, and therefore, made the plot more complex, considering the vital role Antoine's mom play in his character arc.\n\nThat being said, these flaws can't take away the greatness from this bona fide classic that you can tell it has inspired many filmmakers today. It's also one of, if not the best movie that explored the troubled adolescence. And it, unquestionably, marks one of the most impressive directorial debuts in cinema history!\n\n(8/10)",

This makes the movie difficult to watch because we have to see him continue to face one punishment after the next, instead of just talking about and dealing with his problems. I\u2019m not sure how much of this movie reflects a cultural difference, but I was surprised how the characters handled some of the behavior of these children. And the way that the parents react to their son disappearing was strange. The story goes in circles a bit until it finally reaches the point of an unforgiveable crime, and then they have to take extreme measures to deal with that. I feel like I should have been more emotionally engaged, but the entire movie was not clicking for me. My favorite character was actually the father played by Albert R\u00e9my, because he was more light-hearted and fun. Good child actors are often hard to find, so it was impressive that they cast a number of decent kids for this movie. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud was not the greatest, but at least you could sense where he was emotionally from one scene to the next. I think The 400 Blows does a good job of telling its story, but it wasn\u2019t a story that I connected with on a personal level, so for me the movie was only OK.",

Throughout the film, I just wanted for the boy to succeed. Every time he had something great happen to him, something bad would follow suit. It is a film that is much truer to life in that it isn't happy go lucky throughout as so many films are. Written by Francois Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, I felt that the script overall was superb. I appreciated the many dynamic contrasts employed in the script with the extreme ups and downs that Antoine experiences, such as having a great night out at the cinema with his family one night and getting into trouble with his parents and school the next day. Directed by Francois Truffaut, I enjoyed that he used shots that took more time. Nowadays, we are so used to quick cuts and scenes that are big and fast, where Truffaut favors long and slow. Edited by Marie-Josephe Yoyotte, I enjoyed the end sequence of Antoine running to the water. I appreciated that the editor stayed on the shots long enough to where we aren't quite sure where Antoine is going or what he's doing. It added a bigger punch to the very final sequence of the film. Henri Decae was the cinematographer of the film and I felt that he did a superb job. I always feel that it's difficult to tell the quality of lighting in a film when the film is in black and white, however, I felt that Decae brought a softness to the film that differed from films of that period of time. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it!",

The film examines the misunderstood Doinel's family life and mischief, and it quickly becomes a blunt, nostalgia-free exploration of adolescence. A key film of the French New Wave movement, The 400 Blows focuses entirely on Doinel - the performance of the young actor playing Doinel carries the film. Doinel's life is a rollercoaster, as is the audience's viewing experience. The film's laugh out loud moments are swiftly followed by tragic reality. Within Doinel's story is an honest examination of Parisian society in the 50s. The film explores the various forms neglect can take particularly powerfully. At the film's end, audiences are brought back to reality with a bump as the impact of the injustice that Doinel experiences really hits. It's uncommonly absorbing.

Antoine Doinel is an example of a kid who, on the surface, has a stable home life - with a roof over his head, a decent school, and parents who look out for him, albeit with them sometimes taking turns as one or another is often out at night.   However, as the movie progresses, we get glimpses of just how difficult the young man's life is - his mother's infidelity, overheard arguments, and their careless comments.  The way Truffaut slowly reveals the details is masterful, which is all the more impressive given this was the director's first film.  \n\nDoinel is played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who at 15 was taken under the 27-year-old Truffaut's wing as a kindred spirit of sorts, and he turns in a remarkable performance - natural, honest, and highly realistic.  We see him acting out in school, cutting class, and getting into trouble.  Even when he does try to apply himself, reading Balzac, it ends wrong at home, with the candle he's lit in a small shrine of sorts starting a fire, and at school, where out of inspiration he paraphrases Balzac so closely that he gets an F for plagiarism.\n\nThere are many great shots, and the film is beautiful.   The street scenes in Paris.  A swirling centrifugal carnival ride.  The shot from atop a tall building, which follows a school teacher as he leads the kids down the street, only to have groups of two and three of them peeling off along the way to get into mischief.  Little children watching a puppet show, with rows and rows of faces reacting with such natural animation, and unmistakably telling us of their emotions.  The interview with the psychologist, shown from her perspective, as Doinel answers her questions about why he lies and steals in a straightforward manner.  That's a very powerful scene, and one that really ties it all together emotionally.  \n\nThis film will impact you.  Its ending leaves the young man's fate unresolved - just as in life.   He's at a crossroads of sorts.  He may get into further trouble and spiral, becoming a criminal, or he may be saved by a passion for something, as Truffaut himself was with cinema, or by his inner good nature.  We certainly hope for the latter, but can't help but worry.   Put up with by his stepfather but unloved, a nuisance to his mother and deep down unwanted, labeled a bad kid by his teachers and put into the system - these things go deep into his core.  In a non-cloying way, the film explains why some people turn out as they do, and makes us want to be more understanding and kind.",

            "content": "The title of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's debut drama film, The 400 Blows, was literally translated from the French idiom, \"Faire les quatre cents coups,\" which means \"to raise hell.\" That it did when, from 1959 to 1960, it won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, earned an Academy Award Nomination for Best Writing, totaled over 4 million admissions in France, left critics clamoring to have their words of praise heard over the rest, and induced thousands of parents of young adolescents to walk out of the theatre while shaking their heads and vowing to love their children more. \n\nThe hellfire spread by the cratering impact of The 400 Blows mirrors the tale (no, chronicle!) it tells. Presumably set in late 1950's Paris, The 400 Blows follows Antoine Doinel, a creative and tough twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy (played by the equally creative and tough Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud who skipped school and travelled miles to audition for the part) who struggles to conform to the demands of his cold mother Gilberte (Claire Maurier), jocund but pathetic father Julien (Albert R\u00e9my), sourpuss school teacher (Guy Decomble), and every other authority figure he encounters. In mere weeks, he lies, steals, runs away (and even alludes to seeking the company of prostitutes before the film's events), all in an attempt to satiate his physical wants and emotional needs, leaving hellfire in his wake.\n\nBut why? To reach freedom, of course. But as he desperately swipes morsels of freedom time and time again, and (most dramatically) when he finally escapes from bars and stumbles onto the seabed he has dreamed about, when the camera freezes and inspects his face like a detective on a crusted blood stain, Antoine is confused, perhaps a tinge disappointed. He has his freedom, but still not his happiness. Who is to blame? His family, his friends? Society? Himself? Or just terrible luck? If Truffaut were here today, he might drily respond with a smirk on his face, \"All and none of the above,\" because he does not care to explicate how Antoine would escape his unhappiness. This film is a statement about the inevitable desire to escape and seek freedom, but not the inevitability of happiness to follow. Yes, it is about escaping sadness and finding freedom from a dull life, but not about escaping to happiness or finding the freedom to be happy. \n\nThese ideas were clearly relevant to post-World War II France, who had won her freedom but still lacked vitality, excitement, bright and shining energy. Seen in this light, it is no wonder why The 400 Blows \"raised hell.\" \n\nTruffaut channels this sentiment into the lifelessness of Gilberte, who has a home, son, career, and yet still shirks her motherly duties to seek freedom with a secret lover. Truffaut also channels this feeling of empty freedom into Gilberte's foil and husband, Julien, who, too, has a home, son, career, and yet still shirks his fatherly duties to seek freedom with his cars.\n\nThis sense of constraint tinged by morose sadness seeps into every cinematic tendon, ligament, and bone bracing this film. Firstly, the sets underlie this tone throughout: Antoine and his parents are stifled in their almost-hilariously-miniature apartment; too many mischievous children are shunted into the classroom of a restrictive teacher; Antoine finds himself being moved from a cramped jail cell to an even smaller, child-sized jail cell. Even when Antoine finally finds himself at sea in the open air, the camera quickly closes in on his face and excludes the space, much like his dry disappointment closes in on his spirit. \n\nJust as sculptors chisel blank faces of rock to reveal looks of lust or jubilance or perhaps even sly inquisitiveness, the camera, too, masterfully extrudes the raw emotions and ideas about escape and happiness from seemingly bare and sloppily-designed sets. Scenes are often unfocused, the camera bounces and jolts or pans across the screen, and sometimes we follow a single shot for minutes at a time. Why? From the unfocused scenes, Truffaut seems to be quipping, \"This shot, like Antoine's and his mother's and his father's and everyone else's life, is imperfect,\" and as audience members, we have no choice but to accept it. From the bouncing and jolting and rapid panning, we feel (or perhaps, want to feel) hope that things are picking up for Antoine, but just as suddenly as the rocky filming starts, it ends, and so, too, do our hopes of Antoine uncovering the freedom to be happy. From drawn out and aesthetically unpleasing scenes, like the unforgettable tracking shot of Antoine escaping from his prison or the point-of-view shot of Antoine fidgeting to fight the centrifugal force of the round up amusement park ride, we are reminded that escape is rarely the result of a single, well-executed attempt, but a long and arduous process that, just as often as not, ends in no escape at all. \n\nPerhaps what lends to The 400 Blows's thematic development even more than the sets and deliberate camerawork is the genius soundtrack. In the opening credits, as we tour the outskirts of the Eiffel Tower, just close enough to see this lasting mark of artistic expression but not enough to touch it, we hear a bouncy, jazzy score rife with the xylophone, piano, flute, and violin. Soon, however, the melody become more somber, instruments drop out, and we are eventually left with the lone plucking of the violin, the only instrument to have pushed through to the end of the score. Even the violin finally eventually slows, fades and dies out. This line is remarkably foreboding of the rest of the film: Like the violin, Antoine tries to establish his own place beyond the one hastily allotted him by his parents and other authority figures, but ultimately fails and fades. The lone plucking recurs whenever Antoine is alone, when he is arrested, wandering alone at night, and finally, when he reaches the sea, only to realize that despite the freedom, he is still alone.\n\nNow, over sixty years after its release, is The 400 Blows still relevant? If Truffaut had waited until now to debut his first feature-length film, would it still \"raise hell\"? Would it win the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, earn an Academy Award Nomination for Best Writing, total over 5 million admissions in just France (adjusted for population growth), leave critics clamoring to have their words of praise heard over the rest, and induce thousands of parents of young adolescents to walk out of the theatre while shaking their heads and vowing to love their children more? I believe the answer is, \"Yes. Absolutely, yes.\" We have our freedom, our technological escapes from the cruel crusts of life, but does that mean we have our happiness? More than ever, I think that answer is, \"No. Absolutely, no.\"\n\nOver sixty years after its release, The 400 Blows still raises hell. Truffaut seems to be saying, Seek freedom, and you shall learn more than you expected to find, but feel less than you had hoped in your stomach, veins, and mind. These ideas-conveyed by the sets, camerawork, music, characters, and plot-make this cinematic masterpiece more relevant today than ever before.",

All i got from this movie is that kid was raised in a chaotic household moving around a lot and with little to no supervision that led him to act out constantly until he gets sent to a reform school. Some parts of this I could relate to because I grew up in chaotic household and also acted out a lot but little does that make a movie.

            "content": "'The 400 Blows', Truffaut's debut feature film, marks the beginning of his screen persona, Antoine Doinel; it's one of the most noted films of the French New Wave, and one of the most intriguing stories on adolescence. The most brilliant aspect of it is that it doesn't have a particular agenda, and just lets us witness everything going on in the life of a misunderstood teenager as it is. It's the thoughts and acts most teenagers go through, maybe in different ways. I think, most people would relate to Antoine at some level or the other.\n\nIt's the story of a misunderstood child who faces trouble both at school and home, and tries to escape both these places. He senses neglect at home, and and his taste and talent being ignored or (misunderstood) by the teachers doesn't help either. Lack of affection is the main cause for most mischief and rebellion at that age.\n\nThe background score is mesmerizing, and it really sets the tone of the movie from the beginning credits scene showing us entrancing visuals of Paris - beautiful, innocent, yet rough like the main protagonist. The wide-angle camera is used quite effectively (it's 1959).\n\nThe acting is terrific. It's said that Truffaut auditioned hundreds of teenagers before finalizing on Jean-Pierre Leaud, with whom (he said) he found many similarities of family neglect, talent, mischief and rebellion. Jean-Pierre is incredibly talented and charms us with his acting; the shades of innocence, fear, rebellion and curiosity are portrayed quite adeptly by him. His monologues with the counselor are quite captivating. He goes on to play Antoine Doinel in four other Truffaut movies.\n\nMost memorable scenes from the movie include: The 'Wheel Of Death' scene, which is actually the first scene in the movie that completely fascinates and thrills you. The single shot of the kids on a morning jog with their PE teacher, where they bunk the class by slowly detaching themselves from the main group; it's incredibly amusing. Antoine's sessions with the counselor. And of course, the beautifully-shot open-ended climax scene.\n\n(Note: The film's French title comes from a French idiom \"faire les quatre cents coups\" which means \"to raise hell\", but I can't figure out why they went for the literal translation for the English Title; it doesn't make any sense at all. In short, it's a terrible and misleading English title, and has got nothing to do with the film.)",

The first I have seen was Jules and Jim, which I felt was a bit of a disappointment due to its lack of empathetic characters and lack of drama. The second would be The 400 Blows. I came into this film not knowing how I would feel as my feelings towards the director's works have been like a see-saw, and the hype for this was large but I tried my best not to let that affect my viewing of the film, and wanted to take the film as it is.\n\nThe core element that made this film stand out is its protagonist, Antoine Doinel, as unlike Truffaut's other films, we are given a character that is universally empathetic. The boy goes through problems that are both genuine to reality and also entertainingly dramatic. One can simply look at this as a portrait or representation of children who grew up in a life of crime and rebellion, exploring the emotional and psychological factors that led to it, but the film could also be seen as a time capsule of our own memories and feelings during our youth. Even if our experiences aren't superficially similar to Antoine's, in its core it is the same; who hasn't had any trouble in their school or home life, and who hasn't stolen anything from anybody before? The only thing that is different is how we deal with it, and Antoine's coping is what makes him a unique individual.\n\nTruffaut keeps the film's perspective the eyes of a child, every problem and personality that surrounds the protagonist are seen and felt exactly the same way that our protagonist sees/feels it. Antoine is trapped by the crushing power of the adult figures in his life, even when the intentions from these figures are for his benefit; the audience is still able to relate to our protagonist's feelings. Truffaut isn't encouraging younger people to become more rebellious and go against the strict rules and values of society, he is trying to speak to the already mature adults to let the young people speak about their emotions and problems, instead of always speaking for them, as this sort of attitude is the core reason for their physical and emotional distance. \n\nAntoine Doinel was played by the adorable and charming Jean-Pierre Leaud. Truffaut made a smart choice of having him play the role as he demonstrated that sense of genuineness that a professional actor just couldn't produce. Leaud's performance was all the more convincing due to the fact that I have seen his performances in the films that succeeded this film, \"Antoine and Colette\" and \"Stolen Kisses\". The actor's best scene in the film is clearly the end of the film, accompanied with a wonderful tracking shot, as it felt so authentic to the character's feelings.\n\nThe 400 Blows is a powerful character study, delivering a character and a story that everyone can connect with. There is no doubt that during my next viewing, I would love this more and add it to my list of Great Movies",

A seminal French New Wave film that offers an honest, sympathetic, and wholly heartbreaking observation of adolescence without trite nostalgia. Henri Decae's black and white photography helped Truffaut enormously but what the director himself provides is a sense that though there is no easy answer to the problems of growing up, there is a hope that will never be wholly denied. Truffaut's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction. It flows nicely at its own pace, never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere. It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave, and one of the greatest movies about childhood, from anywhere, ever. An enduring masterpiece...Truffaut's autobiographical fiction shows an admirable equanimity by depicting the highs and lows of boyhood. A movingly sympathetic and perceptive portrayal about an unwanted rebellious adolescent.\n\nVERDICT: \"Instant Classic\" - [Positively Acclaimed Reaction] Usually I give this rating to a movie that I believe is absolutely outstanding and has little to no flaws in it.

Antoine Doinel is a kid who ends up doing some bad things, minor but still bad enough to land him in hot water with every authoritative figure in his life, including the police. His mom sees him as little more than a burden and is only nice to him when he finds out her secret. His stepfather is a good man, but he doesn't know what to do with Antoine, no one does, little of all Antoine himself. He longs to join the Navy to escape his loveless life, a life in which his room is a bed in the corner of a kitchen that has a bath tub and just happens to also be where the front door is. Harry Potter's room under the stairs is the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf compared to Antoine's situation. Jean-Pierre Leaud gives perhaps the greatest performance by a child actor ever. His expressive face tells you more than his words ever could. With Truffaut's penchant for long takes and natural sound, it's hard not to get sucked into Antoine's world. Once Antoine finally sees what his heart has desired, it is at once beautiful yet terrifying, mysterious and exciting. Unknown. Is that what becoming a teenager is all about?

Another much-appreciated long shot is about a gym teacher leading a group of schoolboys jogging on the streets, the sky-roving camera meticulously and jovially captures the process of boys sneaking away from the procession by turns, such a benevolent and ingenious skit, the same can be referred to a little boy's ink-smearing writing scenes, the close-up records the entire happening resolutely, these paragraphs augment a touch of enlightenment and virtue of innocence which resides inside every kid's heart in spite of the story per se is a tale of woe. Antoine's familial life suffices all the negligence and misery that will impair any unsullied soul, it is a tragedy has omnipotent repercussions on everyone, Truffaut and his co-screenwriter Marcel Moussy inject great dedication and patience into Antoine's character, it is for sure the most acute and iconic portrayal of a child ever on the silver screen!\n\nThe grainy texture and vintage monochrome of the film has an immanent allure to film buffs, apart from L\u00e9aud, Claire Maurier and Albert R\u00e9my as the mother and stepfather of Antoine, both resemble a kitchen-sink superficiality and lifelike casualness as the rest of the cast, L\u00e9aud's naturalistic responses towards fate's rough handling is a boon, it is explicitly emotive and the film has earned its prominence fair and square, a must-see should not be missed by aficionados.",

This was the first film from Francois Truffaut, and one of the earliest films of the French New Wave, the revolutionary mid-century movement in French film led by directors like Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Alain Resnais. This film is less boldly experimental than Resnais's work, and less coldly intellectual and theoretical than Godard's; it's actually a fairly warm and naturalistic film, and it has aged extremely well. \n\nThere's a story here, but not an easily summarized plot. It's a character study of a troubled fourteen-year-old boy named Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a nice kid who keeps running into trouble with his parents, teachers, and the police. It was apparently largely based on Truffaut's own youth. Despite the fact that he's almost constantly in trouble, Antoine is a decent kid; many of his problems are the results of misunderstandings. \n\nLeaud is entirely convincing as Antoine, perhaps partially because the character is not all that different than Leaud himself was. Unlike many child actors in older films, he never seems to be acting or putting on a show; there's a constant feeling of total realism to the character. The adults who surround him don't particularly care about him, not even his mother, but they're also not portrayed in an overly villainous way (as were, say, some of the adults in the recent Precious). No one in this movie is especially evil; they all just kind of keep screwing up.\n\nThe style of the film is more straightforward and less self-conscious than some of the later films of the New Wave would be. There are only a few noticeably elaborate shots, and they're well-integrated into the story of the film. I particularly liked the overhead shot of the PE class running around town and constantly losing kids. Truffaut here is never maudlin or sentimental, but he also avoids the coldness and disdain that, say, Godard might have brought to the material. Although the movie was released in 1959, it feels more contemporary than many films from only, say, 10 or 15 years ago. It's a great movie that doesn't feel like it needs to make a point of its own quality.",

It is about a boy named Antoine Doinel who lives with his careless mother and his clueless step-father. The opening scene is key to the film. A picture of a half naked woman is passed throughout the class. When it is handed to Antoine, he looks at it for too long and the teacher notices. We see that he is penalized for something that everyone did just due to luck. Welcome to the life of Antoine Doinel. He carries so much responsibility and pressure which ultimately leads to failing in school. He is a trouble-maker, but Truffaut brilliantly shows that anyone in his situation would be one. After he sees his mother cheating on his step-father, who he has lived with most of his life, he starts a downward spiral into crime. His parents do not really pay any attention to him even though he has a small friendship with his step-father. Although the film appears to be quite depressing, it is highlighted with moments of great comedy and happiness. Especially when Antoine and his friend skip class to go to a carnival. Truffaut always portrays school life with complete truth and realism. Our childhood memories start to come back to us. I really like how Truffaut shows that parents or guardians are extremely significant in a child's success. The actor who plays Antoine Doinel, Pierre Leaud, has got to be the best child actor in history. He does not overact his emotions, but he does make the role his own. I think his acting consists of 40% of the film's success. The screenplay is perfectly constructed. All of the scenes are very important and powerful. They all have an significant place in the film's chronology. The cinematography and editing play a big part in the film especially in the end scene where we see a freeze frame of Antoine smiling on a beach for the first time who has escaped from a detention center. \"The 400 Blows\" demands required viewing with its carefully constructed screenplay, excellent performance by Pierre Leaud, director Francois Truffaut's touching direction, and significant impact.",

The film depicts a boy, Antoine Dionel, who to us, seems like a normal fun loving kid who is actually a little more responsible than most kids, but to everyone around him he is a troublemaker, and headed for a life of crime. However, Antoine just wants to go live his own life and make his own living, he reads Monore de Balzac, he is much more mature than the average child his age. But he feels somewhat alienated, no one around him understands him, and he doesn't understand them, so he wants to be able to make his own decisions. It could be said that Antoine is one of the greatest existential characters in cinema's history. Besides the script though, Truffaut gives this film an artist's touch, crafting a film that has memorable scene after memorable scene, and keeping a close eye on his camera angle, lighting, and mood. Each frame has the exact setting, music, and lighting to evoke the atmosphere of the scene. With all this in mind, I would agree with any who said this is one of the greatest films ever made.",

Enveloped in supreme style and driven by a new found energy and freedom Les Quatre cents coups is quite simply a wonderful film. Truffaut takes us on a journey with Antoine Doinel, who fights in his own way for everything that the French identify with from their youngest days . Whether or not he achieves any of it is up for debate of course, but I marveled in his fervor from the very beginning of the film. The film gives us a look at youth and all its magic, but here it's also contrasted with adulthood and its hardships, which serves as a wonderful contrast. Rene and Antoine, when walking in the streets of Paris at times resembled tiny gangsters making their rounds, while never feeling overwhelmed by the sheer size of the city which is as much a character as them in the city. The black and white color palette gives the film a stylish look and the camera work, while not smooth by any stretch is more in line with the story and the emotion emitted in the film. Recommended for anyone that loves film.",

            "content": "This classic  French, new wave movie, directed by Francois Truffaut, is the best film I've watched in a long while.  Jean Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a troubled and misunderstood adolescent who has problems at school, lacks attention at home and gradually spirals into a life of petty crime.  \nI was confused by the title until I learned that it is a straight translation of the French but misses its meaning; the French title refers to the expression \"faire les quatre cents coups\", meaning \"to raise hell\".\nThe striking contrast between the (rare) happy times  Antoine experiences with his parents - (his happiness being almost painful to watch  in light of its rarity), and the ugly scenes where he is berated, neglected, or physically punished are crafted perfectly.  Although the central theme is rather grim, there are wonderful bursts of humour, innocence and adventure throughout The 400 Blows.  \nAntoine is clearly distanced from 'regular', happy children and nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where he and his best friend, Renee, played by Patrick Auffay, are planning  Antoine's 'running away from home' in a packed auditorium of children watching a Punch & Judy-like show.  As the camera pans around the small children's faces we can see how utterly absorbed they are by the show while Antoine and Renne stand apart from the crowd, only absorbed by the difficult tangle their lives have become.\n\nThe 400 Blows sometimes gives one the feeling that a mere string of unfortunate events are solely to blame for how Antoine's life turns out but his dysfunctional home, defiant nature, yearning for  independence and contempt for authority play a big role too.  This is a beautifully made, intelligent, absorbing movie and I cannot fault it one iota.",

            "content": "Antoine Doniel is a juvenile delinquent. He disrespects his teachers, lies even when the truth might suit him, deceives his parents, cuts class and is generally a trouble-maker. This is bad enough. What makes him a delinquent is the fact that he defaces school property, commits numerous acts of theft (and not just by sneaking money from his parents) and trespasses. He thumbs his nose at all authority.\n\nBecause Antoine is the hero of Francois Truffaut's semi-autobiographical first film THE 400 BLOWS, we are apparently supposed to forgive all that. After all, he's got the soul of an artist...he lights up when watching movies and perhaps has an insight into them beyond his years. His parents did not show him significant enough amounts of love. So it's okay that he can't follow the simplest rule, or even care to try. He does what feels good to him, regardless of who it inconveniences or hurts.\n\nOn its surface (and below much of the surface too), THE 400 BLOWS is a film with an utterly unlikable central character. I give the kid no credit for being a \"misunderstood artist.\" He's clearly excited by what he reads when he first encounters Balzac, but rather than taking inspiration from the word, he plagiarizes it for a homework assignment. Word for word. So for me, an appreciator of arts and artists...Antoine is a snot-nosed kid who needs a comeuppance.\n\nTHE 400 BLOWS is set in `50s France, and was on the leading edge of the French New Wave in film. I'll readily admit I know little about those films, and the more I read about the socialist ideology of many of its purveyors, the less I care to know. It is all filmed on location, with many fantastic shots of this marvelous city. Paris is as much a character as Antoine's mother or father. The gorgeous black and white exterior shots are a treat. The viewer really gets a sense of being immersed in a primarily lower middle class city. The film is very briskly paced, even as relatively little of real consequence happens. Although the film is primarily a slice-of-life drama, it is full of funny moments, characters and vignettes. I greatly appreciated its breezy tone and the naturalistic filming approach. While it's too self-consciously a movie to have a documentary feel to it...I did appreciate the clearly improvisational nature of many of the scenes.\n\nAnd, while I dislike the central character, I really liked the remarkable young actor Jean-Pierre Leaud who played him. He's got a soulful face, and filmed right on the edge of his teen years, he's got a cherubic affect to go along with his far more mature misbehaviors. I never rooted for the character, per se...but I couldn't help smiling at his many malfeasances, even as he exasperated me. He has an attractive mother who clearly isn't enamored of being a mom (and has a few more secrets I won't spoil), but for much of the film, I also appreciated that he had a gruff but remarkably patient and understanding father. The father clearly understood that Antoine was a source of irrational irritation on the part of his mother, and worked hard to shield the child, even when his own temper was tested. I found his character to be interestingly complex. And he too has some secrets. Other characters, such as the schoolteacher, teeter too close to caricature. Yes, he's an awful teacher. But given what teaching was like in those days, is he deserving of the utter derision Antoine pours on him?\n\nI know for some, THE 400 BLOWS is some sort of testament to either the miseries of being a misunderstood \"artist's soul.\" For others, it's a statement on how too little love can damage a kid. Or the harshness of society, etc. etc. I find any messages like that to be unconvincing and delivered with too heavy a hand. However, the fast pace, gorgeous cinematography, lovely locations, generally solid acting and generous doses of humor to make this a film worth recommending despite my hesitations.\n\nI viewed the Criterion Blu-ray, and must say that the bonus materials are particularly fun. There are numerous interviews over the years with Truffaut...who is a lively subject. And there are some great shots of young Leaud as he auditioned for his role, and during interviews while making the rounds at Cannes. He's an interesting person to learn about. The bonus essay was a bit skimpier than I'm used to with Criterion, but worthwhile nonetheless. Once again, Criterion has done an exceptional job. THE 400 BLOWS is an important movie in film history, and Criterion has given it an appropriate showcase.",

What other alternative can one have but to rebel? I think most people can identify with the story, either personally or through knowing someone else who has had similar problems. Truffaut's debut is empathetic and universal, and as I understand it, semi-autobiographical -- it just goes to show how personal experiences, when transferred to celluloid, can be the most impactful. So simple, yet profound. On the technical side of things, I loved the camerawork and the music; both were really beautiful. A great performance by Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine Doinel in the lead.

Shot in black and while with hand held cameras, it stands out from other films produced in studioes at the time. Some scenes are comical, other tragic. Truffaut paints a compelling picture of a youth trying to find his way in post-war Paris.\n\nLike the Shawshank Redemption, Les 400 coups turns the tables by making an outcast the hero and an authority figure the villain. Perhaps linking the two films is a bit of a non-sequitor; perhaps not. They share a first person perspective, some themes about adversity, keep the interest of the audience throughout and can be rented from Bay Street Video.",

The child protagonist is not necessarily moving toward a deeper understanding of life or preparing to become a fully-functional member of society.  He is a largely static character to whom events happen, and the movie follows his attempts to navigate and perhaps exert a limited sort of control over his less-than-ideal circumstances.  He lacks any particularly precocious qualities or quirks, so his behavior and manner of expression are not that of some child prodigy.  He behaves for the most part as a normal child his age would in similarly-challenging situations, and that makes him more relateable than many adolescent figures in film.  I'm not sure I've ever seen better acting from a 14 year old, and the DVD version contains an interesting interview with the actor recorded a year or so after the film wrapped.",

This film has affected me no other film will ever be able to achieve. You know that Antoine is a good hearted child, but he just wants to be free and enjoy the world. His parents and school continue to get in the way of him trying to be free, and they continue to win until near the end of the film. That is when Truffaut takes over with his obvious cineaste to make my personal favorite ending ever. Not to mention the hands down greatest performance from a child. He certainly has an intriguing attitude and look to him. He was irreplaceable for the role in this film. Though the things that Antoine and Rene do are quite bleak occasionally, the way Truffaut presents the world to us, in such a life affirming way, is absolutely stunning. This is a film that should affect everyone in a personal way, whether you love cinema or not, this is made to reach deep down into the core of us.",

He sees them as rank hypocrites. He has no role models to follow. His teachers are crass and demeaning to their students.
