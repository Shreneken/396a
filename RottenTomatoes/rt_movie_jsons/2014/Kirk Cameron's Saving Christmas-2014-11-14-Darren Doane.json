            "content": "Cameron's Christmas Revisionism -- This movie should have been shown only television and only on a religious network. But even then, the ratings would have been terrible. Only the most die-hard fundamentalist trying to squeeze a Christian meaning out of every Christmas symbol would have liked this movie. The only Christmas show I've seen that's worse than this is the Star Wars Holiday Special (on YouTube), which has never been re-broadcast since 1978 or released on home video.\n\nChristian, Kirk's brother-in-law, is complaining about how so many of the symbols of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Kirk, in his revisionism, goes way out on a limb to deny the pagan origins of the symbols and traditions of Christmas. He tells Christian that Christmas trees were God's idea, since he made the trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross. Christian then starts complaining about Santa Claus. He sees Santa as replacing Jesus, and notices that \"Santa\" and \"Satan\" have the same letters -- what a stretch. But Kirk tells him that the original Santa Claus was actually Saint Nicholas -- who in actuality was one of several sources for the character. Kirk ends his lecture be saying that the presents under the tree represent the buildings of New Jerusalem. The last 15-20 minutes are partying, eating, and bloopers.\n\nA conspiracy theorist as the party, meanwhile, is complaining about the removal of public manger scenes, and says they're be removed to Area 52, which he says is similar to Area 51.\n\nKirk's brother-in-law's real name, by the way, is John Ridenour. His name Christian in the movie is probably meant to represent Christians disappointed about the non-religious symbols of Christmas. Christian at one point says, \"It's like a car-jacking of our religion!\" This is probably a hint that Kirk, along with some Christians (but not all), doesn't like the loss of Christian dominance over the holiday season.\n\nThe truth, Kirk and Christian, is that late December was a time of celebration long before the rise of Christianity, with the focus being on the Winter Solstice. Since the early Christian leaders knew they couldn't suppress the celebrations, they adopted them as their own. The rebirth of the Sun during the Solstice became the birth of the Son. So, it was actually the early Christians who \"car-jacked\" the ancient pagan symbols of the Winter Solstice and turned them into celebrations about their mythical savior.\n\nThe bible actually provides no information on time of the year Jesus was born. However, if \"shepherds were in the field keeping watch over their flocks by night\", it probably wasn't in the dead of winter. Thus, the celebration of Christmas itself in December, like the non-religious Christmas symbols Christian is complaining about, is not biblical in origin.\n\nUntil a few centuries ago, Christmas seemed more like Mardi Gras rather than a quiet time to be with family and friends. The 17th century Puritans, who didn't like the rowdiness, banned Christmas (party poopers) in England under Cromwell and in New England.\n\nKirk's response to the failure of his movie was to blame it on a massive atheist conspiracy. Some people just don't like criticism. When they can't debate their opponents, they demonize them.\n\nIf you want a good show about Christmas, I highly recommend History Channel's \"Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas\" (1997). It provides an excellent history of the symbols and traditions of the holiday, and shows the different views of it. \"Saving Christmas\" is intellectually insulting.",

Saving Christmas had a horrendous story that would probably be more efficient as a 5 minute YouTube video instead of being a 79 minute film. The writing was horribly filled with Biblical inaccuracies especially in regards to St. Nicholas. Also, it was highly unnecessary for a family friendly Christmas film to have a scene where two characters talk about conspiracy theories. This attempt at being a humorous failed miserably. The acting was awful as well. David Shannon was overacting and Darren Doane was underacting. Now for music, Christmas music is supposed to be lovely and beautiful. But for the music used in Saving Christmas, it was so bad, I think it gave me tinnitus. Did Kirk Cameron save Christmas? The answer is no.",

I pray this film gives everyone who watches eyes to see and ears to hear and softens hearts to understand the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ our savior.

            "content": "If you looked at the poster of Saving Christmas and expected a fun family action comedy featuring the actor from \"Growing Pains,\" get ready to be disappointed. Kirk Cameron, the formerly popular teen actor turned born-again Christian, is off to save Christmas and what does he do? He stalls inside a car with his brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane) and lectures to him and the audience about the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of Jesus. Saving Christmas is more about inflating Cameron's ego than spreading the holiday cheer to all your friends. Despite being a Christian, Cameron contradicts his own religious philosophy of love and forgiveness and suggests that Saint Nicholas, the originator of Santa Claus, murdered heretics when not giving presents. I guess Cameron was trying to be ironic with his \"Lord of the Ringsy\" take on the figure, but instead it comes off as mean-spirited, especially in a Christmas movie. To be fair, the joke might have worked in a tongue-and-cheek sense, if the other characters weren't so poorly-written. Christian is a one-dimensional Scrooge in the mud, the atheist conspirators contribute nothing and neither do any of the party-goers, including Kirk's sister Bridgette, except a dance number. Seeing the characters' lack of onscreen presence only adds to Kirk Cameron's overlong sanctimonious preachiness; that's me a film lover in general. If Kirk Cameron is reading this post (I seriously doubt that he is), I apologize for being a \"hater and atheist,\" but Saving Christmas wasn't very good.

They live in the biggest houses, driving the most expensive cars, married to the hottest, most submissive trophy wives (procured through the best cosmetic surgery money can buy), and able to furnish their vapid, empty, soulless children with the most resplendent Christmas imaginable (all of this, even in the faces of families who cannot afford the most basic food or shelter). 'Prosperity Gospel' promulgates the message that, rather than feel bad about poor little Johnny whose parents can't even buy him breakfast from McDonalds because there isn't enough change to be found under the seats of the car they've been living in for 4 months, those who can afford to flaunt their wealth in the faces of poor Johnny and his desperate parents should do so shamelessly, because that's how true Christians show their gratitude to a 'God' who has singled them out for prosperity and good fortune. In the Gospel according to Kirk, it is the duty of every prosperous Christian to display their obscene and likely ill-gotten wealth, in order to throw into starker relief the disparity between rich and poor, and thereby draw a clear distinction between 'Good' and 'Bad'. In the Gospel according to Kirk, 'God' rewards 'The Faithful' with prosperity, and any attempt to redress that imbalance through charity is an act that contravenes the dictates of 'God', by 'artificially' elevating those who do not enjoy 'God's' favor to the level of those who do. It is also the duty of every 'God'-fearing Christian to worship their benefactor with displays of conspicuous wealth, especially at Christmas. \n\nKirk Cameron's 'God' is the god of heartless consumerism justified through predetermination millennialism, a philosophy which states that, from the moment of birth, one's path through life is pre-ordained by 'God', and therefore any attempt to change that path through human agency is not only pointless, but is in fact sinful, as charity toward the impoverished and deprived both denies 'God's' ultimate design for each and every human being, and blurs the lines of distinction between those who enjoy 'God's' favor and those who suffer 'His' displeasure.       \n\nKC's 'Screw-You-Jack-I-Got-Mine' brand of Christianity is emblematic of American consumerist exceptionalism which has its roots in European and Early American 18th-century so-called 'humanist enlightenment' philosophy and political thinking. Adherents of which who, while simultaneously pushing back against aristocratic 'Divine Right' were, themselves, wealthy land-and-slave-owning businessmen who saw their own prosperity as an act of 'divine providence', and therefore to be enjoyed and reveled in without thought to others. The Founding Fathers were shamelessly hypocritical in that way, so I suppose KC can wrap himself in the flag and say he's just following their example with this big, steaming turd of a movie.",

There will always be those that are willing to put their faith in unbelief, and therefore will hate the strong position Christianity takes. I love the messages in the film.  Are they based around the corniness of bits and pieces of the film... sure...but so what.  It is a fun and harmless (inexpensive) Christmas movie.  I give a lot of credit to Kirk Cameron for the stance he has taken based on faith.  It is not an easy path.  This film is a characture of the different anxieties around Christmas.  Have we lost the true meaning?  Has money exclipsed what we should truly be focusing on.  Is it all wrong and the meanings behind the whole celebration all wrong?  Rest at ease... this is the first movie I\u00e2(TM)ve see like this that\u00e2(TM)s real premise is to speak to those who don\u00e2(TM)t just celebrate Christmas... but believe in its true meaning.

The film itself is horrible, preachy and  stuffed like a Christmas turkey full of self righteous non-sense, pious platitudes, as one and all are castigated for not celebrating the holidays the way Cameron thinks we should.  The film in essence accuses Christians of being ignorant for not knowing their own traditions, and then of incredible gullibility for accepting Cameron's kooky made up answers so quickly.  Don't waste your time on this movie, there is nothing of value in it, (unless you want to see how not to make a movie) we are left with the mind boggling message of embracing the excess, materialism and gluttony of the holidays.  Thank you Kirk, exactly what our self centered, capitalistic society needs today (oh...but don't go over your credit card limit!).  Charles Dickens understood the message of Christmas with only the slightest of religious intonations, Cameron gushes about Jesus and succeeds only in completely gutting Christmas of any real meaning, spiritual or material.  Kirk leaves us empty hearted but with a few new religious icons: hams, butter, snow globes, hot cocoa...can we find a way to work in egg nog and Frosty the Snowman?

Kirk Cameron is trying so hard to connect Christmas symbols to the Bible when he could have just told the story of the historical Saint Nicholas.

            "content": "Of course. I just had to get my hands on a copy of Saving Christmas. Even though I have a backlog of well over 90 other films that I have seen this year that I haven't reviewed, this was one of the films that I have been dying to see and review. Not because I thought it would be a good film, but because it was both a film made by smug bastard extraordinaire, Kirk Cameron, and also because it has gone down in cinematic history as being one of the worst films ever made - and rightfully so.\n\nNot only that, but I was absolutely fascinated by how Kirk Cameron decided through his titanic ego to make the blundering error of asking his fans to inflate the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes in protest of the scathing negative reviews by the critics. For a brief period, he and his fans succeeded, pumping the audience score all the way up to a 94% approval, much to his delight, despite the fact that this is, you know, LYING. Which is frowned upon, including in the Bible. Plus, it's frowned upon regardless of beliefs. Then again, Kirk Cameron is a complete fucking idiot, so of course, this logic would be lost on him.\n\nNaturally, this plan completely backfired in his face, with far more people storming Rotten Tomatoes to swiftly curb-stomp the rating, which, as you can see, has plummeted all the way down to an utterly dismal 31% approval at the time of this review (Though it has a far better rating here than on IMDB, where the rating is currently 1.6 out of 10).\n\nBecause of his shady antics and glorious stupidity that are far funnier than any comedic elements of his films, his horrible film and antics gained quite a bit of media attention and widespread scorn. Not only that, but thanks to his film gaining attention, it earned many dishonorable awards from the Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Combo (Cameron and his ego). I think it should have won all of the awards, especially Worst Director (Come on, Razzies. You know Darren Doane is FAR WORSE than Michael Bay). If he hadn't been a complete ass, it would have been like all other shitty religious films and just disappeared into obscurity.\n\nAs you can tell, I really, really hate Kirk Cameron. Not because of his politics. Not because he is a Christian. I hate him as an actor and I hate him as a person. This is the 6th film of his that I've watched, and like this one, I have panned every one of his films I've seen (Left Behind 1-3, Mercy Rule, Fireproof). So, you're probably wondering why I keep bothering to watch his films, aren't you?\n\nWell, I am a seeker of garbage. As much as I enjoy films (In fact, I'm positive towards a film at least 90% of the time, with an average rating of 4 stars given out), for whatever reason, I feel compelled to seek out terrible films. I'm not talking so-bad-they're-good kind of terrible (Though I am quite fond of B-movie classics like Showgirls. I certainly enjoy the FUN kind of bad film as I gave Showgirls 4.5 stars), I mean, TERRIBLE FUCKING FILMS. Ones that I hate. Ones that I will complain about and avidly discuss with people who will listen - sometimes even forcing them to endure these awful films with me. And Kirk Cameron has certainly been a reliable source for absolute garbage, complete with incessant, poorly-written, droning sermonizing applied to the script like water from a pressurized hose. I have a lot more to say about a film that I hate, than one that I enjoy for some reason.\n\nBut Saving Christmas is a whole new level of shit, even for an untalented bastard like Kirk Cameron. This film, somehow, some way, manages to be even WORSE than Left Behind I & II, which I awarded a grand total of 0.5 stars to (Though I have no choice but to give this film the same rating, as I am not allowed to provide the far more appropriate zero rating this film deserves) and consider them both to be among the 50 worst films I have ever seen. Hell, this film is worse than garbage like C Me Dance or the 2007 straight-to-DVD abomination, The Apocalypse. In comparison to all these other bad films, Saving Christmas makes them all look like masterpieces. I'm dead serious. It's really that fucking bad. Not since the likes of Gigli, Happy Feet, and Sex And The City 2 have I seen a comedy so heinously awful, so horribly and completely unfunny, so soul-crushing, and with such genocidal levels of brain cell killing, in quite some time.\n\nAfter its brief stint in theaters, the film dropped off the map for awhile, and its release date was kept quiet for a long time up until maybe a month before its release on DVD. And, much like Mercy Rule, the DVD cover is a sight to behold. And also like Mercy Rule, there's a discussion booklet! Lucky us.\n\nThere's a glowing endorsement from Republican presidential candidate, Ben Carson, in which he says, \"A wonderful defense of Christmas traditions.\" Looks like I'm voting for Deez Nuts or Satan Lord of the Underworld for president. With nutbag Republicans and a shady Democratic candidate who reminds me of a villain from films, is it a wonder why modern Americans are so disillusioned with politics? Plus, with one of them endorsing something like Saving Christmas, I now feel even more confident in my decision to just give both sides the finger in 2016.\n\nNext up - and this is a warning sign for any film - a glowing endorsement from the Dove Foundation, earning a perfect 5 out of 5 rating. Unless you are a fundie nutjob who eats up Christian films just because they claim to have Christian messages, DO NOT trust an endorsement by the Dove Foundation. It is a clear warning sign that if you dare watch the film they are endorsing, you are in for a total crapfest. In it, they say, \"Saving Christmas is the perfect movie for the Christmas season!\" Yeah, if you hate Christmas and your family and friends. Who needs It's A Wonderful Life or A Christmas Story when you can just torture your loved ones this Christmas instead!\n \nOn the back of cover, it comes with a glowing endorsement from Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson. You know, the guy who got in trouble for his comments about gay people and black people? That story was fucking hilarious, especially his comments. Despite his undeniable bigoted comments, I actually didn't agree with his suspension because I do believe in free speech and I don't like political-correctness (This coming from a gay guy whose politics lean more to the right than to the left). Though Duck Dynasty is a fairly innocuous and for the most part, pleasant, show, I will never trust a film endorsement by members of the Duck Dynasty family. In his comment, Phil says, \"It will change the way you think.\" Oh, it certainly has, Phil, but not for the reasons it intended. Saving Christmas is one of those rare bad films that truly redefines what it means to be a bad film.\n\nAnd dammit, this is third terrible religious film this family has either been involved in or endorsed that I've seen. First, it was a cameo in the terrible, and at times, unintentionally funny God's Not Dead, then it was as producer/endorser of the hideous 2014 Left Behind reboot, and now this. NO! NO! Bad Robertson family! BAD! No more, dammit! NO MORE!\n\nStrangely, though, I must mention, Kirk Cameron doesn't appear on the front cover (Though his name is in large print), and is instead relegated to the back cover, still sporting that smug, smiling, \"I'm Kirk Cameron! Look at how awesome I am!\" look on his face. There's also a picture of the director on the back (Who is also one of the leads in the film) smiling and giving a thumbs up. Great, we have both faces to remind us of the assholes who brought us this cinematic abortion. Fucking assholes.\n\nAnd then, there's the discussion booklet, which is meant for families and church groups. I will admit, this discussion booklet will be helpful in my review, as it reminds me of what Kirk Cameron preaches in this film, nearly word-for-word. However, I don't anticipate that many families or church groups will ever use this booklet because of what steaming pile of shit this film is, combined with its mind-blowing levels of idiocy that it spouts.\n\nLet me put into a small perspective of how baffling this film is: I took 4 pages of handwritten notes while watching the film. I only took one page of notes for David Lynch's surreal, mind-bending psychological thriller, Mulholland Dr. that completely fucks with the viewer's mind and is open to all sorts of interpretations due to its extremely enigmatic and abstract tone. Yes, it required far more notes than a motherfucking David Lynch film (However, David Lynch films are actually enjoyable). Trust me, it's gonna take a rather long screed to dissect the madness and staggering idiocy of this film. When I have to start picking at the film just from the DVD cover, I know I'm in trouble.\n\nOnce again, much like with Mercy Rule, before we get to the actual film, Kirk Cameron feels the need to be the very first person onscreen, where he complains about people who want to ruin Christmas or how people say that Christmas was actually a pagan tradition that the Christians stole, while surrounded by decorations, a Christmas tree, a blazing fire in the fireplace, and drinking some hot chocolate.\n\nThen, the film opens strangely, with - guess who - Kirk Cameron narrating over a man dressed in ragged clothes wandering around in the snow, talking about how we as children love to hear the same stories over and over again, and then demanding new ones from our parents. Then when we grow up and have children of our own, we end up telling them the same stories our parents told us, only this time, we tone down the villains to make them less scary, like the wolf or whatever else, and in the process, tame the heroes.\n\nI think it's some sort of screed against political correctness. But then again, considering how horrible this storytelling is going to be, I can only guess because I don't think the writers had any idea what the fuck they were doing. Before we quite get to the main story, the main credits are shown with some animation and an abominable instrumental version of O Holy Night that sounds like it had an unholy lovechild with the America's Funniest Home Videos theme music.\n\nThen, we get to a Christmas party at his sister's house (The actress is also his real-life sister), and Kirk continues to narrate and talking about how he loves Christmas, while also awkwardly splicing in parts of his comments from the \"stories\" opening about how we can decide who we're going to be, like Scrooge or Tiny Tim (I don't fucking know. I'm not one of the brain-dead cretins who wrote this damn thing. I, too, struggled to make sense of all the stupid shit that occurred endlessly)\n\nDespite the merriment surrounding them, his brother-in-law, Christian (By golly, aren't we subtle!), is not enjoying the party, as he has become disillusioned with Christmas because of materialism, the decorations, the perversion of beliefs, Santa Claus, paganism, and some other shit. \n\nBut don't worry! Kirk is here to save the day and change Christian's thoughts about Christmas and explain these aspects of it that Christian seems to hate so much. So, when Christian goes to sit in his car and stew, Kirk follows him and sits in the car with him to preach to him and extol the wonders of Christmas.\n\nThe first topic is the nativity scene, which has been largely put off to the side in many households in favor of the more elaborate decorations. In particular, he makes arguments about the meanings of the swaddling cloth and the gifts brought by the wise men.\n\nAccording to the film, the swaddling cloth could not hold Jesus in birth or in death. I forget all of the meanings extolled by Kirk Cameron in regards to the swaddling cloth. All I know is, it's completely stupid in a way that just made my head hurt. Second, in this section (As there are other aspects of Christmas Kirk will educate us with), were the gifts by the wise men, frankincense and myrrh, which are apparently burial spices. This is a representation of how he was sent to die for our sins, and how his body would become the bread for the hungry and his blood was used to wash away our sins. Birth to death, remember what Jesus did for us whenever you look at the nativity scene, in short.\n\nUp next for Kirk Cameron's ham-fisted butchering of Christmas is the tree. When Christian complains about how trees were worshiped by Norwegian pagans or that it had to do with winter solstice, Kirk debunks it through a variety of bizarre explanations that I will do my best to explain because it is so batshit insane and mind-numbingly convoluted.\n\nPart of it has to do with how God was the one who created winter solstice, not the pagans, druids, or whatever the fuck else. When he created the universe and the planetary alignment, it was all part of the cycle for Earth. Darkness to light, death to life, winter transitioning into a new year - Rebirth, I guess you can say.\n\nGod also created trees, which he also had in his house (Complete with lights!) and put trees all over the Garden of Eden, like with the Tree of Life. When Adam ate from the Tree of Life, he and Eve were of course, kicked out of Eden. The only way Adam could redeem himself and the sins of mankind would be if he could put the forbidden fruit he ate back on the tree, which he couldn't. But, apparently, Jesus was the last Adam, and through his crucifixion on the cross, he helped to undo what Adam did, so that he could cleanse our sins. So, according to Kirk, whenever you  walk into a Christmas tree lot, \"...I want you to see hundreds of crosses that will never be used because of Jesus' finished work.\"\n\nI'm not fucking kidding. That is the explanation for Christmas trees...and there's still more insanity.\n\nThen, there's the discussion of Santa Claus, who Christian is so hateful and paranoid about he even goes as far as to say Santa's name is essentially Satan when you rearrange the letters. He also complains about how Santa has \"hijacked\" Christmas from Jesus.\n\nAs Kirk explains the meaning of Santa for Christmas, we get a brief glimpse of Kirk dressed as Santa Claus through grainy footage and donning a creepy smile under the beard (That smile doesn't say, \"Merry Christmas! Ho! Ho! Ho!\" That smile says, \"You're all gonna die\" before pulling out an axe Silent Night, Deadly Night-style). Then he demands that Christian picture his image of Santa and his story in a Lord Of The Ring-sy style, where he goes on to explain the history of Saint Nicholas and how he was kind to the poor, was generous with gifts, and the bishop of Myra.\n\nHe goes into detail talking about his conflict with a man named Arias who didn't believe that Jesus was essentially God, so he kills him, and despite being removed as bishop, he became a revered saint. I will admit, that of the topics discussed in the film, this one at least makes some sense.\n\nBut there's one final part of the insanity, and that's his explanation about the meaning of gifts after he blows Christian's mind with his \"wisdom\" and Christian, renewed in his faith, bursts back into his house and slides into the presents. Wait until you hear Kirk Cameron's explanation about why gifts are an essential part of Christmas.\n\nAccording to Kirk, when you look at the piles of presents, think of them of as a representation of the New Jerusalem. They are like a city skyline and God is the architect of this great city. At the center of the city is the tree covered in lights which shine over this great city like stars over Bethlehem. In short: presents = God's gifts. Yes. According to Kirk, materialism is what God wants during Christmas. Lots and lots of materialism.\n\nDuring the midst of this sermonizing, some scenes cut back to the party, and follow in particular an annoying token black guy character named Deondre, while the script also tries to insert moments of breaking the fourth wall as if it wants to be a hip, meta film, so to speak. Also, there's a hip hop dance sequence set to a hideous, ear-bleeding hip hop rendition of Angels We Have Heard On High. Needless to say, I have never wanted characters to die so badly in a film.\n\nAnd that's the story. I know, I spoiled the whole film, but I have now saved you the misery of watching this abomination which clocks in at 69 minutes of actual film, followed then by about 10 minutes of outtakes during the credits. I am honest to God flabbergasted by how shockingly awful the story is. It's truly mind-blowing at how badly it perverts Christianity, Christmas, and anything resembling quality or coherent storytelling. \n\nNot only does the damn film rarely make sense with its utterly illogical arguments, regardless about what you believe about the history of Christmas, but it also features some of the most irritating, unlikable characters ever put to film. Kirk is of course a smug douche who can't argue for or against anything to save his soul, Christian is a brain-dead moron who is easily convinced by the most nonsensical bullshit imaginable, and the minor character, Deondre is a combination of the worst elements of the token black guy character cranked up to 11 on the annoyance meter. I've felt more sympathy for amoral characters in other films than I did for the so-called Christian characters of this film. When I want every character to die a horrible death in a film, something has gone horribly wrong.\n\nIn the end, the story is a giant middle finger to Christianity, Christmas, and the intelligence of the viewer.\n\nThen there's the acting. Oh, God, should I even call it that? It was more like listening in on the conversation of two complete idiots, interspersed with listening in on the conversations of other stupid people.\n\nKirk Cameron has an outstanding pedigree in failure as an actor. He's like the antithesis of a great actor like James Stewart. James Stewart was versatile, charming, and instantly likable. He truly cemented himself as one of the all-time greats of film stars and left us an impressive body of work, including the forever beloved, It's A Wonderful Life, which many hail as quite possibly the greatest Christmas film ever made (Though for my money, I'd give that to another James Stewart film, The Shop Around The Corner, which is extremely underrated).\n\nKirk Cameron is the complete opposite of James Stewart. He has no versatility, he is far too smug and narcissistic to be even a modicum of charming, and is in no way likable. I once described him as being like an inoperable cancer to a film, among many other insults, but he truly is. Unlike Stewart, he has left us an impressive body of work that is a complete failure, which now just so happens to include not only the worst Christmas film ever made, but one of the worst films of all time. Kirk Cameron has certainly cemented himself as one of the worst film stars of all time, and for me, he is the worst actor ever.\n\nHe has no emotional range, his face almost never changes, and all he seems to know how to do is sermonize. Wait, no. He's not good at sermonizing, either. He just spews shit from his mouth - he's good at that.\n\nThen we get to Darren Doane (Who is also the director and one of the two writers of this film) who plays Christian. How this man did not win Worst Director or was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor (Cameron's sister was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress instead), I don't know. The man can't direct, write, or in this case, act. He has perhaps a little more range than Cameron since he tries to emote, but he is never once believable, nor achieves any sort of campy charm in the tradition of say, a screwball comedy.\n\nI don't know the name of the actor who played Deondre, as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Wikipedia refuse to mention who played this character, but he is surely one of the most irritating characters ever put to film. Whenever his character came onscreen and started talking, I wanted to put a gun to my head.\n\nNo one else is worth mentioning, nor do I give enough of a shit to learn their names.\n\nEntertainment: You know, for a family film, I can't imagine what family would possibly find this enjoyable. Kids will be bored stiff by the endless, droning, headache-inducing, watching-paint-dry-would-be-better-than-this, sermonizing that continues through almost the entire running time. Despite the colorful poster the film had when it was in theaters (Though the DVD cover has opted for something that is at least taken from the segment in the film talking about Christmas trees and comparing them from the cross), no such shenanigans occur in the film. There is no rousing adventure, no exciting action, no funny humor. No, there is only pain and utter tedium.\n\nAdults will also struggle mightily to stay awake through the film. Or, you'll end up like me, where despite being fully awake, it was it was with open-mouthed astonishment that something so awful and mind-blowingly idiotic actually exists as my brain began to shut down from trying to process so much idiocy. And I've seen A LOT of idiocy in films. Worse yet, this was the bad kind of stupid. This isn't the fun kind of stupid in the tradition of say, Showgirls or the recent Jurassic World. No, this is soul-scarring, bad kind of stupid.\n\nIt's a film that will linger with you long after it's over. If I ever develop a brain tumor, this is going to be one of the things I blame for it. It's a film so bad that even if I live to be an old man and get Alzheimer's, I will never be able to forget it. It is now seared into my memory for the remainder of my life. It's so awful the film-makers should be charged with a hate crime against the audience and Christianity.\n\nHumor: ??????????????????\n\nForget whatever psychotic right-wingers scream about in regards to the war on Christmas, this is the real war on Christmas! Saving Christmas is a despicable film that insults the intelligence of the viewer, insults Christianity and the good people who follow it, insults Christmas, insults the craft of film-making, possesses no humor, the acting is hideous, the music is hideous, the direction is abominable, the writing is beyond bad, and so many other things. There are an infinite number of issues with this film, and it deserves every bad review it gets, and Kirk Cameron deserves every bit of flack he gets for starring in this film and trying to manipulate the ratings.\n\nCongratulations Kirk Cameron, Saving Christmas has now become one of the 10 Worst Films I have ever seen. Welcome to the bottom, asshole.",

            "content": "You really have to see this film to believe it. I went in expecting it to be a rather revolting piece of Christian propaganda, but that wasn't really what I found. In fact, hardcore Christians are one of its main targets. I expected it to be self-righteously mocking as well, and while it's certainly self-righteous to an amazing extent it doesn't really spend that much time mocking its opponents. Instead, it takes a more \"positive\" approach by building its own interpretations of \"controversial\" elements of Christmas celebration.\n\nThe film starts with Kirk Cameron sitting in front of a fire surrounded by Christmas decorations delivering us a long-winded Christmas soliloquy. I can sum up the style in three words, as they're the ones he repeats the most often: \"Maybe, just maybe\". Over and over again he says that line, as if he's repeating scripture. It's obnoxious and patronizing and not nearly as charming as he thinks. During this we get to hear for the first time what some of the arguments against Christmas might be: the only possible reason you could not like Christmas is if you can only see the worst in things. To be specific, if you note \"commercialism, greed, holiday junk, materialism, paganism, elf-worship\" in the Christmas ceremony you're just being a doomsayer.\n\nAfter an agonizingly long time of watching his self-satisfied smirk as he preaches at us we finally get down to the \"story\". The basic plot is that his brother-in-law doesn't like Christmas. The reason he doesn't like it, in fact the only conceivable reason that anyone ever could dislike the holiday, is because he can only see the worst in things. And the proper response to somebody not enjoying or participating in this greatest of all holidays is to hunt them down and force them to enjoy it. The best way to do this is through guilt: if you're not conspicuously enjoying yourself you're ruining it for the rest of your family. And that's truly what he believes too. He hunts his brother-in-law down to his car, where he's not bothering anyone, and forces him to come out and enjoy it. \"What's in there, it's all Christmas. And you're spoiling the whole thing.\"\n\nAnd of course, even if hardcore Christians are one of the targets, this is still a deeply Christian film. The brother-in-law is so upset because he can't enjoy a holiday knowing that it's not really Christian. He sets up a whole straw man argument about how baby Jesus isn't really at the core of Christmas. And here's the best bit: even having set up an obvious straw man argument Kirk Cameron can't actually take it down. This is a guy with no grasp of logic or even relevance. Instead of actually confronting the issue he goes into a long-winded ramble that covers everything from the manger, to feeding troughs, to family, to Herod's soldiers, to death. This doesn't so much confront the problem as state various thoughts (most of them wrong or questionable and all of them irrelevant except for the presence of religious decorations at Christmastime) one after the other with a very limited visual display. Naturally, this being a Kirk Cameron film, the brother-in-law is floored by all this and immediately abandons all resistance to the idea that Christmas is solely about the worship of Christ.\n\nHaving been humbled by the \"awesome\" debating powers of Kirk Cameron he immediately and for no obvious reason becomes insufferably arrogant and mocking again and accuses Christmas of being a barely concealed pagan holiday (the horror!) and the Christmas tree a pagan symbol. And just like last time, Kirk quietly and calmly pretentiouses the shit out of him with his awesome \"logic\". Why, he says, the Garden of Eden was full of trees. God filled the world with trees (all pines I assume). God even brought trees inside his temple and placed lights on them (when did he do this?!?). In fact, how can celebrating the winter solstice actually be pagan when God created the winter solstice? QED. As if this stunning argument isn't enough, he also emphasizes how trees have a long tradition in the church. Why, Adam stole the apple from the tree so he had to put himself back on the tree in its place. Can you see where he's going with this? That's right, the Christmas tree is essentially the cross, as shown in an amazingly poor visual of a boy in a Christmas tree lot. So when you're buying a Christmas tree it's so that it will never be used to crucify someone, because Jesus. At no point in here does anyone mention anything about what the \"pagan traditions\" actually were or who was doing them.\n\nThis whole argument again astounds the guy, who immediately backs down and repents the error of his ways. But of course, we're not done yet and he rebounds with his greatest argument yet: that Santa is an anagram for Satan, that Norwegians are druids, and Santa is really an elf. It's difficult to create more of a straw man than that. And yet again Kirk fumbles. This time he really goes all out in making fun of hardcore Christians. He gives here a hilariously inaccurate account of the Council of Nicaea told in true Lord of the Rings style as if it was conducted in a bar in Scandinavia instead of a comfortable church in Turkey. Nicholas is a crazy barbarian with a big beard. When he comes across some filthy heretics he immediately... sits down and recounts scripture. It's one of the few bits of humor that actually works. As such it is too clever for this film by far so he immediately discards it and has Nicholas beat the guys up and throw them out. Hurrah! Most of this is irrelevant to the main point, which is that St. Nicholas was associated with giving gifts to children. No explanation is proffered for why we remember him as Scandinavian, where the name Santa Clause comes from (actually a corruption of SaintNi cholas), or the association with fur coats. Also no indication of why he would be associated with elves in the first place or how pagan elements could be given a Christian gloss to make them acceptable to the religious authorities. I'm not a hardcore Christian and yet I can see all of these problems in a way that he can't.\n\nSo once again, even when creating straw man arguments and controlling both sides of the conversation Kirk Cameron can't manage to actually score any points. He's that bad a debater. If he set out to prove that water was wet he'd go on about how water symbolizes our covenant with God, how the Flood was used to destroy sinners and is therefore good, and how every time we use water we're really participating in the worship of God because God created water. And then he'd beam and wait for us  to fawn all over him because of his wit and logic.\n\nThe film is filled with many many factual errors. In fact, when hearing something in here it's safest to assume that it's entirely incorrect as a baseline. This is true even for the most minor of minor facts, such as when Cameron calls the lead in A Christmas Carol Uncle Scrooge, mixing him up with Scrooge McDuck from Duck Tales. This is a sad, ignorant waste of celluloid made worse by the smug smirk that Cameron wears throughout. I don't know who the intended audience for this is. It's not Christian fanatics as I first supposed because they're mocked even more than non-Christians. Instead, I think it's Christmas fanatics who are the target audience, a group I was not even aware existed until this point. Given the failure of this film perhaps they don't. In any event, it's not as funny a disaster as it could have been. It really is nothing more than an excuse to hear Kirk Cameron ramble about something nonsensical in a car for an hour and twenty minutes.",

I was raised in religion, and no longer follow it, but I believe in spirituality... and oh, did I mention that I'm gay and married to a guy?\n\nI too agree with Kirk's point - I always say 'Merry Christmas' or 'Christmas' when the holidays come around. I am so tired of being politically correct. I think we need to give every filmmaker a shot and respect them for their opinion and beliefs, even if we don't agree. \n\nMaybe it's not the best produced film, and if that's your reasoning to dislike it, okay. But if it's because you don't agree with Kirk's message, that is no reason to pick on him. He's doing what he thinks is right, and what inspires him.

However, when someone comes out with the facts of why we celebrate Christmas and that they are all Biblically related suddenly he is a disgrace and attempted to be made a mockery out of. Do you really think that Kirk Cameron cares what any of you think? He is concerned what Christ thinks of him, and personally I say good for you, I support you 100%! Kirk used his same amendment rights to show what he believes with facts to back it up and you all try to laugh him out of the business. You are hypocrites as usual. You could not attack the facts that he had because they show why we believe what we do and why Christmas is a Christ ian holiday. No matter what you try to do to spin it, people only make fun of others when they are a threat or they are jealous of his stance on what he believes. I say God Bless him. The movie was great, and I wish it would have been longer. I say, do not worry about the money or ratings, you did it to show others why we celebrate Christmas. Keep it up. I suggest you make one for Easter as well!! We need your information and insight!

            "content": "Christian evangelist Kirk Cameron sets out to put the Christ back in Christmas with his latest film Saving Christmas, a film that had good intentions but crumbles into nothing more than a poorly written essay disguised as a Christmas comedy. Let's get one thing clear, this review is not meant to start arguments or bash anyone's personal beliefs. Being a Christian, this movie obviously has some weight for me as a person but this is a film review not a religious dispute. Bottom line: this is an unbiased review not meant to cause problems. With that out the way, lets dive in. There really isn't much to say about Saving Christmas, it is poorly written, horrendously acted, edited terribly, and shouldn't be viewed by anyone. The main problem here is that there is a small plot line that is actually an essay. The story is that Kirk Cameron's brother in law isn't in the Christmas spirit and it is up to Cameron to convince him of Christmas traditions but not without sitting him down and discussing three points. That's right, there are literally three main points that are tackled in this film and then the film is over in a brief little speech at the end. That is the entire film in a nutshell. The film is 80 minutes long but it feels like hours. There are poor attempts at comedy here that the audience is supposed to laugh at. Be it about hot chocolate or Fox News, we are apparently supposed to just \"get it\". There is a ridiculously small cast here with Kirk Cameron in the lead as a character we can only assume is himself. There are no names given outside of the brother-in-law. There are other actors here but they receive no development at all and are so stereotypical and racist that you can't believe this is supposed to be meant for everyone. The acting in this is so horrible and cheeky that the Lifetime Channel would never touch this. The brother-in-law is played by the director Darren Doane and he drops the ball in the worst fashion here. Every shot is elementary and the camera work is beyond shoddy. The frames shake and the scenes feel like poorly drawn snippets of Hallmark cards. Doane and Cameron both do horrible jobs here and this film is nothing but a product of bad ideas. The only thing I will touch on as far as the subject matter is that some of the topics here are harmless enough while one is just so out there it feels like it is just thrown in for laughs. All in all this barely counts as a film. Nothing in this works and it is literally a chore just to sit through. Everything is poorly done and I can never reccomend this to anyone under any circumstances. Save yourself from Saving Christmas, watch something on Netflix instead.",

And I like Kirk Cameron in general, and the movies he's been in before, etc. IN Saving Christmas I did enjoy hearing some of the stories  - specifically the one about St. Nicholas,  but I don't think that the truth about who St. Nicholas was and who people present Santa to be here in our culture is relevant to each other.  Yes, teach your children about St, Nicholas and who he is, but don't try to make that into a reason to teach your kids that Santa is a symbol for Christmas that is pointing towards Christ and you should get your picture taken with Santa or you're being a bad Christian who isn't embracing Christmas. I think there is a balance between the view that you shouldn't celebrate Christmas at all or you're a sinner if you have a Christmas tree, and the view that Cameron is espousing in this film.  I also think the title \"Saving Christmas\" is a bit disingenuous.  Sure, celebrate Christmas and make Christ the focus, but don't try to embrace materialism and greed and say that that is taking back Christmas.",

            "content": "Given the title, Kirk Cameron's prominent placement, and a poster involving Cameron with a background explosion of holiday paraphernalia, one would assume Saving Christmas would concern itself with the oft-repeated \"War on Christmas.\" I was expecting Cameron to lament our use of \"Happy Holidays\" and the like. Perplexingly, Cameron's war is not with those outside Christianity but those within. Saving Christmas is a shoddy evangelical sermon with shoddier theology, straining to fill out a running time, and ultimately being pro-materialism and anti-empathy. Come again?\n\nAt Kirk's (Cameron) family Christmas party, his brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane) is a Grinch. He complains that Christmas has been co-opted by secularism. Santa Claus and other symbols with pagan origins dwarf the nativity and baby Jesus. Christian removes himself from the party and sits in his car. Kirk won't allow this to stand. He gets inside the car and proceeds to explain why Christian is wrong about Christmas.\n\nTo call this a film is to be more charitable than perhaps even Jesus would be. Saving Christmas (or Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas as listed in certain places) is a smug sermon presented by Kirk Cameron lecturing his \"bro\"-in-law in a car. The majority of the film takes place in a parked car. If that sounds deeply cinematic to you, then stick with me. The film shambles its way to 80-minutes, exasperating to fill out a minimum feature-length running time. There's about ten minutes of \"hilarious\" bloopers. There's a five-minute opening where Cameron speaks directly into the camera and sips from his mug of hot chocolate three separate times. There's a five-minute, though it feels torturously endless, \"hip hop Christmas dance\" performance by a bunch of white people (it is powerfully uncoordinated, like you're watching someone's home movie of their kids). You do get to watch Cameron effectively do the Worm, though (his finest acting moment onscreen, in my humble opinion). There's also the occasional, very tin-eared comedy break with supporting characters that skirt the line into stereotypes. When it all comes together, there's maybe a total of 40 minutes of an actual movie here, laboriously stretched out. And when I say \"movie\" I mean Cameron and Christian talking back and forth in a stationary car. This is not a movie. At all. \n\nDirector and co-writer Doane is one of the most inept filmmakers I've observed. This is a horrible looking movie with many clueless edits and strange visual compositions. His onscreen wife is always seen looking wary and in slow motion, like her face has frozen. There's also the annoying habit of not properly framing his subjects, who will get caught behind a pot of hot chocolate or some poinsettias. This is just bad filmmaking. The lighting is amateurish or overdone, like when Kirk spends about five minutes standing backlit, as to communicate his inherently angelic nature. Doane will also keep focusing on repeating scenes like he's filling time. The film has a very rushed and patched-together feel, as if they had a weekend to film it at Cameron's place with his friends and family. The \"comedy relief\" is also terribly executed, with two characters having a conversation holding mugs to their face, the better to disguise the fact that one of them is not actually speaking his lines. The pacing is also dead. The movie keeps faking you out when it's going to end but then continues on, overstaying its welcome so Cameron can have yet another victory lap to hear himself talk. \n\nCameron and his producers seem to subscribe to an all-or-nothing approach when it comes to recognizing the malleable symbolism of cultural artifacts. Is there any harm in acknowledging the past connections of certain ceremonial customs and artifacts we use today? While the origins of the Christmas tree can go back to the pagans, Cameron seems to forget to mention that it was Martin Luther who took the Christmas tree as a German holiday tradition and gave it a Christian spin. Of course acknowledging such would indicate that the Christmas tree wasn't always the same symbol. But who cares? History is a melting pot as far as cultures are concerned, and we pick up many customs that become passed down for various reasons, often expanding and adapting. Is there any implicit harm in simply admitting that a Christmas tree has an origin that predates Christianity? Today it is a different symbol commemorating a different holiday. Just because we know history doesn't somehow devalue our customs and traditions. Cameron and his cronies seem to disagree, which is why he presents flimsy arguments to reclaim historical authority. What he's really doing is treating the symbols of the season as metaphors, applying deeper meaning to them. That's fine and good. If Cameron wants to see the Christmas tree as a representation of the cross, or the trees of the Garden of Eden, that's fine. But he shouldn't pretend that this interpretation is gospel. That's the thing about metaphors; they're subjective and pliable. They are not absolute. \n\nAmazingly, Saving Christmas ends up becoming a misguided and ludicrous defense of materialism and the commercialism attached to Christmas. In Cameron's very narrow perspective, anything associated with the holiday has to be positive. Yes, Cameron literally argues that all the material excess and spending actually honors God.  Instead of looking at the presents under the tree as just that, look at them as the outline of a skyline of a new Jerusalem, Cameron offers in one of the more head-scratching moments. He conflates the spending of money with celebration, admonishing people to buy \"the biggest ham, the richest butter\" as long as they just don't \"max out their credit cards.\" That's the limit he sets, so everything below that must be agreeable. Just to hammer the message home further, Cameron says that materialism is good because \"Christ was made material.\" That sure is a slippery slope of ethics there. It's not much of a leap to then justify greed or to equate spending the most money with being the godliest. Why would any film, let alone a Christian one, choose to defend unchecked materialism?\n\nI know Christian is more a foil for Cameron to helpfully inform, a straw man who cannot articulate his intellectual rationale, but Christian is the worst skeptic of all time. If he truly believed what he does then he should be able to provide evidence to support his stance. It wouldn't be hard. The historical record is loaded with stuff ready-made to counter-argue Kirk's cherry picking of relevant theology. The very concept of late December existing as a pagan holiday celebrating the winter solstice (Saturnalia) is backed up by a treasure-trove of sources, despite Cameron's snide rejoinder that \"last time I checked, God created the winter solstice.\" The Romans would even exchange gifts on December 23rd in celebration and feast. If Christian were a real skeptic, he'd at least have a cursory knowledge of this stuff before even approaching specifics. Instead he sputters and is proven to be a fraud, duped into believing these anti-Christmas thoughts. Every time Kirk finishes another of his rather unconvincing asides, Christian shakes his head, dumbfounded, and says he never looked at things like that. He is the most easily converted skeptic since the Spanish Inquisition. \n\nI kept going back in my head to a vital point of Christian's that is never referenced or challenged by Cameron: wouldn't all this money be better spent helping the disadvantaged? Christian looks at the extravagant money spent on an ostentatious party and thinks of how many people could have been fed, how many wells could have been dug in villages. \"You're wrong,\" Kirk says. \"About everything. You've drunk the Kool-Aid.\" Even as Cameron bends over backwards to defend materialism, he never addresses Christian's fundamental point, which is that the money can be better spent elsewhere. to the movie's worldview, Christian is a \"jerk\" and he's \"terrorizing\" (I kid you not, they specifically use the word \"terrorize\") his family with his negativity. This is a guy who wants to put the \"Christ back in Christmas\" and he's setup as the bad guy. He's not storming the party, aggressively challenging people, calling them names. He sits to himself, eventually leaving the space for his car. It doesn't sound like he's terrorizing anyone and is rather considerate of others. No matter, no one is allowed to have a different opinion than Kirk Cameron and so he will not allow one man's empathy to bring everyone else down as they spend lavishly to celebrate the birth of a poor carpenter.\n\nAnd that's what's most distressing for me when it comes to this poorly made and poorly reasoned movie; I'm concerned that others will use Cameron's distorted teaching as a justification for excess over empathy. Cameron seems to use the film as a defense of his affluent privilege. He uses the Bible to back up his lifestyle and to defend materialism. Did we forget that part where Jesus said to sell all your possessions and help the poor? The film is packaged as a comedy and a family movie with a spiritually uplifting message, but what's so uplifting about saying \"SPEND SPEND SPEND\" is how you show love? Just because Cameron says a nutcracker is representative of King Herod's foot soldiers prowling Jerusalem for the baby Jesus doesn't make it strictly so. To call this a movie would be too charitable and I am not in the season of giving. Saving Christmas is a lump of coal disguised as a open-hearted message. Skip this movie and donate your money instead to some charity. At least that will do some actual good.  \n\nNate's Grade: D",

Christmas is whatever we want it to be,  a celebration of toys,  gifts, food,  family.  An after the harvest and beginning of winter celebration.  Nobody,  not even atheists threaten Christmas,  because it's just a silly holiday like Halloween.  This man lives in a fantasy land and portrays that in every aspect of the film.  He is so self entitled that he of course casted himself as a lead to 'save Christmas.'  This is a good movie for people who oppose logic and reason and prefer to live in fantasy land,  where the middle eastern desert God Yaweh had a white blue eyed son,  who was himself,  so he could kill himself to save his creation from him.

Worse, they hate anyone and anything that isn't explicitly christian and feel the need to attack it, not realizing that their own opinions have no bearing on how others live their lives. This film evidences the woeful self-delusion common to christian extremists and the American Taliban who fear the world outside of their tight-knit communities. Most disturbing, Cameron's attempt to \"rig\" his rating here on Rotten Tomatoes demonstrates the type of selfish desperation not seen since Tom Cruise attempted to refute psychology. Cameron's holier-than-thou attitude is little more than a smokescreen for his own delusions and willful ignorance. Cameron's brand of christianity brings to mind a quote from Stephen Colbert: \"If this is going to be a Christian nation that doesn't help the poor, either we have to pretend that Jesus was just as selfish as we are, or we've got to acknowledge that He commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition and then admit that we just don't want to do it.\"",

It's two hours of Cameron telling Christians that they don't have to feel guilty about indulging in some commercialism (which we're allowed to do, but becomes crass when suggested that it's what Jesus wants) and fails in two hours to undo what Linus accomplished in A Charlie Brown Christmas in under two minutes, which is to make people focus less on what they can buy and more on what they do for one another.

The movie starts out slowly with a normal Christmas party (good porn always start up slow). \"Christian\" (ha ha) begins to doubt the spirit of Christmas, so he and Kirk head out to the driveway. \"Oh yeah\", I think, \"here it comes!\" I unzip my pants and get ready to start jerking it. Then Kirk and Christian talk some more. Build up is good, but are they going to at least start rubbing each other's shoulders? No. They don't. All of the talking made my erection very sad. I ended up walking out of the movie after 40 minutes. This gave me a chance to look out over the mostly empty theater and confirm that everyone was unable to masturbate too. That's a pretty harsh indictment of a porn. Usually at least one deviant finds something in the movie to pound off too.",
