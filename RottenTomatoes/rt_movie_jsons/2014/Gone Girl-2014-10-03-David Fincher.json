A suspicious person was found to be her husband. Yet, he doesn't seem to be involved in her disappearance. The way she has gone is not quite obvious. Gone Girl is based on the book and was directed by the well-known David Fincher. In the majority of cases, a detail might have been lost when a book is converted to film. However, once I had read the book before watching the movie, I believed that the movie still had a strong production value. The way this movie is mysteriously processed, along with the way it goes, define its identity. Besides that, how the plot twists during the movie is also compelling. Some scenes are unpredictable and also lead to psychological thrillers. It also interfered with social issues. The breathtaking atmosphere and soundtrack that encourage viewers to stay focused on the following scene are what I most admire. Similar to Rosamund Pike's character, other performers were chosen for their roles based on how well they would match the roles. Rosamund Pike is an actual actress. \nI would recommend this movie to anyone who prefers watching thrilling, mysterious investigative films. It deserves to be listed as a must-see movie.",

(spoiler alert -- don't read on if you intend to watch this movie).  Nick Dunne knew full well her horrendous capabilities and yet he stood in a shower with her.  That scene alone destroyed the entire movie because no patient would be let out of a hospital with blood still splattered all over her!! That insulted my intelligence.  My husband and I put the movie on pause and both of us were furious that the movie at that point took such a ridiculous turn!! Then the ending was so stupid -- It made absolutely no sense that: 1) a fertility clinic would release someone\u015b sperm without his approval and signature, 2) that he would stay with her after that horrendous lying scheme to get pregnant,  3) that he would stay with her after all her other horrendous actions against other men, and 4) that he would stay with her after her attempt to have him sentenced to death row for murder.  Nobody would stay married to someone that did that to them. He would be suing her!  The only thing we could think was that he stayed in it to get the publicity, the book deals, the fame, a potential movie deal, etc. -- for the money, but that was not appropriately presented as a motive either.  His premise that he felt obligated to raise the child because the court would not give him custody was also stupid because nothing would stop her in the future from killing him and claiming he raped her (like she did with the previous boyfriend) and raising the child herself.  He was a much smarter person than that throughout the movie. He would not risk his life and stay with her.  This movie with great acting, top-notch production, great directing, and a potentially great plot line went to a complete failure when it crumbled into a million ridiculous peices.",

            "content": "In an early scene in \"Gone Girl,\" the female protagonist Amy says to her lover Nick, \"We're so cute, I'd like to punch us in the face.\"\nIndeed, both of them deserve a punch. They're a couple of self-absorbed, overeducated, glib, entirely-too-good-looking, yuppified, white jerks. Their \"meet cute\" scene at the beginning is nausea-inducing. The two are played by Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck.\n\nI thought perhaps that the author of the original book, Gillian Flynn, made the two characters  unlikeable for a reason (I haven't read it, and I probably never will). If that was Flynn's intention, filmmaker David Fincher has surely captured it in this film. \n\nSo we have a problem right from the git go: characters we can't stand. On top of that, the film's attempts at dark humor come off as unbearably smug. \n\nOne saving grace is Kim Dickens' portrayal as the world-weary detective Boney, investigating Amy's disappearance. I found myself perking up whenever she appeared in a scene. She suspects that Nick has something to do with the vanishing of his wife, and so do we. We learn that Nick has been having an affair\u2013which is, of course, requisite in all sleazy soap operas.\n\nI won't reveal the movie's big twist, in case you're one of the few people who don't already know about it. But the story is not over at that point. There's a particular event that's unbelievably cynical, and there's a gory sex / murder scene that's purely gratuitous.\n\nIn spite of its distasteful characters and their behavior, curiosity about the outcome kept me watching. But overall, \"Gone Girl\" left a bad taste in my mouth. This film is, like the Supreme Court said in the 1970's, \"utterly without socially redeeming value.\"",

Affleck and Pike are incredible leads, with Harris, Perry, and Coon also giving solid performances. The actual message of the film is a bit messy, with the final message being very questionable. The atmosphere and cinematography are all brilliant as always. Really, my only major concern is that many of the characters are such bad and unlikeable people that it's hard to side with them. I get that that is part of the story and the ending itself, however, there are many times where their deeds go unpunished. There are also many unrealistically frustrating moments that just don't seem to work (trying to avoid spoilers as much as possible lol).

            "content": "David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

As the story unfolds the husband becomes the prime suspect. Is he a monster?  A victim?  The fall guy?  The story is intriguing and well executed.

In the end I simply settled on the fact that they were meant for each other. Neither spouse exemplified true character and I don't think there would be any way for them to be with anyone else while the other is alive. Obviously there was quite a bit more mental instability on the part of Pike's character, but one could argue that the grief of her ailing relationship drive her towards such measures, therefore shifting a portion of the blame to her husband. There is so much relational turmoil to unpack in this film, and I enjoyed the thought process surrounding it. Pike as a narrarator will always be a plus to me, and her explaination quickly became my favorite part. All in all, I was pleased with the movie and will certainly be watching it again.",

It is certainly violent and it has sexual content but the psychological drama side is just fantastic. I empathized with a guy that cheated on his wife because her wife is just crazy (and terrifying) and her craziness makes all the medias talking shit about him. I mean what a bad luck. He fell in love with that woman but he made mistakes and instead of just getting divorce like everyone else would, she just destroys him without any mercy and she loves being loved by the people. If there is a sociopath, it's her.\n\nSo, for the plot value, it is good but it is also sublime because of Ficher's style. I always say that David Fincher is one of my favorite directors (if not my favorite) and that's even more true after watching a film like that. The dark, stressing atmosphere with the music and the fantastic camera work.\n\nVery good",

She pretty much carries the film on her own for the most part. This film is neither feministic nor misogynistic in my opinion. I felt a bit disappointed with the climax and it's plausibility.

I think this film is a masterpiece, the concepts are expressed in an excellent way, it has become one of my favorite films. He should have won an Oscar. \nThe intro is so significant and disturbing: \"I'd like to split her skull\" \nafter watching the movie trailer you already know what's going to happen, or at least you think you know, and Nick already starts to dislike you a little.\nThe movie starts with him going to a bar, and when he comes home, his wife is gone, so Nick calls the police. I was struck by the fact that Nick doesn't seem too upset by his wife's disappearance, I mean, he's not desperate for grief. Then, when the cops intrigue him doesn't seem to know any aspect of his wife's life, a relevant fact because thanks to this, we who look understand that they did not have a good relationship.\nThe police then set off to look for her; earlier she had left clues which when Nick finds them he does not show to the police. By doing this he shows the audience that he is somehow guilty, if he wasn't he would have had to give everything to the cops. \nTo add to the hatred we already had for Nick, we find out that he has a lover, oh God, when I found out I was shocked. I thought: \"how could you do this to Amy\" and as if that wasn't enough she was a little girl. From this last fact I felt a hatred towards Nick, I didn't justify him. On top of that there were the scenes of their relationship in the beginning and how they complemented each other, but then Nick ruined everything. \nthe director wants to make it look like Nick is the bad guy in fact who wouldn't be on Amy's side seeing those images? no one, that's who. \nAmy to get revenge for his betrayal stages her own murder. she plans it in every detail. then she runs away and takes refuge in some bad place. the feelings were almost indescribable, oh god, she didn't die, thank goodness\nIn the meantime Nick gets a lawyer because he is accused of his wife's murder. he also finds out what game Amy has him playing in. His sister has two very important terms: \"psychopath\" and \"manipulator\". After this scene I started to see Amy as a manipulator too, because on second thought that's what she is.\nShe tells the police everything and everyone believes her, except for 4 people: Nick, Margo, Nick's lawyer and the detective on duty. They don't believe her because they know what really happened. But in the end she won anyway, she fooled everyone who matters and appeared as the perfect wife who despite everything is madly in love with her husband (plus she's expecting his child without Nick touching her, now Nick is forced to stay with her forever).\nThe film finish with the intro scene, one things significative, now we now the meaning of that. \nNow let's talk about the media, they were present throughout the film, they discredited, insulted Nick and made him hated by all (they even insinuated incest), they too were fundamental for the judgment of Nick and Amy. I think with this the director shows us how much the media can influence us and make us think as they want.\nBy finishing the film we all realized how powerful women are, how she is powerful, how the power of cunning beats everything and everyone. We are all astonished because we had a thought for, and another, and another. In the end she's won everything.",

Overall, the movie makes sense and the viewers somewhat understand the motivations behind each of the characters.

Gone Girl is stylish, it's characters feel sleek, cunning and criminally cool. Rosamund Pike did a fantastic job in her role, and the tone of her acting really complemented the sharp edge of the film. Ben Affleck plays his role brilliantly as well, and it really is as if the role was written for him; He's a very human character, and he's just empathetic and charismatic enough that you still stay on his side, despite how the film tries to convince you otherwise. This brings me to my next point, which is that this is a movie that plays with your thoughts, I honestly felt manipulated watching this, and at times uneasy with how I reacted unsurely to things that I normally would've been viscerally disgusted with. I don't often find myself yelling at the screen, but this is one of those movies that made me nervously exclaim out loud, multiple times, while I was watching it.

But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous fa\u00e7ade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?\n\n\"Gone Girl\", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. \"Gone Girl\" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: \"This case is about what people think of you.\"\n\nAmy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where \"Gone Girl\" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie.\n\nBen Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is. 9.0/10",

Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.\"",

            "content": "David Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" is a dark, gripping and utterly unpredictable thriller that offers a commentary on the toxicity of modern relationships. With his tenth feature, director David Fincher has crafted an astonishing adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel. Using captivating cinematography, Fincher draws viewers into the world of a man that is suspected of his wife's murder. From intimate close-ups to tense panning shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the movie a tense and foreboding atmosphere that is reminiscent of Fincher's previous films. Gillian Flynn's script is sensational, and expertly employs narrative twists to keep viewers engaged in the story. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career as Nick Dunne. This is the actor unlike you've ever seen him before: intense, charismatic and menacing in his most complex role to date. Rosamund Pike is remarkable in the role of a manipulative woman that is unsatisfied with her marriage. With enigmatic expressions, she captures the mischief, torment and resentment of the villainous character. Although \"Gone Girl\" is undeniably riveting, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly two and a half hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. In this regard, the film may have benefitted from a tighter cut that removed unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"Gone Girl\" and so will movie-goers seeking engrossing entertainment. At a time when toxic relationships are rarely depicted in films, its a cautionary reminder of the dangers posed by psychopathic women in marriages.",

Not only is 'Gone Girl' a meditation on marriage, but also a commentary on how a media narrative can be used to a malicious individual's advantage and make the public see an innocent person as guilty.  Very contemporary.  As a Fincher film, I'd put it slightly below Fight Club and Social Network, but it ranks high within his works in my opinion.  I thought the whopping 2 and a half hour run-time would be a drag, but surprisingly by the final act, I wanted it to keep going, for the sake of Nick's (Affleck) character to receive justice.  If you want a prime example of a conniving psychopaths ability to dupe others into believing their lies as irrefutable truth, through highly elaborate means, this is a great film to start with.  Dark, intriguing, illuminating, sobering and twisty, 'Gone Girl' is a psychological thriller done right.",

The dialogue feels a tad manufactured at times, and although I've personally ignored much larger mistakes, Gone Girl balances on such a tight rope, that this single flaw sticks out like a sore thumb. I'd say it's a thankless job to make a movie like this, but it wouldn't be true. After all, I'm still writing a review for myself, expressing the love I have for this work of art.",

It might be the quickest 2 \u00bd hour movie I've ever seen. The RT ratings are surprisingly tied (and surprisingly low) at 87/87 as I write this. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross always give a chilling and perfect score. The whole storyline of \"X Day Gone\" builds suspense, which is compounded with unreliable narrators. Rosamund Pike delivers an exceptional performance as the manipulative, conniving, and downright evil Amy Dunne. The cut to her, very much alive, over an hour into the film was stunning on first viewing and still makes me smile. There was something so unique about watching her eyes flutter by, reveling in her Welcome Home reception while sitting in the back of the police car. I also think this is one of Ben Affleck's best performances as Nick Dunne, a character we question with every scene and who is ultimately the sympathetic hero. I suppose the scores weren't higher \u2014 although 87s are nothing to shake a stick at \u2014 because of the ending? At a minimum, Amy ruined one man's life with a false rape allegation and ended another's, and she was never brought to justice. In fact, she was given the gift of a child, something she yearned for from the beginning of the movie. The supporting cast of Tyler Perry, NPH, Carrie Coon, et al., were also excellent. Of course, 100/100 for Cheeto (Bleecker), the cat. I have seen too many movies lately where horrible things happen to cats, and it was nice to see Bleecker make it until the very end.",

            "content": "I honestly HATED this film. It was so painful to watch. The protagonist played by Ben Affleck and the antagonist played by Rosamund Pike were both really, really, really, really annoying and hateful. I could not root for either of them. In fact, all of the characters aside from Tyler Perry's character in this film were irritating, especially the two lead characters Nick and Amy Dunne. Gone Girl was also a very slow and boring film. I was falling asleep during this movie.\n \nYou have a protagonist who is a pretentious manwhore who blatantly cheats on his wife and constantly has an affair with another woman while he is married. He also constantly treated his wife as if she was invisible and pretended not to notice her during their marriage. He wouldn't even sleep with her in the same room. Then after his wife ditches him and when the whole media and community turns into an annoyingly relentless frenzy gossiping and getting suspicious about the disappearance of Nick's wife, he pretends that he misses her and pretends that he has always loved her.\n\nYou have an antagonist who is a love-sick, devious, crazy, relentless sociopath who frames her cheating husband for murdering her after she had enough of him treating her like she doesn't exist by leaving a lot of false murder evidence in her husband's house. Her murder conspiracy annoyingly drags on for what feels like forever. Her revenge plan on her cheating husband is stretched and over-the-top. Explaining her whole murder conspiracy would put me too sleep.\n\nSo she is living with her old friend (played by Neil Patrick Harris) from high school whom he had a big crush on her since high school and he knows about her murder conspiracy and wants in on it and helps participate in her revenge plan on her skanky husband by letting her live with him in his house in a different state than where her skanky husband lives and keeps her presence a secret from everybody else in the world aside from the couple that bribed her earlier on in the film. So when she watches a live TV interview of her husband claiming he did not kill her and stating that he misses her, loves her, and wants her back. She buys it and then her crush tells her that she shouldn't come crawling back to him. He refused to let her go. So one night they have sex together on the bed and she suddenly murders him by stabbing him to death and he severely and quickly bleeds to death on the bed.\n\n Then she later hurts herself by cutting her own breasts and making them bleed to make it seem like she was taken hostage by him and killed him in self-defense. So she goes to the police and gets interviewed by them and lies to them that by telling them that she was kidnapped, taken hostage, and hurt by that man and killed him in self-defense. They buy it and she returns home to her skanky husband Nick. He was shocked to see her back, but was still unhappy and whispers \"you bitch\" to her while they hugging outside of their house with the neighbors from the media frenzy around them clapping and applauding them. So she later confesses to him that she killed that guy she was living with for quite a long time.\n\n He was very shocked to hear that she was a sociopathic murderer who was crazy enough to murder someone just to get back to her husband. So Amy reveals to Nick that she's pregnant and which makes him feel obligated to stay with her and not turn her into the police for manslaughter so that he would live with her to help take care of and raise their unborn child. So Nick breaks up with his girlfriend whom he had an affair with and she cries. They both get interviewed one last time by the pesky neighborhood media and then he ends up being stuck with her. What a god-awful ending!\n\n I hate to admit, but Tyler Perry's character who is the lawyer is the only likable character in the whole entire film and the only one who didn't annoy me. His acting was great and he was the only one with charisma in the entire film. You know a movie is bad when Tyler Perry ends up being the best part of it. I would not watch this film again.\n\nRating: 4.2/10",

And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\n\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\n\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\n\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down.\n\nOverall Gone Girl is a fantastic film.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this film as it had a premise that sounded ludicrous enough to be enjoyable and I had heard a lot of praise for the performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Sadly the film just never really worked for me as it was too arch to believably deconstruct the pain of a failing marriage and too serious to enjoy purely as a campy film noir romp. I have always found David Fincher to be more successful at putting together the technical elements of a film than creating engaging characters or settling on a consistent tone. You feel at a remove from all of the characters in the film and therefore it is hard to care about any of their problems.\n\nThe seemingly perfect Amy Dunne, Rosamund Pike, elaborately plots to fake her own death and have her husband Nick, Ben Affleck, implicated in her murder. Nick is shocked by her disappearance as he had failed to understand that she was unhappy in their marriage as they were forced to move to Missouri after his mother became sick, she invested her savings in the bar that he wanted to own and he began an affair with one of his creative writing students, the much younger Andie Fitzgerald, Emily Ratajkowski. The press and detective Rhonda Boney, Kim Dickens, attack Nick while Dunne's plan fails when she is robbed by two rednecks and forced to turn to her former stalker, Desi Collings, Neil Patrick Harris. Nick must figure out how to manipulate the press so that his name is not dragged through the mud and those who are suspicious of him do not come to believe that he is her murderer. Meanwhile Dunne considers returning to him as she realizes that Collings is predatory and she must escape him to gain freedom.\n\nWhat the film aims to be is a sharp satire on the influence of the media over current events and what sensationalism pushes the public and the figures effected by these events to do. In some ways this works as there is humor to the occasional interludes featuring holier than thou news presenter Ellen Abbott, Missi Pyle, theorizing that Nick has an incestuous relationship with his supportive sister Margot, Carrie Coon. Despite this the dialogue is overwritten and Affleck and Pike struggle to make their dialogue believable as they spit out lines that are better on the page than when delivered on film. At a party Pike deconstructs the image that her mother has built up in the \u2018Amazing Amy' books and in what could have been a scene that accurately pinpoints what drives Dunne to break free from the eerie perfection of her life we feel that we are listening to an overexcited teenager spew out everything that they learned at a creative writing course. The film wobbled right on the edge of several genres and it's refusal to commit to a satirical bent left me cold.\n\nMuch of the discussion of the film centered around the performance of Pike in the lead and I must say that I was never particularly impressed. She is an actress that has often disappointed me as while she is well cast as a brittle socialite in An Education (2009) she otherwise strains too hard for cool and detached in her other performances. She is most difficult to believe as the Dunne who is subtly angry at her husband as while Fincher's direction doesn't help her she isn't quite as tough and calculated as she needs to be. The great femme fatales, Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity (1944) and Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), are simultaneously alluring and scary. They are able to convince you of their heartbreaking vulnerability and then shock you with their triumphant response to the untimely downfall of the protagonist. This film gets something right in portraying Nick as a wayward, flawed figure not entirely deserving of sympathy but Dunne's character is lacking several vital components as we never quite understand what would push her to go as far as she does.\n\nThe film would have benefitted from leaning into its dark, film noir elements more and the performances were lacking therefore I would not recommend the film. Watch one of the classic femme fatale thrillers from the 1940s instead.",

The chemistry between Ben Affleck (Nick Dunne) and Rosamund Pike (Amy Dunne) made this film extraordinary, with a touch of psychological mystery and suspense. In particular, the introduction scene focuses on Amy Dunne's long blonde hair while her husband's hand brushes through it gentle as a playful flirtatious gesture. Where then the camera shifts to Amy's eyes, while Nick describes their falling turning point in their marriage saying \"When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling her brains trying to get answers. The primal questions of any marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?\". \nThey seem like the perfect oddly couple who devote effort to keep their marriage interesting even after fail attempts. So, why is a devoted housewife missing the day of their 5th anniversary? In this film, the struggle to find his wife makes detective Boney (Kim Dickens) hard to believe that he wasn't in any reason involved in the disappearance. The diary kept by Amy will structure flashbacks that reveals secrets never heard before. That's when Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) comes in the picture, a former boyfriend of Amy. Despite details written in the diary, characters will have to choose sides, team Nick the sweet, gorgeous, cool guy or team Amy the super intelligent, hilarious girl that doesn't mind pretending to be what she is not. \tAfter all, the primarily suspect in these types of cases is always the husband, a person that knows every step that she has taken throughout the day.

The storytelling is really good. Very well-written screenplay. Fincher has a way of making dialogue so subtle. And in that subtlety is brilliance. Almost as if you have to be paying close attention or else you'll miss an important detail. I love it. It makes you pay attention more. \n\nIt's insane how she elaborately staged the whole thing. So meticulous down to the last detail. This movie proves that the media is the devil. They're way of construing the truth just to get views is the most disgusting thing. For them, it's anything that will create drama. Who ever would have thought that this cute blonde would be a psychopath and so sinister. \n\nRosamund's acting is oscar worthy and everyone else as well. Jesus Christ that sex scene was terrifying. I was not expecting that. Just proves even further how much of a psychopath she really is. \n\nSuper dark and twisted. It's like a really really good Black Mirror episode. An amazing psychological thriller that makes you feel claustrophobic and with plenty of unexpected turns that always keep you on your toes. ",

This is unfortunate, because films like this spell the soul of old cinema and deserve their place on the silver screen. I wish I could disabuse the studios of their proclivities towards the fantastic, and proselytize them in favor of arthouse. If I had my druthers, I would get my wish. But my entreaties would likely fall on deaf ears because cash is king. Maybe I'm just being hidebound and stodgy though. Nevertheless, for now I will pay court to this beguiling movie. It managed to compel the nectar of my soul and form a connective tissue that had me on tenterhooks throughout. The film had mettle, vigor and a projected a deep sense of pathos. So, I implore you to take a bold swing and exult in this movie. I guarantee you won't stalk off in a huff. But you don't have to take my word for it.",

Gillian Flynn's story is disturbing and creative with a fresh perspective on the crime thriller. Fincher's direction complements her writing with his sleek, smooth camera shots of clear violence and open sexuality.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is more subdued than his work on The Social Network or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nBen Affleck is a snooze of a lead unfortunately. I never liked him as a person, nor I have ever been convinced by his acting. He is just so lazy and mundane looking. His glazed over expression carries over for most of the film. He does capture the essence of a terrible husband, unsympathetic loser, and a strange decision maker. At least, you are not supposed to like his character as he is a jerk, but Affleck pulls off unlikable with ease.\n\nRosamund Pike is the real star of Gone Girl. Her character constantly gets talked about, but once you start following her perspective, the whole film changes lens and meaning. She is chilling, yet charming. Pike deserved all the acclaim she received for Gone Girl as she is subtle and unnerving throughout Gone Girl!\n\nCarrie Coon is fantastic, likable, and sympathetic as Affleck's sister. She is very genuine and funny, while adding a dramatic depth to Affleck's side as you care about her. She gives the emotional performance he cannot.\n\nI was impressed by the dramatic turn from both comedic actors Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris. They felt completely believable as their respective characters in Gone Girl. I hope they continue down a more serious film path, but who knows.\n\nAlso, Kim Dickens is hilarious as the hard boiled detective with a witty arsenal of comebacks and remarks.\n\nLastly, I suppose I should mention supermodel Emily Ratajkowski's acting is pretty good. She out acts Affleck in her introductory scene, then proceeds to get two more memorable moments. She did alright.\n\nEveryone else is forgettable or passable in their minor roles.\n\nIn all, I'm not sure that I like Gone Girl so much as I appreciate. It's a great story told beautifully. The acting is mostly solid with a few standout roles like Rosamund Pike. I think Ben Affleck's lack of charisma or energy is what will always hold Gone Girl back for me. I'd honestly rank this as my least favorite David Fincher film, but it's still a decent film.",

Fincher flawlessly encapsulates Flynn's story, with fast paced and intense direction.

I was scared when I heard that Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry were in this film because they are not usually very dramatic actors, but I had no problems with their performances.

The story was obvious ripped from Scott and Lacey Peterson with a twist, which actually made it better.\n\nHowever, the dialogue was excruciatingly bad. Way too carefully constructed in a way no one talks. Like a highly choreographed tennis match with perfect call and responses, i.e. the standard overly written repartee. Part of the problem in Hollywood is that dialogue never reflect anything real. It's for the most part written like writers would like to talk like, but never how people actually talk like.\n\nThen, there was some of the situations and casting. What's with hiring foreign actors to play American parts? There are no actresses in Hollywood that can do the job? Hint, Rosamund Pike, Lola Kirk .\n\nWhen you call the cops about a potential break in or foul play, detectives don't show up. Regular cops do, but not here. The young attractive mysterious lead woman detective and the sceptic side kick with nothing to say. Did I say cliche? Cops don't interview people together, like Nick and her parents in the same room.\n\nAmy writes out her plan on postage notes and puts them on a calendar? Who on earth would do that? You have to be a complete imbecile to do that. Only in badly written movies does that happen.\n\nJust the overall behavior of everyone was totally unnatural and inauthentic. That is Fincher's fault. The accents were too over the top. Felt like they forced them too much. And Emily Ratajkowski was supposed to play a 19-20 year old? But she is 30 and she looks that. Why not get someone who IS American and actually that age.\n\nIf you are interrogated by the cops, you don't force yourself to look guilty. You do the opposite, unlike Pike, her acting was so winking into the camera it was hilarious.\n\nI wish it was better. The premise was good, just the execution and writing of it was not.",

Ben Affleck was bad but, my God, Rosamund Pike was nearly unwatchable. Her robotic acting and something about her voice or inflection was the most irritating thing I've witnessed in quite some time.\n\nThe plot was comically laughable, especially for how seriously this movie took itself.\n\nThis biggest problem I had with Gone Girl is that no person in this film acts like an actual human being. Whenever someone goes missing, there are not ravenous mobs of people camping outside their house holding up signs like they're at some kind of concert. There are no Missing Person Groupies.\n\nAnyone outside of close family and friends sees the story on the news for a week and then forgets about it. That's how the world functions. Good or bad, that's reality.\n\nThis movie is so stupid and annoying on so many levels that I'm frustrated I even spent 2 1/2 hours of my life on it.",

Like Fight Club or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it's almost as if this book was written so he could direct the adaptation. It completely plays to his strengths. He also got the best out of his leads. Ben Affleck (Nick) gives one of his best performances ever. Rosamund Pike (Amy) is the shining star and I'd say this was easily her best role. Carrie Coon (Margo), Kim Dickens (Detective Boney), Neil Patrick Harris (Desi) and even the usually maligned Tyler Perry (Tanner) were all great in their supporting roles. Nobody is wasted. Fincher expertly sets up a dark, suspenseful tone, while the score added a ton. Fincher's combination with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was once again a spectacular fit. I won't go into too much detail on the plot, because if you haven't seen it or read the book, then the twists and turns need to be experienced spoiler-free to truly appreciate them.\n\nWeaknesses: I will admit that the ending doesn't feel like it resolves much. Again, without giving too much away, people don't really end up paying for anything they've done. I liked that Nick and Amy were portrayed as deeply flawed people, who were probably absolutely right for each other, but the ending just kind of leaves things a bit flat. It's not a bad ending, just not great. After the big reveal in the middle, the film does veer off into a few things that feel too far-fetched and a bit over the top.\n\nOverall: This is a rather insane film, yet it all works very well. It's right in David Fincher's wheelhouse and he does what he does best. Great performances, a perfectly executed tone and a gripping mystery makes Gone Girl a success.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I just went to see Gone Girl. I guess that makes me a Went Boy.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) And when you went, you made quite a mess. Let s turn our attention to this interesting Ben Affleck-flick. Go ahead and recap, Went Boy.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) - an unemployed author married to the woman of his dreams - Amy (Rosamund Pike). He comes home to find his wife has gone missing. And all the clues point to Nick as the culprit. Local Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is tracking Nick s activity and is building a case against him. There s blood on the kitchen floor and on the walls. There s Amy s insurance policy that was doubled in recent days. There s the nosey neighbor who claims Amy said the marriage was on the rocks - and Amy was pregnant. But without a corpse, there cannot be a murder. Then, Boney finds a diary where Amy lays out a story of a marriage gone bad and a husband she fears.\n\nSCOTT: As public opinion turns against Nick, he senses his imminent arrest. Wisely, he seeks the legal counsel of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who attempts to rehabilitate his public image. A big setback occurs when Nick s adulterous affair with a college girl half his age is revealed. But wait, a bigger reveal is that Amy isn t dead after all. We learn that Amy is a psychopath who has orchestrated what appears to be the perfect frame and set-up of Nick. Amy s plan is dealt a huge blow when she is robbed of all her cash and must turn to an old boyfriend (Neil Patrick Harris) for refuge.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is a great story. We re pulled in by the story of the perfect relationship. Then the relationship sours. We are lulled into the sense that Nick is the typical terrible husband. That he just might be capable of murder after all. And just when we, like everyone else in the movie, believe he is guilty - we learn that Amy isn t dead. In fact, she s setting Nick up for her own murder. This premise is easily as frightening as Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction. Nick has scorned Amy and now she uses every intimate detail she knows about Nick to implicate him in a terrible crime. It s anyone s worst nightmare - that all the secrets you share with the person closest to you can be used against you in the court of public opinion. The greatest element of this story is the turnabout of the villains. The first half of the movie sets Nick up as a dreadful man (and to a certain degree it s a deserved reputation). Then at the halfway point, the tables are turned and Nick becomes the victim to Amy s villain.\n\nSCOTT: You got that right, Greg. Gone Girl is a dark movie. It s dark in showcasing the worst of humanity and also dark in the way that darkness conceals things. There are hidden agendas of varying degrees throughout the movie, and they keep us guessing and re-guessing. This film is a chess game on steroids, with chess pieces moving methodically along the board in surprising and sinister ways. I ve never been a big fan of Ben Affleck s acting ability, but here he is a master of exuding mixed signals, rendering us uncertain of his culpability and character. Nearly all of this film s darkness emanates from the story s main malevolent character, Amazing Amy herself. For me, Amy is the most memorable female character in the movies since Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, released in 2011. Amy is sexy, smart, confident, and accomplished. We cannot even imagine her attaining the level of diabolical evil that she reaches. But reach it she does. We re left aghast and appalled while admiring her stunning, disturbing intelligence.\n\nGREG: Ben Affleck as the hero of the story is severely flawed. He is childish, a philanderer, and actually not that bright. We re given a tale of him as villain first and when the tables turn he is the victim. The story follows him center stage from beginning to end. It s his conversion from the controlling husband to the one controlled that we are witnessing. He s different from any other hero we ve studied thus far. He is transformed, but this time, not for the better. Amy is likewise a complex villain. At the start of the film she is painted as the dutiful wife who does whatever her husband wants to do. But at the halfway point we come to realize that she s the one who is controlling Nick. She becomes the villain. And again, unlike any villain we ve studied so far, she is more capable, more cunning, and more powerful than the hero of the story. She is the ultimate villain.\n\nSCOTT: Nick is not your typical hero. He s not a terrible man but he s not a good man, either. He goes through hell in this movie yet we hardly see signs of change or growth in his character. He becomes wiser but appears not to use his wisdom to better himself or the world around him. I think this is the point of the movie. We learn that dark people do dark things, and if they re smart enough, they ll get away with murder, literally. We need heroes to stop them but in Gone Girl the heroes are neither smart enough nor virtuous enough to rid the world of its darkness. I do believe that Rosamund Pike is outstanding in her role as Amy and deserves Academy Award consideration for her performance here. There is a multi-dimensionality to her acting, ranging from demure sweetness to true psychopathological rage. I agree with you, Greg, that she is the ultimate villain, making everyone around her look foolish as they try to keep up with her true motives or her next move. Amy is a force unto herself, literally; there are no henchmen or henchwomen to aid her. She is a true lone villain, perhaps the most formidable force of evil that we ve seen this year at the movies.\n\nGREG: Gone Girl clocks in at two and a half hours - and none of it was wasted. I was getting a little bored by the time we got to the midpoint where the tables are turned. Then I was riveted. This is a completely engrossing tale told spectacularly well by all members of the cast and crew. I give Gone Girl 5 out of 5 Reels. Nick is a flawed hero as we have discussed. He s not altogether bright nor altogether virtuous. He lets women mold him into whatever they want him to be (his mother, other girlfriends, then Amy). We really don t have much sympathy for him as a victim. At the end of the movie he has a way out, but he isn t strong enough to take it. This is a complex protagonist that is difficult to score on our usual scale. I give Nick a 4 out of 5 Heroes. Amy is the most manipulative, spiteful, vengeful, cunning and controlling villain we ve ever seen. If there were a Villain s Hall of Fame, I d nominate her for it. Her  unreliable first person  narration first paints her as the victim, but in the end we realize she s the one in control. I give Amy 5 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villains: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Gone Girl is one of the year s best movies with it s stylish portrayal of love, treachery, and murderous revenge. This film drags us through the muck of human relationships and the nadir of human conduct. I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that afterward I was left feeling alarmed and ashamed of the human race. At film s end, there are hints of a sequel, which I would dread seeing with great anticipation. While not a perfect movie by any means, it is engrossing enough to merit a full 5 Reels out of 5. The hero Nick is confident, handsome, and charismatic, but he s not terribly admirable. He blunders his way through the movie without evolving or learning from the disastrous choices he s made (and continues making). The fact that at the end he remains married to Amy is a horrifying testimony to his lack of heroism. That he even survives his arrogance and foolishness is a miracle -- or perhaps it is grist for a sequel. The near absence of heroism in this movie is unfortunate but probably necessary to drive home the film s bleak message about humanity. Generously, I award the rather hapless Nick 3 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, Greg, Amy is a force to be reckoned with, one of Hollywood s most formidable and memorable villains we ve seen in years. I believe her level of malevolence rivals that of Hannibal Lecter. I hope none of our readers take this the wrong way, but I d enjoy seeing her tear up additional flesh in future sequels. Because of her magnetism, her backstory, and her ability to surprise us with one chilling act of evil after another, I ll also award her 5 Villains out of 5. Movie: Villains:  Heroes:",

After my second, I'm still quite frustrated, but I'd have no right to deny how much skill went into every single aspect of \"Gone Girl.\"\n\nI wouldn't say I don't enjoy the film. I think I really do, with the key word there being \"think.\" It angers me immensely, but David Fincher has such a knack for guiding an audience and controlling pieces of information that I'm nothing if not fully engaged every time I watch it. And I guess I like being manipulated by movies.\n\nThe cast is stellar, the cinematography is excellent, but I think the true star is the score. It's eery and unsettling, but so excellently disciplined. I feel genuine fear every time I hear \"What Have We Done To Each Other.\" And that's not a common thing for a soundtrack piece to do.\n\nEven though I know what happens in \"Gone Girl,\" and I know how everything ends, I have this part of me that's optimistic things will go how I want them to.

When we see we can't live this lie to tell the truth, when we can't go deep with others no longer. When what we don't see coming, we see we are deep into whether we like or not when what the public sees and knows and what we have to live with, is enough we have to see. When what we don't see who we leave behind in deep dark places when they have to be part of this lie that we no longer like seeing but have to live with too. When we see going in deep dark places we don't know what it will bring, when some actions we see we donate reversible and unreversible that we don't see who will get hurt in the end.",

After the clever mid-film reveal, and subsequent idiocy, I couldn't wait for it to end- and thus it failed in its only raison d'etre- to be entertaining.

            "content": "I don't know much about the bestselling novel, which the movie was based off, so I don't know how much was retooled and edited all the way towards the big ending.\n \nBen Affleck plays Nick Dunne, an unemployed magazine writer whose wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing from their supposedly perfect marriage life.\n \nNick becomes a tortured, confused husband after he comes home one day to find his home wrecked and his wife missing. As the local police (Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit) are involved and investigates but seem skeptical about Nick's odd behavior and reaction. particularly his just too-calm aloofness  and demeanor to his wife's disappearance.\n \nSurprisingly he doesn't seem to know much about his wife personally and social ably and they seem to suspect that he is hiding something. Even Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon from HBO's Leftovers) to whom he is close to and greatly trusts, begins to have her own doubts if Nick is telling the full truth as the investigation develops on. There's a suffocation presence from investigating law enforcement, and the media tabloids that create a web of mounding pressure and confusion around a missing wife and a presumably guilty looking husband.\n \nBut there is a flip side to Nick's actions and story as piling clues and physical evidence involving Amy' disappearance is beginning to paint a completely different portrait of her husband, of a man that prone to showing signs of increasing anger, physical abuse, selfishness, and suspected infidelity, as a result the leering media spotlight gradually transforms Nick Dunne from victim to prime suspect.\n \nI admit that I had reserves about Affleck playing out this lead role, and the blank facial looks in the first half of the film starting me out wondering\nabout that (maybe that was purpose of the blanks due to his role) - but as the movie evolved and developed, his character grew on me and\neventually intrigued me, especially during in its dark humor spots and moments -.particularly his antics when he is awkwardly forced into a media interview with a controversial, exploiting TV talk show host.\n \nBut I admit that it was Rosamund Pike (as Amy Dunne)  who easily stole the show and spotlight with me in this film- In fact don't be surprised if\nshe is thought of when the Oscar Academy buzz starts up based off this very part and role as she took on a look of conveying Amy's upper-class upbringing,\nher icy demeanor, that is perceived and interpreted as being disdain. Through Amy's clues (ala her hidden journals  the character opens up to us, feeding out overflowing defining  details and auto-biographical testimonies, making us fear for her, and Rosamund Pike sells it. We see her as both a victim and suspect, both controlling and protective. But no matter what she is always composed and prepared.\n \nI was impressed with how she reveals and displays her tale and antics over time, how she makes us rethink the past and the characters and their sincerity.\n \nGone Girl is a patient and steady film, but I did that it was too long  (About two and a half hours) and overall I kinda felt it's longveitity.in the latter half.\n \nIt's a terrific whodunit suspenseful thriller  with several booby-trapped surprises that only make you dig in more. It seems like every few minutes we're learning more and more about Nick and what he's been hiding from others - the film is thought provoking and it influences you to try to figure out who is the suspect, who is the victim, who deserves justice, who deserves revenge,\n \nIt shows both questionable and involving parties using media manipulation to exploit their targets in a game of justice, deceit and revenge - and the film keeps the audience I'm part of guessing between who to root for - and who to believe -and why they should be believed..\n \nFrom top to bottom, I thought the acting and the supporting cast overall was terrific and well done in the film. Even surprisingly Tyler Perry in his appearance in a significant role as Nick's high media profile, slick-smooth defense attorney.\n \nHowever there are just a few issues I had with Gone Girl, Besides being a bit too long, I simply did not like or care for the casting of Neil Patrick Harris in it at all as I simply could not take  him serious in his character role as Amy's mystery past lover.  Maybe he is too typecast as a highly spot-lighted lead figure of  \" How I Met Your Mother \" - and maybe Harris himself simply couldn't make me convinced by his acting that he is more than just TV's \n \nI thought attempting to look past Harris' presence  was hampering my imagination, mode and mood of the movie ,and I admit that I was so ready for him to go away so I could get re-focused on the movie again,  I wished they had went a different direction - I was bothered the minute I saw him and I was nowhere near convinced with his acting role as a smothering, love-sick ex-boyfriend.\n \nBut it had more issues (than just Neil Patrick Harris) I also thought there would be another episode in the making when Amy's plans are thwarted and she is mugged and robbed - I had expected another act of revenge on her part and I would get to see her cleverness and cunning in getting back at her tormenters- but at last, it didn't happen.\n \nAs good as the plot and story write is,  as good as the camera work is,... as superb as the overall acting is, ..as good as the dark, smirking sense of humor moments were,  I had issues with the disappointing ending; Especially as much as it was build up and rolling with momentum and happenings where my anticipation was racing towards the wow- expecting climatic ending that I thought I was in for-  But without spoiling it for you , it really didn't happen.\nMore so, I was left with a  ...\" oh, what da hell? \"  impression as the ending credits began to roll. It didn't settled anything, and left me like it had surrendered and gave it up when it was apparently targeting the viewers' curiosity and anticipation to the very end. \n \nI liked the mood, dark atmosphere, and cinematography - Once it hits to Amy's diary tale - that's when I thought the movie really ante up and became extraordinarily compelling, ....that's when you should tie yourself down to your chair,... focus your eyeballs tightly to the screen ....and line up your ears to the theater speakers as closely and attentively as possible because she goes through all her dirty evidence work and antics with an amazing speed and pin-point display but it is so clever and complicated that you may be afraid that you may missed out on an very important clue.  And it is critical because it is the basic motive for the entire film.\n \nThe great twist and turn of it is it sets up the mystery of who to believe, who to root for, who to villainize and point the finger at, who is the victim, who is the suspect, and who is telling the believable truth. As it develops, it has some of the who-dunnit element and sexy seductiveness that we remember seeing from Basic Instincts.\n \n  Overall and as a whole , I thought it was a very good suspenseful thriller - and on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it 7.5 ....and 3 Tomatoes",

Gone Girl touches on marriage/relationship themes like other notable films (Revolutionary Road, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), but with deeper satire and an 'up to date' stance. Fincher has a way of reflecting the more interesting parts (and dark corners) of the collective consciousness (especially Americans) in a humorous way, sometimes veering towards an artistic activism of sorts (but its just 'entertainment' and simply pointing out issues will not magically make them go away). I wasn't sold on Rosamund Pike's performance until later in the film and it was nice to see a more raw and fanatical version of her than usual. This film's attitude and satire reminded me of films by Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), plus older films like Heathers (Michael Lehman) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone). \nGone Girl is ambitious in that it reaches for a wider audience in obvious and more subtle ways, infusing the 'law of reflection' to play with our minds (notably challenging our perception of who the antagonist is)- there are no 'winners', just human beings perceiving from their own experience (nicely balanced male and female point of view), resulting in a zero sum score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an appropriate and subtle soundtrack.",

This compelling and entertraining thriller had me on the edge of my seat for all of its running time, and there was never a dull scene nor a predictable one. The two leads were perfectly cast: even though i don't really like Ben Affleck, he was the perfect choice for the role, since he was able to convey the feeling of uneasiness of his character and its inability ro properly show his feelings. And what can I say about Rosamund Pike? She gave life to an extremely complex character with dedication, and she ultimately outshines everyone else. An amazing screenplay, full of unexpected twists, adapted from an even more amazing novel and cleverly written dialogue, together with a fittingly dark score all add up to create an incredible picture that serves also as a commentary upon the power of media and the nature of modern marriage.",

The police investigation uncovers several strange elements and Nick's behaviour doesn't paint the image of a distraught husband. Did he kill her? The press and the public certainly think so as the story makes several completely unexpected turns as new revelations come to light. There were elements that reminded me of Fargo in this terrific movie by David Fincher, in that we have a police investigation in a small American town where everyone seems to be hiding something. There's also a dash of Fatal Attraction and a dollop of that Christie staple, the unreliable narrator. I've always found Rosamund Pike to be both interesting to watch and more than capable and here she seems to relish her complex and variable role. Ben Affleck is an affable, likeable lead who is not as meek and mild as he first seems. Everyone in this movie seems to have a skeleton or two kicking around in their closets and the plot weaves around cleverly enough to keep the viewer guessing about what will happen next. This is a clever, witty and different take on a crime drama which I can thoroughly recommend.",

I walked out of Gone Girl with my jaw on the floor. Almost everything about it fascinated me from start to finish. And the fact that I very much enjoyed Tyler Perry's performance should tell you how great of a director Fincher really is. My only issue with the film is the miscasting of Neil Patrick Harris. Who was, at times, very hard to take seriously. I by no means blame Fincher for this but I do think he could've been a little bit better written and a tad more developed. But I nevertheless HIGHLY recommend this movie.",

            "content": "Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",

He is put in prison but enlists the help of a lawyer played by Tyler Perry who is willing to give him a chance by the truth of the real story to his wife's disappearance.\nEveryone was raving about this film in it's first two weeks of release,while I was busy trying to watch a set-of horror only films. I couldn't wait to see this film for two reasons,Ben Affleck and David Fincher. Ben Afflcek is one of my favorite actor/director working today and every time his name is on a film I must see it. David Fincher has made three great films I have seen my favorite being Benjamin button and Se7en, I did enjoy Zodiac but though those to be better.They both bring their \"A\" game in this movie Its Ben Afflecks best since Argo and better then Se7en.\nYou won't believe how it ends.

Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\n\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\n\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character.

            "content": "With a variety of great films under his belt, David Fincher has risen to become one of the best directors in the Hollywood business. Coming off of the recent political drama House of Cards, Fincher has now set his sights on Gone Girl, with impressive results.\n\nGone Girl follows the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Nick arrives home one evening to find his wife gone and a series of cryptic clues and broken furniture left behind. He finds himself embroiled with both the media (personified by Missi Pyle's Ellen Abbott) and Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) in his search, but as things go along a seemingly ordinary mystery devolves into a web of lies and hidden secrets. Just as the police begin to question Nick's honesty, so too does the audience question his integrity; did he kill his wife? Or if not, why and how did she leave him? This burning debate gradually develops as the film swaps between the perspectives of Nick and his wife with flash backs whilst also bringing in new characters which have their own roles to play in the search. On top of a plot which consistently moves forward, the film weaves in detailed themes which are constantly on display; these include the difficulties of marriage, mental degeneration, keeping up appearances and the pressures from the media and other external sources. The film gets especially dark in its later act with often disturbing acts of violence permeating the haggard minds of the characters. The ultimate conclusion, however does stick out as rather confusing and maybe a little anti-climactic; I won't ruin it here but you may well leave the film expecting slightly more closure, especially to Nick's side of the story.\n\nA movie of this genre thrives on its characters and those featured in Gone Girl are both detailed and often quite relatable. Ben Affleck does a great job of conveying the sheer frustration and isolation Nick feels from being unable to find his wife and constantly being hounded by the media, allowing the audience to put themselves in his perspective. Rosamand Pike is also brilliant as Amy, putting across the character's deterioration over the course of the film. The flashbacks strewn about the film's first act give us a lot of time to get to know the two and in doing so, we're all the more curious as to what will become of their ultimate commitments to each other. The side characters in the film are also well done; Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and his lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) have important parts to play in the overall story arc and their own more light-hearted characteristics play off the main leads well. On the other hand Ellen Abbott's character is one you will love to loath time and time again thanks to her endlessly senseless accusations. Gone Girl's characters and plot stand on an equally tuned level, creating a steady level of quality across the board.\n\nGone Girl is deftly paced, intelligent and complex, making it another winner from director David Fincher. The film's slower developments and confusing resolutions may not ring true for everyone, but for those who want something beyond the usual predictable film tropes; this is most definitely one to watch.",

            "content": "Picture\nI'm going to be honest, I really liked the start of this movie, two writers falling in love in a cloud of romance couldn't be any sweeter. I spent the first twenty minutes falling in love with Amazing Amy as she tells of how she fell in love with Nick Dunne, but as the story develops cracks appear in the relationship and it's difficult to tell where our allegiance lies, which is why we get caught up in the initial media frenzy that the movie pulls off so well.\n\nAt the turning point we find Nick Dunne is just another washed up writer in a bar downtown, his relationship is under some serious stress and we wonder if these two can make it.  Then disaster strikes as Nick comes home to find a coffee table turned over in the living room. He immediately suspects something is wrong, unemployed Amy would have had all day to clean that up, best call the police.\n\nI've never had cops over to the house after I've reported someone missing but I think I'd be pretty perturbed if they suddenly left little post it notes all about the place saying 'check this shit out' 'forensics need to see this' 'definitely evidence' 'blood all over the kitchen'.\n\nNick doesn't mind though, just happy to help out as he entangles himself further by leading the police from one clue to the next. Quick interview with the prime suspect and we learn that he doesn't know his wife that well at all, how did these two ever get married? Does Nick even love Amy? Has he ever loved her?\n\nThe best part of the thriller is wondering if Nick has something to do with his wife's disappearance, but the film never really convinces us of his malice, in fact the movie lacks a real villain in that sense.\n\nBy that I mean the movie never really delivers an act of evil that we can use to identify the sinister criminal, the rat, the bad guy - we never get that feeling of fear where our skin crawls with discomfort. Instead we get a psychotic house wife, a cheating husband, a cop that can't solve a crime, a teenage girl that can't pass her exams, a sister that can't find a husband (or a friend outside of her family), a good looking rich guy who can't find a girlfriend, two parents who can't find their daughter (no not the McCanns), a lawyer who can't find a case, two mentioned marines who never find anything, a drug lord that can't find a gun, a news anchor who can't find more than the one news story, a Father who's lost his mind, and a movie that loses the run of itself.\n\nI can't understand why this movie tries to continuously get clever with itself instead of developing one plot at a time, usually a thriller tries to play mind games with the audience by slowly building cliff hangers but this is a movie too busy trying to play mind games with itself, it moves too quickly from scene to scene in an easily explained and convenient fashion, without capturing the imagination of the viewer. It mostly just gets boring and refuses to end. Alright we get it, you've had a few bad relationships, let's all just be friends again. Ultimately the film is just too Ben Afleck, sure it tries to be bold but it's just not cut throat enough to make it off the bottom shelf.\n\nSpoilers include  :\n\nWhy wait to get out of the hospital to have a shower?\n\nSurely divorce would have been a better option?\n\nWhy not get search warrants straight away?\n\nWhy is there only one suspect in a murder investigation?\nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

But where Fatal Attraction was at least a decent movie with at least redemption at the end of the movie, this movie is having none of that. \n*Spoiler alert*  The plot of the movie was over complicated, she is a psycho who wants to setup her husband for her fake murder but where there is a lot of easier ways to do that she picked the most complicated way to do so. Where there should be some likable character there are none except the sister Margo and she barely gets a pass at that. Everyone is asshole or creepy has hell, the husband hates his wife for most of the movie, the wife hates her husband for most of the movie, Wife's mother what little of her is in the movie is a bitch and the wife's dad is a little creepy pedo feeling coming from him. The cop doing the investigation was ok in the beginning then starts to become a bit of a bitch though out, the ex-boyfriend played by Neil Patrick Harris was hurt by the wife but wouldn't say what she did then he opens he's arms for her when she want to come back to him, There is no redemption for these characters the husband just become afraid of his wife at the end, the wife is still a psycho, the sister is still hates the wife and no one is better for it.

            "content": "There's an interesting correlation that exists within David Fincher's filmography: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button aside, the more shocking and memorable a film's chief psychopath is, the better the film is as a whole. Kevin Spacey's John Doe made Se7en one of the most horrifying films of all time, and characters like Tyler Durden and Mark Zuckerberg aren't psychopaths in the same way, but both are a little twisted and most definitely unforgettable.\n\nOn the other hand, can you remember much about Stellan Skarsgard's character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Or who even played the villain in Panic Room?\n\nDiscussing Gone Girl's chief psychopath is a little complicated for a variety of reasons. For one, it would mean spoiling some of the film's best surprises (surprises that made me seek out the book before the internet spoiled the film). More interestingly, however, is the notion that the identity of a \"chief psychopath\" can vary from viewer to viewer. But this collection of psychos ranks among Fincher's most memorable, and perhaps because of that, Gone Girl ranks among the directors better films.\n\nThe film (and the book) unfolds across three very distinct acts. The first introduces us to Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and, through her diary, his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears mysteriously from their Missouri home. Signs point to a struggle, and while Nick spent a few hours of that day at the bar he co-owns with his twin sister, Margot (Carrie Coon), investigating detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are suspicious of the few hours he spent that morning alone at the beach.\n\nAs the days go on, news of Amy's disappearance goes national. She's the inspiration for a best-selling series of children's books, and as a result, she's collected a series of frightening admirers over the course of her life. But maybe none is as frightening as Nick, for the last line in her diary reads, \"This man may truly kill me.\"\n\nWhat starts as a luridly entertaining mystery becomes more layered as narrators and protagonists reveal themselves to be liars and manipulators, and anyone familiar with Gillian Flynn's novel (she also penned the screenplay here) will appreciate David Fincher's way of conveying all of this cinematically. Yes, as is almost always the case with adapted material, some context is lost in translation, but Fincher and Flynn add to the latter's text by rooting everything in a place resembling the real world. It's still wild, fantastical pulp, but Gone Girl the novel took place on another planet. By toning down all but a few exclamation point scenes, Fincher's film is more sinister and haunting.\n\nBen Affleck is perfectly used as Nick. It's not a particularly flashy performance, but neither is the role. Rosamund Pike, for all intents and purposes, gets the chance to play several different characters-all of which are done to near perfection. Like the film as a whole, she does a wonderful job of conveying all aspects of Amazing Amy while still grounding her very much in the real world-a task I thought impossible.\n\nAmong the supporting cast are a bunch of actors whose performances range from good (Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens) to great (Tyler Perry). However, one falls completely flat. Neil Patrick Harris never finds Desi Collings, which renders a few key scenes flatter than they ought to be.\n\nBut Fincher's handle on his craft is as strong as ever. Gone Girl is the best-edited film so far this year (kudos Kirk Baxter, who's won two Oscars for Fincher films and does career-best work here), and its shot by Jeff Cronenweth to perfection (suburbia has never felt so menancing). The score from usual Fincher composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is more subdued than their last few collaborations, but its startling punctuation marks are simply perfect.\n\nThe film does rely a lot on its plot machinations, but not so much that it's void of anything thematically meaningful. Maybe it's that marriage is hard work, as one character remarks. That's certainly the case, but what stuck out to me more after the lights went up was a quote from another character: \"You are the most fucked up people I've ever met.\"\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/gone-girl-review/",

Fincher slow-plays this all tremendously, shaping the narrative and the incredible nature of the scheme through stylish visuals and sharp dialogue.\nNothing is ever what it seems in a film such as this, and the conclusion will leave your head spinning, wondering how, after all the events, it could possibly end that way.

Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? \n\nDavid Fincher\u00b4s \"Gone Girl\" digs into the dark psyche of marriage and the ideology behind this union, presenting a twisted story of the so called reported crime and the planning of it. I haven\u00b4t red Gillian Flynn\u00b4s book as I normally don\u00b4t go for bestellers, but since David Fincher is one of my favourite directors I wanted to see it. Fincher works his magic, but he still doesn\u00b4t go all the way like he did with \"Seven\" and \"Fight Club\". Ben Affleck is not too bad as Nick (yet way too one-dimensional), but fantastically upstaged by Rosamund Pike as the borderline psychotic Amy. While Neil Patrick Harris is completely miscasted as Desi Collings. The man cannot play anything else than Barney Stinson. However, despite the technical groundwork from Fincher and the excellent performance from Pike, the story has huge plot holes and the logic goes out the door the minute Amy \"disappears\". The portrait of the two sexes is so stereotypical it hurts (could write an essy on it) and to be frank quite ridiculous and there\u00b4s way too many scenes that just doesn\u00b4t add up. The end is as well mind boggling as Nick gives their marriage another chance despite murder, mayhem and full on psychotic behaviour from Amy which he is aware of. By then the film shows itself to truly not be in its own right mind.",

The fact it's gotten such great reviews from professional journalists may be an indication of how terrible US movies have become. Compared to the latest superhero movie maybe it looks great.",

A lot about Desi was missing among other things.  I often find this with good books which do not transfer well to the screen, because so much is cut out due to time constraints and cutting or changing of characters.   I found the same thing with The Bone Collector, which was an excellent book but disappointing film.  People who have not read the books may still think the films are good, which they are, but when you have read them it is disappointing.  In The Bone Collector by Jeffery Deaver they changed the sex and nationality of some characters.  In Gone Girl the Tanner Bolt character was white and his wife a beautiful statuesque black woman, but she wasn't in it at all, and the same applies to Desi's mother.",

The film is both a whodunit thriller and some sort of social commentary on marriage and the media. Tonally, it swings between satire and straight drama and never quite finds its groove. The POV shifts provide the film with its major twist (arguably its greatest selling point) but also throw audience identification with the primary protagonist.\n\nAs you'd expect with a David Fincher film, production values and performances are strong. Affleck is convincing as the disaffected writer and husband. Pike is perfectly luminous and loathsome. Carrie Coon is fantastic as Nick's straight-talking sister Margo, as is Kim Dickens as the detective investigating the case, Sela Ward as a journalist and Tyler Perry as Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt.\n\nDespite all of this as the film nears closer to its very drawn out conclusion it tends to get more and more disappointing. Established narrative expectations are not delivered on. That would be fine if the direction taken made sense but you find yourself saying, 'Seriously?' Tyler Perry's character Tanner Bolt is given substantial build up before he enters the story but ultimately has a very insignificant role to play before exiting stage left. Believable character motivation flies out the window and coupled with some rather significant logic flaws the film's resolution comes across as forced commentary rather than natural conclusion.\n\nUndoubtedly the novel is able to fill in the missing character details to make more sense of where this story ends up but without them the film may start out strongly commanding intrigue and involvement but by the end its allure is simply gone.",

            "content": "Featuring great and outstanding performances from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike combined with intelligent storytelling and taut suspense Gone Girl is by far one of the best films to date and is also one of David Fincher's best films to date since The Social Network and his second feature film Se7en. Based on the popular Gillian Flynn novel of the same name Gone Girl deals with the story of the Dunne couple Nick and Amy who are in a rocky and troubled marriage. On the day of their anniversary Nick finds his wife has been kidnapped from their very own home and soon he decides to lead a search party with the help of a bunch of police officers as well. But soon the police are suspicious about Nick and Nick soon becomes the suspect of his wife's kidnapping and Nick also soon learns the true nature of his wife and that she's planning to have him arrested by the cops and Nick must find a way to deal with his situation before he ends up in prison. I finally had the chance to watch Gone Girl after reading the novel and of course reading all the positive reviews from critics and audiences. To my surprise, I was like wow! Gone Girl is one of the best films ever made and I truly appreciate the work done by screenwriter and novelist Gillian Flynn including some support and outstanding directing by director David Fincher. I'm seriously not kidding when I said that this is Fincher's best film to date because it really is. It is my third favorite David Fincher movie with the first being The Social Network, second is his outstanding dark crime thriller Se7en and fourth is his new adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I admit I read Dark Places first and then I watched the film adaptation of Dark Places since Dark Places is Gillian Flynn's second novel and Gone Girl is her third book and I love how it was adapted into a movie I enjoyed Dark Places whodunnit Mystery Thriller style including its grotesque and dark tone. But with Gone Girl it is a huge surprise. Like the recently released Dark Places, Gone Girl was really different. Gone Girl was different in terms of tone, themes, suspense and execution and I truly believe Fincher did it in a believable way. Anyways, let's get on with the review. What I like about Gone Girl is that this film is very intriguing from start to finish in its overall length and pacing. I was totally shocked and surprised with how the film  goes. Because in the first half it starts out as a missing person's movie until in the next half it goes into a psychological territory done in a grim and darker way because the movie will keep you guessing a lot from start to finish and it creates a lot of mysteries and it also gives the overall film a creepy vibe. One of the other things I like about Gone Girl is that this movie is also faithful to the source novel and I was pretty surprised to how faithful the movie was and it didn't disappoint at all despite a few changes from the book since there are only a few changes from the novel(a few characters missing like Desi Collings' mother, Hilary Handy and several scenes like Andie biting Nick in the neck, tensions between Amy's parents on Nick) but nevertheless the film still has the mystery and creepy feel. I also love the gorgeous settings of the film and it gives the film the feeling of how someone suffers from a bad day in their everyday life it has that sense of feeling of stress, loneliness and isolation at the same time. The other things I like about Gone Girl is that the movie is also packed with several scenes that are tense and unexpected in times even though it isn't as tense as the book(The scene where Nick shoves his wife, the motel scene where Amy gets robbed by Jeff and Greta and the super gory climax where Amy kills Desi Collings) plus I love the cinematography of Fincher collaborator Jeff Cronenweth(One Hour Photo, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) which gives the film a haunting feel at the same time. I also love the film's themes and tones and the film's tone is very haunting and dark while the themes of the film about how most evil women can be manipulative and daring towards their husbands along with husbands cheating on their wives and of course how social media threats affect a person's life makes you think about the situations that could happen in your life when you marry someone who is manipulative and very psychotic creates a sense of fear, tension and suspense and it also makes you think twice about life as well since Dark Places deals with themes about murder, troubled teens, teen pregnancy and pointing your finger at someone who you think committed the crime is very different to Gone Girl's themes and both themes are very haunting and dark because the themes in both Dark Places and Gone Girl shows the dark side of an individual's personality and how he/she can do something really bad that can cause many people to hate and point the finger at the one who is a perpetrator at first but is actually innocent in real life its by far one of the creepiest things in film history. But the film has two real main highlights. The first thing I really like about this movie is that the film's soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who are Fincher's collaborators from Fincher's The Social Network is very haunting, dark and in times dramatic as well which fits in the overall tone of the film. I love how the soundtrack range from being very light in scenes where Nick wakes up in the morning to visit his twin sister Margo to very dark when tensions surrounding Nick being the prime suspect of his wife's disappearance is absolutely amazing and in my honest opinion the soundtrack felt that it was composed more by M. Night Shyamalan's collaborator James Newton Howard because the melodic vibe of the soundtrack is so dreamy and haunting in times and it works really well. Now the acting is the second main highlight of this movie. All of the casts did a very good job with their performances in this movie from Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex boyfriend Desi Collings to Scoot McNairy as Tommy O'Hara Amy's other ex boyfriend. But out of all the casts Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are the real stars of this movie. Both of them deliver the best performances in both of their careers. They both did a very good job in portraying Nick Dunne and Amy Elliot Dunne respectively. Plus they are perfect for the two main characters in the book and they match the description of the characters of Nick and Amy in the novel and I look forward to what these two will do next. Director David Fincher did an amazing and perfect job with his work on this movie and the same can be said to screenwriter and novelist Gillian Flynn and Gillian Flynn did a very good job with adapting her third successful novel into the big screen and David Fincher managed to raise the bar up even higher by turning the screenplay into a dark, twisted and haunting movie combined with surprising performances from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and I truly can't wait to see what David Fincher will do next as well. Overall Gone Girl is a superb adaptation of Gillian Flynn's successful novel that delivers lots of haunting moments, thrills, some creepy moments and is entertaining at the same time. This movie gets a 10/10.",

Armed with a cast that has bought in and a plot that is, for the most part, as intelligent as they come, he puts out a very solid work.\n\nBen Affleck has never impressed me much as an actor, but he does the job and more here as Nick Dunne, the beleaguered husband of the missing \"Amazing Amy.\" Rosamund Pike might be even better as the mysterious and intelligent wife of Nick's. Neil Patrick Harris also offers a good performance.\n\nMy only problems with Gone Girl were how I didn't really like any of the characters. It should be noted that plenty of films have unlikeable characters, but it was hard to root for anyone in this psychological thriller. This is a small nitpick though. Go see Gone Girl if you want something heavier than your normal comedy.",

            "content": "UNRELIABLE NARRATOR. From 10/05/2014. Gracie and I went to see Gillian Flynn-written (both novel and screenplay) and David Fincher-directed \"Gone Girl\" yesterday. I recommend the film, number one in the box office this opening week. Better yet, please consider reading more about it, and I recommend rottentomatoes.com, which provides links to reviews by critics.\n \n\"Gone Girl\" is a 432-page novel (2012) and a 149-minute film (2014). It is about a couple about to celebrate their wood (fifth) wedding anniversary when the wife goes missing. It is about the relationship of a couple of unreliable narrators whose marriage seems ideal and idyllic and is anything but. It is about the media circus and us the invested spectators whose opinions on everything must count, but don't. In short, \"Gone Girl\" is a satire about our sick society. This is the world of NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) sickos, and we only live in it and are bemusedly shat at.\n\nIf newsmaking one percenters have NPD, we the 99% people have ADHD (attention deficient hyperactivity disorder). We follow the bouncing ball, entertaining the thought we need always to be in tune, without questioning who put that song we couldn't get rid of in our head. Being attuned and amused becomes more important than paying attention to what's really important.\n \nAnd, so, we read a book and watch a movie about a couple who are \"so cute I want to punch us in the face.\" When their private lives are opened for public consumption, no thanks to the media and social networks, we take sides, play the partisan game, and inform the world of our opinion as though it matters -- and we matter: NPD by osmosis.\n \nFlynn and Fincher shoehorn the narrative to fit the screen. Do we really care about the ecstasy and agony of another couple? Well, the ecstasy part, maybe in porn; but don't we have angst and anger of our own? Which, of course, we can't control. So, we check out how other people live. And we invest in their well-being. At the expense of ours. Which is more important.\n \nGeorge Orwell said: \"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\"\n \nJim Morrison: \"Whoever controls the media controls the mind.\"\n \nAllen Ginsberg: \"Whoever controls the media, the images, controls the culture.\"\n \nGary DeMar: \"Whoever controls the schools controls the world.\"\n \nAnd Chris Claremont: \"Whoever controls the narrative has the power.\"\n \nFlynn and Fincher give us the narrative. It's a matter now who has control of the discussion. Or, is our world and society so corrupted and distracted that discussion is out of the question? The reliably controlled narrative is the new normal, and we just have to live in and with it, BS and all.\n \nPlease take great care of yourself, everyone, and thank you for all you do. Love, Mel & Gracie",

            "content": "No one would blame you if you approached David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best seller Gone Girl with a bit of trepidation. In most cases a hugely successful book turned into a movie leaves its faithful audience with the feeling of \"Did they even bother to read the book?\" It is a relief to report that Gone Girl doesn't have that problem. Fused with a cinema artist's great skill and a screenplay that is as tricky and fearless as its source material, this turns out to be one of the best films of the year.\n\nIt was a difficult book to translate. Gillian Flynn concocted a brilliant and complex pot boiler that seemed to move in at least five different directions, shuffling a dozen different characters around like pieces on a chess board. In terms of narrative, it walked the knife-edge, veering close to becoming convoluted but never losing focus. The movie works just as well as the book (and in some ways better), and the fact that the author wrote the screenplay - which I always champion - is probably the reason why.\n\nGone Girl is a complex story that opens one way, and then turns another way before turning into something completely different. The story is all about perspectives sprung from the story of a marriage that never should have happened in the first place. We meet Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a college professor who, years ago, married Amy (Rosemund Pike) and was happy as long as their marriage was padded with money and hot sex. Then the recession hit and they both found themselves out of work. Without the cushion of surface comforts, it is revealed that their marriage was as joyful as a cupcake made of arsenic. The mask hiding the bitterness in their union is seen by everyone else as a match made in Heaven.\n\nThen one day Nick comes home and finds Amy missing. There some broken glass and an overturned ottoman in the living room. There's some drops of blood on the kitchen cabinet. All curious, but the cops seem more interested in Nick's demeanor - he seems more irritated than upset. The case becomes a community effort to find the young woman and then blows up into a national media frenzy. The whole country begins to wonder if Nick might be involved in her disappearance. Was he beating her? Was she pregnant? Was he cheating on her? The answers to all of these questions ultimately have at least five or six answers. Nothing in this story is ever as it seems.\n\nMore of the story I cannot reveal without giving too much away. This is a complex story despite its simple premise. It's one of those fun thrillers where you're constantly second-guessing what is happening - just when you think you've figured it out, the screenplay peels back another layer and the mystery of Amy's disappearance gets more and more bizarre. What starts as a singular idea spirals down and down and down, opening more doors yet somehow all connecting them together. This is one of the most sadistically brilliant thrillers in a long time.\n\nIt is appropriate that Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher whose films always seem be about ordinary people who, through circumstance, find themselves in the sadistic arena of inhumanity. This was the theme of Fight Club, Se7en, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Zodiac, The Game and Panic Room. Fincher never stoops to making his characters likable, and in Ben Affleck he's found the right actor to play Nick. Affleck is not afraid to look like a jerk and we admire him for that. He's cocky, yet there's something about his questionable union with Amy that gives us a measure of sympathy for him even when his guilt seems to be staring us in the face.\n\nAffleck shows the strain of a man who slowly begins to realize that he is married to a woman that he never really knew, and begins to come apart at the seams under scrutiny from the cops, his sister, the media, Amy's parents, the public, and his own attorney. Everyone has a perspective on the case; everyone has a point of view that makes Nick look guilty of something no matter whether he's done anything wrong or not.  This may be the timeliest film of the year.",

Where is that guy that leaved me shocked in Seven, where is the guy that kept us all puzzled in The Game? I don't even want to mention Fight Club, masterpiece that is on the list of best movies I've ever watched. All positive critics on this movie makes me feel sad about the world where this piece of pure mediocrity makes such hype.

It's directed by Fincher with a rather loose hand, which allows for a certain casual ebb and flow as it works its way through the source material. The first half is set up as a mystery, while the latter half works as a thriller. All of this is a good thing in the hands of Fincher. \n\nIt is a dark and twisted story, and one that only gets seemingly more twisted as it goes on towards its unsettling conclusion. Affleck gives us another understated performance that is perfectly suited for the pace and nature of the film. He brings a layed back presence to a character that is not so much about depth as it is about embodying the twisty nature of the story itself. Pike, who plays opposite Affleck, is even more involved with her character (as the girl gone missing), and in a lot of ways the story hinges on her performance. \n\nThis is more of a directors film than it is an actors one. And I have no doubt that Affleck brought some of his perspective to the table on this end as well. And to be fair, it does take its own madness almost too far (considering where it begins as an involved mystery of who did it/what happened). When the mystery is revealed halfway through the story then has the freedom to evolve and explore different avenues of incredulity. Along the way it does elevate itself above the confines of a recognizable and realistic commentary on the romantic relationship, but it never does fall completely off the edge, coming across as more of ingenious net of complex schemes and plots rather than simply a preposterous idea regarding relationship woes.",

It was, of course very well made from a cinematic perspective. I knew it was dark, but I did not realize how darkly funny it would be. I was pleasantly surprised at the humor throughout. It feels weird to call it a dark comedy, but it kinda was. \nWhen the film started, something felt off - I thought the dialogue was forced and the acting was robotic. That was a brilliant direction choice by Fincher as I look back on it - that was purposeful for reasons I do not want to spoil. It was supposed to make me feel that way.",

It is a good thriller and it is perfect in almost every possible way. I really love the female character played by Rosamund Pike. She really convinced me that she is an evil incarnate. I also love Ben Affleck and Neil Patrick's performance. This movie get me to think about the true meaning of marriage. Do you really think you know about the person who sleep beside you every night? Obviously Nick Dunne of this movie don't know all about his wife like he thinks he does. I believe they really love each other at the first several years of their marriage. But as the sweetness and passion of love wear off, they begin to realize that the person they married is not the person they used to love anymore. Amy think Nick is lazy and Nick find Amy to be mean and boring. But Nick still thinks that they can go on with their life even when there is no love between him and Amy. He is terribly wrong. After Amy finds out that he is having an affair with another woman, she become furiously angry and come up with a evil plan to fake her death and frame Nick for it. She thinks Nick deserves to go to prison for being dishonest to her. Nick, on the other hand has no idea what is waiting for him when he wakes up on their anniversary. when he come home later that day to find his wife missing, he is confused and reports Amy's disappearance to the local authority. The police come and he is very cooperative at first. But when all the evidences point to him, he finally realized that he is being framed. In my own perspective, though Nick is the victim, I think neither of them is innocent. Their irresponsible and selfish behaviors killed Desi Collings and wasted a lot police resources which could be put into good use. The ending was really shocking. I can't believe Nick still decides to live with Amy after everything. A lot of people think it is unrealistic, but I think it is also irony. It's just a movie, it doesn't have to be like real life all the time. I think the movie is just trying to tell us that in real life there are a lot of couples like Nick and Amy who go on with their marriage even when it is just full of unhappiness, dishonesty and resent.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for any mistakes in my English.",

It begins on the day of the fifth anniversary of a young couple, Nick and Amy Dunne. Nick, played tremendously by a superb Ben Affleck, who comes home to find the living room in disarray and his wife Amy, played by Rosemund Pike, in an amazing star-making performance, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, is missing. The mystery ignites a media frenzy and suspicion falls on Nick. The police detectives on the case, well played by Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit, are worrisome about Nick's abnormal reaction to his wife's disappearance. He doesn't seem to know much about his wife, and he seems like he's hiding something. Even Nick's twin sister Margo, played terrifically by Carrie Coon, has her doubts that Nick is telling the full truth. Amy's diary however paints a different portrait of her husband, a man prone to increasing anger, mostly stemming from the loss of his job, and a relocation from New York City to Missouri. Most of Nick's anger is focused squarely on Amy, enough that she fears for her life, and is looking to buy a gun. As various clues keep piling up and Nick's public behavior appears more and more suspicious, the media spotlight transforms him from victim to prime suspect. It soon becomes clear that not everything is as it seems, and it's probably safe to say that the story's controversial resolution will shock a large portion of the audience, and anger the rest. It is a magnificent thriller, thanks to David Fincher's meticulous direction, and the exceptional supporting performances by Neil Patrick Harris, David Clennon, Lisa Barnes, Missi Pyle, Emily Ratajowski, Sela Ward, Loia Kirke, with special kudos to Tyler Perry, for his wonderfully impressive turn as the defense lawyer Tanner Bolt. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is striking, and the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is sensational. One of the year's best and most entertaining films, a total triumphant. Highly Recommended.",

Gone Girl is enthralling for the first hour. Really well acted by Affleck and Pike and Fincher doesn't disappoint in his use of suspense. \n\nHowever, and there is a big but coming. The way the story unfolds is not only implausible but almost ludicrous. Discreet veils are drawn over several unanswered questions. Questions that would be asked and answered in the normal world.  Here however they deal with it in one scene where everyone resides not to do anything about it. \n\nIt seems as if the expected ending couldn't be used simply for that reason, that you'd expect it and trying to be clever is better.

As the police investigate, the skeletons come out of both Nick and Amy's closets, and the tide of public opinion grows in scale over the film. The plot really gets going with a twist about halfway through, and it really fleshes out the character of Amy, creating a very gripping narrative.\n\nDavid Fincher has cast this film very well. I warmed up to Ben Affleck over the movie, despite my initial trepidation. Similarly with Rosamund Pike, I was more and more impressed as the film progressed. Neil Patrick Harris, while great, was underused, and Carrie Coon was excellent as Margo. Kim Dickens did very well as the main detective, and even Tyler Perry gave a commanding performance as the high-powered lawyer.\n\nThe slow start is a knock against the film, and I didn't feel totally satisfied with the ending.

            "content": "I'm not exactly sure what to think of David Fincher as a director. Two of his movies I thought had poor endings the first time I saw them: Fight Club and The Social Network. On second viewing I loved Fight Club, kind of giving the ending a pass, and liked Social Network the second time I gave it a chance, still unsure of the ending. Now after viewing these movies a number of times I understand the significance of these endings, but do not believe they are great resolutions. For Gone Girl, the ending left me amazed and creeped out how the Rosamund Pike character won, but it doesn't make perfect sense that she got away with murder.\n\nI think some of the writing towards the beginning of the film is a little strange; I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's something \"off\" about it. This isn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but you know how Amy's life is improved upon through her parents' book series \"Amazing Amy?\" 1) Why would a book series about such a perfect girl be so popular, and 2) What kind of parents do that? As Nick states: a**holes do that.\n\nThe dialogue before they REALLY get into the investigation of Amy's disappearance is highly based in riddles, which are included when Nick and Amy flirt in flashback sequences. I mean I get that both of them are writers, but do they really need to be that smart all the time when they talk?\n\nLet me stray from negative criticism to say the sequence which reveals the twist of the movie is among the great sequences which Fincher has directed. In this \"montage\" of sorts, the music is on- point, Amy's internal thoughts revealed in voice-over is haunting as hell, and the editing is simply perfect.\n\nThe strongest aspect of this film is the performance Rosamund Pike gives by playing Amy - one of the most maniacal psychopaths I have ever seen on film. I am so glad she got an Oscar nomination for this film since she made me hate Amy so much - it's impressive when actors can get you to feel extremity of any emotion towards their character.\n\nFlaws in her not getting caught? There were cameras all over the house of the Neil Patrick Harris character that he said were recording all the time. I get that Amy fakes getting raped for the camera cleverly by biting the man's tongue and pulling down his pants so it looks like he is cleaning up after that as he exits. And I get that she poses for a camera like she was tormented. But what about the rest of the cameras in the house? Are we to believe they are only covering the perimeter of the house? Also, I forget why they can't get Nick to wear a wire around Amy - she prevents it once by talking in the shower, but is she going to be on guard the rest of her life? Highly unlikely.\n\nThe fact that they make it very hard to determine whether Nick murdered Amy or not before the huge twist in the film is brilliant, making the end of act 1 and most of act 2 very strong, though the film has a weak opening and a flawed - but extremely creepy - ending. The mystery aspect and Pike's performance make this a very strong film, but it could have been improved if some content was cut and the film was more of a character study.",

            "content": "Director David Fincher is undeniably the master of misdirection and psychological thrillers; he has performed his magic countless number of times\u00e2?\u00a6 Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room, and that are just to name a few! Such a visionary whose latest film Gone Girl only elevates his position as one of the world\u00e2??s best directors. Gone Girl plays to his overriding strengths and delivers the opening and perhaps unconquerable film of the winter cinematic season.\n \nA mystery/crime film that on its own elevates itself into primarily the category of a psychological thriller. Gone Girl parades the disappearance of Amy Dunne and the catastrophic effects of this on her husband Nick Dunne who is then cast into the limelight as the perpetrator of her vanishing. It is dark and disturbing, and will leave you gasping for respite at the sickening events that unfold, as you will feel inconsolable shock that the plot\u00e2??s turn of events even occurred. Gone Girl has the best plot twist to appear on screen in a while. It takes you to the most sinister, gloomiest places of the anthropological being; and that place is an intriguing area, yet it breeds a sort of malevolence that will leave you questioning the potential of humans\u00e2?\u00a6 It is that agitating! The only other film in recent memory similar to Gone Girl is 2010\u00e2??s Shutter Island as both leave you guessing until the end, and when the end arrives you just will not expect what comes your way.\n \nThe film uses heavily the main protagonists as unreliable narrators as everything seems hollow, deceiving and meticulously planned to be one step ahead of you. You want to come to a judgement about the proceedings but you cannot prove it because in truth you do not know anything. This is because the characters appear dark and unresponsive, hiding their true persona under a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that is so sinister to even comprehend. The film\u00e2??s structure divides the plot into segments of unreliable narration creating an extremely intimate yet deceiving film. It lures you in with lies and you know that, but you cannot figure out what the purpose of Amy Dunne\u00e2??s disappearance really is for.\n \nPermeating through the structure of the film is the Fincher-esque suspense he has come to define in his own cultivated unnerving style. The suspense delivers in bucket-loads through so many different ways. Most intriguingly is the sound, which adds to the tension further that you expect at any moment for things to boil over. The sounds are eerie, heightening in volume and intensity until it mirrors your own palpitating heartbeat and suddenly cuts. Sound is presented as a cycle, intensifying until the chapter boils over giving you an interval for the next disclosure.\n \nThe themes of dishonesty, unreliability, media representation and economy are prevalent during the film thus making it more affecting as it deals with aspects of life that everyone can associate with. The overriding theme of marriage incorporates all the other themes under its name and presents marriage as a corrosive junction where two people intertwine themselves in a spiral of dishonesty and facades.\n \nLondon, Hammersmith-born Rosamund Pike makes up one half of the couple and this film marks a turn in her career as one of the freshest actresses around with a performance that will leave you mesmerised and shocked. She is not afraid to really let herself go in some scenes and therefore her character, Amy Dunne, will be one day on lists for the greatest female characters to appear on screen. Ben Affleck\u00e2??s Nick Dunne makes up the other half, and he is perfect for the role. He has a \u00e2??villainous chin\u00e2?? and a cold face that looks like he is hiding something. His character is universally presented as the person of concealment and doubt as the film\u00e2??s trailer dictates to you who you should watch out for\u00e2?\u00a6 but this could be misleading, as nothing should be trusted. You go on a journey with both the characters that your initial perception of the characters is completely abolished and transformed into sentiments so otherworldly by the conclusion of the story. In essence, Fincher presents Gone Girl as one big magic trick\u00e2?\u00a6 and boy does it amaze!\n \nGone Girl is perhaps the biggest mind-fuck of the decade. The extraordinary Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike leave you distressed and shaken at the disturbing sequence of events that unexpectedly shatters the comfort of your psyche.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        10/10",

I often wondered how we were at the climax so soon and what will they have more in store for me. You might think that the story is far fetched but it would surprise to say that I know characters (no spoilers ;-)) who would have acted in the same way if only they had the skill.\n\nOn the technical side..\nWhat really  makes the film so good is the amazing mystery story and the pace it unravels at.

Days go by and clues start to point to foul play by Nick, but who really knows? I'm not sure if it was just me, but having not read the book I was clueless as to the fate of Amazing Amy, constantly being pointed in different directions by the film. Blown around like a whirlwind on what could have possibly happened, who could have done it? The film has a slightly extended run time of 145 minutes but for the most part I was so intrigued by what was going to happen - the time flies by, especially after the introduction of the plot has passed and you are stuck in the depths of the mystery.\nThe depiction of the media was great in how it provides a bias opinion while harassing the victims of the situation. It is also really interesting to see how the plot adopts the media into becoming a key player affecting future events of the film. Most of the people in the film do pretty good jobs, even Tyler Perry, but the most outstanding was Rosamund Pike. She's of little fame besides small roles in films such as The World's End (2013), Die Another Day (2004) and Jack Reacher (2012), but Pike has finally been able to show what she can do in her role as Ben Affleck's wife, Amy Elliott Dunne. She really took the part and made it her own, so good in fact that I would nominate her for an Oscar. \nI can't see myself watching film over and over again, however the rare times I will see it again, it will be an excellent two and a half hours in which I will be lost in the mystery. The best word to describe the film is insane. I definitely recommend seeing the film as soon as possible as it is one of the best films of the year so far. Gone Girl is a brilliant mystery that will keep you enthralled even after you find out what happened.",

The genius provocateur has helmed such modern classics as Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Oscar nominees The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Add Gone Girl to the list. Adapting Gillian Flynn's smash best-seller, Fincher delivers Generation Y their very own Fatal Attraction, a portrait of a marriage gone horribly, horribly wrong.\n\n It's hard to write an adequate review with the film fresh in theaters as non-readers will want to avoid spoilers. NIck Dunne (Affleck) is married, mundane, and miserable in Missouri with a mistress, a deceased mother, a decaying father, a struggling business and Amy - Amazing Amy. She's a New York yuppie who's childhood was the basis for a series of best-selling children's stories. A minor celebrity and totally Type-A, Amy just can't help but expect more from Nick. But then one day, she goes missing, and he is the prime suspect in her disappearance.\n\n Fincher unfolds the twists and turns like a virtuoso with another haunting, electronica score by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and his collaborator Atticus Ross (Oscar winners for The Social Network score). Jeff Cronenweth's moody cinematography is trademark Fincher as always.\n\n Some may feel Affleck is too likable as Nick compared to the novel which the screenplay by Flynn herself does not depart from. But he delivers a great perf, one of the best of his career. And a star is born in Rosamund Pike. She makes Amy desirable, admirable and terrifying. \n\nDestined for box office sucess, the film is probably too cold-blooded to win the Oscar but it should be nominated in most major categories especially Pike who has to be the frontrunner for Best Actress for now. A competitive, exciting movie season awaits, and Gone Girl is a terrific start.",

The cinematography and editing create an expert sense of tension from beginning to end. Gillian Flynn (whose book I enjoyed tremendously) adapts her source material perfectly for the screen. She doesn't just write intriguing characters (Nick and Amy are gloriously and intelligently dysfunctional), but she also gives them rich dialogue and nifty vocabulary to work with. And finally, there's the cast. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris make for great ensemble members, and Ben Affleck is terrific as Nick. But in terms of casting, Fincher and Flynn hit cinematic gold with Rosamund Pike as Amy. She is calculating, psychotic, funny, clever, and all of those traits come accompanied with Pike's doe-eyed beauty, which proves all the more entertaining. Fans of the book will love what Fincher, Flynn and their cast have done with the movie. And those who haven't read \"Gone Girl\" (as long as no one spoils it) will love it too. It's another A-grade thriller from Fincher. What more could you ask for?",

You hate it because the film has a lot of anger and revenge. The dialogue is smart, no doubt same as for the previous Fincher films. But this film for me has no life at all. The story is 2 hours and a half, which is overlong to me. With some unnecessary scenes that needed to be cut. And it is one of those dark tone psychological dramas that has a great execution, but then it's not an easy watch for everyone. Gone Girl is not recommendable film yet Fincher wants to prove that he is one of the geniuses in film making. Here's a movie about how bloody your marriage can go. 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "No one ever said marriage was easy. But who ever said that probably wasn't married to the couple at the forefront of Gone Girl. That's not just some slogan that everyone throws around at a couple whenever things get tough, but it's also the driving force of the entire film. There are tumultuous times when two people have to want to work hard to make things work, and then there's this couple, a sure fire candidate for the worst cinematic couple of all time.\n\nIt's been a while since I was this consistently surprised, shocked and all around awe struck by a movie, but that's exactly what Gone Girl did. It's really something that needs to be seen to be believed and one should make quick haste to see it since it has one of the best twists I've ever seen. It will be hard to keep it under wraps given how social media is spoiler central.\n\nAdapted from a novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn in 2012, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is a bar owner in St. Louis who is preparing for his fifth wedding anniversary to his wife Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike). It starts off like any other day until Nick comes home to find the front door open, broken glass all over the floor and clear signs of a struggle. He can't seem to find his wife anywhere and Amy is only shown in flashbacks from her journal. But as shocking evidence turns up through a police investigation along with public and media scrutiny, Nick finds himself as the number one suspect for murdering his wife despite his constant pleas of innocence.\n\nReviewing this film is incredibly hard given how many surprises are in it, but a challenge I am more than willing to accomplish. Director David Fincher was already a legend in many people's minds and one of the best in the world at his craft with classics like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network. But here with Gone Girl, it reaches an entirely new level where his stamp clearly presents itself more so than ever. Fincher out does himself with his best film since Fight Club and one of the finest performances in any of his past films. Fincher's strong visual style, complex characters, enthralling plot and a dark satirical edge have always been standard for him. This makes all the more sense that he can adapt novels and short stories so well like Fight Club, The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. He has a great handle for the material divvying up the screen time well amongst the ensemble cast. \n\nFincher doesn't overload the viewer with information or make you feel bogged down by it all during its two and half hour running time. Everything felt liked it mattered where every nuance may reveal something about a character or the story. Even with its two and half hour running time, you want more. It's hard to leave this world that he created. Fincher is known for his brain melting twists, more so than wannabe M. Night Shyamalan, and packs in more twists that Fight Club, Seven, The Game and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo combined. How he managed to pack in so much without it turning into overkill is nothing short of unbelievable. Every twist was expertly managed to perfection where one will have to see it more than once to get that thrilling feeling again. This may be even more depressing than Seven and that's saying something given how bleak that ended. Few directors have it where seeing their films is an important event, but that's exactly what this is. It's something that you will want to tell your friends about months after it's gone.\n\nThe acting was amazing all around with every actor pulling their weight and contributing an impactful moment. Not one character felt left out or like it was on the outer rings waiting for their cue. But of course it's the leads that provide the meaty offerings and succeeding on all fronts. Ben Affleck has grown and matured in an incredibly competent actor over the years with his recent roles in The Town and Argo. But it's here as a married everyman that outshines his performances as a bank robber and CIA agent. Anyone doubting his acting abilities should eat their words if they already haven't already. With every performance, he is showing why he will make a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is more human and affable, able to relate on a more personal level. His natural charm and charisma shines through naturally. But it's his menace and dubious nature that really drive his performance home. He's a two sided coin, flip-flopping between personas showing how versatile Affleck really is. \n\nRosamind Pike on the other hand was nothing short of brilliant in one of the most shocking performances I've seen in years. It's hard to remember when I've seen a performance that dynamic and shocking with Pike quickly showing that she is a force to be reckoned with. Her narration from her diaries was incredibly well done. She has a great voice that expresses so many emotions without even having to see her face. Honestly I haven't seen her more notable performances but was aware of who she was. So I wasn't sure what I was getting with her, with Affleck I kind of knew what I was getting more or less. If she isn't nominated for a trove of awards while winning many of them come awards season, it would be one of the worst crimes in Hollywood. \n\nTogether Affleck and Pike had impeccable chemistry, acting like they really were married with every argument and declaration of love seemingly coming out of any married couple's living room. Alone they seem like generally nice people, but together you see that it's basically mixing chlorine and bleach. It's a joy to watch them go at it and I've never had so much fun peering into the intimate moments of a married couple's relationship on the brink of utter destruction. Whether they're throwing barbed wire laced insults or sharing the first romantic kiss, you don't want to look away and you don't want them to stop. Fincher has a great history of male/female tandems, most famously with The Narrator/Tyler Durden and Marla Singer in Fight Club. But Nick and Amy-Elliot Dunne is quickly becoming a classic movie couple that would terrify Sid and Nancy.\n\nThe cast was incredibly well rounded with various actors. Margo Dunn (Carrie Coon) was Nick's twin sister as well as co-owner of the bar. But quickly became more than that as the confidant to Nick during this harrowing time. Her despair while dealing with stunning revelations were real and touching, while showing she has just as much fight as Nick. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is the lead investigator on the case, showing a wise beyond her years demeanor, taking in every and all clues as they come up while holding all judgments on Nick until more substantial evidence. This runs counterpoint to her partner Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) who wants to arrest Nick outright despite having no real proof. They worked well together as a cop duo with some great work. Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) is Nick's attorney and was surprisingly good, given Perry's inclination for wacky comedies and wearing drag. He was a slick, smooth operator who knows all the tricks of The Game and how to erase doubt of even the guiltiest person. Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris), an ex-boyfriend of Amy's had some good moments too but nothing that meaningful.\n\nSome of my favorite parts were the dissection of the media, public opinion and reasonable doubt. It looks like shooting fish in a barrel but it plays an important part in the continuation of the story and toning down the overt subtitles would undermine what it's trying to say. Far too often loud mouthed, bobble head, cable TV idiot's act like the voice of reason whenever something shocking or horrible happens. They present the most outlandish scenario as truth without saying so while painting a picture of someone they don't even know. Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) and Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward) played the roles of polarizing cable TV show hosts to perfection, making you hate those types like Nancy Grace even more for even spreading that type of filth to idiots who eat it up. The circus atmosphere to hot media targets points to our inert obsession with reality figures and how our perception of them changes in an instant. It also shows that even though Amy's body was nowhere to be found and no evidence to say that he killed her, he is still pointed as the killer, by the public as well as the cops. It hardly matters to others that you're innocent until proven guilty, but just that it makes it easier to pin the blame on somebody.\n\nThe script was crackling with passion, fire and spite, all the things that make up every marriage. With something this emotionally complex, it only makes sense that the author of Gone Girl would write the script. Flynn has a deep love and understanding for the characters while giving them a believable script to take from. It was also surprisingly funny with its dark undertones and content. Fincher always has dark comedy present in his films. Sometimes you can't help but laugh at about things that you shouldn't. The views of a crumbling marriage may ring too true for couples as well as thinking about what Nick and Amy do to each other. Everything was said with such reverence and pop that gave everything a much needed feeling of stark reality. Whether it was the detectives scrounging for clues, the harried couple arguing or TV pundits debating, it was as if it was pulled from real life. Like Nick said when taken in to the police headquarters, \"This feels like an episode of Law And Order.\", then proceeds to do the classic tone.\n\nI love a good score so this was like a feast for my ears. Knowing that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross reteamed for another Fincher film made me so much happier. No one else can create these musical accompaniments like these two. And they continue their streak of Fincher scores with the best yet. It accentuated the drama, grief, excitement, and shocks like nothing else. It was equal parts haunting and beautiful where you wish it would go on for hours. It added so much depth to scenes, emotions and characters that the first kiss between Nick and Amy became so much more romantic and Nick finding out something awful that much for harrowing. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth was gorgeous as always, as it is a David Fincher film. I loved the slow, creeping camera getting closer in a shot. It paints everything like a stationary picture with figures moving in and out, creating a gloomy, creepy like atmosphere.\n\nOne of if not my favorite scene in the movie would have to be the montage halfway through the film. As a lover of montages, I would consider myself a connoisseur of sorts. With saying that, I could say that this was one of the greatest cinematic montages and sequences I have ever seen. Everything about it from the acting, direction, editing, music and cinematography was pure unabashed brilliance in the highest order. It comes out of nowhere and half way through it, I knew I was watching something special and had trouble keeping my jaw open. But everyone will be doing that the entire film. That sequence alone should be enough for Gone Girl to garner multiple awards.\n\nNot much more needs to be said about Gone Girl as it heads the awards season as the first official classic. It may be superfluous, but this is one of the most exciting, unpredictable thrillers I've seen. The ending, as is to be expected, is the most telling part. It comes full circle and ends exactly where it needs to.  There is nothing that can prepare you for the mayhem one will witness and is a ride worth taking more than once. Treated as somewhat of a horror story for those who aren't married, it captivates all those who enter while mercifully beating them into submission, refusing to release anyone from its cold, steely grip. Sometimes it's good to realize when it's really over and be single, now I see Nick and Amy wish they'd have done the same. Five spousal murders out of five.",

Gone Girl is certainly one of his darker films. The themes and plot events are twisted and effective in many ways, as the audience will most likely be uncomfortable with the images on screen. Specifically, scenes involving Rosamund Pike's character's plans and the lengths the character will go to to get what she wants. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, and although I've not read the book, he plays the role well. However, Affleck pales in comparison to Rosamund Pike's Amy Dunne, who is mesmerizing and extremely convincing in playing an insane woman. Tyler Perry surprisingly plays Tanner Bolt admirably, but the weakest link here is Neil Patrick Harris. In short, NPH's scenes are cringe-worthy, and it makes you wish for a more limited role by Harris. Overall, Gone Girl is a intense and dark tale and will affect all audiences with its gruesome plot and extended scenes of brutally real, equally frightening violence, and it's strangely enjoyable. 4.5 out of 5.",

Ben Affleck may be responsible for the disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike).  He arrives home to find the door open, some furniture over-turned, and her gone.  Of course, Affleck becomes the number one suspect (because, really, he is that type of guy).  However, if we are encouraged to consider Affleck's perspective, even in the face of possible domestic violence, are we also asked to blame the victim? Fincher seems to indulge in the same kind of shenanigans that Mamet once toyed with (in Oleanna; and perhaps Hitchcock too), getting us to identify with the probable or stereotypical guilty party. So, is it a misogynistic film, if it explores the victim's deservingness even as it raises awareness about family violence?  There is no easy answer but still I say yes.  Aside from any potential value still remaining for film to tell us how bad the media's three ring circus has become, the film serves only to reinforce some people's negative beliefs about some women   But then again it is only a film and quite gripping for most of its tawdry length.",

During my one trip to the cinema that week, Gone Girl was the film which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a real thriller with horrifying scenes making it almost a horror film itself.\n\nI'm not going to spoil details of a plot which works best as a mystery, but the premise is that Midwestern everyman Nick Dunne (Ben Afflek) returns home one day (his fifth wedding anniversary no less) to find his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing media circus then throws Nick into suspicion.\n\nThe film's strength is its manipulation of the viewer. We follow and side with Nick initially; Ben Afflek plays him as fairly neutral, a blank slate. Maybe he's too passive in the face of his wife's disappearance. Is he guilty or does he simply not know how to react? He seems likeable enough, but there's something just behind it.\n\nDuring the first act the couple's relationship is told through flashbacks, incorporating segments of Amy's diary, and we gradually begin to side with her. These dual narrative strands are apparently from the original wildly popular novel by Gillian Flynn, who wrote the screenplay. We must be in safe hands.\n\nDavid Fincher, whose last film was the English-language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, retains something of the Nordic noir to Gone Girl. The film is full of darkness, sex and violence. Camera angles are sweeping and the scenery both bleak and beautiful. At the heart of the film is an exploration of humanity which is divisive and ambiguous.\n\nThough a long film, it is never boring. There was a point around halfway through when some kind of resolution seems to have been reached, but the film keeps going and the pace and intensity increases. Rosamund Pike's role increases as the story progresses and without giving too much away, her performance is powerful.\n\nRole and image are major themes. On some level, everyone is playing a part, deliberately projecting or hiding behind a facade. Amy has been fictionalised by her writer parents in the overblown, saccharine Amazing Amy books which she has never been able to live up to. She has a place in the public eye and this is why the press descends so rapidly on the case. \n\nAs the audience struggles to understand his psyche, Nick is struggling to appease the exploitative media. He hires Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), a lawyer specialising in image and defending suspected husbands. Perry's role is dramatic but played with a much needed balancing touch of humour. Of note too is Neil Patrick Harris's rare straight role as Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi.\n\nThe music, from serene yet ominous ambient soundscapes to throbbing electronica was composed by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and his producer Atticus Ross who have collaborated on Fincher's last two films. In keeping with the theses of this film, they have created a score which is simultaneously soothing and unnerving.\n\nI'll finish by acknowledging that there are some plot holes in the decidedly complicated narrative, particularly paper trails, alibis and the possible existence of exonerating security footage. Again, I won't go into too much detail, but at one point a detective begins to question such a hole but is quickly shot down.\n\nPresumably these details would come to light sometime later during the inevitable long investigation. The case ends far from closed. But the film is more than just the plot, which is nevertheless engaging. As a piece of film making, the themes, music and visuals remain powerful.",

On the other hand Rosamund Pike was dry and boring and she was the main character, I wasn't even concerned about her disappearance, she just didn't shine for me as a character. One flaw was after the plot was revealed it was easy to guess what would happen next. The ending however did catch me off guard. I found it to be unique but definitely not the ending I had hoped for.  \n\nNow, I am not at all saying it was a terrible film because it was great but I just wish they would've spaced it out a bit better, that's all! Overall, if you're a fan of drama and mysteries of give it a go! I did like it, hence my rating was more than half! It definitely kept me on my toes for the whole first half!

For those who read the book, it's easy to see that the film adaptation stays pretty close to the events that unfolded in print. Aside from the obvious strength of 'Girl,' being the plot, the two leads deliver award-worthy performances (Ben Affleck as confused husband Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as his missing wife, Amy). In fact, Pike was nominated for multiple awards, including an Oscar, for her portrayal of the deranged, vindictive woman at the center of a bizarre disappearance and media field day that ensues.\n\nAs we get further into 'Girl,' we get closer to the truth, but further apart at the same time. From a film perspective, some of the best scenes are those that are full of shock and surprise, but there are also some that are more subtle that really show the best parts of the story, where the human emotions that are true - and raw - are on display. Other supporting roles that are notable include Tyler Perry as Nick's defense attorney, Tanner Bolt, and Carrie Coon as Nick's trusting twin sister. Missi Pyle also does a fine job of being an annoying crime talk show host. And then in true Fincher fashion, there are lots of unique shots littered through the film. The soundtrack plays a crucial role in 'Girl,' as it has an underlying presence that makes everything seem that much more intense. Aside from the soundtrack and the acting, there are many different marks of a great piece of cinema, but again, it goes back to having a solid script and screenplay, which 'Girl' certainly does.\n\n'Gone Girl' is a great film, despite the fact that it explores some twisted, dark aspects of relationships, and will leave a lasting impression on cinematic history.",

            "content": "David Fincher has always been slightly left of centre. It's easy to see why he was so drawn to the Alien franchise in the beginning, with its gothic stylings and absolute subversion of sci-fi and horror tropes, and while Alien 3 didn't quite turn out the way anyone particularly hoped, Fincher has consistently chosen films which have found a way to play on our expectations in new and interesting ways. Se7en's finale, Fight Club's central premise, Zodiac's long and twisting narrative that just refuses to resolve itself to our timeframe; all of these and so many more examples point to exactly the kind of filmmaker that David Fincher has proven himself to be, and he revels in the chance to walk that tightrope with audiences.\n\nUp to a certain point in Gone Girl, I was initially confused by Fincher's choice of story here. It presents itself as a by the book thriller, and while it's executed in a downright pristine way with Fincher's work, it made absolutely no sense to me that the director who chose to direct The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would also choose to direct something I'd seen a hundred times before.\n\nAnd then of course he decides to rip the rug out from under everyone's feet.\n\nWhen Amy Elliott Dunne goes missing, her husband Nick is at the front of the search and the investigation, as he tries to find his wife and to keep the law from finding him guilty of her murder.\n\nIt's a twist that's not necessarily unforeseeable, but it's delivered with such relish by Fincher and the performers involved that it's difficult not to imagine them sitting amongst an audience seeing it for the first time just giggling at everyone's reactions. And it's a credit to Fincher's patience that the shock hits home as well as it does, as he calmly sets up the first third of the movie without any sort of hint of what specifically is in store for the viewer. The precision and clinical feel of Fincher's direction up to this point plays to the conventions of the genre in a way that also feels like it's really all the film has to offer. It's a clever way to set up a twist, as it has half the audience writing the film off as a by-the-numbers thriller up until a third of the way through the film. The later two-thirds feel like uncharted territory as a result, and Fincher plays with genre and their conventions in cleverly carefree ways; navigating thriller, horror, drama and comedy with the kind of ease that only a director with his kind of experience and confidence can. Every scene offers up something new and clever, and Fincher's dissection of each scene and the way he finds the layers beneath the film's outer surface brings a popcorn film up to some seriously impressive levels.\n\nThe main two characters of the film are Nick and Amy, and it's both impressive and unusual to see two characters written so well on each side of the story. Usually a villain is left too one-dimensional or a hero is just too bland for the story, but both Nick and Amy are layered, interesting characters, each of them with so much to do throughout the film's runtime. And each of them have their perfect human counterparts in Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck has been steadily building a new reputation for himself with The Town and his all conquering Argo, but both of those were directed by him as well, and it's interesting to see him in a role where he isn't directly involved in the behind the scenes processes of directing or writing on this one. He's fantastic as Nick, and not in the kind of way where you're thanking the stars that it's not another Daredevil, it's the kind of performance that demands a lot of its performer and where that performer is absolutely up to the task. Affleck is so many things in this film, often at once, and he manages to pull off the trick of being a sympathetic asshole; a man who's being slowly backed into a corner and trying desperately to avoid lashing out in case it's misinterpreted as the actions of a lunatic. You can feel the presence of electronic eyes in all of his performance, and the fact that a 24-hour news cycle can contribute to a man's innocence or guilt drives a lot of Affleck's ambiguity when it comes to pinning down just whether he's done the deed or not. The villainous chin so often referenced in the movie actually nails the idea of Affleck's character needing to be both a possible villain and a character you can root for, and Affleck nails it. But as good as his performance is, it's always going to play second fiddle to Rosamund Pike's breakout brilliance as Amy Elliott Dunne. She picked up the film's only Oscar nomination and it's no surprise, as she brings an effortless reality to a role that could so easily fall into caricature, finding humour and likeability in a role that can't have been easy to find any. She has so many different roles to play within this one character and it's fascinating to see the amount of information she can pack into one expression. There's a moment towards the end of the film when she stares down Kim Dickens' Detective which is so simple and so effective that it could be a summation of her character's entire role. But that would be limiting; her performance is so smart and has so much range that it's difficult to nail one defining moment. The supporting players elevate the performance beyond these two phenomenal leads as well, with Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon bringing brains and heart in their performances and Tyler Perry giving what is easily the best performance of his career.\n\nThe book's author Gillian Flynn adapted Gone Girl for the screenplay, and while I haven't read the book it's impressive to see the kind of detail and smarts involved in the script, as well as just how well balanced the entire movie is. It's paced perfectly, and the way it moves from section to section builds to some truly impressive scenes towards the end of the film. There are some fantastic quotes to find here and the recurring themes and quotes that Flynn plays with introduces an entirely new selection of phrases to the national lexicon. But mostly it's the way that these characters are handled and explored throughout the film that makes this screenplay so impressive.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross continue their fantastic collaboration with David Fincher and this score could be their best one yet, as they create a subtly rotting world of cotton candy in their tracks. You can feel the slight shift from normality to not quite there throughout the film and their contribution is a huge reason that the film works on these themes as well as it does.\n\nOccasionally a brilliant director can take popcorn entertainment and turn it into art. Spielberg did it with Jaws in 75 and Fincher has done it again with Gone Girl. It's a brilliant film that creates a new standard for the genre and a cultural phenomenon in the process.",

            "content": "Once disappeared. Now found. Here's my take on GONE GIRL (2014).\n\nThere have been numerous films that deal with the intricate facets of marriage; mostly set on a very positive tone. Sometimes the road leads to the unconventional yet entertaining or veers to the rudimentary yet real. But it truly fascinates me when it gears toward a sicker and more twisted approach that only exceptional directors can fully realize.\n\nOne notable example who's willing to take the driver's seat is Oscar nominee David Fincher. With the bold script from author-turned-screenwriter Gillian Flynn, Fincher takes us on a journey to the darker avenues of the so-called \"married life\".\n\nBen Affleck and Rosamund Pike play husband and wife (Nick and Amy Dunne) trapped in a life of ups and downs. Amid the game of bondage, Nick's life will turn into great degrees upon the disappearance of his better half. Trouble ensues. Deception surfaces. Madness arrives. And it gets darker from there.\n\nThis faithful adaptation of the best-selling novel stems from the team's vision of redefining everyone's thought on \"Marriage\"- IT'S NOT AS FREAKING EASY AS IT SEEMS. The film's never afraid to re-examine the very dynamics of human relationship and spew fires of the ugly truths that come with it.\n\nAffleck has greatly elevated his leading man status while Pike has finally become a household name. They are so effective that their onscreen chemistry can shift from likable to dangerous. The rest of the cast (from Neil Patrick Harris to Tyler Perry to Carrie Coon to Kim Dickens to Missi Pyle etc.) strongly supports from start to finish.\n\nWise decision indeed, Fincher relies on his highly formidable team- haunting music supplied by Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross / sharp editing maneuvered by Kirk Baxter/ and precise cinematography focused by Jeff Cronenweth- the same people who gave life to gems like \"The Social Network\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\".\n\nThis film is not to be missed. Just leave all the expectations at your door and enjoy the bumpy road ahead. Even if it means enduring a chaotic ride.\n\nSkull. Treasure Hunt. Wood. 5/5 folks",

There are several aspects of this story that I find incredibly intriguing and impressive. \nHowever, I do have two issues with it: \nA) I didn't enjoy either of the main characters (not the actors or their performances, but the story's characters), and therefore found it hard to care what happened to them.\nB) The pacing of the storytelling in the movie was too consistent. There didn't seem to be a climactic climb. Events and realizations tended to unfold very matter-of-factly which made the overall flow dry, adding to my feelings of the characters. \nAn excellent story that could have been tweaked for the sake of the hour-and-a-half movie model.",

We must bear in mind that Fincher movies are not easy to understand, therefore are not for everyone.\n\nBen Affleck is pretty convincing but nothing special, the real extraordinary fact of this picture is Rosamund Pike, definetly the best performance by an actress of 2014.\n\nThis deserves to be seen, since it makes us see that there are similar cases in real life and also makes us give us has it easy that we judge people who we don't know only by their attitudes to a camera.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but don't wait a happy ending because How many cases were completely resolved and in the right way?",

Gone Girl is a slap in the face to survivors and victims of domestic violence. This film perpetuates the narrative which abusers depend upon to control others through invalidation and gas-lighting. At its core, this film has nothing to say, nor original story it tell. By ignoring the overwhelming statistics of the number of women killed and then disappeared by their abusive spouses, Gone Girl sets the movement to end domestic violence back significantly. Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage. Both the filmmakers and actors are obviously incredibly talented, but this story is trash; boring, substanceless and offensive.",
