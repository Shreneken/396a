            "content": "BEE-PROUD \nReview\nA historical comedy-drama film Pride is a 2014 British LGBT-related film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus. It is the perfect film for those who want to watch a educative but also a super fun movie. The film was released on 23 May 2014 in Cannes film Festival and on 12 September 2014 in the United Kingdom.   \nI did admire the film so much because the film is political and tells a true story about gays and lesbians that support the miners. I can understand why this very beautiful story was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy and for the BAFTA for Best British Film, Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Imelda Staunton ( she was in the film a member of the strike committee), and for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.\nPeople who know about the British mine strikes will see that there is more than just a strike. The film \"Pride\" is about a shy gay boy who hasn't yet come out of the closet for his parents. He goes to London to study but meanwhile he also goes to the gay prides. The boy sees a group of lesbian and gays and joins them. This group is planning to start a campaign titled \"gays and lesbians support the miners\". With this campaign they want to collect money for the miners who are victim of stagflation and they have become poor as a consequence that they don't have a lot at home to eat. They wanted to donate the money that they have collected to a trade union. They often were rejected because they were gay but there was one union that did accept them but the citizens of the village didn't accept them. There will be a discussion between the two groups and after a blessing in disguise it is beautiful how it creates a bond between them.\nWhen I watched the movie with my friends I didn't know what the movie was about. I thought that it was a movie made for LGBTQ but it was more than that. It wasn't a movie for them only, it is also a movie you can watch with friends or with your class, you can even watch it with your family at home. This film can change your way of looking at gays, not in a sexual way, but in a way that makes you realize what they have to deal with.\nThe movie is political because it is about workers who stand up for their rights and are protesting on the streets. The film was excellent, it showed discrimination and how the prejudiced group learns that they made a mistake by judging. I also found it sad  for the boy whose parents didn't accept him because he was gay. I was watching the film worriedly about this boy, I wanted to know what was going to happen with him. All the ingredients of a feel-good film are present. The combination of moving elements, humour and personal development is reminiscent of films such as \u2018Billy Eliott' or \u2018The Full Monty', a list to which this film can certainly be added.\nPride is one of those rare films with content, entertainment and soul. It is also very funny but has also his sad parts. Some parts of the movie can really give you goosebumps or even a tear.I really did enjoy the film \u2018Pride'. We need more beautiful and learning stories like this one based on true stories with a successful cast like this one. The film was so powerful I held back from crying but couldn't resist the bittersweet tears of joy that were coming.",

A top-notch cast takes us on an odyssey across a country stricken by political upheaval and social unrest. I loved the parallels it made between miners fighting for their rights and the LGBT community fighting just to be accepted by a group they're trying to help but who offer nothing but insults and hostilities in return. Far from being a sombre, depressing affair, the movie is very uplifting and life-affirming, filled with slick humour and realistic characters. I felt that the Miner's town's acceptance of their new allies happened oddly fast for some members, and the lead character's abandoning of the group only to come back later is a very hackneyed plot twist, so much so that it's not even a twist anymore. But these little niggles did not hamper my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. The screenplay is witty and profound, the acting is excellent, its full of great character development and little subplots which all demonstrate how much of an impact the event had on those involved, its tender moments are never overdone and the tone is never oversentimental. It will bring even the stoniest of cinemagoers tears, and I say that anyone who has ever experienced even a sliver of discrimination should put this film at the top of their 'to-see' list.",

Those days seem like a different world and while we take the rights and acceptance won by the LGBT movement in the UK pretty much for granted and this movie is a timely reminder of just how hard won those rights were. This is most definitely a feel good movie and there is little illustration of the hardships faced by the miners who were on strike for so many months. However the movie has tremendous good heart and is told in a warm and humorous manner, with some genuine belly laughs along the way. There's a terrific ensemble cast headed by Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy who play the leaders of the village. The improbable alliance they form with the young gay activists is touching and inspirational and there really isn't much not to enjoy about this great little movie.",

It was a story that I had not heard of before. Director Matthew Warchus' was sure to bring some inspirational elements of the film on how two opposite polar groups can work together for civil rights and fair labor. But Warchus' was sure to implore us with the aforementioned concept a few too times to many; as worthy as the concept is. I am a big fan of 80's New Wave Retro music, so I was very proud of \"Pride\" to include some U.K. New Wave classics. The ensemble acting was commendable but not sensational; which included Ben Schnetzner as U.K. gay activist leader Mark, Dominic West as the flamboyant Jonathan, and Imelda Stanton as a Miner Committee Member. \"Pride\" is not the biggest pride film piece from the 2014 movie year, but it has enough activist gravitas to give it a shout.",

Tensions flared between an unsympathetic government lead by PM Maggie Thatcher and the National Union of Mineworkers on a long contentious strike.\n\nAt the annual Gay pride march in London, a group of passionate activists decide to show their solidarity for the miners plight by raising money and banding together to form the LGSM (Lesbian and Gay Support Miners).\n\nThe only issue, the unions are embarrassed to receive 'their' support. Unperturbed by initial rebuttals, the LGSM randomly selected the small rural Welsh mining town of Dulais and descend to show their staunch support, handover the money raised and break down conservative prejudicial barriers.\n\nTV actor Stephen Beresford's terrific screenplay is not yet another sorry tale of victimhood, but one of civil rights. His utterly compelling story is full of heart and conviction as well as tangible sense of the era allowing viewers to truly grasp the hopeless situation that was the 1984/5 strike.\n\nThe tapestry of emotions felt by those involved is wonderfully showcased through an outstanding to-many-to-mention cast whose comedic timing is only surpassed by their dramatic acumen, this really is a case where only the trademark British wit and restraint could pull of such an enjoyable cinematic experience.  \n\nThe verdict: A deserved crowd-pleaser down to its rousing finale.\n\nPublished : Canberra Weekly Magazine\nDate of Publication : 14/11/2015",

Despite the pinkwashing and sanitizing, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that everyone should watch.

            "content": "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this touching true story about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to raise money for the families of miners during the miners strike in London, when Margaret Thatcher was in power. As the movie was based around the 80's, there was a lot of prejudice against the gay and lesbian community but this movie shows how this group came together and fought against all odds, to raise the money for the Welsh people who were going through such a difficult time. The group also protested for Gay and Lesbian rights, at a time when Aids was the biggest fear for there community, so this movie is a big eye opener to a world which is the norm in today's day to day life. The storyline is great, along with the performances and the witty script which brought some light to a situation were a lot of people were struggling to come to terms with there sexuality. The real footage on the DVD was touching because a lot of the activists were actually in the movie and they get to tell there story of how it was to deal with the true situation. Anyway, it's a well made movie which tells a true story which hasn't been told before so it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nI've always been a fan of Bill Nighy's unique style of acting so I was glad to see him in this film, even though his role wasn't that big. The same goes for Dominic West who also had a small but important role in the film. Most of the rest of the cast have only had small roles in films so I can't really comment on there performances. Paddy Considine has starred in a few movies like the Bourne Ultimatum, Cinderella Man and Hot Fuzz but he's never played the main role. In this movie he played the go between the activists and the miners quite well but it was Dominic West's dancing which really impressed me. The other thing that impressed me was how a small group of people, who had weekly meetings, could have made such a big impact for there community. The amount of people that joined them in the end was touching and I'm glad that they changed a few laws after putting in such a big effort.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $14.7million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their powerful dramas about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to support the miners strike at a time when there sexuality wasn't that welcomed by many people. 6/10",

Then there are some films that deserve the hype and publicity that only ever get minimal, usually these films belong to a film festival and it's only through word of mouth that they make it to their intended audience. Pride is a film that was first released at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival winning a standing ovation and the Queer Palm award from there it went onto a limited release schedule mostly being involved in Queer Film Festivals around the world.\nPride is a true life story based around the British Miner's Strike in 1984, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and not very popular, not with miners and especially not with the gay and lesbian community either. Joe, a young na\u00efve closeted gay boy arrives in London to take part in his first gay pride march, soon after arriving Joe is taken in by a local gay and lesbian rights activist group who do their part to raise funds to fight their foe Thatcher and her evil ways. Soon after the group realise that both the Miner's and the gay community have a lot in common they make the decision to start raising funds for the families of the miners in a little Welsh town called Onllwyn. The miners reject the gay and lesbian activists money believing it will do more harm than good for their cause so the group unfazed but a little perplexed decide to take the money personally to the town to hand it over and explain their situation and hopefully form a new alliance against the countries Prime Minister and her party...\nPride is set in a very bleak and dark time of British history but I feel that it's never actually shown that way, sure things are dark and gray but I wish the director just added more hardship to his final edit for the film, not being a part of it personally but remembering how harsh it was from school study and other films I have seen over time. I don't think the film was shown as brutally honest as it should have been, from what I know of those days; they were horrid, times were rough and extremely hard, I just wish that it was portrayed a little more than what we were given. That is my only concern with the film, which says a lot I feel. None-the-less it is a fantastic well made, well directed and full of amazing actors that really bring the story to life, the story is really well scripted and the actors chosen in their respective roles have done an amazing job. Staring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Shaun of the Dead) as Cliff, Imelda Staunton (Maleficent, Vera Drake) as Hefina Headon, Dominic West (John Carter, The Awakening) as Jonathan Blake, Paddy Considine (Hot Fuzz, The World's End) as Dai Donovan, George MacKay (How I live Now, Peter Pan) as Joe \"Bromley\" Cooper who is one of the few fictional characters created for the film and a whole heap of others, it is actually a very great cast everyone did their part to make the film work. As I said earlier the cinematography of the film was good I just wish it was darker like the times it is set in. The director and his crew have done a great job with this film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus (Simpatico).\nPride is a feel good film with a fantastic story that can be shared with all your loved ones, there are a couple of scenes that may be a deemed a little over the top but perhaps you can use that to answer some curious minds if questions are asked. Pride is an amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for one great cause.",

            "content": "It's disconcerting when the news of your childhood becomes the historical movies of your adulthood. Pride did nothing if not confirm for me that I have officially hit middle-age. \n\nIt's a British comedic-drama about events during the Miners Strike in the UK of 1984 (I was 11, just about aware of what was going on in the wider-world). It focuses on two small communities: one is a small mining town in Wales of the sort that suffered most during that time. The other is a London-based group of gay and lesbian people who form LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners). They take on the small Welsh community as a project for which to fundraise. The film is that story, of unlikely friendships and culture-clashes. In tone it is closes to British comedies like The Full Monty or Brassed Off; an edge of social realism and a triumph of underdogs storyline. \n\nThere's some fine performances - Bill Nighy is at his understated best, drawing laughs at times without uttering a word; the comedic tone sits well with some serious themes of social distress and prejudice and it's hard not to leave the cinema without at least a small air-punch of satisfaction at the film's feel good narrative arc. \n\nIt's not without flaws though. Some things just seem a little too easy to be true; did they really, for instance, break into singing that easily in the minibus? At times the adventures of the London-based characters come off too much like a school outing rather than engaging with one of the biggest social issues of the day. More seriously is an overly romantic view of history. The miners' strike was a brutal and painful period of British history for all sorts of reasons, not least because it fractured families and communities. The film presents to us a picture of communities and towns united in their stand; I can't speak for the individual town in question, but the brutal reality of the strike is that it was opposed from within the community of miners as well as by the government. Members of families fell into bitter, lifelong dispute; strike-breakers were, and maybe still are, 'scabs'. All this because some felt they and their families couldn't pay the price of their families' well-being. It's tempting to, as the film does, to play the strike as a unified struggle; but it wasn't and it does a grave injustice to the complexity of real people in unimaginably difficult situations to pretend otherwise. \n\nNone of this detracts from the joy of the film; it should also be noted, though, that the nature of the film means that the humour is broader than The Full Monty (it really is); and sometimes that too (especially towards the end) seems a bit too easy to be true. The film also suffers slightly from Return Of The King-itis in that seems to have about three endings. By the time the last one rolled around I was ready for the film to actually end.\n\nIt doesn't outstay its welcome, though. The reservations are real, but not major problems.",

The film starts its narrative quite flamboyantly in the gay parade and quickly steers onto the thorny issue, to raise money for the UK miners who are under the same predicament where LGBT minority is, the mineworkers'  union starts a strike would last for more than one year.  \nkeep reading my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1Nw",

He is aided completely by his stellar cast, an ensemble of such character and nuance that maintain an element of sincerity even in the film's more formulaic segments.",

An unlikely true story of an unlikely alliance that's unlikely well done, Pride tells the plight of both striking Welsh miners and the hugely persecuted English homosexual community in equal and genuine measure. A heat-seeking crowd-pleaser, the film comes damn close to becoming mawkish without actually tipping over the edge. The climax, for example, assumes a tone that almost feels a bit too cheeky.almost. Regardless, the dynamite performances and rich storytelling always come across as truthful throughout this production, however manufactured it feels. You've hear of designer drugs, eh? Here is a designer feel-good flick and it likewise plays with your body's chemical makeup to make you feel good.\n\nIn this R-rated dramedy available on DVD and download, U.K. gay activists work to help miners during their lengthy strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in the summer of 1984. \n\nBoasting a theater CV that includes Ghost: The Musical, Matthew Warchus deftly directs the goings-on with a nimble footed swagger, literally making your toes tap. For a non-musical, this is an impressive feat. For Pride, however, it also proves appropriate. Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Paddy Considine, and Andrew Scott (the wicked wicked Moriarity to Benedict Cumberbatch's wily Sherlock on the BBC) play beaten-down and sometimes tragic figures, but they bring a resolve and vigor to their characters that you never feel sorry for them--just, well, proud. Their performances and the direction get you on your feet in solidarity, yes, but a good deal of credit also goes to the screenwriter. Stephen Beresford's script effortlessly hopscotches from bleak to hilarious moments and back again in a manner that somehow remains reverential to both.\n\nBottom line: Heart O' Miner",

Pride isn't a musical, but it surely feels like one with all the colorful characters and the lovable 80's soundtrack. It was a surprisingly fun film with an upbeat message about solidarity. It is one of those rare crowd-pleasers that stands out from other films thanks to its strong cast and uplifting message. I never imagined a film focusing on the historic events that took place in the UK in 1984 when the miners were at strike and found an uncommon ally in the gay and lesbian activists could be so fun. We've had similar plots in the past where two groups come together in the aid of each other despite their differences, but I don't think it has been done in such a contagiously joyful manner. Take last year's Dallas Buyers Club for example where we get a contrasting alliance between a redneck cowboy and a group of gays suffering from AIDS. That was a much more serious film where we got some comedic moments due to the contrasting lifestyles, but Pride takes this similar premise of contrasting groups coming together and delivers a much more hilarious and uplifting film. It still delivers the message and despite being formulaic it manages to stand out thanks to its colorful characters that never lose their humanity. I can't think of another film where a group of gay and lesbian activists aren't just fighting for their own cause, but are actually invested in helping others who are going through a difficult moment. So it stands out in that it isn't one of those films that is focused entirely on delivering a message in favor of gay rights, but rather focusing on the solidarity between these two groups.

The way the film is portrayed feels like a musical at times and you actually want to dance along with some of the characters when the music plays. Pride is a film with a lot of heart that reminds us that despite our personal issues there are always others out there in need of our solidarity. Pride might feel a bit too sentimental at times, but it is a feel-good film nonetheless with some of the funniest scenes of any comedy released in 2014. There are also some dramatic moments where I literally got goose bumps because I was moved. It is well balanced and uplifting despite its flaws.\n\nSome of my favorite moments in the film involved the clashing of these two contrasting groups. Despite their differences they learn to understand each other because they both have suffered from oppression. The cast couldn't have been better. Ben Schnetzer gives an impressive performance as the gay activist who comes up with the idea of supporting this group and winning a new ally in the process, but the fun really kicks in when they interact with these miners from a small Welch community. This is where we are introduced to some great characters played by Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, Imelda Staunton, and Bill Nighy who are outstanding. Nighy really delivers by underplaying his character and proves that sometimes less is more. I enjoyed Gunning's strong female performance and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the future. George MacKay also delivers as this young kid who hasn't told his parents he's come out (which is probably the most formulaic part of this film) so he lies to them about his activities. Andrew Scott and Dominic West also have some endearing moments on screen together. The best thing about Pride is without a doubt the strong cast which thanks to the rich screenplay by Stephen Beresford are given such colorful and interesting characters.

            "content": "Britain, 1984. Margaret Thatcher's Tory government is facing the consequences of its extreme economic policies as employment, health and sense of freedom of the Average Joe is crumbling during a period of apparent economic boom. The miner's strike has been going on for weeks, resulting in illegal government action and measures against freedom of speech. 20 coal mines are under threat, spelling 20 hopeless towns. Union funds have been seized by the government, leaving the towns literally starving. Politics are polarizing. At the same time, gay rights are targeted by the same government, adding insult to injury to a community struggling with the peak of the AIDS epidemic.\n\nDuring the aggressively political London Gay Pride march a young man named Mark Ashton realizes something: the miners and the LGBT crowd have a common, dangerous enemy: their own government. A posse of a handful of London-based gays and one lesbian form a fundraising group called- informatively- Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners and start collecting money for food, setting up their base of operations in an artsy bookshop.\n\nThe at first glance unlikely support group manages to gain momentum and soon starts co-operating with the small Welsh mining town of Onllwyn. The core group of activists is soon invited to visit a town made up of beer drinking macho miners and their dutiful housewives. Things are about to change. The oddest of bedfellows, united only in the oppression that has embittered them, are about to meet. This is how you lay the grounds for a predictable but endearing, damn stylish and skilfully presented film based on actual events.\n\nThe main point of view in this tale of a meeting between two completely different worlds is that of Joe, a closeted, 20-year old boy who has just discovered the gay community. He documents the political struggle, both in London and in Wales, in photographs. His journey of self-discovery is as formulaic as the rest of the film, but also equally genuine, touching and well presented. He is the least aggressive in the group of young activists, allowing him a certain status of an outsider observing the uneasy union that is forming between initially homophobic miners and provocative young gay activists. The process is handled with insight here, the pacing perfect, the character interaction plausible and nicely complicated despite the both historically and dramatically obvious direction it's all heading into.\n\n\"Pride\" threads in very familiar territory, all in all. This along with some scenes that take emotion into the realm of sentimentality cripples the film in some obvious ways. But then again- \"Pride\" is exactly what it aspires to be. And it's still special and frankly just damn enjoyable as well as thought-provoking to watch, filled with rich characterization backed up by an army of wonderful performances. Stephen Beresford's script alone is deliciously witty yet touching, growing into a funny but also deeply poignant work. The film is not ashamed or sneaky in its declaratory left-wing politics, but doesn't taint its case by painting only in black and white, even if it does leave its antagonists a tad thinner than its heroes.\n\nI saw this in a small Finnish movie theatre in the middle of the coldest, completely sunless winter, and it warmed the audience so much it received actual, hand-clapping applause from the Finnish audience as the credits started to roll. Believe me, this better than anything else indicates that \"Pride\" is a force to be reckoned with.",

Dominic West and Ben Schnetzer are particularly good and both Bill Nighy and Imedla Staunton excell at the dry humour. Paddy Considine is another that hits some dramatic and comedic notes, which propell his towns relationship with the GLSM. However, this film is more of a dramedy than a full-on comedy and therefore doesn't provide laughs the entire way through. But is does offer some rather confronting scenes of homophobia which adds to the dramatic element. This film is genuinely one of the best films to come out of the uk this year, even if it is a bit grim for a comedy. And its not really a dark comedy either...",

On the one hand -- especially at this time of year -- it's all about ranking the best from the rest, compiling Top Ten lists, awarding prestigious prizes and statuettes to the most outstanding films and filmmakers, minutely comparing one movie with another.  But, as a matter of course, every film no matter how great or small is critiqued concisely with practically no precision, often on a 4-star scale.  IMDb allows its users to select from an extravagant 10 stars, while other sites offer 5 stars (sometimes with the doubling effect of half-stars).\n\nIf four stars was good enough for Roger Ebert, surely 10 stars at IMDb should be good enough for me ... but no.  This film is a good example of 10 not being enough for me.  No, no, i don't mean i'd like to Spinal Tap it with 11 stars -- what i mean is that this film begs nuance in the range between 7.0 and 7.9.\n\n\"Pride\" is not an 8 out of 10 film for me.  It's very good, for sure, anchored by the gravity of Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton, and buoyed joyfully by a young unknown(-to-me) cast.  My salty cheeks are evidence that the story's sentimental notes were soundly struck.

The cast is top-notch, the story is both interesting and heartwarming, there are a plethora of hilarious moments, and there's enough conflict for it to hold your attention the whole movie, without really forcing conflict and generally allowing for happiness and teamwork to flourish from early on until the end. It's just a happy movie, you know?\n\nI'm not sure what you could complain about with this movie. I guess some characters are sort of archetypes, but that's necessary with an ensemble cast like this one, and besides, the actors do a great job of making up for their limited screen time by making their few scenes count. It's clear Joe Copper is fictional, a sort of audience surrogate created to introduce us to LGSM, but that's okay, because his stereotypical situation is made genuine thanks to his actor, the strong direction, and the particular details in the script.\n\nThere's also just a lot of beautiful visual moments. The Wales countryside is gorgeous, and the whole visual feel of the movie is colorful and vibrant to match the spirit and optimism of the movie.\n\nI guess one more complaint somebody could make is that the themes are a bit expected, nothing truly new. I'm sure there are aspects of the story that are misrepresented or simplified in the film, and overall the movie is pretty simple. So...I guess I can understand if somebody was looking for a deeper message and was instead met with a treacly or overly sentimental movie. But, to be honest, I don't think every movie needs to be extremely complex or true to life, and it'd be hard for me to make that complaint when I was having so much fun spending time with the characters onscreen. There's just so much unapologetic happiness, from Dominic West's amazing dance scene to the crazy old ladies having fun (I loved all of them) to the gay pride parade at the movie's end. I just had a lot of fun watching the characters, and even if the story and themes are pretty basic, it doesn't make it less moving to see two distinct communities support each other, or to see the simple but effecting image of two hands clasped together.",

I sat down not knowing what exactly the film was even about other than it was based on a true story dealing with gay rights. More specifically, Pride concerns itself with the 1984 trials of a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists who raise money to support the National Union of Mineworkers who are on strike. The two groups discover that standing together makes for a stronger union for both their causes and generally serves as an inspiring tale all around. What makes the film so rousing and fun while telling an inherently dramatic story is that of the characters and the genuine way in which they interact with one another. From Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton to Paddy Considine and Dominic West with a cast of exuberant youths in between including Ben Schnetzer, George MacKay and a star-making performance from Jessica Gunning Pride knows where its charm lies and it utilizes that quality to ensure the viewers feel its points. Maybe it was that lack of expectation that made this a more emotionally stirring experience than I expected, but it is also a rather exhilarating study of the human spirit and the kind of, well, pride that comes along with seeing differences set aside for the greater cause. Either that or maybe it's simply because director Matthew Warchus and first time screenwriter Stephen Beresford gauged just the right tone with which to capture this story and allowed their actors to flourish-creating not only a winning film in terms of being entertaining and informative, but a rather moving and intimate portrait of a little-known story that still feels more than relevant today.",

Even in context of the emergence of the AIDS epidemic, this gaggle of idealists believe that they can make a difference in their own struggle and the progress of humanity by linking arms with those engaged in the pivotal class struggle of their time. I was working for the AFL-CIO at this precise time, and know that the result -- unions joining the struggle for human rights -- was directly inspired by what happened in this story. So yes, one person can make a difference. As a film, this one follows a long line of 'heart-warming'  comedy/dramas that have come from the decline of Britain's working-class, such as the Full Monty, Kinky Boots, Billy Elliot, Calendar Girls, and many others. There are lovely set-pieces (Dominic West as a flaming disco queen, the girls in London discovering dildos and porn), and some genuinely affecting emotional moments.",

And deservedly it did, although not by a big margin. If only the director had kept up with the dramatic tone, the film would have been much more dramatic and effective, in my opinion, since the subject and theme of this film consist the most fertile ground for a good drama - social struggles for equality mixed with internal quests of finding oneself. My sometimes he fell for lighthearted touches of \"stage/musical\" style, which made the film much more cheerful and up-lifting to watch, but at the same time cut off the emotional stream of feelings by the audience built up by the previous moving sequences (and I just realized that the director is indeed a more accomplished stage director and is planning for a musical adaptation of this film, which I believe will be even more successful due to its stage-suitability). But as a blade having two edges, the cheerful tone of \"Pride\" also brightened up its characters, whose everyday lives were often put in the dark due to the social and political prejudice against miners and LGBT. As such, almost every character in the film stands out and is easily recognizable for their liveliness and their will to fight for what they believe. The weaknesses of the film might be the shaky emotion build-up, as mentioned above, the lack of \"true climax\" (although I did actually enjoy this style - rather having some fun and care-free moments than watching heavy dramas all year long), and a very uneven \"second act\". However, the brief but extremely powerful ending did concluded this film on a high note. If only the film had been a true cinematic drama rather than a stage-alike piece, but not every one can be Sam Mendes (who jumped from his stage career to film career with instant success), so we should sit down and enjoy the film for all the optimistic thoughts it has, which shone through the film like a beam of sun light piercing through the cloudy sky in December.",
