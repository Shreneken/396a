    "summary": "Hoe zou het zijn om in de huid van een varken te kruipen en een dagje op een boerderij te leven? Met deze gedachte in zijn achterhoofd maakte de legendarische documentairemaker Viktor Kosakovskiy zijn natuurfilm Gunda, waarin we aan de hand van intieme zwart-wit beelden in de dierenwereld worden geplaatst. Na het zien van Gunda kun je niet anders dan respect en empathie voelen voor elk levend wezen op onze aarde.",

The movie has enough ludicrous action scenes and fun musical numbers that were admittedly pretty fun. This movie received a lot of backlash for an incorrect portrayal of history, but I didn't personally let this affect me, and I tried to watch it as a movie. As a movie, it is pretty messy at times, as the story has way to much going on and doesn't always make a lot of sense. I also think the actors do as good as they can considering how cheesy the dialogue is. I can't say this is a great movie nor is it art, but if you just want to watch something brainless for a couple hours, I think you can do a lot worse.",

Similarly, this terrible film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several sights. It depicted that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war when in reality; they had been fighting for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!\nSuch is the state and height of historically inaccuracy and dumbness!\nPoor dumb ass YashRajFilms!!!

Gunday, although not falling under the genre of my preference, let me be unbiased in reviewing the same.\nThe movie begins at the backdrop of 1971 war, where Bangladesh as a country was born. It gave birth to lot of orphans and refugees. Gunday is about two young orphans Bikram and Bala who witnessed the war and its aftermath. Refugee camp turned out to be a hell rather than a shelter for them, where the seeds of gunday was sown. Fighting for survival, the inseparable duo escaped to Calcutta (now Kolkatta). The young Bikram and Bala enacted by Darshan Gurjar and Jayesh V Kardak reminded me of Salim Malik - Jamal Malik (played by Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) of slumdog millionaire. Both Darshan and Jayesh have given fabulous performance.\n\nThe grown up Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) with their illegal business (they have justification for all these) started ruling Calcutta and became its most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless, and most powerful ... Gunday!\nThere comes the entry of gorgeous Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer who swept both Bikram and Bala off their feet. There are certain light moments when both Bikram and Bala try to woo Nandita turn by turn. I wish, these moments could have been prolonged a little more. Nandita has given some sensuous performance through dance sequences. Although her costumes don't belong to 80's era of fashion.\nIrrfan Khan as ACP Satyajeet Sarkar has definitely added his style, cool, composure to the character. He plans a chakraviewh and the movie moves ahead to let us know whether and how Bikram, Bala get trapped in that chakraviewh. Irrfan is also the narrator.\nMusic by Sohail Sen is good. Jashn-e-Ishqa, Jiya, Tune maari entriyaan and Aslame-Ishqum have ranked well in the chart-busters. Irshad Kamil as penned down some good lyrics. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra highlights Hoogly, Howra Bridge, fish market... the specialties of Calcutta.\nDirector Ali Abbas Zafar has definitely tried to take out the best from Ranveer and Arjun, although I felt Arjun's expressions betrayed his dialogue at times - 'Ye tevar humare khoon me hai'. I need to mention that I missed the director Ali Abbas Zafar of Mere Brother ki Dulhan fame in this movie.\nSaurabh Shukla is natural and effortless as always.\nIt is disheartening that Gunday has nothing new to offer. Very predictable plot.\nWatch Gunday only for Ranveer & Arjun's chemistry, Irrfan's tactful cop act and Priyanka's dance numbers.\nAlas! Gunday ...Hum Gunday the, Gunday hain aur Gunday rahenge... Koi hume sudhaar nahi sakta...",

The context is set around the time of Liberation war in Bangladesh and it manifests that Bangladesh was born as an independent nation because of 15 days war between India and Pakistan. It simply omitted that 9 month's long war that Bangladeshis led to achieve their independence. Bangladesh is deeply offended by this scandalous distortion of truth regarding their glorious Liberation war in 1971. I don't know whether this major mistake was made deliberately, as they could have known the truth from a very preliminary research of international news of 1971. \nNot only as a Bangladeshi, but also as a sensible viewer, I think the exhibition of this movie should be stopped immediately and should be banned if they do not make the necessary correction.",

Today, we see on a blog that Yashraj Films has apologized for this incident (http://yrfmovies.blogspot.com/2014/02/on-gunday.html). We don't know whether it is your official blog or not. That's why we are not stopping ourselves from protesting and sending mails to Yashraj Films. We are demanding your apology from your core heart and this should not be in a less covered media. We know you are a film making giant and know how to make news. We demand apology from you calling on a press conference. And our second and related demand is withdrawal of your bull sheet garbling history telling of your film's first eleven minutes. You people told the incident as a fiction. But keep in mind that, it may be merely a fiction to you but it is our sacred history regarding our independence. We don't know what you are coming up with. But we will never tolerate any propaganda regarding our history and its vandalism. We will continue our protest if you are not apologizing. If you need any further help please contact me in given email address below. And for your information I am sending you the Surrender document of Pakistani army in 16 December 1971 as a proof of your misdeed. In which you can clearly see that Pakistani Army surrendered to the joint force of Bangladesh and India, not merely Indian Army.",

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film.\n1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.\n3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!\nWe consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. \nThank you.",

It's promos and promotions (TV appearances etc.) give you the impression of high quality bromance between the protagonists and their fun filled wooing of a diva. Whereas, it's opening scenes are well crafted derivations of aftermath of 1971 Indo Pak War, which separated the modern day Bangladesh from India, thereby creating a partition between West Bengal and East Bengal. But in actuality, the film turns out to be a tribute to the angry young man, Robin Hood like films of Amitabh Bachchan which also had high dosage of intense camaraderie between the heroes, thundering dialogues and high dollops of performances by coquettish damsels. You feel like you have been transported to the film era of the 70's.\n\nIt's quite evident, that immense hard work has been input by cast and crew, in terms of - r&d, apparels, appearances, set designing, performances etc. In fact the opening scenes, especially the performances by child artists are very good. They actually raise your expectations from the movie to a different level. Even the facial and body language similarity between the two protagonists and their childhood appearances have been matched to the T.\n\nThe entire leading cast - Ranveer, Arjun and Priyanka are in their best body forms i.e. very toned, agile and very Hollywood like. In fact, the cabaret performance by Priyanka can give many a similar Hollywood movie performances, quite a run for their money! Lookswise, even in her avatar as a Bengali coquettish lass, she scores well in both traditional Bengali dressing and full-of-tease acting. Such impersonation is not easy. Otherwise too, she has acted well. However, you do feel that her role is longer and meatier than what is actually required on the lines of the movie. Ranveer and Arjun are bursting with both energy and muscles. Their on-screen camaraderie as 'Bala-Bikram' remind you of 'Jai-Veeru' (Amitabh and Dharmendra)! They also look good in whatever they wear and have acted well. A special mention needs to be made of the fact that the dress designing is not completely on the lines of the 70's. It's kind of fusion of the 70's with the modern day sensibility. As expected, Saurabh Shukla and Irrfan Khan have acted well too.\n\nThe movie holds well till interval. And, then it loosens it's grip, both in terms of objective and enactment. Some scenes are really long and unnecessary. \n\nShowing pure and innocent love in the backdrop of extreme and realistic violence and turbulence is no mean feat. Directors like - Vidhu Vinod Chopra ('1942 A Love Story') and Mani Ratnam ('Roja', 'Bombay') have achieved this with great elan. Sadly, 'Gunday' attempts this, but falls short of similar final delivery.",

Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot!

Similarly, this terrible film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several sights. It depicted that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war when in reality; they had been fighting for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!\n\nSuch is the state and height of historically inaccuracy and dumbness!\n\nPoor dumb ass YashRajFilms!!! Better start selling pinup magazines on the street - I mean it!",

Basically, they are good boys and good deeds but one incident of stealing coal from\n a train changes their lives. They become the biggest coal mafia. Added to that, they fall in love with the same girl Nandita (priyanka). In comes ACP Satyajeet (irrfan) to nail them. What happens after that forms the rest.\n\nThe director has come up with a familiar storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was good in parts. The dialogues were reasonable. The script was smooth but the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was good but not that effective while songs were okay. Cinematography was rich. Editing was not sharp during first half. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was excellent. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor shoulder the film well and dominate. Priyanka Chopra was valuable and looked sexy.Irrfan Khan was powerful. Saurabh Shukla was superb. Others did their bit as required.\n\nThe film per se doesnâ??t have anything special and different to offer but it is the way the whole thing is packed which entertains. The makers cleverly chose a 70s backdrop. The first half was somewhat slow and takes time to pick up but the second half has enough twists and turns to keep the energy on. Overall, this is a film which will appeal to the commercial audience and mass masala seekers.",

Loads of action, music, dances, romance & \"bro\"mance makes this Gangster epic one of the most predictable yet highly entertaining films to come in recent years. YRF production has made this film on a large scale with different set pieces & a lot of explosions. Among the exceptional performances from the lead, with no doubts my favorite was Arjun Kapoor, the lad is becoming the patent gangster slowly, as the short tempered but lovable to a crazed maniac he is just brilliant!!followed by the always lovable Irrfan Khan who with his undeniable charm & personality conquers every scene he is present in. Ranvir Singh is a huge star in the making, no doubts on that & does well as the gangster with the brain part, but unfortunately gets overshadowed by his co stars in many sequences.While Priyanka looks incredibly sexy & manages to hold her own ground in this all boys film. Ali Abbas Zafar has made an ambitious film & it has been clear from his 1st film (Mere Brother Ki Dulhan), his films are solely meant to be mass entertainers. Looking forward to more sir!!",
