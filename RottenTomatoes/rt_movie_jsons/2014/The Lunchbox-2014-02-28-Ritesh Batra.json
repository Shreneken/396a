    "summary": "Lonely housewife Ila (Nimrat Kaur) decides to try adding some spice to her stale marriage by preparing a special lunch for her neglectful husband. Unfortunately, the delivery goes astray and winds up in the hands of Saajan (Irrfan Khan), an irritable widower. Curious about her husband's lack of response, Ila adds a note to the next day's lunchbox, and thus begins an unusual friendship in which Saajan and Ila can talk about their joys and sorrows without ever meeting in person.",

Some scenes, I felt, worked better than others but there were enough funny moments to keep me entertained regardless. I particularly enjoyed the stoning scene and ones where John Cleese's character gets very wound up! (no change there then referencing Fawlty Towers et al). I also liked the over the top/shrill tone of voice used for some characters. Its silly and entertaining, with the usual Monty Python opening titles, with words in lumps of stone falling around and things. I'd recommend this film.",

            "content": "I probably would have liked The Lunchbox quite a bit more in the moment if the version I ended up seeing did not have terribly translated subtitles; when the characters speak English the poor quality of the transcription really showed. But that's hardly the fault of anyone involved in the actual production, so I'll try to be as fair as I can having seen this film through what feels like a thick pane of glass.\n\nThe Lunchbox uses a classic formula (two lonely people brought together by innocuous chance) and puts a bit of a twist on it, keeping the characters physically separated and moving from comedic territory to more of a subdued dramatic feel as Irrfan Khan' Saajan and Nimrat Kaur's Ila develop a relationship by sharing the emotional hardship of their relatively monotonous, everyday lives. There isn't much in the way of a whirlwind romance with giddy excitement and a sweep-off-your-feet moment, but instead a more restrained passion as both characters find in each other someone to open up to about problems that they had relegated to their inner thoughts as the result of loneliness; their respective presence forms something of a light in the darkness towards which each character cautiously crawls. The film earns its status as a film well beyond what could have been a standard (albeit creative and sweet) romcom premise. Ultimately the film touches on quite a bit of sincere territory - unfulfilled ambition, societal expectations, lovelessness, aging, kindness and friendship; it all proceeds with resolute but unrushed pacing and comes together quite well. A very nice romantic film that hasn't really received much attention in Europe or the United States since a very positive reception at Cannes in 2013. (3.5/5)",

What transpires is the melting of his cold skeptical wall and is slowly shown by Rogers how kindness effects peoples lives. Very well acted and a lovely story you can't help but smile through.  Beautiful film.",

            "content": "Lunch Box-Hindi Film (2013)\n\nIn all love stories, a boy and girl or a man and woman with totally conflicting backgrounds are considered. They both overcome many hurdles and come together or very rarely fall apart. \n\nSeveral love stories have been churned in the past with lovers belonging to different castes, communities, states, borders, mother tongues, physical disabilities, economic disparities etc. etc. Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Kalidasa's Abhijnana Sakunthalam motivated our film makers since the times immemorial. When we tend to believe that all love stories have been exhausted, the film Lunch Box must have come as a refreshing breeze in 2013. I wondered how I missed this film so far, but when I watched it recently, I thought of putting with great reverence, my appreciation as a flower in the garland of its reputation. \n\nIla (Sanskrit meaning earth) is a married woman with a child. Her husband does not pay any attention to her. She feels her married life has become monotonous and boring. \nSaajan (Lover) is a widower and leads a sullen and lonely life. Both Ila and Saajan exchange letters through wrongly delivered lunch box by a Mumbai Dabbahwalla. \n\nHow Ila and Saajan open up their hearts and come closer to each other to rid of their drabbing lives form the rest of the story.\n\nFirst let us consider Ila. She is helped by a couple of characters in the film to arrive at clarity of her mind. Mrs. Deshpande, the aunty in the upstairs portion tells her that a woman can reach out to her husband through his stomach. So she cooks delicious and good food for Rajeev her husband, but is unfortunately delivered to Saajan. Ila tries to bond with Rajeev by igniting his libido. The Director's imagination is at its peak in showing Ila without duppata and Rajeev's mind ignoring the real and hovering over the virtual. \n\nWhat a woman expects from her husband is his time and attention when he is at home. Her heart does not really aspire for material things. And it is not happening for Ila. \n\nIla learns that aunty derives inspiration from her ceiling fan, which runs continuously without fuming and fretting. Her husband needs to look at the ceiling fan always running to be out of coma. Aunty also spends most of her time listening to audio tapes.\n\nThere is another character Yashvi, Ila's daughter. It is sarcastically shown that the natural instinct of a girl child is to play with inanimate objects like dolls, which in latter years may help her to manage with the husband.\n\nBoth the aunty and Ila's mother nail in Ila's mind that the life of a woman for generations is always confined to the four walls of a house serving the most undeserved. \n\nFor Ila, married life appears to be mere exhibitionalism. The quintessence of a family is in its emotional satisfaction. Ila symbolizing the earth has touched her limits of forbearance. She gradually draws herself close to Saajan.\n\nThere are two suicides in the film. One suicide teaches Ila that a woman has to overcome her short-comings courageously instead of becoming the victim of circumstances. Another one is her own brother, a failed personality.\n\nIla visits her mother when her father died. She could notice the degree of disgust and oppression her mother has been putting up with her father and her great relief and freedom after his death. Ila feels how fragile any woman's life can be especially when her husband and her son are not there to support. Incidentally Rajeev is reluctant to have a son and Ila felt depraved.\n\nComing to Saajan. If one does not kill the time, the time kills. Saajan spends his lonely evenings with an old transistor radio or repeatedly watching wornout video tapes. His mind is like his old bicycle moving little forward to embrace a sweet family life, like the one seen through his neighbour's window. In the next moment it moves backwards to dwell in its emptiness.\n\nIla and Saajan want to meet each other. Both of them are shown waving away insects (obstacles) in front of their faces meaning they arrived at a common vision. They choose a restaurant for their meeting. On the way, Saajan meets an old woman in the electric train staring at him. Saajan felt as if his age is suitable for her. At restaurant he sees Ila and backs out without meeting her as she is too young for him. He is autumn. She is spring.\n\nSome more letters are exchanged between them through lunch box. Saajan is yet to get the necessary impetus to make further moves for Ila . \n\nShaikh is an office-subordinate of Saajan. He and his fiancee Mehrunnisa come from diagonally opposite backgrounds like in any love story. One is an orphan and the other is having a large family. Their live-in relationship is purely based on mutual trust, companionship and masti. Wedding is a coincidence. Saajan gets a clue from his friend Shaikh that though one travels ticketless in a train, one can buy a long term pass for comfortable journey. Even the wrong train can take a man to the right station. Means is not important... only the end.\n\nIla takes a taxi to come to Saajan's office. The taxi experiences a little jerk freeing her mind from all possible hurdles. She finds Saajan has already left for Nasik his native town. But she comes to know from Shaikh that Saajan was waiting for her at his wedding. She confidently sells of her jewellery to jump-start her life in Bhutan where she wants to amplify her happiness five times. \n\nOne can see the clarity and determination in Ila, when she instructs her school going daughter 'look for the water pool in the front, take diversion, do not look back and it is your journey' ....all by facial expressions without single dialogue.\n\nSaajan boards the Nasik train. A ripe old passenger is sitting in the opposite seat. He realises old age makes a person a destitute. Saajan gets down from the train in the mid- way and comes back home. He identifies himself with a cricket ball which is batted and bowled by every one. He holds the ball tight in his hands. Now he is determined for Ila. Next day he commutes with Dabbahwallas in search of Ila's home. His actions are endorsed by sounds of 'Hail Vittal...Hail Vittal' as blessings by God Vittal.\n\nOne expects both Ila and Saajan are soulmates once lost but found themselves now. But the story suddenly becomes a conundrum. Any on-screen conclusion for Ila and Saajan will be out-right rejected by conservative Indian audience as it amounts to an infatuated affair between a married woman with a child and a widower, whom she never met. The film could be branded as a revolt against social norms and could have flopped.\n\nBut the Director Riteshji deftly takes an intelligent recourse to an open-ended solution and leaves it for the audience to extrapolate. This is a master stroke.\n\nSeveral places, one can see the Ditrector's imaginative streaks. For example, when Saajan is rectifying the accounts prepared by Shaikh, a servant is shown mopping the floor.\n\nHowever, even in the best restaurants, there can be a fly in a bowl of soup. For example, we feel jerky when Saajan reveals the name of his girlfriend Ila to Sheikh. Such things happen in teenage love, where the boys take pride in announcing the names of their girlfriends. Saajan is a sophisticated and matured character. He should respect and protect the identity of Ila. He should not make it explicit until both of them come to a concrete decision. The inebriated conditions of Saajan do not justify his actions.\n\nAt this stage, I started analysing how Lunch Box became a super-hit film? Is it because of neat script? Or creative direction? Or amazing histrionics of Nimratji and lrrfanji? Or awesome camera work? Truly all of them went in the right proportion in this well-crafted film. But more important than all of these is, one can find real-life characters in the film...the characters who are crushed between their dreams and dreary lives. For them the film is a silent thunder. Lunch Box remains therefore a classic in the annals of Indian Films-Jai Hind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch Box-Hindi Film (2013)\n\nIn all love stories, a boy and girl or a man and woman with totally conflicting backgrounds are considered.

It's a very sophisticated, thematically rich, immensely universal movie that is also sprinkled with authentically Indian touches such as food, public transportation and delivery service. The humor is also excellent thanks to wonderful sidekick characters. Consequently, this is a rare romance that works in its entirety, and it's very difficult not to absolutely fall in love with it.

The idea from Illa with the help of her aunt is cook the most wonderful dishes and send it to her husband using the service of Dabbawalas a messenger service who deliver lunches right at her husband office.

After the second lunch Illa realize that her husband is not receiving the food, but is other person, and she decided to send a not with the lunchbox in order to find out who is the mysterious person who is enjoying Illa's cooking skill.\n\nThe film The lunchbox is hopeful, funny and represents a single love story, where both characters share personal thoughts about life and dreams.

It's a movie that not only restores my faith in the genre of feel-good dramas, but it reinforces the fact that something simple isn't always a bad thing (and can actually be pretty powerful). From the cinematography to the acting, I can't complain, and that's pretty rare. But somehow, the ingredients that make up this delightful little movie never falter. There wasn't a moment that I would've changed, especially when it comes to the original way our two main characters meet.\n\nTheir sweet relationship begins due to a mistake in Mumbai's lunchbox delivery system. Ila, a young housewife, takes up the task of making her husband's lunch each day and unexpectedly, it's not getting to him. She spends hours and hours making a wonderful feast but it ends up going to Saajan, a widowed man who works in an office, by accident. She decides to send him a note in the lunchbox one day and they begin communicating back and forth, turning a simple mishap into something beautiful.\n\nAnd honestly, it's one of the most sincere films I've seen in a long time. It doesn't feel the need to be in any way grandiose, keeping a quiet and reserved tone throughout (with some comedy sprinkled in at the perfect moments). Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur (who play Saajan and Ila) are absolutely superb, playing off of each other perfectly in every scene.\n\nAnd what's even more miraculous is that all of this is coming from a first-time director. It has the style and confidence of a film made by someone with years of experience, and I have to commend Ritesh Batra on his outstanding work. It would be a crime if this doesn't receive a nomination for 'best foreign-language film' at the Oscar's this year.",

If you are going to watch this movie don't do it like i did watch it with subtitles.\nIrfan Khan & Nimrat Kaur played really well and you really wished them to get together.\nThis is not a Bollywood production there is no song and dance in this movie it is a straight story.\nI enjoyed it. It was something different a story with a little spice.\nKids can watch this but it can be a tad boring\nit goes on i would say 20mins too long...",

Two people cross paths through the one lunchbox that lost it way in otherwise an impeccable delivery system. Two people needed each other and their fate found a way so the can offer each other solace from their desperate situation. \nIrfan Khan solidify his position as one of the greatest actors of our times, and Nimrat Kaur, a new discovery for me, is almost as amazing as he is. Director Ritesh Batra in his debut feature film offers a terrific story that is unsentimental yet magical. There is no holding hand or exposition in this film. It is an adult film that gives you enough to chew on but doesn't give you instant gratification or happily ever after, yet it leaves you with hope that the two of them will find happiness, may be! Do yourself a favor and watch this film, it is a gem and an instant classic. 4.5/5",

The film The Lunchbox is about two of these people -- a mismatched pair who do not know each other but come into contact with one another when the man is accidentally delivered a lunchbox intended for someone else (her husband).  When Ila (Nimrat Kaur - One Night with the King) decides to add some \"spice\" to her marriage through her cooking, she is surprised by the nonplussed reaction of her husband that evening when he conveys to her that his lunch was edible and adequate.  Little does she know that complete stranger Saajan (Irrfan Khan - Life of Pi) highly enjoyed her delectable meal.  The two begin a written correspondence with one another as they each open up to the other about their own personal hopes, dreams and desires that eventually develops into a respectful and gratifying friendship even though the two have never met.  The unexciting title of this foreign film (another negative to some) will likely keep people from seeing it which is a shame as The Lunchbox is an unexpected pleasure that is both satisfying and genuinely kind-hearted.  The \"Lunchbox\" delivery system used in the film is a fascinating concept on its own that IS used in the city and I was so intrigued by it that I had to look it up and learn more about it!  It isn't everyday or every movie that allows me to expand my vocabulary but The Lunchbox gave me the word \"dabbawala\"!  This is a simple story that couldn't work elsewhere because the idea cannot translate (\"a dabbawhat?!\").  I liked just about everything here -- I fully appreciated everything I was given by first-time feature writer-director Ritesh Batra.  With The Lunchbox, he's crafted a love letter of sorts to the changing city of Mumbai.",

The whole story is very gentle and quite constrained with the focus primarily on the relationships between the two protagonists but some focus on their secondary ones. The shots of Mumbai are just what you'd expect - I'd like to visit it one day and travel on the public transport system. Seems like an adventure in itself! The movie seemed a touch long.",

            "content": "This 2014 Indian film is  a quirky romantic tale of two very lonely and desperate people attempting to find something to live for.  A psychological study of loneliness and hope, \"The Lunchbox\" masterfully questions how much an individual is willing to risk to change his or her life.\n\nSaajan Fernandes is a fifty-something civil servant on the cusp of retirement and  resentful about it.   Ila,  a beautiful young thirty-something mother, studies cooking from television shows and from her aunt, who lives in the apartment upstairs and coaches her to improve her culinary skills in order to please her husband:  the old adage about a way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  The problem:  it is not her husband whose heart is charmed by her cooking.   Ila lovingly prepares a  lunchbox for her husband, to be delivered by the complex yet typical lunch delivery system for  office workers.  It is mistakenly delivered to Fernandes.\n\nThis begins a series of lunchbox notes as Fernandes awakens from his sleepwalking existence, and Ila begins to feel affection for someone once again.  But \"The Lunchbox\" also devastatingly reveals the melancholy of entrapment with no way out.  It is a  missive in itself:  to love regardless--and perhaps, in spite,--of age.\n\nSometimes the wrong train can take you to the right station\u00e2? claims Saajan\"s friend.  The ending is not a neat tying up of loose ends, and may leave some viewers frustrated.  Nonetheless,  this is a surprising film of depth, warmth, and character.  \"The Lunchbox\" deserves to be devoured, morsel by morsel, by a wide audience!

Watching these two actors fall in love is incredibly engaging, especially considering they never have a face to face conversation. As we see Khan and Kaur trade letters, secrets, and dreams we begin to see how hope can breathe new life into a dying soul.\n\nI loved the portrayals of growing old and coming to terms with reality. It's something that usually doesn't happen in romantic comedies, but I appreciated that the film took its time to let the relationship build to a natural rhythm. Also, it doesn't hurt that all the food looks delicious. \n\nEven if you're not a big foreign film fan, I think everyone can get something out of this film.",

It's a nice slice-of-life story that follows the subtle neglected lives of two different people who are misguidedly brought together through a lunchbox. Even for how slow-paced this film can be, it is ultimately saved by impeccable performances and genuine dialogue. There are many cases where films ensure languid camera movements that just seem to go on and on with not much happening. However, with the 'The Lunch Box' (2014) almost every minute of languid camera time gives direct details, whether it's cultural or for a character's depth-real characters, real situations.",
