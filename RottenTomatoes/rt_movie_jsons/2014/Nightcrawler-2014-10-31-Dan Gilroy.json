    "summary": "Los Angeles denizen Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) survives by scavenging and petty theft. He stumbles into a new career as a cameraman and -- armed with a camcorder and police scanner -- begins nocturnal forays across the city in search of shocking and grisly crimes. When he catches the eye of a shopworn news director (Rene Russo) who welcomes the chance to raise her station's ratings, Louis goes to increasingly greater lengths to catch the \"money shot.\"",

It was a good movie, the concept is great and fresh, and it feels extremely real in general: crime everywhere, car chases and ambitions that go beyond money. It was missing something though, maybe a stronger plot twist or darker scenes. Still, it is a powerful thriller that will leave you with one or two things to think about.",

The film is very graphic, exciting, sophisticated and blurs the restrictions between documenting the news and making the news.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal seems to have put a lot of thought into building the character before the film. He plays an emotionless and boundless psychopath. And he does the job very impressively\n\nIt's hard not to think of Peter Parker - aka Spider-Man and I believe that the plot was at least inspired by the comics \n\n\u2028\u2028Wonderful !",

However, 2014 is one of the best years cinema has had so far in the 2000s so I understand that it was packed with a million other phenomenal performances.  The last 20 minutes of this movie is some of the best and most tense moments I've seen since I watched Breaking Bad.  I REALLLY wanted to give this movie a 5/5 star rating but 94/100 rounds down to 9/10 which is 4.5/5 stars.  Nightcrawler is one of the closest films to reach a 5/5 star from me without actually getting it.  Absolutely amazing!!!!",

            "content": "Nightcrawler shows the dark and sadistic rise of an underground freelance video producer that left me on the edge of my seat in disbelief throughout the entire film.\n\nThe film begins following Lou Bloom, a man down on his luck during economic turmoil trying to find his way in the world. The whole first act really builds his sense of helplessness and drive to help lift himself out of his financial hardship. This drive is built upon throughout the entire story as with each step Bloom's morals and societal lines drift farther and farther from the norms. The entire theme of the story really resonates with common day America, as you are told to work hard and pave a path for yourself no matter the cost to those around you. Dan Gilroy did an outstanding job with the direction and writing of the entire film. The unsettling nature of dialogue and characters actions/motivations is incredibly eerie as it is indicative of society today. Each scene feels real as if it is a retelling of true events. I believed every second of Lou Bloom as a character, and that is largely due to Jake Gyllenhall's best performance to date.\n\nGyllenhall does such an excellent job of putting on this outcast persona. As a loner, he spends most of his time learning on the internet and due to that he does not really understand the nuances of everyday life. This is done tremendously well as every line delivered by Gyllenhall is so sharp and awkward, but the source of the words is tremendously powerful. The sense of emotion displayed by the lead is fantastic as well, he swings from being incredibly upset to quickly turning into a calm put together businessman. It demonstrates Bloom's extreme passion for this work as his emotions blind him to not only his speech but slowly morality. Every aspect of Gyllenhall's performance was incredibly visceral and every bit deserving of an Oscar. I touched a lot on the main lead here, but the supporting cast was all around spectacular. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed did excellent jobs in their parts. They were able to mirror the audience's reactions to the unhinged nature that is Lou Bloom, this aspect really resonated with me.\n\nOverall, Nightcrawler was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

The film ends with a bang and has left me thinking about it hours after viewing.\n\nGrade: 97%\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

One part of his character I loved was that you were never really sure if he was a sociopath, or just socially inept. We're never truly let into his mental state until one great scene later in the movie, that answered so many of my questions in the perfect way. Everything he does seems logical in some way, but more messed up than anything. He's grounded by his \"employee,\" another great character played by Riz Ahmed. Gyllenhaal was able to portray the perfect catalyst the film needed to provide takes on greed and human connection, and how those two can feed each other. The ending, also the most polarizing part of the film, was in my opinion, great. However, there were small scenes that aren't very important to the story, that just don't tie in with the rest. This is more of a nitpick than anything, just something that should be said. This is a must watch, if you get the chance.",

Jake's performance is just perfect just like everyone's else so the craziness and complexity of the characters were shown gracefully. The story is perfect. I mean you just follow a guy filming crime scene...and you love it! At least I do. The score, on the other hand, wasn't really surprising and ominous like I would have liked it but besides of this little \"flaw\", the movie is almost perfect. I must say it was beautiful.",

            "content": "It might well just be me, but I feel that to a certain extent at least, Jake Gyllenhaal is somewhat underrated. His performance in Nightcrawler is a career highlight, and it's a career that's strewn with repeatedly excellent displays. His portrayal of oddball Louis Bloom, a thief who decides to turn his trade to nightcrawling after witnessing the late Bill Paxton grabbing footage from a late night car crash to sell to the media, is nothing short of genius. The brilliance of Gyllenhaal is to deliver such lunacy with total calm, combining possible sociopathy with well read sense, making for a dangerous and off the hook individual, willing to go to any lengths necessary to get his story. Some of you may have seen Gyllenhaal recapture some of this manic calmness in Velvet Buzzsaw (2019) a film that was serviceable but held together by his performance. In Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal is supported by others on the top of their game, an early performance from the brilliant Riz Ahmed, as well as Rene Russo, whose news director slowly loses control over her own  self confidence thanks to Louis' calculated calmness. Dan Gilroy's debut feature is littered with brilliance, and he went on to bring those features to Velvet Buzzsaw, it's just a shame it doesn't hit the heights of Nightcrawler. Another thing that the film does so well is to address a small area of American culture that is somehow perfectly legal (admittedly not the lengths that Louis goes to) and it tackles these discussions head on in the newsrooms, albeit briefly. But that's not what the film is about, although it covers these topics. Its subject matter is about the ability and accessibility of a troubled individual with the means within his grasp to wreak physical and emotional havoc, and to be far too close to the bounds of legality for comfort. One of the best films of the decade, with a behemoth of a performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.",

The moment when you most need a tense / dramatic music, there it comes a sound that you'd expect with a happy ending. The dialogues are poorly done, as is the plot: half of what happens in the movie is not credible. I understand pushing the limits of credibility to make a point, but in this movie, it falls into a farse. There is no depress to the characters, only moments of extremity that in reality would have very different consequences.",

What lengths will he go to get the story? Well, let's just say that a man born without empathy or fear can go pretty damn far.\n\nThere's a lot to talk about with this movie but let me start off by saying just two words, \"Jake Gyllenhaal.\" MAN! This guy is something else! He really shines in this movie. The way he portrays Bloom without an ounce of empathy is just unlike anything I've seen before. He's like a bizarre cross between SpongeBob SquarePants and the T-1000. It's really unnerving watching him in this role and every moment you spend with him makes your skin crawl but at the same time you're drawn in to wanting to see what he'll do next. Also noteworthy is Rene Russo who plays a veteran news anchor desperate to increase her ratings. I really liked the whole vibe of this movie which plays kinda like a retro John Carpenter film in some respects. It's got a style and a brash quality about it that has been largely unseen in film beyond the 1980s. The art direction and the cinematography are another triumph of this film. It manages to marry both handheld and steady-cam shots in a fluid way that keeps the differing styles uniform and easy to follow despite some scenes that have quite a bit of action in them. Speaking of which, the driving sequences in this film are amazingly well shot and really interesting to watch. There are a few sticky moments that don't really make too much sense as far as the way the police are portrayed, letting just anyone hyper-close to dangerous crime scenes in a way that you know they would never do, but overall it's alright.\n\nOn the whole, I really liked this film. If you're a fan of films like Taxi Driver or Drive or any number of John Carpenter films, I think you'll like this too. It's not super heavy on the action like some of the other films but you will definitely get a thrill from it. Nightcrawler gets a 4...out of 5.",

He shows the story of Louis Bloom, a loner and loser, he dreams of achieving of something big in the field of media. What he ends up doing and how he goes down an extremely dark path of filming news footage in an exploitive way is the movie's story. Its extremely sad that Jake Gyllenhaal never got an Academy Award for this role (and not even a nomination!). He dives into the insanity and drive the character goes through when trying to achieve his dreams. He manipulates and exploits situations, and Gyllenhaal transforms himself physically and mentally when becoming the character. The rest of the cast, which includes Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, and Bill Paxton also deliver some really solid underrated performances. Outside of the acting, its the way Gilroy writes and directs thats super impressive. He creates a slick and dark look for the city, and treats the media world as almost a battleground with no rules whatsoever. You watch and hope that the character will turn into a better person, but as you see their descent, you realize that they will not change. Its an antihero subject, and Gilroy doesn't glorify the character at all. He shows how selfish he is and how slimy his tactics are. When I watched the film at TIFF14, I remember thinking about the movie for the whole car ride back home. An excellent film that needs so much more attention!",

            "content": "As a former newspaper editor, I can tell you that the \"If it bleeds, it leads\" cliche is absolutely true. And _Nightcrawler_ takes it to the limit.\n\nDark as it may be, this is one of the best films of 2014. It belongs on the all-time classics list. That''s how good it is.\n\nLouis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) invokes the whole \"how to be successful in business\" trend that was popular in the 80's. Although that movement is cloaked in motivational blather, which Louis recites constantly throughout the film, the bottom line, in reality, is in \"Make the sale at any cost, step on anybody you need to step on, forget about ethics, and treat your employees like dirt, so you can BE SUCCESSFUL.\"\n\nLouis' recitations of business cliches are comedic at first, until the film descends into real darkness. Louis decides to make his living as a \"nightcrawler,\" a freelance cameraman who rushes to the scenes of horrible accidents and murders, films the most grisly footage he can, and sells it to the local news channels. It's distasteful enough in the beginning of the film, but believe me, it gets worse.  He starts orchestrating and setting up camera ops, including the ultimate shooting death of his assistant Rick (Riz Ahmed), a homeless young man who helps him out for $30 a night.\n\nThroughout the film, Rick speaks for us, the audience, who can't believe what Bloom is doing. He can't believe it, either. So his death is a real tragedy. Ahmed turns in one of the best supporting performances I have ever seen.\n\nRenee Russo is excellent as the greedy news TV director who buys the footage from Bloom.  In one scene, she tells Bloom that what she wants is footage of crimes committed in upper class white neighborhoods by colored people and minorities. Makes you wonder about the TV news business.....?  And Bill Paxton is perfect as a veteran nightcrawler who ends up a victim of Bloom's deviousness.\n\nBut the prize goes to Jake Gyllenhaal. His performance is incredible. He never blinks. He dispassionately does his thing, meticulously planned and calculated.  It's the creepiest performance I can remember since DeNiro in _Taxi Driver_.  Gyllenhaal was in his mid-30's when this movie was released in 2014. His acting in _Prisoners_ (2013) was impressive; the same goes for _Enemy_ in 2014.  It will be interesting to watch him as he ages.  He may end up as the next DeNiro. I hope he stays on track and turns down stupid movies when he gets older.\n\nTo me, the most disturbing scene is the final one. Bloom has made so much money that he has bought two news vans. and he's hiring several more assistants. He gives them a Tony Robbins motivational talk about climbing the ladder of success,  and he concludes by saying, \"I would never ask you to do anything I wouldn't do.\" It's chilling.\n\nDo not miss this one!",

When I did watch the film it was just as interesting but I did feel like something was missing. The way the story progressed felt fast despite it being almost two hours long.

Typically included with Zodiac (which I gave a (90)) and Prisoners (95), as thriller-like, neo-noir-ish films in which Gyllenhall plays a/the protag, he gives his best performance here as Louis \"Lou\" Bloom. What he does with the character, which easily could've been played a straight-laced creeper with a dark side, blew me away. Even cruising 100mph through L.A., Bloom keeps his composure while simultaneously lecturing his intern, Rick (Riz Ahmed), on maintaining a positive attitude in the face of adversity, establishing goals, and increasing your value when salary-bargaining, amongst other tidbits of life advice you'd expect to hear in the conference room at the Sheraton by the airport. You see, Lou works as a \"stringer,\" or a photojournalist who arrives at the scene of any news breaking story, and in the Los Angeles of 2014, as is the case in every city or town across America, the more violent, the more cultural overlap \u2014 the phrase \"urban crime spreading into the suburbs\" is used a few times \u2014 the quicker it can make it onto the air, the more lucrative the clip. Lou forms a business relationship that soon shifts into a sexual-control relationship with Nina (Rene Russo), the morning news director at a local station. \"How much can we show?\" \"Legally?\" \"No, morally. Of course, legally.\" Pretty much sums Nina. A single scene shifts the tone of the film from one of sleazy and unethical to downright criminal: Lou moves a bloodied body from a car crash, where he had been the first to arrive, even before the police, so he could block it better for the recording \u2014 the entire time music like something out of Friday Night Lights plays, as if he were the star Quarterback scrambling for the pylon. The best line of the film and the one that finally offers some insight into why Lou is so\u2026idiosyncratic comes after rebutting Rick's statement that Lou doesn't understand people: \"What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people, but that I just don't like them?\" I was late to the game on this one, so I won't detail the climax, but man o'man is it shocking. One small thing I would've changed is a detail about the ending. Lou has grown from a 1\u20132 man operation to a small crew assembled of four interns, clad in matching uniforms and vans. However, a huge part of Lou's success was due to his upgrade from some crappy clunker to the Dodge Challenger that graces the movie posters, which offers him speedier access to the scenes. It would've been a more impactful final scene had the crew departed together \u2014 after Lou's \"I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself\" line \u2014 in badass muscle cars instead of the vans. Nevertheless, Nightcrawler is a must-see and has been one of the most enjoyable viewings of the year.",

Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Lou Bloom, portrayed a character desperate to be someone and be successful. (we never knew his motivation/background) Lou becomes a freelance TV news cameraman overnight with a nose for graphic tragedy and actually began as a weird petty thief. The problem here is there was no character background. The audience unaware become manipulated in a way as with the majority of the film they're quickly thrown into a tense thriller believing this to be about the media, fake news etc. It was actually about a creepy guy who, like so many, wasn't born rich (I assume) and wants a lot of personal success. Instead, we see fake news after fake news and the lengths of which people go to get the news. Fake news is still a very strong discussion and to me clearly it wasn't Lou's patronising smile that sold the movie, it was more that the creators focus mainly on something that's discussed every day, fake news. \nSecondly, Lou seemingly goes around filming incidents he learned about on a police scanner. (It is not that simple believe me) and points a Black Friday value camera before he sells this to a news company. (Oddly enough Lou was able to just casually stroll into the newsroom and sell his stories)\nI found the entire film strange. You claim this to have been profoundly very well written and shown and yet if the character has been doing this for three months earning in excess of $1000 a night or whatever we still never learn much about him, nor do we see him spending his earnings or anything. \nAlso the police do not seem to be very good at investigating crimes. There's never any cctv footage even in a mansion? \nThere's just too much unbelievability with this movie. I know people are easily persuaded by similar characters like Lou but there's far too little in regards of actual reality. The police or anyone else do not mind too much when a strange looking guy points a camera at a dead persons face. \nWhat was quite obvious to me and not to others was Jake himself slipping up so many times with his accent. At first he played a deluded, somewhat mentally unstable slow person (let's be honest) yet within a few minutes he's a fast thinking dreamer with an education. Not long after he's a posh accent with manners. Then not long after he's an American roaming around talking like he's a top businessman very prim and proper. Not much consistency in his dialogue. Yes Jake of course is a brilliant actor and really carried this film but much of this movie his performance was certainly not anything to blow you away.",

Nightcrawler Written & Directed by Dan Gilroy follows Louis Bloom, an odd entrepreneur trying to find his place as a local nightly news videographer. I remember seeing this film in theaters in 2014 opening night. I am a fan of Gyllenhaal\u2019s work and the trailers definitely intrigued me. I cannot day enough about how great this film is. This is the best performance of Gyllenhaal\u2019s career still to date. This movie builds on suspense and just keeps escalating to points you will never expect. It\u2019s a twisted psychological thriller that surrounds the topic of how far will you go to get a good news story. Rene Russo as they news station manager delivers a scene that still to this day that gives me chills. Bill Paxton & Riz Ahmed deliver great performances in the supporting roles as well. The music and cinematography in this movie is simple and really drives the suspense as the movie starts to unfold. The script is classily written and still one of the smartest scripts of the last decade in cinema. Nothing in this movie feels out of place, it all serves a purpose. If you have not seen Nightcrawler and are a fan of any sort of thriller, this movie Will not disappoint you.",

He's won a lot of acclaim for his roles in other films but he's unbelievable in this one. Not only in his performance but for how he must have prepared for the role. He lost a shit load of weight in preparation to play Lou Bloom and it makes him so much creepier in his performance. I mean the character is a pretty disgusting guy and usually Jake is a heart throb in Hollywood but in this film he's skinny and so creepy looking. Obviously his features are something we're used to being filled out but here he's indistinguishable from his previous roles as he's so gaunt and drawn. \n\n\nNot only is his performance amazing but the film itself is bloody brilliant. It's so unique. We all love a fresh story. Not one that's not been done to death or remade over and over. This is a completely different story and we're here for it. I don't know if the murder news cycle in America is as hotly as contested as this but if it is then I feel sorry for the people in that industry. What you must have to see must be truly disturbing. \n\n\nNightcrawler offers us so many twists and turns. The main reason we get so gripped is because we wonder how far Bloom will go to get the perfect story. With each passing tragedy he stoops lower and lower. His poor assistant is literally thrown into situations he never thought he would be in. You wonder whether he will finally see Bloom as the evil man he is and report him or whether Bloom will continue to get more depraved. This is truly a great film. It has great performances all around and a constant building tension throughout it's runtime. I have to watch this film at least once each year as it's so brilliant. Definitely one you can revisit again and again. \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lu as if he is Jaquine Phoenix's Joker. Both characters are nice enough that you can have a pleasant conversation with them, but you know that they could strike at any moment without warning. Both also do things that are very illegal and look for careers that suit their passions. Even though the acting is great in this movie, the overall message and theme in this movie really confuses me. The movie overall feels like it's trying to teach you something but it's not. This movie could have been a lot more complex and have more depth than it did. During the entire movie we see Lu getting his way and doing illegal things that benefit him and we, as an audience, expect to get what he deserves for doing all of these wrong things. Then in the end, he gets exactly what he always wanted. His own video news production company. I was really dumbfounded by this. I guess the theme or message is that the world is unfair and sometimes horrible people get what they want without consequence? Even if that was the message this movie was trying to say, this movie could have been a lot more complex in this area as in how the news media can manipulate situations and control peoples lives without them realizing it. This movie also needed a better score. The music didn't really give me the feeling of tension or anything for that matter. But overall it is still a great movie with great pacing, directing, and acting.",

When it comes to intimate character studies of unhinged individuals, 'Nightcrawler' unquestionably ranks high alongside 'Taxi Driver' and the incredibly divisive 'Joker'.  Along with its airtight screenplay which never wastes a single moment on anything not pertinent to the central story, Gyllenhaal easily gives a career-best performance as an admittedly persistent individual with a laser-focused ambition and drive to do any and everything to succeed, morally or immorally.  The conflicting thing about Lou (Gyllenhaal) is that, he has that drive, that craving if you will, to achieve more and move up.  However, his means of doing so is nefarious, illegal, and in some parts inhumane.  He is no doubt an antihero; his motives are clear, but his ways of navigating them to reach his goals are what make him ultimately evil.  I feel like 'Nightcrawler' conveys more than just one thing about society and people.  Among these are the very plausible idea that, perhaps to individuals as sociopathic as Lou, succeeding can be a breezy no-brainer; after all, what's stopping them?  The wellbeing of others?  No.  A conscience?  Nope.  Empathy?  Uh uh.  Sympathy?  Try again.  Lou is the embodiment of corporations who will do whatever it takes to stay afloat, grow bigger, and relentlessly expand even at the expense of other people.  It's hard to believe he is a human being, what with his extremely calculating, razor sharp precision and machine-like way of getting what he wants.  I will no doubt be revisiting this in the future.  The cinematography is great, the score complements the dark tone, the performances are of the highest caliber, the pacing is bang-on thanks to a superb script anchored by phenomenal dialogue, and of course a mesmerizing performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.  'Nightcrawler' is entertaining, visceral, intense, creepy, thought-provoking, and all around robust filmmaking at its best.",

Laser-focused and analytical in all things, he's amoral to the core. He communicates in long, precise sentences that cut straight to the point, strategically disarming his conversational adversaries before they even know they've entered a sparring match. If not for the obvious physical indications, one might question if he's human at all. The one exception might be his fondness for composition, an endless pursuit of sublime photographic harmony amidst the broken glass and shattered bodies of a fatal auto accident. The rescue crews and police officers, also present amidst the carnage, are mere obstacles between his lens and the natural beauty he finds, bleeding and gurgling, upon the asphalt.\n\nAs Gyllenhaal grows bolder and more calculated in his nightly hunt for that next great shot, the stakes increase and his eye grows more selective. It all culminates in a masterful climax, a white-knuckle chase scene, that pulled me from my cozy spot on the couch to a closer seat on the floor, a few feet removed from the TV screen.

            "content": "I was disturbed by this film but in a good way as it commented on the shallowness of current media coverage and had a clear perspective on the events that unfolded without seeming too po-faced. Director Dan Gilroy made the film in the 2010s, a decade when crime had evolved significantly since the gritty 1970s, but he updates the style of a film like Taxi Driver (1976) for the modern age effectively. What the film received particular notice for at the time of it's release was the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal who went from handsome leading man to scary psychopath with a positive response coming from critics and audiences alike.\n\nPsychopathic thief Lou Bloom, Jake Gyllenhaal, is inspired to become a freelance journalist after witnessing others being successful in the position and realizing that he can sell footage that he captures to local news stations for a large amount of money. He is initially a failure but eventually records a carjacking incident and has his footage bought by the calculating executive Nina Romina, Rene Russo. She informs him that they want extra gruesome events to be recorded and if these take place in wealthy parts of town audiences are titillated and excited by seeing it. He begins to stage accidents so that his footage looks more presentable and has enough money to hire assistant Rick, Riz Ahmed, to accompany him on his trips at night to capture accidents. He forces Rick into compromising situations so that their videos are more impressive and forces Romina to offer him sexual favors in exchange for him continuing to provide her with good footage. He then almost kills his competitor Joe Loder, Bill Paxton, when he disables his car and tensions arise between himself and Rick as they become involved in a serious crime.\n\nBloom's total disconnect from humanity and selfishness in all situations could make it hard to relate to him but the film is still mesmerizing as we are horrified by the nearly dystopian world he appears to live in. The city he wanders through at night is a world of the morally bankrupt and tortured but the few innocent people who just happen to be caught in the crosshairs are those who Bloom takes advantage of. As they bleed out in their shiny cars or crawl along the pavement he is there tracking their misery and to him this is not immoral as he has no idea what it is like to be one of them and their suffering is simply something to sell through his eyes. The only person that he seems to really understand is Romina and yet he still feels the need to manipulate her in order to have her sleep with him and there is a confrontational tone to all of their interactions. The final scene they share together in which they stare into one another's eyes and excite over the gory footage he has taken gilds the lily too much but for most of the film's running time the weird romance that develops between them is fascinating to follow.\n\nGyllenhaal does give a chilling performance in the lead role and despite the fact that he may draw too much from a young Robert De Niro you can't really blame him when he is asked to play a psychopath in a 1970s style thriller. He has those famous bug eyes and a smile that seems genuine when delivered in real life but that can easily be twisted into something disturbing. Russo, given one of her first great parts in years, matches him as the cynical executive who views everything in terms of money and has a disconcerting glint in her eye when she meets somebody who is as ruthless as her. The film really belongs to the two of them as they are the two actors who make the most impact and while Ahmed is fine as the squirrelly assistant he is no match for Gyllenhaal.\n\nScorsese devotees will have seen all this before and will be unimpressed by the way it plays with the form ever so slightly but for an effort at recapturing some of Scorsese's early career brilliance it is better than a film like Joker (2019).",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a gloriously dark journey through night-time Los Angeles, where Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is making a name for himself as a \"stringer\" \u2013 a freelance journalist who captures graphic footage of crime scenes, turning a profit by selling it to TV stations. Unlike many journalist protagonists who came before him, Lou doesn't endeavour to walk a tightrope between legitimate reporting and exploitative intrusion; instead, he shamelessly scavenges for the most provocative \u2013 and therefore most profitable \u2013 material, going so far as to engineer crime scenes to create the grisliest effect. Lou's manipulation of the world around him is not limited to the crimes he stages; rather, it extends to all aspects of his life, which he is able to manipulate to his advantage. Nightcrawler is a fantastic film because it delights in Lou's capacity to make his desires manifest, and depicts his tenacity and nerve with humour. It succeeds because it never defers to its audience with obligatory scenes, such as explaining away Lou's behaviour or doling out the justice that many audience members yearn for.\n\nNightcrawler attests to the power of cinematography to support characterisation and sub-text. A wide-angle lens is paired with shallow depth of field throughout the film, often rendering everything on screen out of focus except for Lou. This serves to reflect Lou's worldview, in which he is the only thing that matters. Lou's isolation from other people is reflected in the framing of shots, which frequently position him on his own rather than in over-the-shoulder or two-shots which would signify intimacy with other characters. Even when sharing the frame with another person, long shots are employed to suggest distance. As a result, Lou's aloneness in the world is palpable, his separation from society conveyed through visual techniques.\n\nI found the scenes where Lou is capturing footage on his camera to be the most visually interesting. While the crime scenes and dead bodies that comprise Lou's subject matter are presented as blurry and out of focus through the film's lens, we can simultaneously see the images depicted with clarity through the viewfinder in Lou's camera. This demonstrates how Lou's interest in reality and the world around him is contingent on its purpose within the media, and ultimately his own success.\n\nNightcrawler could not have succeeded without Jake Gyllenhaal's fantastic portrayal of the voracious Louis Bloom. It was satisfying to watch Gyllenhaal cast against his usual type of wide-eyed ingenu here. His expressive eyes, usually employed to fawn over women in romantic comedies, are disturbingly repurposed in Nightcrawler to express his fascination with the suffering of others, and how it will serve his lofty ambitions. Gyllenhaal simultaneously conveys emotional detachment towards the world around him and emotional intensity towards that which is incidental to his success.\n\nA reading of other reviews regarding Nightcrawler suggests there is a multitude of ways of reading this film. Some view the film as a commentary on the exploitative nature of the media, which capitalises on selling human suffering as entertainment. This perspective condemns the media for motivating behaviour such as Lou's. This is a weak argument, given that Lou's deviant behaviour is evident before he is rewarded for it. The media didn't create Lou, it is merely a convenient platform for him.\n\nNightcrawler has also been interpreted as a satire of millennial entitlement and the cultural adage that one can achieve anything as long as they try hard enough. Lou references the importance of hard work throughout the film, and even states \"I was raised with the self-esteem movement so popular in schools\". Further, Lou projects an exaggerated image of himself and his company (Video Production News) in a manner not dissimilar to the embellished social identities projected by millennials on social media platforms. The marketing campaign for Nightcrawler played on this concept by setting up Twitter and LinkedIn profiles for Louis Bloom, as well as posting a video resume on YouTube, thereby reflecting the bootstrapping ideology of millennial culture.\n\n\nI take issue with the above interpretations, as they suggest that the film is condemning Lou's behaviour. In watching Nightcrawler it is clear that the film delights in Lou's tenacity and nerve, revelling in the absurdity of his behaviour. Thus, I prefer to read the film as a comment on embracing one's true nature rather than conforming to the social norm. The journey of Nightcrawler sees Lou progress from attempting to fit into a traditional lifestyle at the beginning \u2013 where he attempts to get an unpaid internship during the daytime \u2013 to accepting that he is at his best when separated from societal expectations. Lou discovers the world of stringer journalism, where his natural inclinations are rewarded. As a result, Lou is more powerful and more authentic when he exits the film than when he enters it. As such, Nightcrawler is ultimately a film about coming into your own and finding a path to expressing your true nature. It is about the triumph of authenticity over conformity, the triumph of the individual over society.",

Things kind of pick up in the second half as he starts manipulating everyone around him - cops, co-workers, criminals.  By about the 90 minute mark, I was hooked.  It was obvious the whole scheme was going to go south, you just couldn't tell exactly how yet. Most crime thrillers at this point would focus on the cops making the bad guy squirm in his guilt, but Louis walks out of the police station like he was buying a pack of gum.\nThere seems to be a bunch of commentary about the callousness of the media, and I guess something about how psychopaths who run companies abuse their employees while smoothing it over with business jargon.  The end of this movie is compelling, although it is neither fun nor enjoyable to watch.",

His unwitting, desperate assistant, a young guy who just needs $$$ to survive, eventually sees his own moral compass spin as he negotiates with a master manipulator. Bill Paxton, playing a veteran nightcrawler with wit, grit and quirky charm is darkly comic relief. Stunning cinematography rounds out this thrill a minute ride. Find it.

Perhaps it's because so many of us can identify with the need to succeed and why so many choose to do anything to meet this need, even at the expense of hurting others. This film may be more appropriate today, 2019, when there is so much horror in politics and so many decrying \"fake\" news. People in show business as well as in journalism, politics and other fields should really relate to how people are used and abused for money and position. While the focus here is strictly on journalism, it applies to a great many fields of endeavor. Renee Russo also shines in this picture as she usually does. She and Gyllenhaal are an even match in good acting and play off each other very well as overly ambitious people who have chosen or simply never had, ethics or morality. There's quite a bit of dark humor to keep it from bringing the viewer down watching the leads acting out the worst of their character. The ending is sad and dark but realistic.My only hope is that it doesn't parallel where our current society ends up. I prefer to have more hope and faith in people. I guess I'll just have to wait for the sequel, should it come in my lifetime.",

Everything the movie sets acts as the essentials for its conclusion and message, nothing ever feels too much or too heavy just for the sake of nailing that roughly 2-hour runtime like most heavy-budget films do.\n\nThis movie is not a heavy-budget project, and that's not the case, but the case is its purpose and the message it delivers through the end of its final act. \n\nThe movie is not from a horror perspective, but its thrilling setting up of events makes your heart beat and makes you wander about what is to happen next, it simply makes you care.\n\nLue is clearly shown from the beginning itself as a criminal, in disguise of a man looking for a job but yet a hard-working and polite one. Due to the film's incredible focus of detail and fantastic pacing, you get thrilled to the building up of events and thus, provokes your thoughts which intensifies your hype and care for what's to happen next.\n\nLue is amazingly polite, full of charm but the slow build of events and character building allows you discover the flaws with his disturbed self once put in play near the ending of the film. Inspite of knowing that Lue is completely wrong and using what he calls \u2018employees' just for the sake of his success and greed, we still get to empathize with the character which is why Lue simply doesn't have a character arc, adding to the fact that the main protagonist of the movie is yet the villain himself, which the society seeks to accept and build up upon, decieved by his hard-working character trait to just serve their need for money, entertainment etc.\n\nThe film's cinematography also expertly lines with its message and the protagonist's goal.",

There is a great feeling that you get of Lou's antics becoming more and more extreme. The film lacks humor and I think it plays to the style of Lou himself, a person that barely seems to know what humor is. The downside of this movie is too me it seems very plain. The point is to see how others interact with Lou as someone who very calmly and professionally responds. Lou does not evolve as a character only evolve in business, professionalism, and in relationships with others. Overall very interesting film with a dark tone that works well for the subject matter, but as a movie it seems that the 2 hour runtime plays against it seemingly wearing out the audience by the end.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a thoroughly unsettling character study.\n\nDan Gilroy wrote and directed the creepiest thriller I've seen in a long time with his film Nightcrawler (2014). It is a gripping and unnerving suspense film depicting the profile of a sociopath. We see Lou's shallow motives built up by manipulation, threats, and even violence. Nightcrawler is a demonstration of society without ethics fueled by a moral depravity. It is captivating from beginning to end.\n\nGilroy's critique of the media's process of obtaining raw footage unethically is scathing. He puts up the idea that the news will show anything regardless of the tastelessness of the material as long as it gets them ratings and viewers. The moral void of Nightcrawler is chilling. Even the decent editor of the newsroom that suggests what they are doing is wrong is shutout for the sake of ratings. What we consider good news is as reviewed as immoral without value. Nightcrawler even depicts another unethical cameraman with Bill Paxton's character Joe, so that the audience knows there are other men like Lou who think there is no privacy. Nightcrawler is a depressing state of the media as a business bent on entertaining rather than informing.\n\nAdditionally, Nightcrawler is primarily a heart stopping character study of a man without a conscious. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as Lou Bloom. He depicts this freelance cameraman as a morally reprehensible, criminal mastermind without boundaries. Gyllenhaal is supremely creepy and horrifying with increasingly unethical line stepping. Nightcrawler opens on Lou killing a security guard and stealing his watch, then it goes downhill from there. Gyllenhaal kills it portraying Lou with a vocal pathological liar persona and a cold calculating manipulative front to all around him. Gyllenhaal captures Lou's quiet hate and inner rage just on the surface. He will go down as one of cinema's greatest villains.\n\nReno Russo and Riz Ahmed are fantastic in Nightcrawler. Their supporting roles are the perfect foils for Gyllenhaal's character. They speak out and suffer for it, all while being victimized by Lou in one fashion or another. They feel normal and natural to their world and portray people that could really exist. In Russo's case, we see her lack of ethics in that she appreciates Lou's madness all for his exclusive footage. Russo does a great job depicting Nina's darker side. On the other hand, Ahmed is endearing as the everyman dragged into a horrid situation with no out as his character Rick is so impoverished.\n\nLastly, James Newton Howard's score is pounding and unsettling with every note crawling under your skin. Howard is the perfect accompaniment for this twisted thriller.\n\nNightcrawler is the highly underrated psychological look into the mind of a madman who will not stop at any cost. Gyllenhaal's subtle performance filled with boisterous venom is worth the price of admission.",

This is extremely unusual for me, but I have immense admiration for this passion project, and it is without a doubt one of my favourite pieces of filmmaking.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nEverything in this movie I love, to say the least. It seems crazy for me to think about having seen it so often, yet still it all works so well and fully gets me.\u00c2\u00a0\nGoosebumps, laughter, utter shock... all over and over again.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWhat Dan Gilroy has crafted is impeccable, not just for an debuting director, but overall.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI believe if you truly give your whole attention to Nightcrawler, you will find endless details in it, that will make you fall in love with it deeper and deeper.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis is a film that has so much to say without ever being judgemental.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is simply stating facts about our society and about what can happen when you leave your empathy and morals alone in your apartment.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI would like to mention that I liked Roman J. Israel Esq. as well and have seen that once so far. In a few days or weeks I will rewatch that, partially because I want to prepare for Dan Gilroy's third outing, but also 'cause I wanted to see it right after my first viewing of it anyways.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThere's really something about the honesty and the delivery of it all, that so far just glues me to the screen of a Dan Gilroy movie. It is thanks to his vision and thrilling but knowingly underwritten scripts, it is thanks to John Gilroy's great editing, and of course to mention one important name out of many also thanks to the genius of cinematographer Robert Elswit.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe score is also very important and masterfully done by James Newton Howard. It all takes you right into the mind of the main character.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI almost even forgot to mention the stellar performances in here. To my mind all of the three performances that the movie focuses on are easily Oscar nomination worthy and in Jake Gyllenhaal's case it's needless to say he should have won it that year.\u00c2\u00a0\nI am blown away each time by his portrayal of Louis Bloom, who as a matter of fact, is the character I am most fascinated with, in all of cinema history. There is so much to interpret into his words and no need for any backstory, it's amazing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI am very excited to see what the crew has done with Velvet Buzzsaw, which is apparently coming out in February of next year.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThese films are like rare animals.",

A chance encounter leads him to set himself up as a freelance cameraman who spends his evenings listening to police radio messages in order to get to the scene of accidents and murders so as to film graphic footage to sell to a local TV news station. His desire to get bigger and more salacious stories is encouraged by a ruthless news editor, Nina (Rene Russo) and by his rival cameraman Loder (Bill Paxton). Bloom is a truly disturbing character who will stop at nothing to get his way and is devoid of a sense of morality. Gyllenhaal nails this role perfectly, even seeming to blink in a cold hearted, reptilian manner. The tension that Dan Gilroy notches up and up makes some of the scenes very uncomfortable to watch and there are a fair few heart thumping car chases thrown in for good measure. This is a kind of blackly comical psychopath story which is a damning assessment of the lengths that a poorly regulated television industry will go to in order to chase ratings. Nightcrawler is a really skilful, horrifying movie with a good plot and excellent cast.",

It's another thing entirely to see the dark underbelly, the very people that provide the media with those bloody images and horrifying tag-lines.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Louis Bloom is astounding. Creepy and unsettling and downright loathsome - yet absolutely captivating to watch. Bloom is an excellent example of the type of sociopath that would be drawn to nightcrawling, to making money off the suffering and misery of others.\n\nThe script, performances, soundtrack and cinematography come together to form an incredibly tense and quietly ominous film. I held my breath throughout the entire scene where Louis calmly explains to Rick (Riz Ahmed) that he will hurt him badly if he doesn't cooperate. The almost uplifting music during the scene where Louis drags a man's corpse for a better shot is downright disturbing.\n\nNightcrawler also does an excellent job of creating and capturing the atmosphere of Los Angeles at night. The film pulls you in and makes you a part of that world. The incredible cinematography does a lot in this regard, with beautiful shots of the city at night and fast-paced driving sequences.\n\nNightcrawler is a fantastic film, but it certainly isn't for everyone. Some may be put off by the honest and brutal portrayal of the ambulance-chasing media coupled with the cold, manipulative, and completely unlikable character of Louis Bloom.",

We have desensitized ourselves, and though most people won't go to the extremes Louis Bloom will, Rene Russo's character fittingly has one rule for what makes it to air. \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nAt the very least, Nightcrawler is an interesting commentary on modern society and where our priorities lie.

But this movie has all the marks of a great movie, great acting, lighting, original plot and story, as well as original characters with different personalities. This is a bit of a lengthy film as it nears the 2 hour mark, but it does NOT feel like it. This movie went by almost too quick for me, by the time it was over I wanted more like binge watching a good TV Show. One of the only fair and true 10/10 5 star ratings I'm going to be handing out of the movies I've watched recently for sure, this surpassed most things I've been watching because I've been running out of movies to watch! I have seen almost every or any classic movie you can name, pretty much 90%+ of all the horror genre movies ever probably as well.

            "content": "Local news stations live and die by the ratings. Whether it's the royal wedding or a high-speed chase, reporters toil around the clock for the next big story that will increase the viewership and advertising revenue of their stations. When however, does the next big story cease to be news? \"Nightcrawler\" highlights the broad line between good journalism and morbid entertainment, and what can happen when that line is crossed.\n\nDespite being credited as the film's lead, there is no trace of Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Nightcrawler.\" Losing 30 pounds to play the part, Gyllenhaal immerses himself into the role of petty thief Lou Bloom both physically and psychologically.\n\nFrom the opening shots of the film, you can tell that something is off about Bloom. After stealing chain links from a fence on private property, he assaults a security guard, delivers the stolen materials to a Los Angeles construction site and tries to sell himself as a potential employee to the site manager.\n\nNoticing a car crash on his drive home, Bloom pulls over to investigate. Two freelance videographers arrive at the scene shortly after and film police officers pulling the driver from the burning wreckage. When asked by Bloom, one of the cameramen reveals that he and his partner drive around LA, filming anything and everything to sell to the news station that will pay the most. \"If it bleeds it leads,\" the cameraman tells him. Inspired by the encounter, Bloom pawns a stolen bicycle, purchases a camcorder and a police scanner and begins working as a stinger.\n\nBloom presents his first clip of footage to local TV news station director Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who describes her station's newscast as, \"a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" Bloom adheres to this ideology in his work, exposing his darker nature to the audience. Infatuated with his growing success, Bloom pushes every moral and legal boundary imaginable to get the perfect shot.\n\nGyllenhaal's performance is enthralling. Despite the disturbing and sociopathic nature of his role, his character intrigues you. Bloom is passionate. Bloom is driven. Bloom is wickedly smart. He has an eerie charisma about him that seeps under your skin.\n\nRene Russo is also exceptional. Unlike Bloom, Romina fully comprehends the magnitude of her choices, sacrificing her morality for television ratings. When the thrills of Bloom's nocturnal crusades are sucking you in, Kevin Rahm's character, Frank Kruse, serves as the conscience to bring you back to reality. Despite his efforts, the concerns of the honest journalist sadly get swept under the rug by the prowess of Bloom and Romina.\n\nThe cinematography and editing by Robert Elswit and John Gilroy fuel the intensity of the acting. Whether Bloom is recruiting his partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) at a diner in the late afternoon or he is pursuing a high-speed car chase in the heat of the night, each scene is an exhilarating experience. The film's many shining qualities are only a testament to the thought-provoking script of Dan Gilroy.\n\nThe scenes and dialogue bring to mind recent events such as the shooting of reporter Allison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in Virginia. In the shooting's aftermath, there were news websites and stations that chose to run the footage from a video posted online by the shooter, which showed the victims being shot at close range. The ethicality of this has been questioned, as it shows little respect for the victims' families. Sadly however, footage of this magnitude engages our morbid curiosity, and Gilroy explores this truth as the basis of Bloom and Romina's actions in the film.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Gyllenhaal humorously remarks, \"There is a Lou in all of us. I don't know if that disturbs you!\" While I think this is far from the case, our culture as a whole contributes considerably to the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" mentality. Next time you see a brutal or disrespectful video, don't support it. Don't promote it. We can change the rating trends. We can rise above the culture.",

Time to review Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. You first, Gregger.\n\nGREG: Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disreputable young man who makes ends meet by stealing chain link fence and manhole covers for the money he can negotiate from the smelters. He is scraping the bottom of the barrel when he happens upon an accident where he witnesses some professional videographers who crawl the night looking for stories to film and sell to area newscasts. Louis decides this is an easy way to make money and steals a bicycle which he hocks for a camcorder and police radio receiver.\n\nSCOTT: Lou first films the scene of a fatal accident and takes the clip to a local TV station whose new director, Nina (Rene Russo), welcomes his gory footage. She encourages him to bring her videos of violent accidents and crime scenes with white affluent victims. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Rick Garcia), and the two men find some success hunting down bloody car collisions and murders to put on film. To obtain better videos, Lou alters some crime scenes and arranges dead bodies to create better images. He even sabotages a competitor s van so that his competitor suffers a gruesome accident for Lou to film. One night he and Rick arrive at the scene of a horrific mass murder before the police have arrived. This sets in motion more graphic violence for Lou to orchestrate (and videotape) with the goal of earning more money from Nina.\n\nGREG: Scott, Nightcrawler is an intense look behind the scenes of local news. It s not enough to show the events as they happen, but Lou is advised to find events that show the urban world encroaching on the suburban world. Or, to show people of color robbing or killing white people. These are the stories that garner higher ratings. And higher ratings garner more advertising dollars. Lou realizes this and starts to manipulate not only the crime scenes he s supposed to be reporting on, but also the people around him. He convinces his  intern  Rick to work for peanuts and even gets Nina to sleep with him so that he will continue to feed her these high-value videos. Lou is an unusual hero for a movie. He has many of the characteristics we look for in a hero. He s resourceful as he finds a way to make a living. He is intelligent - he studies the internet and reads up on all things having to do with network news and how it works behind the scenes. In his own way, he is charismatic as he uses his motivational speaker skills (which he learned from the internet) to induce people to do things they really don t want to do. He rises from a position of low social status to running his own business. But he severely lacks any empathy for how other people feel. He is completely self-absorbed and manipulates people into doing things that are illegal and ultimately even life-threatening. He will do anything to get what he wants, no matter the cost to others. Scott, Lou Bloom is a textbook definition of the anti-hero. He is a villainous person cast in the role of the lead character of the story. Unlike the more likable anti-heroes (like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or Bonnie and Clyde), we learn to fear and even despise Lou Bloom.\n\nSCOTT: For me, Nightcrawler is a disturbing look at a disturbed man. Lou is a classic sociopath who lacks a conscience and has no empathy, remorse, or moral core. He uses people and hurts people to obtain his goals. We ve seen characters like this in the movies before, of course, but usually they are secondary characters, i.e., the villains who occupy limited screen time. But in Nightcrawler, we re subjected to Lou s heinous character for two solid hours. He appears in just about every scene. Although this film was extremely well made, I was uncomfortable being exposed to pure evil for such an extended period of time in the form of Lou s psychopathic personality and escalating malevolent behavior. It was relentless. As you point out, Greg, we know villains share four of the Great Eight attributes of heroes. Lou is smart, strong, charismatic, and resilient. But Lou is lacking the most telltale signs of a hero: He has no heart. It was repugnant watching him deliberately ignore suffering people, harm others, and even kill them, in order to sell his videos at a higher price to Nina. Nightcrawler makes us think about the ethics of paparazzi and ambulance chasers. It even raises ethical issues about television news journalism and where they can and should draw the line between morality and legality.\n\nGREG: With Lou already playing such a villainous role, it s hard to identify any villains in Nightcrawler. Lou s arc of going from harmless gadfly to devious mastermind is the epitome of the Villain s Journey - which is the mirror image of the Hero s Journey. So, I look for the more heroic characters to offset Lou s villainy. Nina is already a pretty cut-throat news director. She ll do anything to advance her career - even put clearly illegal source material on the air. She doesn t offer an impediment to Lou s advance. In fact, she aids it. There is a minor character in the form of the station manager, but while he is the voice of morality and reason, he offers little in the way of opposition to Lou. The rival video company owned by Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) is Lou s only opposition. He s a good guy, plays by the rules. But he s a tough businessman. At one point he see s Lou s abilities and tries to hire him. But instead of taking Joe s offer, Lou tampers with Joe s brake line and causes him to be in an accident that heartless Lou films for the morning news. And that ends any opposition that Lou might have.\n\nSCOTT: Really, the only decent character with any screen time is Rick, who plays the role of the sidekick who repeatedly questions Lou s actions and character. Rick is in such desperate need of money that he looks the other way while Lou engages in awful conduct. Rick s also such a weak character that he is no match against Lou when the two men eventually collide over morals. If there is an oppositional force at work against Lou, it exists mostly in the form of the ineffectual Los Angeles Police Department, who appear at the scenes of accidents and murders, and who also try to keep Lou from getting in the way of emergency personnel as well as their investigations of what happened at these scenes. The LAPD may be the type of villains that we call institutional villains -- a large bureaucratic entity that lurks in the background as the main impediment to our main character s goals.\n\nGREG: Nightcrawler is more frightening than any horror movie for its vivid portrayal of the realities of mainstream news. The thing that makes it scary is just how real and current the story is. This could be happening now. This is a tale about how we are being fed stories - and how they could potentially being crafted - to titillate and spread fear in the name of news and money. It begs the question - what is news? I give Nightcrawler 5 out of 5 Reels for showing us a very scary reality. Lou Bloom is a terrifying anti-hero cast in the world of network news. He frightens us not for any super powers that he might have, but for how amazingly ordinary he seems to be. He seems in every way an under achiever. He is not handsome, overly intelligent, or even athletic. But he is a cunning villain in the way he manipulates his prey. We are witness to a complete Villain s Journey here. I give Lou Bloom 5 out of 5 Villains. There are no strong heroes in this story for Lou to combat. You ve already pointed out that the LAPD detectives were completely ineffectual against Lou. And rival Joe Loder was no match for Lou. A stronger hero for our anti-hero would have made Nightcrawler a completely different movie. I can only give these side-heroes 2 out of 5 Heroes.  Movie:  Villain:  Heroes:  \n\nSCOTT: Nightcrawler is an extremely well made movie but you won t catch me watching it again. The movie is two relentless hours of the devil in human form at work on the streets of Los Angeles. I was disturbed by the main character (notice that I cannot call him a hero) and his wanton disregard for human life, and it was disheartening that no heroic character in the film could even come close to combating him. I don t know what good can come from making such a movie or even watching it, other than the possibility that it can be used as fodder for ethical reform for the ways TV networks solicit film clips for their evening news. I give this movie 4 Reels out of 5 simply out of respect for the filmmaking and for Jake Gyllenhaals extraordinary performance. There is no hero in this story, as this is a tale of the triumph of evil. Our main character is the devil running roughshod over everyone in his path. Like a cancer, he just grows and grows in his size and power, and he is shown flourishing in the end. He doesn t change or evolve or transform like a heroic character might. He has no mentors or friends and he eliminates his sidekick when the sidekick outlives his usefulness. Our main character s evil simply gains strength for two disturbing hours. The absence of a hero story here leads me to assign a rating of 0 out of 5 Heroes. Inasmuch as our main character is a villain, this is a movie about villainy and how it blossoms. Nightcrawler shows us how villainy is allowed to prosper when we allow it to prosper, when we condone it, when we cooperate with it, and when we place money ahead of principles. Nina and Rick are probably not terrible people; they simply succumb to greed. As the main character, Lou does encounter some resistance from a rival videographer (whom Lou severely injures), a sidekick Rick (whom Lou eliminates), and the LAPD (whom Lou outsmarts).  There aren t many villain stories that are better told than this one, and so I ll give Lou an impressive 4 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villain:  Heroes: 0",

A linear script, which contains some difficulties in guiding its acts and abuses at various climax, but what is necessary to take the monotony. Telling the story of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with an immense penchant and an insatiable desire to win in life, with difficulties of getting a job and living from petty thefts, he discovers a new market, selling accident videos And murders on local television channels, such a market becomes Lous's obsession, which does everything to stand out and does not put any effort or scruples. We can not judge so much Louis, a man with ambition and desire to overcome insatiable, we can not judge his work or even his coldness, only his crimes can be judged, the biggest villains are the public itself indulging in a basic human curiosity, Morbid curiosity, this interest generates the market that generates interest in exploiting it, this is a trade, and the criticism of the film is precisely on top of that, the despair of the television channels in selling death, and the little concern to understand or help Victims, what counts is the exploitation of its disgrace. The film has an extremely urban photograph, at times it remembers the great \"Drive\", with a palette of colors that always strives to emphasize the night, a good sound mix and a basic but competent assembly, the soundtrack is discreet, but When it appears, she talks to Louis, and the film seeks not to sell violence, other than the same shows, this is interesting, as it seeks to reach the public with its quality rather than pure appeal. The biggest highlight of the film for me is Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who completely embodied himself for the movie, losing I0 kilos, not flashing, and even the way of walking is different, Jake is incredible, with a sociopathic face and really looking like A vulture, he completely steals the scene, not just the scene, the whole movie, you feel the desperation in his eyes, the despair of anyone who would do anything to achieve their goal, Jake makes the best performance of his career. Finally, \"O Abultre\" is a great and interesting film, it details itself in small details, but it is very well acted and has a very interesting morality.",

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie where the characters are this repulsive. I know there are people out there like Lou in this business, but he's not someone I want to be associated with. And it gets a lot of the TV stuff wrong. Lou and Nina wouldn't spend five minutes having a conversation after she has just said there was only 10 minutes to get this story on the air. Lou would realize that he wouldn't be able to talk to a reporter out live by just shouting something in the control room. Not a fun viewing experience for me.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler, a movie from a directorial debut of Dan Gilroy, whom which written and directed this modern masterpiece. \n It gives you a sense of unsettling and tense feel as the film starts introducing us to the main character, Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a person who is well educated, appreciated, however, one who is professional acting nice and showing signals of appreciation, as it differs in the inside of himself. He lives an unusual life, a thief who always wonders to find a career to achieve his goals. One day, he comes across some people filming crime scenes as a sale for news footage as for their career, also known as 'nightcrawling'. And so,  Louis Bloom involves as a curiosity into this business. As the film progresses, he gets very good and professional at the job, in fact.. he gets way too good at this job as he, himself commits crimes and acts in illegal actions.\n First off, Jake Gyllenhaal gives his finest role and performance throughout his career. He is absolutely courageous and self-conscious. He is fully engaged with that character, he withdraws himself and becomes fully the character Louis Bloom, which makes us the audience frightening and terrifying as we see him burst his way of performance. \n Also, it is so frightening how our main character Louis Bloom starts off as a protagonist, and as the film progresses, becomes an unexpected and fearful antagonist. However, so riveting and outstandingly written dialogue makes certain situations so exciting and realistic, adding unsettledness which makes us sweat in thrills. From these amazingly written dialogues, even though Louis Bloom transforms into an antagonist, we root for him, and we want him to succeed in every possible way, after all, he has committed crimes and taken illegal actions. \n Additionally, the last act, the last 15 to 20 minutes are the most suspenseful and hand-gripping finales that additionally decorates this film more beautifully. The streets of L.A look immaculately beautiful and flawlessly colored, which contains solid eye candy visuals.\n Overall, this film depicts the realism of the society as well as illustrating the character, Louis Bloom perfectly flawless. It is most certainly one of the best films of 2014 as well as the best-written script forms of this decade. For writer Dan Gilroy's first directorial debut, it is very impressive and unbelievable of what he accomplished.",

            "content": "3/24/17\nWhoah, Fox gave Nightcrawler his own movie? Oh wait, this isn't an X-Men movie, it's a crime thriller. Anyway, we open up by meeting Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a petty thief making money by stealing stuff and selling it, but only for himself, so he's no Robin Hood. In fact, he doesn't do anything as well meaning as Robin Hood. Anyway, after bargaining for a higher pay (and failing) he drives around until he sees an active crime scene and a pair of stringers film police pulling a woman out of a car crash. When one of the duo (Bill Paxton) reveals he's selling it to local news stations to use on air, Lou develops an ambition to boldly do what these guys do, and what follows is his machiavellian quest to be the very best stringer that no one ever was. We waste no time getting into the independent news chaser story, which makes sense from the discovery of this being a thing to the climactic \"in over his head\" climax. I'm going to be honest, the character of Lou Bloom is not very well developed, though we all have aspirations we should be careful not to choke on. In fact, you kind of grow to dislike Lou, which I think is the point of the movie, given the fact that he and his business partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) run around filming crime scenes and anything the police show up at to sell to a local news station. You really grow to dislike him because he's a pain to Nina (Rene Russo), the woman who runs the station Lou sells to, to the point he gets creepy on her, and I know we all have aspirations, but this guy crosses the line to the point where he's essentially a serial killer with a camera and a temper. It's also seen in the way he treats Rick: horribly. He's just relentless, thankless, and just plain rude to the guy who gives his time to help make these shenanigans possible. He's not very relatable in this sense, but Rick serves as the entry point for the audience, and the guy says what's on most viewer's minds: \"What the hell's he doing?\" He and everybody else get no real development, but for the relatability factor, I'll recognize him as the eyes of the audience. Nightcrawler also has this dark and gritty feel to it that just feels raw and believable, and everything we see advances the plot and speaks to the character of Lou Bloom and his insanity. Another flaw I'd like to point out though, is the vast levels of profanity. Was it really that necessary? It helps it feel raw, but I felt they could have toned down the language and made this accessible to younger audiences who should probably see this to see what media has become today: a scary, unpredictable force that brutally sticks to its guns in the face of being wrong. Before I go, I just wanna say James Newton Howard's score was a nice movie score, just getting that out there to end on a positive note. So now, I can say that Nightcrawler is a hard-hitting tale of modern media and the world of TV news in the age of the Internet, led by a psychotic cameraman who wants to be the very best at it for no real reason, seen through the eyes of a sane guy who just needs to make some money, and tells it like it is, unlike news media today.",

A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone. Mr. Gyllenhaal's startling portrayal is far from the only distinction in this impeccably crafted feature film. Mr. Gilroy's directorial debut connects its hero's tacit madness to the larger craziness of a broadcast medium that teaches vast numbers of viewers to live with a false sense of insecurity. Gyllenhaal is in almost every frame of writer-director Dan Gilroy's first feature, skinny and wide-eyed, running down a driveway with his camera or cutting across oncoming traffic in the Challenger. It's an intense performance, the flip side of Ryan Gosling's in \"Drive,\" playing the angles and filling space with empty words instead of soulful silences. Nightcrawler flourishes as a searing indictment on unchecked mania, workplace malpractice, and the forces that maintain them. A thick film of sleaze coats every frame of Nightcrawler, a movie that takes a hard look at media culture and provides Jake Gyllenhaal a terrific opportunity to creep us all out. Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

The movie, much like the stories that Bloom covers, moves at a breakneck pace and is always seeking to up the ante and become more shocking. I was delighted that Nightcrawler kept me guessing throughout, and I was definitely on the edge of my seat. Perhaps the most surprising choices they made were in the score. They made a brilliant decision to occasionally utilize the music as a way for us to get inside the character's head for a moment. So there are scenes that ordinarily would be played dark and gritty, but because of the elation that the main character feels at getting the story, we hear a more up-tempo shift in the score. That seems insignificant, but it's a hundred little decisions like that which make Nightcrawler so great. I would highly recommend it to people as a unique character study, and an intense thriller.",

            "content": "A directorial debut from Dan Gilroy portrays the story of Lou Bloom, a determined media-fanatic with a keen eye for journalism, who crosses the boundaries between morality and selfishness to build a successful news business. Now, I know that the plot doesn't sound like a convincing pitch, but believe me; you would be wrong to assume so. Before we get started, there is a possibility for a few spoilers as I will be discussing the film in some detail, so here is your SPOILER WARNING.\n\nA well written script is paramount for any film to entice an audience, and Nightcrawler does exactly this. The dialogue from the outset is authentic, natural and intriguing; which remains consistent through the movie's entirety. We can also thank Jake Gyllenhaal for this, for his performance was truly sublime. Bloom is everything to like in a person; he's a talkative, enthusiastic, determined character, yet there is a very sinister side to him that lies within his nature. He is desperate, who resorts to theft and even murder to earn a living. He is unaware of where the boundaries between right and wrong lie, and if he does, he has no hesitation in crossing them. As the film progresses, Bloom becomes truly frightening, doing whatever is necessary to obtain the footage that separates the wheat from the chaff; and this is what makes him so interesting. Whether we are supposed to root for him or be disgusted by his acts remains ambiguous,  but one thing we know for certain is that he is unique in his enthusiasm for being successful.\n\nNightcrawler shows exceptional insight into the world of journalism, but has no hesitation in displaying the flaws of the industry either. There's even a quote from the movie whereby Nina (Bloom's footage buyer) states \"we find our viewers are more interested in urban crime creeping into the suburbs. What that means is a victim or victims, preferably well-off and / or white, injured at the hands of the poor, or a minority.\" And that's the harsh reality; quite frankly nobody gives a damn about poor or ethnic-minority victims, and to bring such a reality at the forefront of our cinema screens, I can't help but admire the movie. Any film could depict the wonders of journalism, but instead, Nightcrawler takes a more realistic representation of the news industry.\n\nThe movie, however, can be somewhat silly at times. The shocking fact that Lou remains innocent and free to continue his role as an unorthodox crime-journalist is staggering. Throughout the movie he continuously tampers with the crime scenes and evidence to benefit his own cause, yet his involvement in these scenes remain non-existent in the eyes of law enforcement; despite his lack of effort to hide the fact that he was there. Yes it's a minor flaw, but it's hard not to wonder whether such circumstances would repeat itself in a real life scenario.\n\nDan Gilroy's Nightcrawler succeeds in bringing an authentic portrayal of the world of journalism to life, with crimes that feel so real and shocking in which audiences can't help but admire. Every monologue that spills from Lou Bloom's lips holds a significance to the plot and his character's development; all of which go together nicely into a neat package. It's fair to say that Nightcrawler was one of the hidden gems in 2014, and a film to respect and talk about for years to come.\n\nVERDICT: Pleasantly Surprised!",

One thing that I was fond of, was Gyllenhaal's performance; he never allows the creepy smile to leave his face, no matter the situation he gets himself into and gives an excellent performance.\n\n\tWhile I do not believe that the film attempts to exercise social criticism about journalism, it paints a beautiful, bleak, misanthropic picture. Inside the painting, our prowling protagonist finds his match in the TV-news people and especially in an aging news director  (Rene Rousso who matches Gyllenhaal performance-wise) whose job insecurity and amoral personality compels her to act more like a Grand Guignol director. \n\t\n\tAs the protagonist tries to grow his emerging business (at least in his own mind) we get another good supporting character in his (not very bright) assistant. Also, we get a clear view on how far the protagonist is able to go in order to get his scoop and realize his dream of becoming incorporated. \n\n\tI mentioned that the film does not exercise social criticism, because I wanted to clear the air from the notion the film is about journalism. I believe the film attempts criticism, and that lies with the protagonist's many rants about his goals for the future of his \"company\". The fact that anyone who has ever ridden the corporate roller-coaster will recognize the ramblings of this (clearly disturbed) person, as typical middle-management talk, is the heart of the film's commentary. \n\n\tWhile the film is not especially deep, is a beautiful dystopian experience, mainly thanks to the efforts of the main lead and the stylized direction. Good entertainment when you are in the mood for something dark. 7.0/10.",

The world of watching television news, and wondering who goes in and shoots the aftermath of accidents, crime, and violence? In NIGHTCRAWLER, the audience gets an up close look, personal and even harsh at times the world of videography for the news.\n\nThis film is a spectacular thriller. Its setting is in the city of Los Angeles and its night life. Jake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners, The Day After Tomorrow) plays the character Lou Bloom. He is a very driven young man, desperate to explore and work in crime journalism. He works with a camera, filming crashes, fires, violence, and other types of dangers. As the film goes on, Lou Bloom becomes an even stranger individual. He was so strange and crazy, I thought he would make a good joker for an upcoming Batman film. On the other hand, he has what the news team looks for. Someone who is dedicated, a quick learner, and has a positive attitude. Such as, willing to work with them, and bond.\n\nFurthermore, the films acting and directing were awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal's character really does come off as a strange yet driven and intelligent young man. Even though he isn't physically threatening, like other characters in films. but psychologically he is a crazy creep. He has greasy slick back hair, and he stares at you with those big eyes. The writer - director, Dan Gilroy did a great job of directing. I really enjoyed how at first he made Lou seem like an underdog and a new comer into this business, and then how lou transforms into the man he is by the end of the film. Also, the director made you feel like you were in the car with Lou, up and close. Getting to know him, and his intentions.\n\nSo these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts. Overall,this film has numerous things that are well done. Everything from the acting, writing, directing, and world of being a \"nightcrawler\" in a crime-scene videography for the evening news. It has good moments, and I believe it is definitely worth your time. I believe NIGHTCRAWLER earns a...\n\n9/10 !\n\nThis review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and viewing. Have agreat day as always. :)",

I don't mind a pessimistic ending, but his character obviously goes way too far, and gives himself plenty of rope to hang himself. Despite all the hints that his plans will be undone, the movie abruptly ignores all the clues to attempt a stinging ending. It felt forced and sudden, as if the writers were afraid to betray their admonishment of the news industry. In the end I think it undermined the message.",

            "content": "Neo-Noir is a very interesting genre; when used correctly it can add a much needed spice to film, especially where the crime drama is concerned. Nightcrawler, the latest effort into this field is a welcome new addition, mixing an atmospheric premise with a hint of media ethics and the drive of competition.\n\nNightcrawler is all about Louis Bloom; a conning sociopath who is looking for a way to make his fortune; as luck would have it, he stumbles across a group of freelance cameraman who get close-up footage on crimes in progress and sell it to local news agencies (nightcrawling). With a trusty employee in tow (played by Riz Ahmed), Bloom begins his foray into freelancing and crime journalism, all the while hiding his background behind a wall of well-rehearsed professional chit-chat. Taking place mostly at night, the film focuses on both Blooms' incursions into crime scenes and his bartering with the likes of news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). What makes Nightcrawler so engaging is its build-up; as Bloom's competition and desire to earn soars higher, his tactics and crime scenes grow more risky and intense. There are some really restless moments later on in the film and once the police begin to play a larger role, audiences simply won't be able to take their eyes off the film's proceedings. The film also delves into a few ethical issues in journalism including the presentation of graphic content, and the need for accuracy in the media. These issues never overshadow the central plot, which leads me to its only weakness; the ending. It sort of clunks to a fairly unsatisfying conclusion where there isn't any real consequence to the things Bloom does over the course of the film. While this is a disappointment, the journey the audience takes with the protagonist is certainly engaging, even if he's not exactly the one you would root for in a film of this style.\n\nAt the centre of Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal, who really does go a long way towards carrying the entire film. There's a two-sided approach to his performance which really captures the nature of his character; on the one hand he puts on deceiving look of professionalism, marking himself as someone who takes his work very seriously, while on the other he obsesses over his work to an almost psychotic degree. He's not a character that you necessarily support; instead you're endlessly intrigued by his exploits and deeds over the course of the film.  If there's one caveat to Bloom's character, it's that his central motivation is relatively simplistic; he simply wants money and will cheat anyone to get to it. While this doesn't impact Gyllenhaal's performance, it feels a bit lacking considering how he's introduced as a thief and trespasser. Some of the side characters are also relatively underdeveloped; because Gyllenhaal's acting is so strong, the supporting actors (most notably Bill Paxton as Bloom's main rival Joe Loder) feel pretty basic by comparison. This is less true of Rene Russo who brings a spark of charismatic flair to the news director archetype. Other than that, Nightcrawler's characters are competent, albeit fairly basic given the realistic setting.\n\nThanks to a great central performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler stands out as a solid, well produced thriller. While some of the characters could be more developed and the ending is quite underwhelming, the film's neo-noir style and strong pacing more than make up for its shortcomings.",

A young man named Lou Bloom lives off of others, which many would consider a thief. Once he discovers the underground world of television news, it'll transform him into a menacing psychopath.\n\nLet me just start out by saying Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor right now. In all honesty, he's my man crush if I ever had one because he's one of the most talented actors I've seen this decade. The way he's able to transform into different characters and conform to his role is breath taking, and it's actually scary in many ways. Without him, this movie would've been a lot different. Will he win an Oscar for all the amazing performances he's given lately? Probably not, but like DiCaprio, it doesn't matter. You don't need an Oscar to define you as one of the best actors, and I can't wait to see what more Gyllenhaal does with his career. \n\nThis movie is so unique in the way that it tells its story. The character of Lou Bloom is interesting in its own right, but setting the story in the television world of local news made the movie even more interesting. It was such a weird, yet perfect way to bring about the making of a maniac. I don't know if that's how local news actually works (news crews film crime and then sell footage to news stations), but it's interesting none the less. \n\nWhat I really took note of was the directing and the writing. I think that Dan Gilroy is so smart, and he did a great job of not only communicating his message to the casual viewer, but was really good at subtlety too.  There were some shots that I absolutely loved in this movie, and they weren't even big moments. They were very short scenes, but they were so smart and simple that it hooked me. The pacing is perfect in this movie, and it honestly feels scary sometimes.\n\nThe character of Lou Bloom is something else. Do I think Gyllenhaal is the prime reason this character was such a success? Yes. Was the writing still phenomenal? Yes. But the matter of the fact is, this is one of the scariest protagonists/antagonists of 2014. This guy is a complete as*hole up front. He's a killer, he's a thief, and he has every quality of a psychopath. I know I've used that word a lot, but it's true. This guy talks like a psychopath, acts like a maniac, and has the morales of a stone cold killer. Keep in mind, he's not unlikable by any means. I mean, he should be and in real life, I would hate this guy, but they execute it in a way that you're willing to go along this ride with him. It's a weird thing and in a sense, you're kind of rooting for evil. It's not only a psychological journey for the character, but for the viewer themselves.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this movie to most. Upon my third time watching this film, it's held up every single time.",

The premise may sound like the kind of gimmick that you'd find in 100 different bad films but, fortunately, this isn't one of them. \n\nIt looks at first as if Nightcrawler's goal is to outline the dangers of the modern 24-hour news culture that we now live in and, whilst this is certainly part of it, the movie actually avoids sweeping societal judgement and instead becomes a character study of the fictional Lou Bloom.\n\nGylleenhaal's performance is truly upsetting and in Nightcrawler we're reminded of the eerie elements of his performance as Donnie Darko.\n\nThis film is constantly challenging us in relation to what it depicts and its sleek and gritty style is a perfect match with this approach. Nightcrawler is a fine example of a script, cast, and director all having a similar take on what the end project should be and here, that unity pays off ten-fold. \n\nThe movie's unrelenting cynicism and grotesque nature does begin to take its toll, and so I was constantly concerned that the film would completely collapse on itself at any moment as it continued to outdo the previous shock-moment, time and time again. I do think that some of this concern turned out to justified as the story arc nearer the end felt just a bit too heavy-handed for me. \n\nStill, the film ended well and was always an exciting and challenging ride.

Nightcrawler was the last one I got myself into through this lazy method. \n\nAs you can clearly see from my rating, I was not disappointed in any way.\nThis movie is simply great. I am not very skilled at writing movie reviews so I'll be concise.\nJake Gyllenhaal is a genius of an actor and a monster in this movie. He plays a free lance sensational news footage maker who quickly turns his job into a morbid obsession. The more shocking the footage, the more money he gets, you know that kind of story very well. But I believe that the movie doesn't shine the most through its critical approach of emotional news reporting (targeting insecurities in order to raise the channel's ratings etc...), but through the character of Lou Bloom, an antisocial psycho who would break every ethic boundary to do better in what he loves doing and get more money. It might sound a bit easy to say this but Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is simply astonishing.  \nGreat night-time atmosphere (better than Drive, also don't know why I am mentioning this movie), the soundtrack sticks to the different tones of the movie even though it is not very memorable.\nMan, I don't know what to say, it's just great and I'll just leave a quote from Lewis Bloom himself : \"I would never ask you anything that I wouldn't do myself\".

First reacting to this movie I had an instant hate for Lou, which can probably be attributing to the acting. He is always five steps ahead and willing to do literally anything to get where he wants to be or how he wants the people around him to react. He is like a puppet master and everyone in the world is his puppets. He can probably very easily be categorized as a psychopath, but that's what makes the movie engaging. He goes the extra mile and always takes things too far. It leaves the audience on the edge of their seats. They hate him, but they want to see how the crime and his footage turns out. It's a very eerie movie and it leaves the viewer feeling on edge and skeptical about the media they consume, but I would highly recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for a thriller.",

Jake Gyllenhaal may not be America's favorite actor, but he sure does deserve some recognition for his role in this thrilling film. It was a wise choice for director / screenwriter Dan Gilroy to portray Lou Bloom as a thief first and foremost, as a thief is one of the oldest 'professions', the epitome of someone who is willing to do anything to get ahead. Gilroy's choice concisely reveals the core of who Bloom is and how he operates. Despite becoming wildly successful later on in his new line of work, Lou Bloom initially runs into difficulty landing an honest job--- why? Because you can't trust a thief. Some could say this is Gilroy's dig at Hollywood, which makes the Los Angeles setting all the more appropriate.\n\nThis film could not have taken place anywhere but Los Angeles, and Gilroy acknowledges this as he makes a point of incorporating the city as a supporting character with both beautiful and grungy landscape shots. The City of Angels is known for both the making and breaking of dreams, so a story about people putting aside their ethics to indulge in the supply and demand of the American fantasy seems apropos. Gilory's aesthetic is heavily reminiscent of fellow (adopted) Angeleno, Michael Mann, who also highlights the spirit of this city in his works. For a town that's brimming with swarms of paparazzi, willing to stick their cameras anywhere for the best shot, Nightcrawler's setting only seems natural. In fact, a disturbing realization came over me as I was watching the movie, which was that as a fellow LA resident, the world of Lou Bloom seems all too familiar.\n\nAs Lou Bloom, Gyllenhaal preys on the circumstance of his supporting cast, Nina (Rene Russo) and Rick (Riz Ahmed), forcing them to play his game within the confines of their limited situations. Nina and Rick's situations are unfortunately common in this biz. Nina, a jaded news director, is vying to keep network ratings high, but with her older age, she struggles to maintain her career. This leads her to make questionable choices in the gruesome footage she chooses to air on the nightly news. Lou takes advantage of her desperation, and is able to attain the upper hand though her vulnerability and need for his gory videos that draw in America to their televisions night after night. As a 60 year old actress, Russo must be facing some of the same challenges as many women of that ripe age in Hollywood, despite their talent and beauty, find themselves fighting for roles, usually of the matronly nature. Previous to the THOR franchise, Russo had a 6 year hiatus from the big screen, so it seems wise of Gilroy to write his wife into a role that she can so readily identify. Lou Bloom's manipulation of Nina would not have worked had it been with a man, or even a younger woman. Bloom knows the sad reality that is this business, and he takes full advantage of it. \n\nThere are people who don't seem to like Jake Gyllenhaal, so it seems that his latest film has him perfectly cast as a slimy thief, whose unstoppable ambitions land him at the top of the news broadcasting world in the new film, Nightcrawler.

Lou Bloom's manipulation of Nina would not have worked had it been with a man, or even a younger woman. Bloom knows the sad reality that is this business, and he takes full advantage of it. \n\nRick, practically homeless, faces the same dependency on Lou as Nina does. Desperately needing a job, Rick is willing to work for practically nothing under the guise of an 'internship', a concept that most young people entering the media world are well acquainted with. Lou Bloom is aware of Rick's desperation, and hires him as an assistant, knowing that he will do anything for little money. But as their videos increasingly blur the lines of morality, even Rick questions Lou's readiness to do whatever it takes. While Bloom has earned enough money to upgrade to a fancy new car, Rick is still left living out of a garage. It's a prevailing economic divide that is as common as the struggle of women in the workplace, making both these supporting characters an apt portrayal of some of the problems society faces.\n\nGyllenhaal is consumed by this role of the slick, sociopath Lou Bloom. The intensity of his eyes is frightening, like a power hungry man who's been looking through a lens for so long that he's abandoned the need to blink, lest he miss a film-able moment. To say that he is an opportunist would be putting it lightly. Everything that drips from his mouth sounds like it came from a motivational booklet on 'How to Become a Successful Entrepreneur' as he spouts off words of workplace wisdom, continually sharing his mantras with those he is trying to manipulate. There are times that Bloom's focus on productivity is strangely admirable as he chooses to take opportunities to communicate instead of engaging in an argument. However, he lacks the ability to truly connect with people; they are merely cogs in his machine to fame and fortune. He is simultaneously apathetic and sincere, to the point where it's unclear if he's just bullshitting his way around, or if he is fully committed to the crazy conviction he delivers.\n\nWorking in mass media, you see and hear of all sorts of crazy stories that make the actions of Lou Bloom appear less sadistic and more like LA's 'normal' orders of operation. To someone in Small Town USA, they may watch NIGHTCRAWLER and be appalled by the grotesque decisions of its characters, not understanding how people could be so dishonorable. To someone living and working in entertainment in LA, this just seems like an exaggeration of how this town runs its business. It's also America's obsession with 'news porn' that makes this film so timely. It's easy to look at Nina and Lou with disgust for their ethical discrepancy, but they aren't the only ones profiting from the misery of others. It's an American culture of blood lust that promotes such people and professions to exist, and this movie merely depicts our twisted tendency to go viral with violence. Gilroy's brilliant realization of all this emphasizes the reality of the kind of world NIGHTCRAWLER is spawned from, and it delivers an extra punch to the gut, especially if you live in Los Angeles.\n\nRead this review and more at www.1931Productions.com",

            "content": "At the onset of the movie, we meet a lone mysterious young man who clearly is trying to make meager money selling stolen scrap metal. Late one night he witnesses a freelance film crew shooting a car crash to sell to news stations. In the process, he sees the craft of the camera operators, fast pace thinking, and a morbid fascination with the violence and carnage. With no prior experience, he sets out to start a freelance camera business for himself. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the peculiar yet ambitious character. Although the main character is not likeable even off-putting, he is fascinating. He is clearly smart, persistent, and capable of great charm, but he is also calculating, manipulative, and unfeeling. His competitive spirit and unyielding drive to succeed cause him to hurt people, blackmail them, and force them into doing what he wants. It is chilling to what unethical lengths he goes to earn more money on a story, beat his competition to a story. Perhaps even more disturbing is how successful he is using his immoral tactics. I am not sure why I previously doubted Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, but I did. This movie completely caused me revaluates his acting abilities. His physical mannerisms and facial acting are most impressive. He seems creepy with his overly crisp movements and his hollow go-getter act. There is a predatory animal-like, an analytical nature to his sociopath character. The direction completes and enhances the off-putting feel of the movie with strong camera work music and lighting. Dan Gilroy skillfully uses darkness and blue-green fluorescent lighting to make the viewer feel uneasy and build a growing tension throughout the movie. The story insightfully lampoons flaws in modern media news coverage and corporate world, much of which seems hauntingly believable. It is not a complete thrill ride, but there is smart subtle tension and the acting and directing make this a great pick.",

Writer/director Dan Gilroy must not have known (or cared?) enough what he needed in each moment of each scene to properly serve his cool and contemporary script. If he had, we would have seen fewer vague performances from his cast, and we would have felt a presentational style that suited a greater vision, rather than just settling for being fashionable and unoffensive. Jake Gyllenhaal is very talented and it's gratifying to see once again that he delights in creating bold, believable, and uninhibited performances when inspired by fresh scripts like this one. But every actor in a film is at the mercy of those behind the camera. This is to say that as strong as Gyllenhaal's performance is, if the director is passive or inconsistent about the flow and logic behind the way his scenes are staged, shot, and strung together, then he won't be capable of giving the right direction to his star, his supporting cast, or his crew. Gyllenhaal is very entertaining to watch, but to what end? The movie doesn't allow his character to go anywhere, and his is the one we are supposed to follow. Had he been able to rely on the guidance of a more assured director as well as the stimulating script and his own great acting talent, the performance could have been much more affecting, I think an easy Oscar nomination. It's not my opinion that Gilroy intentionally left drama by the wayside while only give potency to his gritty action scenes. I do not believe he got so wrapped up in the rush of making a vaguely artsy, cool movie that he sold out his vision as many do. But I do believe that his limited directing know-how is unsuited to the kinds of tricky scenes that he wrote in his script where characters talk to each other or do strange things that the audience should understand. Probably it's just not as obvious to him how to translate those moments on screen and create drama as it is how to throw together expensive shoot outs and car chases. This movie is smart if you're accustomed to ignoring loose-ends, but it's only worth watching for Gyllenhaal's performance, and he has given better work with better directors.",

Looking at how the night crawlers make a living in the streets of L.A., was really really interesting and thrilling at the same time. The way Jake depicts his character, his mania, his drive and perfectionist character, is immaculate. Even this weird look on his face and the moments he seems to be on the edge of freaking out but does not, were breathtaking. I found myself actually being frightened about what might happen next. \n\nThe entire movie was a roallercoaster for the viewer. Being on his side, then wishing he is caught for what he does, then again not. His co-actor/helper was also brilliant. The movie was quite long (approx. 2 hours) but it did not seem like it at all.

Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler is a wickedly brilliant thriller, a social satire and an eerie look into the mind of a sociopath who can manipulate with the power of cold-blooded reason. That sounds like a tall order, but this is a deceptively simple plot made functional by a well-mounted script and a near-perfect performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nGyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a man who seems to be as bland as the white shirt on his back. He's a drool, square fellow who talks with the confident detachment of a marketing video and dresses as if he's stealing from Good Will. Outwardly, he's painfully unremarkable, the kind of guy that you pass every day without notice, just another face in the tapestry of your busy day.\n\nHe lives on the fringes of Los Angeles. When we first meet him he's collecting scrap metal to make a few bucks. On the way home he passes a car on fire, and pulls over. What interests him is not the firemen rescuing the driver, but the presence of a man with a video camera (Bill Paxton) who is filming the action. Louis asks the man which news channel he works for, but the man tells him that he's freelance - he finds accidents and crime scenes, shows up, films footage and then sells it to the local news stations. Louis has a burst of inspiration and, before you know it, he's bought himself a police scanner and a cheap video camera and is scouting police activity.\n\nWhat is unsettling about Louis is how good he is at this new venture, and how willing he is to break every moral code in order to get paid. Before long he's crossing the police tape and snooping around the bodies with his camera to get the best and bloodiest images. His talent captures the eye of an attractive news producer named Nina (Rene Russo) who likes this guy's moxie. He does more work for the station, and demands higher pay. Before long, he asks Nina to dinner. What develops is not a romance, but an odd business arrangement built on curiosity and blackmail. At dinner he reveals himself to be a schemer, a deceiver, a liar and a manipulator with all the moral dignity of a bus station toilet. No one wants anything to do with Louis and yet he has such a bizarre method of concrete reason that you're surprised that the person in his cross-hairs doesn't fill the pauses with \"Go on.\" They are fascinated and so are we.\n\nLike Hannibal Lector or Travis Bickle or Gordon Gecco, we are fascinated by the charming monstrosity of this Louis Bloom. He's a man with the brain of a sociopath, a scummy little creature with the heart of a rat, and yet you can't take your eyes off of him. He has a way of motor-mouthing his way into whatever he wants. Watch carefully the way he turns the casual small talk of the dinner with Nina into a whirlwind of blackmail built on bold assumption. It's a brilliant piece of writing and acting.\n\nNightcrawler was directed by Dan Gilroy who wrote the screenplay for The Bourne Legacy. Here, in his directorial debut, he has constructed a hard-bitten satire, a look at 21st century TV news which rises and falls on ratings and the holy sacrament of \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" Louis is the most effective supplier of this, choosing the lowest rated TV station in L.A. so he can bilk it for all it's worth.\n\nIt's hard to describe too much of the plot without giving much away, except to say that when Louis films the aftermath of a domestic bloodbath before the cops show up, he ends up all but manipulating the news in order to get the footage. He's morally bankrupt, but we find ourselves glued to the action. We also find ourselves laughing at how willing this screenplay is to go for the throat. We laugh even when it isn't appropriate. Take, for example, the moment at the end when two people have an intimate conversation in front of a piece of footage on a screen. It's a moment so cold and heartless that you can't help but laugh.",

            "content": "We all realize that news has become more graphic and more sensationalized in recent years, but what's more difficult to determine is who's responsible for this phenomenon. Has the public become so desensitized to violence that the increased demand for dramatic images and information create a demand that TV news directors are powerless to ignore? Or have news directors become so apathetic about ethical standards in journalism that they just care about giving the public what they want whether it's responsible to do so or not? It's an interesting chicken-egg question that's pretty difficult to answer. Or maybe the question can't be answered at all. Maybe the best we can do is sit back and marvel at the current state of broadcast journalism, wondering how we got here - and how much farther these trends will go. \"Nightcrawler\" (R, 1:57) focuses mostly on the most prescient of these questions - where the current hyper-realistic, hyper-violent trends in journalism could take us. \n\nLos Angeles native Louis Bloom (a slimmed down and very creepy Jake Gyllenhaal) is meant to personify a news business without a conscience. Lou is a self-starter. Make that a self-absorbed, self-employed self-starter. He studies business plans and techniques online. What he learns, he constantly preaches to others and liberally applies to his own business ventures, which are, at best, illegal, and at worst, sinister. He steals construction materials to sell them to shady contractors, he murders a security guard to obtain a nice watch and he steals a high-performance bicycle to sell at a pawn shop in order to finance his latest attempt to make it big. He formulates his newest money-making scheme when he sees a cameraman (Bill Paxton) take video at the scene of a car accident and learns that he sells his footage to the highest bidder among the local TV stations. It's as a \"nightcrawler\" that Lou is at his best - and worst.\n\nArmed with a police scanner and a cheap camcorder, he becomes a creature of the night. He's not a vampire, but he might as well be. He prowls the darkness in search of blood. After all, in TV news, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\" Lou finds a perversely enthusiastic supporter in graveyard shift news producer Nina (Rene Russo). Nina buys Lou's footage, Lou hires a desperate and hapless assistant named Rick (Riz Ahmed), Nina encourages Lou and buys more of his footage, and Lou thrives, buying more and better equipment and a fast new car. As Lou's income mushrooms, so does his boldness.  He makes demands that are increasingly outrageous and takes actions that place himself, Rick, and innocent Angelinos in greater and greater danger, while single-handedly pushing the ethics of L.A. news broadcasts closer to the abyss.\n\nTo view this film as an indictment of the current state of television news is somewhat short-sighted. The main character isn't the cause of the problem, but rather its symptom. Not to mention that Lou is clearly insane and completely amoral. The things he does range from unethical to immoral to downright evil, but he is being enabled in everything he does by his customer. Russo's news director is the real villain here, presumably sane, but much more concerned about ratings and job security than what's right and wrong, or even what's truly in the public's interest. A producer named Frank Kruse (Kevin Rham) who works for Nina speaks out for journalistic ethics and Rick tries to be the voice of reason for Lou. Both Frank and Rick are ignored, with ominous and tragic results.\n\nA thriller, with a strong undercurrent of social commentary, \"Nightcrawler\" both thrills and chills. The movie features one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in a long time, but the message that the filmmakers seem intent on delivering nearly fades into the background. Gyllenhaal is very effective and even frightening, but not in a way that would lead most audience members to start boycotting sensationalized news broadcasts, and the lack of ethics embodied in Russo's character seem to pale in comparison with Lou's activities. Although the message of the movie is a bit muddled, the performances stand out and the storytelling is solid. I'm giving this one a \"B+\".",

Although this is only the directorial debut of first-time filmmaker Dan Gilroy, it's seriously hard to believe. The first movies that directors make are usually not their best, but \"Nightcrawler\" is a rare exception of a film. Propelled by fantastic performances, a razor-sharp script, atmospheric cinematography and a relevant message, this is a meticulously crafted thriller that doesn't feel at all like a first-time effort from a director. Not only does it announce the arrival of a fabulous filmmaker, but it also cements Jake Gyllenhaal as one of the finest actors of his generation. Absolutely mesmerizing, he has never been better or gone through such extreme lengths to play a character. The rest of the cast is astonishing, all with the exception of a slightly underused Riz Ahmed. While suitable enough for the role, this is not the actor at his best. A rushed ending also prevents this film from being a true classic. As long as you let these problems slide, however, \"Nightcrawler\" is not a film to be missed.

            "content": "Not as though we needed any more evidence, but if there was any doubt about the talents of Jake Gyllenhaal then let Nightcrawler be the final word in the statement that he is one of the most impressive actors working today, as his creation of Louis Bloom is a creation for the ages in screenwriter Dan Gilroy's impressive feature debut that has some harsh points to make about today's modern day media techniques and makes them with a modern day Travis Bickle like central figure.\n\nWhile the city of Los Angeles is impressively captured here, a night time lit city of crime and desperate figures, while James Newton Howard's subtle yet effective score plays out as proceedings grow ever darker and while Gilroy's smart direction and unique script takes shape there is nothing that compares to Bloom. A haunted eyed loner who wants nothing more than success, no matter the cost, is a vile yet undeniably watchable figure that prowls on anything or anyone as long as he can achieve his questionable goals. From the moment we first meet Bloom in a restricted zone at a city train track through to the tense and white knuckle finale, Bloom is the cold blooded beating heart of the film and his rise from wannabe crime videographer through to aspiring businessman is one that will keep you well and truly glued to your seat even if proceedings sometimes take a turn for the unbelievable a little to often. Gyllenhaal deserves plaudits for sinking completely into Bloom, from his gaunt physical appearance, his empty yet razor sharp eyes and his general characteristic tics, this really is a full bodied performance that makes Gilroy's film more than the sum of its parts.\n\nWhile everything is professionally done in a production sense, Nightcrawler's greatest weakness is strangely found within it's narrative arc. Bloom's rise up the ranks of the local TV station is worryingly quick, his dealings with Rene Russo's desperate news station head Nina doesn't always ring true, Bloom failing to be penalised for obvious crime scene breaches make you scratch your head and Bloom's rivalry with Bill Paxton's industry veteran Joe takes a far fetched and in the end underplayed turn that feels like it belongs to another movie. It's a shame that so many elements of Bloom's story feel to far flung from reality, as when Nightcrawler strikes a believable cord it's a striking indictment of the modern day media circus and an often hugely original big screen picture.\n\nWhile not all elements ring true in this impressive feature, Nightcrawler is a great debut by Dan Gilroy. There's yet another award calibre showcase performance by the increasingly great Gyllenhaal and the journey into the mind of a man so concerned with his goal no matter the obstacles that may hamper his cause is an entertaining one. Nightcrawler is a thriller of the highest order and a depraved tale set in the city of Angels that deserves to be seen.\n\n4 abnormal job interviews out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Plus, while he does lie to avoid the law, he is honest about what he is, proudly stating \"When you see me, I hope it's the worst day of your life\".  He gets great support from the rest of the cast, particularly Rene Russo (in one of her best performances) as a TV exec ensnared by a monster she helped create.  Behind the camera, Gilroy crafts a ruthless crime thriller, never shying away from the gruesome aspects of Bloom's job and what he will do to accomplish it.  He doesn't cheat on the ending either (the last line is especially chilling) though more background into Bloom would have been nice (he's already established as as sociopath from the first scene).

Jake Gyllenhaal is ridiculously good as Lou Bloom, a freelance self-employed cameraman who is prepared to do anything to get what he wants.\nGyllenhaal's performance is perfect at capturing a character who is an embodiment of modern day hierarchy in business - to rise up in the world you must be prepared to work your ass off, as Bloom puts it.\n\"Nightcrawler\" has the same sense of disturbing exploitation that has been explored before in films such as \"Network\" but with a much more sinister, grotesque and dark tone.\nThe American dream is ever present in \"Nightcrawler\" and in Lou Bloom: the charm that Gyllenhaal exudes in his lighter pieces of dialogue are driven towards reeling in potential employees into his regime, while his relentless thirst for power with no regard to who gets stepped on along the way is very much apparent in other scenes.\nThis is a film that will stay with you and one I would watch again - if not for the plot then for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, the suspenseful pace and for the beautiful but dark cinematography.",

Most of the footage here is at night and it's slick with a pulsating score (but not quite Michael Mann slick).  Gyllenhaal is also slick in a robotic way but with no empathy for people and a cold hearted willingness to manipulate them for his own ends.  That's probably all you need to know.  This is director Dan (brother of Tony) Gilroy's first directorial outing after a number of undistinguished screenplays.  His wife, Rene Russo, stars as a TV news producer who desperately needs crime and accident footage to boost the ratings of her station; good to see her again (since roles for older women are so rare), but it's a one-note role.  Bill Paxton is here too with not that much to do.  Riz Ahmed has the only human-seeming character (as Gyllenhaal's assistant), almost more than one-dimensional. So, in the end, this is a character study with a not-so-new message about the bloodthirsty news media that wants to be a thriller (and does feel thrilling at times) but, alas, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, like so many others of its ilk.",

            "content": "Grim. Messy. Gritty. 'Nightcrawler' is all of these things, but it is also suspenseful. Entertaining. Shocking. The film follows the newfound career of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), who follows police calls to capture the aftermath of crimes in the streets of Los Angeles. As one might expect, this makes for an interesting premise, and things get more intriguing as Bloom develops a relationship with a needy managing director at a last-place local broadcast\naffiliate named Nina (Rene Russo). The thirst for capturing carnage on camera only increases as the film progresses, and this leads Bloom to take more risks in order to quench it.\n\nGyllenhaal definitely deserves recognition for his portrayal of this character, as he's probably borderline psychotic (think a more toned down version of Heath Ledger's Joker). This transcends his dialogue - even his body language and actions support this. Russo also gives a strong performance, as it's obvious her \"been around the block\" persona fits her role well. As for the other elements of the film, 'Nightcrawler' hits the mark across the board, following an arc that makes sense, building steadily to a crescendo of a wild ride that is a fitting way to cap off the film. The fact that the film takes place nearly entirely at night is also a nice touch, as audiences see LA differently than they do during the hot, sun-soaked day. And then, you can't ignore the solid soundtrack by James Newton Howard, which brings out the best moments that transpire on screen.\n\nDespite minimal box office attention, 'Nightcrawler' received a good amount of critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for its screenplay and a Golden Globe nomination for Gyllenhaal, and the film will likely serve as a model for future indie thrillers.",

It was like visiting the shoot of Night Crawler.  The cinematography was brilliant.  The story was creepy, and reminds me of the guy who just was charged with trespasss for videoing two dying teens at an accident scene (inspired?).  Jake G was amazingly convincing as an interesting blend of sociopathic opportunism and a touch of Aspergers.  I appreciate how well done was the sexual exploitation topic and that they did not need to go graphic with it.  Very nice.  Same impact.  More taste.  The end was a little disappointing because most viewers would like to see Lou Bloom experience some consequence to his behavior other than success.  But this was a great movie that I recommend to all of my friends.",

Nightcrawler is gritty and dark, and depicts an aspect of journalism that is mostly hidden from our point of view when watching the news.

This is certainly a career best for him. \n\nBeyond the pertinent themes and Oscar-worthy performance from Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler also boasts some beautiful, metropolitan nighttime photography (specifically, Los Angeles).

It's not unlike the protagonist.\n\nOne of the best films of 2014, it's a shame that Nightcrawler didn't get the kind of awards attention that it deserved. No matter. This thriller will most likely develop a cult following and a deserved place in the cinematic discourse that dwarves anything that films like American Sniper or The Imitation Game can hope to achieve.",

After realizing this isnt a one man job, Lou hires an assistant named Rick (Riz Ahmed) and Lou tries to train him.

First off, I loved this movie, I really did. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job protraying his character. I also believe Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed did a pretty good job in there charcters as well. The eerie lighting, the writing and directing were great in this movie as well. To be honest, I haven'tbeen that into a movie like that in a very long time. The 3rd act had me glued to the seat in suspense.

It becomes apparent however that despite his ambition he can only scrape by. Ultimately Lou needs an opportunity to apply himself and he finds his chance through independent news reporting, on the streets of L.A with Lou finding all manner of crime related incidents. With each new story that he covers the end result is to see a payday and expand. Overall the movie is masterfully crafted in depicting the violent nature of an underworld that comes alive at night that is definitely not safe.",

            "content": "A bizarre crime drama is not always the recipe for a good movie. Yet here we have a clear success story. The movie is sufficiently interesting from start to end. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Lou Bloom, a very unusual, eccentric, off-putting individual. Desperate to make his way in the world he will do for us all the things we are appealed to imagine, for the sake of entertainment.\nHis character is not well rounded but very well written. In this occasion a flat character is very fitting. He may be hard to identify with for most people, but as an anti-hero we will like disliking him.\nBut this movie could not have been so good without Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed that provide a high level of acting. Each of them contributes a great deal towards creating likeable, yet sad, characters.\nThe point of the movie is not just to entertain, but perhaps to open the viewer's eyes. The approach to the subject of hot scoops, and live news media may be very realistic, but that's a good thing.\nThe dark and grim plot is well planned. The movie offers a hard look at today's news rooms and field reporters from deep behind the curtain, and it looks rotten. With hard criticism, this picture offers a look at what is wrong in modern society as ratings created not only by media but by the viewers create the demand for such gore.\nThe detective and mystery theme is mostly overlooked however, and initially I wished it would have been addressed more. The movie mostly revolves around the drama happening around Lou.\nOn the other hand, perhaps it is was the right way to go. Focusing on the mystery and detective story would either diminish the main story, or otherwise put an unnecessary strain on the plot. \nIt was hard to watch, but there is no doubt Dan Gilroy has created a good movie. All in all, the grade A is very fitting here.",

When I frist saw the name of this film, I thought 'awesome, a spinoff movie for Kurt Wagner, the X-Man known as Nightcrawler.' I quickly found out this was not the case, and that the film was, in fact, about cameramen chasing news stories in the middle of the night. While the film is set in that world, it is about something much different.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal gives a commanding performance as Lou, the small-time crook turned nightcrawler. The character is truly unique, being somewhat removed from human emotion, while understanding the power of negotiation and smart business practice. He hires Rick (played very twitchily by Riz Ahmed) as his employee, and they build up quite a workplace culture. Lou also develops a tumultuous relationship with Nina (played stoically by Rene Russo), the director of a local news show, who he sells his footage to.\n\nHere's the thing: the movie is actually about good management in the workplace culture. Yes, the two main characters sit in a car looking for accidents to film, but they frequently discuss working conditions, compensation, and obedience. There's even a bit about not reading memos. Lou has a very logical, non-nonsense approach to his business. He knows how to negotiate, when he can hold fast, and when he must back away. He does it all calmly, and does a lot of research.\n\nIt's a gripping film with many layers to it, even though there isn't any teleporting in it at all.",

            "content": "Louis Bloom is a tenacious young go-getter who accurately pitches himself to prospective employers as a fast learner who's willing to do whatever it takes to get a job done and done well. Yet even the most positive corporate attitude isn't worth the paper it's printed on if nobody's hiring.\n\nEver the entrepreneur, Lou tries his hand at the nocturnal profession of nightcrawling, an ethically borderline job that has him tracking down violent crime stories and shooting video for the highest bidding news network. If Lou is one thing, he's driven.\n\nBut of course he isn't just one thing. Besides being driven, he's also psychotic, willing to go to absurd lengths to beat the competition (and the police) to the scene, however dangerous. Lou goes from being a messenger to being an agent of death.\n\nWriter-director Dan Gilroy's screenplay blends tone and genre in interesting ways, using noirish strokes to paint over a sneakily comic premise that's already pitch black itself. It isn't a satire insomuch that the extremes to which Lou goes for a piece of footage are unrealistic (some journalists will tell you otherwise), but that his dedication to those entrepreneurial platitudes is often played for chuckles as much as it intends to put us on edge.\n\nIt's a difficult tone for Gyllenhaal to navigate, but he manages to pull it off. I cracked a smile more than a few times while still being deeply unsettled by this character. His nightcrawler really worms (no pun intended) his way under your skin, and stays there. He even dropped 30 pounds for the role, the contours of his now skeletal frame accentuated by the evocative lighting.\n\nWhile it's clearly Gyllenhaal's show, special mention should be made for his costar Rene Russo, playing the unscrupulous TV news director who initially encourages Lou's disquieting fascination with nightcrawling.\n\nAnother star, albeit one behind the camera, is director of photography Bob Elswit. He shoots L.A. after dark as a unique vision of Hell, where police lights flicker in lieu of flames, overseen by a million evil eyes that take the shape of television screens. Here's hoping he can nab some awards love this season.",

Visually, there is no break and the music only slightly varies making all 2 hours feel every bit as long as it is. The film is worth watching for the characters but not a movie to go back to.",

The crux of the story may seem somewhat mundane, even when things start getting intense as moral boundaries are tested, this could have been an average movie. However, with great directing by Dan Gilroy and an excellent performance by Jake Gynllenhaal, this film becomes exceptional. \n\nFrom the beginning you are interested in Lou, he is courteous and intelligent but as he shows from his first encounter with a person, a darker side lies just beneath the surface. Jake Gynllenhaal does an excellent job of portraying Lou, being respectable one minute only to lash out the next. Lou is a really interesting character that continues to push the boundaries of his world, like only a sociopath could, and although you may not agree with his actions, sometimes not even able to fathom the ease with which he makes them, it just makes him even more so one of the most interesting characters ever.\n\nRene Russo plays a desperate newsroom director and Riz Ahmed - a homeless man desperate for a job, both play their characters well and it's no surprise that their best scenes are when Lou slowly turns away from being a friend to taking full advantage of them. Bill Paxton is his usual scene stealing self, adding some humour to a dark movie while also giving us the media mantra that this film takes to its logical end, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nThis film not only delivers one of the most intriguing characters ever, it also portrays the media for what is has become, obsessed with ratings, following in the footsteps of other great news movies like Network (1976). I also found that its follow through of the American Dream was interesting because although we have had flawed protagonists, a la Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort, I feel like Louis Bloom creates a class of his own.\n\nThis film may be hard to watch over and over again, because there is no character that you are constantly rooting for. Lou's decisions left me walking away from the film conflicted as to if he was actually the protagonist or not. However this film is definitely one of the most thrilling movies of the year and one of the most interesting. A must see movie of 2014.",

However, I found the ending a very big letdown. I understand why it ended that way, I get the underlying themes of the \"evils of capitalism\" and all that. I don't even really need a happy ending. The journalist in me certainly squirmed throughout the film and maybe that's why I didn't love it - it just hit too close to home about the state of journalism and the world today.

As a first time director, Dan Gilroy, previously known for writing middling fare such as Real Steel and The Bourne Legacy, surprises with this L.A. thriller about a creepy loser who finds unlikely night work. \n\nNightcrawler represents a whole new level of acting from it's star Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal has been on a role lately with Prisoners, End of Watch and the little seen puzzler Enemy. But Nightcrawler puts him in line for his second Oscar nomination (he was previously nominated for 2005's Brokeback Mountain). As the sociopathic opportunist Louis Bloom, Gyllenhaal constructs a truly frightening persona of misanthropy, avarice and grandiose self-delusion. Seeking to earn money and fame by filming car crashes and homicides on the streets of L.A., Louis sells his violent, exploitative clips to a desperate nightly news producer played by Rene Russo. Russo, older but still strikingly beautiful, happens to be Gilroy's wife in real life. Lucky man. \n\nNo match for Bloom's twisted world view, she soon is dependent on his ill-gotten fare, and the film spirals toward it's spectacular conclusion with the audience not really knowing who to cheer for. Gyllenhaal's creation owes a debt to the dangerous loner Travis Bickle from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, but something about the tech-savvy, motivational speaker mindset of Louis Bloom makes him a mutated, less accessible and more sinister prodigy of DeNiro's classic anti-hero. Not to be missed.",

You kinda feel for the character. He's crazy, weird, he's doing some creepy stuffs but he has that perfectionist manner that no one has. But in any ways, he wants to prove that he is right in every way. He can have debates with you, and he has rules. This is one of those films that has a perfect example of a good characterization from the protagonist side. Very well portrayed by Jake as he looses some pounds and that's remarkable. Intense, gripping and some scenes are definitely a nail bitter. I freaking love it! A must watch and very recommended. 4.5/5",

            "content": "They only come out at night. Creatures that lurk beneath the darkness of night to stalk prey and attack when needed, especially if it benefits them greatly. This doesn't fit the model of a horrid, ugly monster from classic horror flicks, but a weirdly, driven young man named Lou Bloom. He enters Nightcrawler as an entirely different type of monster that is all the more frightening since this type of person is prevalent in various forms of society. Equipped with a camera and a distorted view of morality, Bloom mirrors the culture that we inhabit and presents a stark portrayal of values that don't seem that farfetched from the norm today. Nightcrawler is a dark thriller with a biting satirical edge that is hard to look away from, much like the blood and guts mentality of media that is being broken down to a mere nub. \n\nSet in Los Angeles, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young thief with simply no ambition to be anything more. He takes what he can get and moves on, selling what he can get his hands on. Lou knows how to sell himself and is great with numbers and statistics. He follows the market and is a quick learner, all of these things would be invaluable for any employer but for whatever reason, it hasn't worked out that way. Late one night, he sees a car wreck where cops are desperately trying to get a woman out of a burning car. Intrigued, amazed and curious he walks up to the wreck to get a closer look, but is met with disdain by the cops as well as a veteran cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). He finds a news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) at a local TV station that shares his views on the \"If it bleeds, it leads mantra''. Now hooked on documenting chaos and mayhem to viewers with an assistant Rick (Riz Ahmed), he finds himself entrenched in freelance crime journalism. But he quickly succumbs to immoral acts to further his new found career and make himself the star of his own story. \n\nGyllenhaal is a barreling train of madness and ferocity that is impossible to look away. He simply takes over the role and the entire movie. Bloom is such an interesting character that you don't mind to see more of him. His performance is simply revelatory as the ghoulishly fun Lou Bloom who looks somewhat of a normal, unassuming guy. But that just makes him all the more dangerous. Gyllenhaal transforms into the role like it's someone else's skin and the look he portrays is heavily apparent. From the sleek, bony cheekbones, bug eyes and slicked back hair, he looks something more of a lizard than a man. The dedication that Gyllenhaal showed is shocking and impressive. Getting ones weight down to 180 and going days without eating hardly anything is nothing short of insane. \n\nHe was all over the place with a firm grip on what he wants, needs and aspires to have. There is nothing in the world that he can't have and nothing is off limits to him. For much of the movie he is in control, a situation that he loves being in. But sometimes he isn't in control and it's a scenario that he can't understand. The perplexing conundrums that he finds himself in are fun to watch and especially to see if he can get out of them in one piece. And that's where it gets really entertaining. He attacks with vitriol at any and every corner where you're left dumbfounded to what just happened. His quick mind and even quicker mouth are more lethal than a machine gun. When he is on, he fires on all cylinders. Bloom is so overconfident that it's hard to not be a little impressed by him. He talks the talk and walks the walk with gusto like he's the CEO of a fortune 500 company. \n\nRusso was just as good as the no nonsense station manager. She quickly shows Bloom the ropes where he unexpectedly picks up rather quickly, maybe too quickly for her tastes. She's basically the only one who can challenge and test Bloom and push him to get her that story of violence and calamity that she thrives for. Russo has never been stronger or more in charge here and she really kicks some ass here. She is intimidating in ways different than Bloom but also someone you don't want to cross. But it's when she is at her most vulnerable that gives you an entirely different look at her and maybe shows some compassion for her. \n\nYou can tell she has never been in that position or made to feel that way and you know she would rather be anywhere else in the world. Russo shows some great range here as she tip toes the balance beam of morality. Ahmed had some impressive work here too as the diligent assistant who may be getting in over his head. He was the conscience of Bloom who constantly asks if the things they are doing are right. But he is as desperate as Bloom is and is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. \n\nThe way Bloom is portrayed, you'd think he'd be an unlikable, disgusting villain, but the more you look at the overall situation, he quickly becomes less and less of a villain. We don't know Blooms backstory, but we don't need too. We know enough of what he is and what he wants. If he wasn't in freelance crime journalism, he more than likely would have found something else but he just happened to fall into it. But he is simply adapting to the culture around him by any means necessary. The media will always be seen and portrayed as blood starved vultures that will pick at the bones of a rotting corpse till there's nothing left, then move on to the next one. It's a system that perpetuates an endless cycle of violence during all hours of the day where audiences inadvertently get sucked in. People love violence and seeing someone else that isn't their family or friends in life and death peril. He's just giving them what they want and what does it matter if it's staged or not.\n\nBlood sells more than a happy ending and a perfect shot is the difference between indifference and shock and awe. Despite all the horrible things he has done over the course of the movie, and there are a large number of them, you still want to root for him in the end. Everyone should have a dream and he is going for that dream. He doesn't really have any inherent qualities that make him likable or someone you would want as a friend. But the way he speaks is mesmerizing and you oddly want to hear him talk for hours on end. He is like a machine, cold, calculating, focused and driven to a fault. He breaks everything down so succinctly that he could have been a presidential candidate. Bloom can talk his way out of anything while still thinking of the bottom line. He sees the big picture out of everything and anything. \n\nDirector/screenwriter Dan Gilroy really went all out for his first film and excelled where others more than likely not have. He has a great knack for storytelling and character dissections with a distinct noir feeling. He transports you to another world that you don't really want to peer into, given how terrible it is. It starts off slow to show ample screen time to Blooms character, but really steps into high gear as the movie goes on. It's paced very well where there is always something you can take from every scene. Nothing feels wasted or as if it didn't deserve to be there. His screenplay is very different than any other film he has written for. Knowing that he wrote the screenplay for Two For The Money and Real Steel would make you think that Nightcrawler would be an entirely different movie, but it surpassed all expectations to catapult him as a serious director worth looking at. The script was very impressive and one of the sharpest I have heard in a long while, Gone Girl also fits this category with a brilliant script. It crackles with ugliness and truth that's a feast for the ears. \n\nI could listen to Bloom sprout off statistics and trends at rapid fire succession for days on end. The script perfectly centers on Gyllenhaal's performance as Bloom where he makes everything around him his playground. Hearing Nina break down what makes a story worth reporting was disgusting and horrible in every way but a truth that should be revealed but in reality is not. It shows how much they rely on race to sell, frighten and intrigue viewers amid a false backdrop of endless violence. Knowing what makes a newsroom tick was a dirty experience that makes one want to take a shower afterwards to get all that dirt and grime off of one's body. One of the most uncomfortable scenes was Bloom deciphering his prey and was like watching a vivisection right in front of you. Bloom cut everything down till there was nothing left and all you can do was sit there shocked. Another great scene was Bloom bargaining his footage to Nina. He talks so fluidly that it didn't seem there was even a stop for him to breathe. He lays down his terms with dominance and assurance, already knowing beforehand that he will get what he wants. He talks directly to the camera with no cutting away, then inches closer and closer where you see more of Bloom that you would want. You once again become entrenched in his presence, creepy face and cunning, conniving wordplay all at once.\n\nThe orchestration by James Newton Howard was great and added another layer to the moodiness of Los Angeles and a perfect backdrop to the dark environments of mayhem. He has scored some of the greatest thrillers of all time with The Fugitive, The Dark Knight and The Sixth Sense. The chilling, tense score gave for a steely feeling while watching. It made it feel colder and detached. The lighting gave it a horror type feel and made Bloom that much more menacing and brought out his devilish tendencies within. But sometimes it's when he is shown in full light that makes him even creepier as the night suits him more. Countless shots show his face shrouded in darkness as it glosses over his eyes as if he's an entirely different being. You want to inspect him like any curious observer but more so in the darkness where he can fully reveal himself to the creature he really is.\n\nNightcrawler speaks to the consumer culture that has purported throughout society and is becoming a driving force for people to succeed. Bloom sees something of value and takes it by any means necessary for himself or for sale. Everything can be taken and sold to the highest bidder and it doesn't matter how it was obtained. The drive to get to the top by hurting all those who stand in your way is one of the reasons why the economy is in the toilet. People crush and harm others, blissfully spending money then are shocked when the bubble bursts. The distortion of success is revealed as nothing but a shallow fallacy built upon lies, deception and bodily, emotional harm to others. \n\nThe wish to become something else and create something grand drives Bloom to sociopathy. He wants to be appreciated for his hard work even if it came at the cost of others and doesn't look back on what he has done and only looks forward to what he can create. His coldness and apathy to all that befalls around him is terrifying and startling but a mirror image to the culture that perpetuates the notion that wealth can only be achieved by any means necessary. I know some movies will have comparisons to Nightcrawler, but I was reminded of A Shock To The System starring a brilliantly insane Michael Caine. He himself also was downtrodden by the system that turned to murder to achieve wealth and influence. Caine was also likable and someone you wanted to get away in the end. Don't know why it's so easy to like evil characters like these but it's the way that they go about it and how they want something different for themselves, like many of us.\n\nThere were some really great sequences here starting with Bloom amassing his clips and slowly building his influence. Nina talking to the newscasters was really fun and shows how quick newscasters are as they have to listen, think and speak at a moment's notice, fitting what they just heard in a comprehensible way that would fit in the newscast. The climactic ending was fast paced, thrilling, nail biting and shocking. It really was a great piece of action filmmaking that went all out. I loved the ending and really fell into place when all the dust settled.\n\nNightcrawler gave the media the punch in the arm it deserves and needed with a brilliantly transformative performance by Jake Gyllenhaal . In an amoral world, it's the ones who thinks of ones feelings and repercussions that are viewed as weird or strange and not the other way around. Those types of people don't survive in today's world as the ugliness of society slowly creeps into the mainstream taking over what is good and right. It presents a dark social commentary that rivals Gone Girl in every way while still remaining its own singular film. It's grotesque, immoral, sleek and too smart for its own good to become one of the best thrillers all year. Given how used we are to violence and sex at all corners of the day, hopefully this won't fall on deaf ears and we miss the point entirely, going on to watch the next report of a person getting maimed as the newscasters graphically tell every detail. If one can take one thing away from Nightcrawler, is that we have to change how we digest and interpret media and life and death onscreen. Lou Bloom should not be looked up too but should be feared as an all too real personification of society. Five invasive, graphic, gory, immoral news reports out of five.",

He's the perverted evil of the American Dream taken to the limit, much like Michael Douglas in Wall Street, but for our generation. A man raised on the Internet, with no prospects, but the ruthlessness to do ANYTHING for the footage. The scary part to me, is that, much like Gordon Gecko, there are too many people out there who will see Louis Bloom as a hero worth emulating. Perhaps it goes a little extreme at the end, but I feel like this isn't that far a stretch.\n\nThe LA scenery at night makes it a whole different world, and Gyllenhaal, who lost weight and started staying up all night to prepare for the role, looks perfectly like the creature he is, and fits the role ideally. Rene Russo is nearly pitiable as his counterpart, the news director of the lowest rated network, who partners with Lou, and brings out the worst in each.\n\nWe see Lou descend from beginner to cutthroat shark over the course of the movie, willing to destroy anything and anyone who stands in his way, including a competitor who tries to partner with him, and his own assistant/partner. \n\nThere's moments of comedy in this satire, but they're few and far between. Most of all, I couldn't take my eyes off the compelling story of this ruthless sociopath. From the first scene where we see him get a watch, to the end, this is not a normal man, but you know he's going to the top...\n\nFeels like a lot in common with To Die For as well as Network, but updated for the Internet Age.\n\nDo not miss this one, but it isn't for kids.",

The theme of how twisted media coverage of crime has become and the character of Lou Bloom. Gyllenhaal expertly plays this character who is creepy, yet friendly, and who gets under your skin in such a strange, uncomfortable way. The movie plays out brilliantly because throughout the plot we are unsure of the true nature of Lou Bloom due to him being such a strange character. We don't know if he's psychotic or just a little off. So for the entire movie we try to figure out what is up with this guy until the end of the climax when his true, dark nature is revealed. \nThe film is full of suspense. This for one reason; we don't know what Lou Bloom is capable of. We are left in a constant state of suspense because the character is so unpredictable and the lingering glimpses that we are given into his dark nature as the film plays out makes us suspect that at any moment he will do something completely insane. I think Nightcrawler is one of the best movies of 2014.

What Nightcrawler made up for in terrific acting from Jake (albeit, with some awkwardly placed music in the background) it lost with poor characters in his partner and the women who he sells his videos too. My guess is that Jake wanted most of the film to be on him, so he made sure that the other two main characters did not get much screen-time. The whole film centers around him, which can be made effective at points, however, I just didn't understand the point of it all. Sure it made some subtly social commentary and followed Jake Gyllenhaal's wacko character, but I just didn't get why the characters were doing what they were doing. I would have liked to see Jakes character receive some attention from the public in order to fuel his ego. As he says in the film, \"why he wants it is more important than what he wants\". That being said, I just did not understand \"why\" he wanted to do this. Given that reasoning, it made him seem plain old crazy, which I never like to see out of a character no matter how \"crazy\" they might seem. All in all a solid film, I say B+.

It's not really all that suspenseful, but it is beautifully shot and pretty well acted.  Jake Gyllenhaal does his best to be creepy and unlikeable and it succeeds.  The problem with films like these, is that there, normally is something at least likeable and or redeemable about the character, but Lou Bloom is not a good character.  He's a slimy piece of shit, and unfortunately that's not really what keeps me watching a movie and or engaged.  The cinematography is stunning though and it's a good performance.  It's a hard movie for me to rate because there is no likeable character among the bunch and it goes about saying what has been said in other movies recently about how the media shows us a skewed view on reality and what not.  Renee Russo also does a good job here, but again, no likeable characters, a bizarre story--a good one--but bizarre.  I think the story, cinematography, acting, and direction are all really, really good...but bizarre.  I couldn't look away, but I didn't really have any other reason to keep watching other than I rented it because I thought it could be good so in other words, I already spent the money and that's that.",

Jake Gyllenhaal gives us an inside look at a sociopath and he's shockingly good. \n\n\"If it bleeds, it leads.\" Every broadcaster and journalist knows this sentence in the media world, but Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) takes this sentence to heart and then some. First time writer and director Dan Gilroy gives us an eerie story of broadcasting gone mad. Yes, it's media satire but that's what makes this film so compelling. It draws you in slowing and never lets you go. Bloom is a freelance TV news cameraman who takes pleasure in other people's nightmare. Bloom has no morals and doesn't care who it is or how badly they're hurt. He just wants to get the 'perfect shot' to tell the L.A. audience a powerful story. He'll do what ever it takes to get to the top of the newsroom and that's what makes him so morbid. \n\nThe fact is, throughout the film we never know how far Bloom will push to get what he wants. He'll move bodies for better camera angles or go into crime scenes before the police get there just to film someone bleeding out. It's scary, intelligent and couldn't have been done with out a provocative performance from Gyllenhaal. From the moment Bloom puts his hair up into a man bun and slimes down to the L.A. nightlife of bloody car wrecks/shootouts, you're hooked. Gyllenhaal's sociopathic performance will also creep the hell out of you big-time. His eerie acting reminded me of other star-struck sociopath's on film like Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in Taxi Driver. \n\nIn addition, there are other great performances by an ethically corrupt Rene Russo (Bloom's news director) and a skittish Riz Ahmed (Bloom's camera assistant). Nightcrawler is sleek, thought-provoking and will have you grappling on the edge of your seat throughout the film. The film also sheds light to the brilliant side of broadcasting lingo, film junkies will eat it up. Gilroy displays his potential as a first time director and Gyllenhaal rises to the occasion in a potent performance. It's truly a breakthrough in acting for him. In the media world how far would you go to push your agenda and throw ethics out the window? Lou Bloom showed us how far he'd go in the end and it's definitely haunting.",

Gyllenhaal's character is never in real danger, nor  has to break his brain to take a important decision; he never doubts, he has no weakness.

            "content": "\"My motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to get a ticket.\"\n\nWhat a brilliant performance by Gyllenhaal in this rather morbid and exciting thriller. At times I was wondering whether it was meant to be amusing and jokingly or that it was intended to be presented as a serious and shocking story. Judging from my own chuckling at times and disbelief about what was being shown, I could only conclude that ultimately it was a mix of both. And it's masterly portrayed by Gyllenhaal, the chameleon of Hollywood and someone I do appreciate very much as an actor. After his appearance in \"Prisoners\" (which was an exceptionally exciting film) and the arty movie \"Enemy\" (as a story it was not my cup of tea, but in terms of performances it was again a success) just like Matthew McConaughey in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" he transformed physically into a gaunt, pale-looking good-for-nothing. Initially, he looks like a marginal person with a mental disability, but as you get to know him better, you come to the conclusion that he's extremely intellectual and has a kind of photographic memory. The way he quotes chunks of information that he has read on the Internet is pretty impressive. Louis Bloom is not exactly a simple figure but rather a cunning and manipulative character.\n\nThe whole story starts with Lou in the process of cutting a fence. He's initially no more than an insignificant criminal who earns his money by stealing copper and the like. Until he witnesses an accident one night on one of the highways around Los Angeles and he sees a freelance reporter (Bill Paxton) capturing the whole thing on film and after wards selling it to the highest possible price so that it can be used for the morning news. Lou doesn't waste any time and purchases a simple camcorder and police scanner. Immediately an assistant (Riz Ahmed) is being contracted and he hits the streets every night to film police interventions. His unconstrained personality and unscrupulous approach, ensure that he can capture pretty sensational images, allowing him to conquer a permanent position at the local station KWLA6. Here it's Nina Romina (Rene Russo) who rules as news editor. The straightforward film style of Lou appeals to her. As a sensation channel the presented footages can't be bloody enough. As she clearly stated : \"The best and clearest way that I can phrase it for you, to capture the spirit of what we air, is think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut\".\n\nAs the title \"Nightcrawler\" partially reveals it, most of the scenes are made during the night in the city of Los Angeles. This provides some beautiful nighttime shots with Lou speeding around in his shabby car (which subsequently will be replaced by a flashy sports car) through the streets on his way to a variety of calamities he has overheard by using the scanner. He's a \"disaster tourist\" equipped with a camera. The film is an indictment against the growing sensationalism in contemporary reporting. The look and shocking effect takes precedence over content and objectivity. You can compare it with the bread and circuses in the Roman Empire. Lou is the personification of this somewhat repulsive attitude. On the one hand he's quite insane and frightening. On the other hand he's a real goal getter who misuses the Achilles heel of the media world in a shrewd way to benefit from. One man's loss in this case is Lou's gain.\n\nThat the masterful rendition by Gyllenhaal, as the extremely manipulative and creepy Lou, takes on the lion's share of this exciting and simultaneously satirical film, is beyond dispute. But the supporting characters contributions are as important,convincing and certainly successful. First there is Riz Ahmed as the pitiful Rick, the assistant Lou has chosen in between, after a rather absurd interview. Rick is the prime example of someone who can use the money and who's offered the job because he has a smart phone with GPS function. He's overwhelmed by the silver-tongued Lou and him being a dogsbody after wards was also predictable. No wonder you instantly think he's likable. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Rene Russo acting again as Nina Romina, the unyielding editor without a conscience. I haven't seen her after \"Lethal Weapon 3\". The fact Dan Gilroy is her husband, probably made sure that the selection criteria were flexible. Yet this wasn't a bad interpretation and you witnessed the way Lou gradually took control over this seemingly fragile little personality.\n\nIt was clear how it would end eventually. Although there was a choice between two possible denouements (two logical endings that arose to me spontaneously), the end was still intense and surprising. A disgusting example of self-centeredness and self-preservation. An example of which way our society is going and how people disregard ethics. The moral of the story is that there is a lack of morality in the media landscape and society today. Does this sound pretty cynical, nasty or downright morbid to you ? I'd suggest to take a look at yourself in an honest way and think whether or not you would slow down when passing a traffic accident in order to catch a glimpse of a victim? Or you'd return home quickly to zap to a news channel just because you have heard a disaster happened somewhere ? You come to the conclusion after wards that we are all a little bit like Lou. Disturbing ? Yep ! \n\nMore reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

Gyllenhaal is virtually unrecognisable as the sociopathic Lou who will stop at nothing to succeed and earn respect of those in power. His insidious, deadpan delivery creates an unease every time he's on screen. Easily his best performance to date. Great to see Rene Russo back in a role of depth and substance too. The slightly out of place 80s synth-guitar soundtrack aside, this is a tense thriller that delivers its shocks and keeps it's audience on the edge of their seats.",

The movie had my attention the entire time and while there were only a few \"big\" moments the pacing was fantastic and never got dull.  Over the past few years Gyllenhaal is becoming a favorite actor of mine and should be thought of as one of the top actors today because of performances like this one. Nightcrawler won't appeal to everyone but if you want a through provoking, intense, serious film (although there are a few quirky, hilarious moments every once and awhile) you should really enjoy this one.",

However, the real focus here is on the development of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, which pushes the film towards its complications. Gyllenhaal delivers one of those performances that transports you into his world, engulfing you in his motives, ideas and realities. It was one of those films where the central character's performance was the cream filling.\n\nHowever, it did help having a very well written script from Dan Gilroy, who also directed the film effortlessly, but with such thrill. What's even more disturbing is how Gyllenhaal 's mind-numbingly sensational performance failed to nab an oscar nomination. I mean, his eyes just spoke volumes every time his face faced the camera.\n\nNo, Nightcrawler is no masterpiece.

His non-exiting sense of moral and strict business attitude makes him one of the best in business and he will allow nothing and no-one to get in his way...\nThe movie is totally engulfed by the powerhouse portrayal of Jake Gyllenhaal. His gaunt physique and manic way of talking and moving really shows his range as an actor and with the way the character was also written, you really don't know what he will do next.\nStorywise this also is nicely unique, telling about the nightcrawlers, the news sniffers who get by by shooting the crime scenes moments after the crime has happened. It also was nice social study of the morality of news television, where the news doesn't sometimes care about the actual story but only about the news' bankability.\nA great opening from Dan Gilroy, first time behing the director's seat.",

That's not to say that the plot is weak - in fact, it's actually interesting because the profession isn't a typical film topic. The story doesn't grab you like Lou Bloom grabs you with his camera angle and lighting. The setting of all-night Los Angeles reminds me of Jamie Foxx & Tom Cruises`s ``Collateral``, but less stylized and with more of a Reality TV direction, much like the television series Cops. There are some times when I find Gyllenhaal unable to mask his technical efforts, where his depictions come off forced, and there are moments when Bloom feels more like a movie character instead of a real person. However, the successes greatly outweigh the few moments of imperfection.",

Soon after Lou commits an act of battery, he stumbles upon an accident scene where he is mesmerized by the work of some news videographers and the apparent lucrative nature of their work. So taken is he by it that Lou obtains low level equipment enabling him to do the same type of work however the nature of his videos are far more graphic than the norm and over time his methods of obtaining footage become quite questionable, bordering on illegal. His work (and an unexplained accident) soon allows him to supplant the video jocks that have been on the scene for years. Lou seems to stop at nothing to obtain his oh-so-precious footage. Repeatedly, he commits crime by proxy to serve his own needs and those of a struggling news director. Not only did Gyllenhaal lose weight, but he had to lose himself in order to play this part so well. Hats off to Rene Russo (playing Nina) as well, whose timing is impeccable when her character is provoked and questioned by Lou incessantly. He asks her for things that she wants not to give, but she realizes the symbiotic relationship that she is bound to form with Lou in order to survive. Their bond is crucial, creepy, and disturbing. The same can be said for Lou's bond with his assistant, Rick, as well (played by Riz Ahmed). No one really means anything to Lou and it shows. They are simply means to an end and he will not be denied.",

The film also has some very large flaws in logic and plausibility.Some of the supporting characters could have been better as well.In other words it's an okay story with a great lead but suffers from some of the worst direction and tone and is completely overrated in the praise it's gotten as it could have been a great film had it been a little more grounded in realism and didn't pull so many punches.",

Gyllenhaal in particular does an incredible job at creating a creepy, psychopathic character that's also strangely fascinating.

Cynical looks at the way mass media works has been done countless of times and this doesn't add anything new. The kind of film that will appeal to those who enjoy cheap thrills and enjoy the highly stylised look of the film. However, anyone looking for something slightly cerebral are advised to look elsewhere.",

            "content": "This is certainly one of the best movies to offer from 2014. While it was consider to be an modest box office success and film critics loved the movie. It certainly one of the year's best roles for any actor and that is Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal is just perfect as a driven Young man, who is desperate for work. Despite that he is a thief and a psychopath. When he catches a group of freelance camera crew (Lead by Bill Paxton in a slightly sleazy role). Which this group are into various different crimes and they sell the footage to the highest bidder for any news channel. Lou decides to do the same, at first, working alone but Lou is such a quick learner and he is very clever. He will do anything to keep at it, since it might be the only real thing, he is only good at until people get in his way.\n\nThe movie has excellent direction and writing from Dan Gilory (Which his screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, which it is well deserved). Sadly, the Academy missed out putting out an nomination for Gyllenhaal's incredible performance for Best Actor. Also Rene Russo is very good in her role as a power hunger news director. \n\n\"Nightcrawler\" is a thriller but it has many moments of darkly comic sequences and there is some real satire in the world of news. \"Nightcrawler\" is one of the best movies of 2014. The other highlights of this feature is the cinematography by Oscar-Winner:Robert Elswit (Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, The Town) and unique music score by James Netwon Howard (Alive, The Fugitive, Outbreak). In time, \"Nightcrawler\" will be a classic. It is the kind of movie, if you get into it. You find yourself watching it, time to time. It is just that good! Grade:A.",

            "content": "Nightcrawler. I thought this movie was a fantastic edge of your seat thriller. The performances are fantastic and the world they build feels both fantastic and grounded in reality in a way that is terrifying. It shows the danger that lurks in our own neighborhoods and the lengths men will go to to get what they want. But let's break it down.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal stars as Louis Bloom a slightly unhinged man who gets into filming breaking news footage and selling it to a TV station. This gets interesting when he starts going to extreme lengths to get the best footage available. If I tell you anymore I will get into spoiler territory.\n\nThings I Liked\n\nJake Gyllenhaal.How Jake Gyllenhaal didn't get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I heard gripes from many other film critics about the \"snub\" but after watching Nightcrawler I get it! Gyllenhaal had been someone who had yet to impress me but after this I can say I am impressed much more by him. He transformed into a different person and every moment he's on screen he is stealing every inch of it. Phenomenal.\n\nThe Pace. The movie flows. It moves. It goes from one thing to another in a way that keeps you interested. It doesn't drop that focus and you think that someone could get in serious danger in every moment of the film. The entire pace is perfect for the tension of the movie and the tension builds at every turn.\n\nThe tension. This entire movie hinges on tension and the tension is constant. Every moment is so intense you don't know whether someone is going to kill someone or whether they are gonna walk away and let it alone. Much of this is credited to Gyllenhaal's performance and much of it the way the screenplay flows through the movie.\n\nThing I Didn't Like\n\nSome lack of Reality. There are several moments where Bloom does things, well within view of police and they don't seem to notice him or do anything to stop him. Especially when he is obviously involved in some morally grey issues. I just couldn't by it the entire time and it threw me out of the film a little bit. Other than that I don't have too many issues with this one.\n\nOverall\n\nNightcrawler is an edge of your seat thrill ride that surpasses Gone Girl as the best one of last year, in my opinion at least. Gyllenhaal give a career changing performance that is so good at walking the line of charismatic and creepy. The movie holds your focus and keeps you wanting to watch more and more. Then when it ends you feel a little uncomfortable with the world that you live in because the scene is one that could happen in your neighborhood under different circumstances. 4.5/5",
