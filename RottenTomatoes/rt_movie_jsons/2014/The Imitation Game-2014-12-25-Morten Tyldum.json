    "summary": "In 1939, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to crack Nazi codes, including Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable. Turing's team, including Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become heroes, but in 1952, the quiet genius encounters disgrace when authorities reveal he is gay and send him to prison.",

I think it's something different yet interesting to watch. I would rate this film a 3.5/5 because even though it wasn't a movie of my liking, it was compelling.

Some scenes had actual videos during the war and this helped with the immersion, this is a true story after all.  Also in general it's just a nice detail to have in this movie. I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. The acting and cinematography pulled me in with the acting being especially good.

I thought that it was cool that they built a machine from scratch that turned out to actually work out for them.\n\nI thought that the overall movie was good. It showed how the British were able to solve the enigma. It was also a good educational movie in my opinion because it was a very important part in WW2 history. The movie is more for people that want to learn something about war history. I wouldn't recommend watching this with other people because it can get pretty boring.

I would absolutely recommend this film for anyone who can get their hands on it, but it does contain violence, the use of alcohol, and drama, so may not recommend for younger audiences. Personally, I'd give the film a 5/5 stars because as someone who likes World War 2 history, this film was an enjoyable adventure from start to finish.

            "content": "Wrong focus of the entire movie. Especially ending. His sexuality was exploited by modern standards and his life and his achievement were not placed in focus. In essence, back then there was probably some political reason that he was treated like that. Today, again, there is another agenda that is focusing on his sexual preferences. Unfortunately, for me, both are using him to support whatever they want to support, and he is the victim in both cases equally.\n\nWhen you present the life of such extraordinary man, you present everything and focus on his influence. In this movie, in the end he is just presented as a victim of the system, which he might have been, but definitely not for a reason of his homosexuality. That was just a motive. Federal services do not do things for such trivialities. There is something more into that. Even back then, he would be protected and he was not. Why? That, the movie does not explain and does not try to dig into at all. His accomplishments are shown in an extremely superficial way. There is not even an attempt to dig into what he has done. And, really, it is not that impossible to explain. If the scenarists asked me, I could give them one scene that would dig into his ideas, I mean we are using his computers today and we cannot explain how he built Enigma-decoder. Really?\n\nFantastic acting, everything else ok, but using him, yet again, to support the current agenda is just showing that we actually did NOT learn a lesson. People were expendable back then as they are today. Used, abused and then discarded. It is almost certain that he was treated that way because he was considered dangerous, self-sufficient or similar, not because the law required it. The system would protect him otherwise for sure.\n\nYou say that this movie is abolishing some malpractice from the past. No it does not. It is using a life of a man for some new its own end. Just like back then the system did to these exceptional people.\n\nIt is not the point of supporting or rejecting what he was. It is the point of portraying him. There was 0 portrait of him in this movie. Sorry for bad review, but he actually did not deserve this movie.",

The plot was the best part and even that wasn't ideal, with far too much time spent on impatient interruptions and a frustrating lack of faith in what the viewer new to be the correct path to resolution. Turing is an interesting guy, and they did a good enough job here that I don't think another movie on him will ever be necessary, but I think it's safe to say that it could've been handled better, especially after reading on the Wiki page that the characters eager to shut Turing's experiment down were not like that in real life.",

Directed by Morten Tyldum, it is based on the true story of Alan Turing, A cryptanalyst who later made massive contributions to the era of artificial intelligence. The character was played by Benedict Cumberbatch, a worldwide famous English actor who won many awards, including the Golden Globe award, Laurence Olivier award, and countless others. The film itself also won the Academy Award for the best-adapted screenplay. \n\nI personally like many works of Cumberbatch, and it could be argued that the Imitation Game is a classic. In fact, Cumberbatch almost specializes in characters that are aloof, intelligent and upper – class. Through his Career he has played Sherlock Holmes, one of the most famous detectives in the world, Dr. Strange, A character in the MCU which resembled high intelligence but with a chill and arrogant personality, Stephen Hawking and many more characters that fit with the characterization of Alan Turing. On point, realistic and powerful acting are just a few words that resemble Cumberbatch's acting in The Imitation Game. From his face, we see almost Turing himself. Cumberbatch does a very, very great job at exposing the true emotions of success, nervousness etc. Most important of all, he vividly portrays what an autistic genius would sound and would be seen as, even if autistics sometimes don't show their emotions well, Cumberbatch grasps this and uses it at the right time. I personally see the brilliant acting of Cumberbatch as a big bonus to the film. In other words, the film would probably not have held the suspension of disbelief as well without him.\n\nThe plot of the film is generally straightforward. Alan Turing, a professor of Mathematics who was intelligent to the point that he published multiple articles when he was around 20. He signs up for the secret code-breaking mission, and step on the journey of breaking the impossible Nazi code with his faithful sidekicks. \n\nAlthough the film mainly addresses the process of deciphering the near–impossible Nazi code, some of it, especially the ending, is quite emotional. Alan Turing is a genius. However, he most certainly suffers from some aspects of Autism or depression. This is actually quite common amongst many masterminds throughout history. Einstein, for example, was one of the greatest scientists who suffered from severe depression, and It was probably why he died. Turing's fate was in some aspects identical, as the film doesn't state that Turing dies from depression, anyone who's watched the film would have a pretty good idea why he died. He was bullied hard at school, and nearly no one wanted anything to do with him. This became one of the reasons why Turing was a successive but tragic character, which was implied at the end of the story and may spark some tears whilst watching.",

Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.\n\nThat 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.\n\nIt isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.\n\nHowever, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.\n\nIn terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.\n\nOverall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Of course, for cinematic purposes, the narrative heavily leans on a specific storyline that does take artistic license on the actual events that took place historically. The truth is that there were many heroes in the war, and there are still other untold stories of efforts just as valiant. That said, Cumberbatch and Knightly did a great job in conveying some of the complex feelings and emotions that arose from many difficult situations. Despite the departure from some historical details and facts, it's a well-made film. One I've watched multiple times since. It's heartbreaking what Turing had to undergo after what he helped do, and definitely a tear jerker for that reason. Great movie.",

In reality this sort of crib would have been worked through from the very first code-breaking moments when the team was first brought together. Lesser brains than Turing's would have noted all available cribs while Turing went through more serious, higher order cognitive contortions. In reality Turing cracked the Enigma Code and then crossed the Atlantic to advise the Americans on code breaking operations, but this nugget of truth doesn't fit with the socially inept creep that Cumberbatch chooses to portray. The film makers lacked the imagination to deal with this subject. Turing was a man, who happened to be gay, whose war effort consisted of sitting at a desk thinking. This is a story that deserved some serious thought, but it ended up getting the standard insultingly formulaic treatment.",

Turing was eccentric, not the simplistic personality disorder sufferer portrayed in this movie.\nAnd the movie is completely disconnected from history, Turing's role at Bletchley Park is inflated to a silly degree, and the sub-story about a convoy and use of intelligence is ridiculous.\nSome will claim this doesn't matter, it's a movie, it's entertainment.

The story is about Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a mathematician assigned the task to break the unbreakable Nazi code called \"Enigma\". Cumberbatch gives an incredible performance as Turing which earned him an Academy nod. Upon further examination, it seems like an obvious choice to cast the Sherlock actor to play the part. The other stand-out performance I'd like to discuss is Keira Knightley as the spunky, humorous, and compassionate Joan Clarke, who is the lone woman working to break Enigma in secret who is an inspiration of social change.\n\nHowever inspirational, Turing's story is devastatingly sad. Instead of being praised and honored as a hero, he was arrested for indecency (being gay) and was subjected to chemically-induced castration. He committed suicide the year after. All that hard work, all those hours he spent, all the lives he saved amounted to nothing. He was given a posthumous royal pardon by the Queen in 2013, but that doesn't quite make up for what happened.\n\nI'm going to try and end this review on a high note, all of what he did do did amount to something. I wouldn't be here typing on this computer (also known as a \"Turing machine\") had it not been for him. And while unknown to many, he and his team took part in saving the war and do deserve to be honored for that. Remember kids, \"sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine\". I highly recommend this movie to teens, though it is not easy viewing it's a powerful and beautiful story about persistence and the hidden heroes of WWII.",

Watching his performance here really does capture your attention, you are never bored when Benedict Cumberbatch is on screen. Flashbacks/flash-forwards were relevant to the story and allowed for some deeper layers to be added to Cumberbatch's character however the way they were ordered felt a bit messy and at times took us out of the moment.\n\nObviously it is very complex to solve a Nazi code that randomised every day but this film allowed what they were doing to make sense without it feeling like they were talking down to the viewer or purposely simplifying what they were saying for the audiences benefit.\n\nThe Imitation Game offers an interesting look into a different perspective of World War II and showed that a lot of the work needed to win the war wasn't physical.

The real people were nothing like how the characters were portrayed in the film, and they even left out some important people from the film. If you don't believe me, then I encourage you to do a search online and you'll find what I mean instantly. I suppose they wanted to make things more entertaining and sticking to the facts would have been too boring so they made everyone unlikeable so there could be moments of conflict throughout. For example, they portrayed Alan Turing as uncommunicative and autistic and Commander Denniston as someone who wanted to get rid of Alan Turing - both are extremely inaccurate portrayals and unpleasant for the relatives of these individuals. Therefore, despite the entertaining nature of the film, and the brilliant acting/cinematography/soundtrack, they botched the writing by changing real events for no good reason.

            "content": "The prestige biopic genre meets the \"Great Man\" genre of film in this very stuffy British period piece featuring a host of British actors you will probably be familiar with if you have seen any of the other entries in this genre. I have to admit that I am not a fan of this sort of film as movies like Wilson (1944) and Gandhi (1982) use the ‘worthiness' of their subject matters as an excuse for their general lack of quality. Unfortunately this film falls prey to many of the most annoying clichés of the genre as we see how our main character's professional success is closely connected to a personal tragedy from his past and have a supporting character through which 21st century values can be impressed upon the film. Yes, the production design is decent and there is nothing to complain about in terms of the cinematography and musical score but the clumsy attempts at emotional manipulation towards the end of the film anger an already resistant audience and for me this attempt to force tears out of me was what pushed me from finding the film slight but acceptable to taking against it.\n\nAnti-social mathematical genius Alan Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch, finds employment as a code breaker at Bletchley Park during the Second World War where he is ordered to crack the Enigma Code so that the Allies can defeat the Nazis. He finds a friend in Joan Clarke, Keira Knightley, after initially angering his co-workers and she helps him to endear himself to the men that he works with and become more comfortable expressing his emotions. His homosexuality is something he struggles with as it is criminally outlawed at the time and his only prospect of romantic love was destroyed when he was a teenager. He tries to find fulfillment through cracking the code but the government is determined to punish him for his homosexuality and despite helping the war effort he faces extraordinary horrors under the government's treatment system for homosexuality.\n\nMuch like The Theory of Everything (2014) the film presents it's lead character as a tragic hero who is a victim of society's prejudices but who finds acceptance in the arms of a ‘good' woman. While I wouldn't call Clarke's presentation quite as irksome as that of Jane Hawking in the aforementioned film she still never feels quite like a real human being and more like the screenwriter's convenient way to force modern values into the story in a way that seems rather improbable. The relationship between the two hits all of the familiar beats as she is a saintly sufferer entertained by all of his quirks and sharper personality traits while he is rude to her before expressing at some point later in the film that he does quite enjoy her company. Having seen all this before in A Beautiful Mind (2001) and countless other biopics I was not enthused about seeing it again and while Cumberbatch and Knightley are talented actors they don't have the stuff to make this tired trope feel fresh and exciting. \n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the film concerns the young Turing's love for his childhood best friend Christopher Morcom, Jack Bannon, whom he is tragically separated from. Unfortunately what could have been a touching teen romance becomes a small sliver of an otherwise unremarkable film that's emotional impact is dulled by the film's other attempts to wring sympathy out of you. Alex Lawther upstages Cumberbatch as the young version of the character conveying multitudes in just a few scenes and really making us believe in his character's investment in this relationship. It would have been nice to see the romantic drama instead of the biopic and in many ways this brief reprieve from the dull, plodding biopic hurt the film because it made me realize how interesting cinema that doesn't concern \"Important Men\" can be. \n\nAll in all, not a terrible film and one that will certainly have less cynical family members and friends crying but for a more discerning audience this may be something that they have seen a few too many times to swallow again. In terms of Best Picture contenders in 2014 it's definitely in the bottom half of the slate for me.",

The soundtrack is phenomenal, all of the music is great and fits the theme. The way the movie moves in time is smooth and really adds another layer to the story. When watching, I noticed those things but more than those the two things that stood out to me were as follows. The writing, the writing is extremely well done and keeps you engaged and wondering throughout. This writing evel works well in the form of narration which most films tend to stay away from because they fear they will do it poorly (unlike this one). This leads into the other thing being the man himself Benedict Cumberbatch. The cast is good and well acted; Benedict steals the show (as he should). He absolutely accels at playing an anti-social awkward super genius, similar to his role of Sherlock in the hit show ‘Sherlock'. However what is different from his role in Sherlock is how he portrays himself here. He has crafted the perfect character here that feels very far off from Benedict himself. Beautiful acting and writing overall (and the cinematography is pretty good too).",

Whether as Sherlock or Strange, Cumberbatch excels at portraying an uebermensch figure, whose inscrutable genius and impenetrable self-confidence allow his characters to do what no one else can, will, or should. As played by Cumberbatch, Turing is more than a mathematical prodigy and oddity of a man: Contrary to the standard stereotype, he is also a dedicated athlete running before it was fashionable and a imperious leader who does what must be done, criticisms be damned. Physically fit, intellectually superior, morally domineering: This sound less like a gay crossword puzzle enthusiast than it does the Nazi ideal; late in the film, Turing even demands the right to choose who will die in the war and who will be saved by his algorithms, a fascist wet dream. In this sense, which is admittedly quite Zizekian at bottom, the audience is allowed to enjoy what a dictatorial jerk Turing acts like, is permitted and even encouraged to emotionally buy into the uebermensch fantasy, because on the surface, he is treated as an outsider to the system on account of his queerness, while on a deeper level, he is really an outsider because he is a cryptofascist within the ranks of the Allied forces.",

Maybe it was just me who felt that the film began slowing down once they had cracked Enigma. It had built itself on the basis of events coming one after another, before it transitioned into this slow, emotional second half that worked, but just couldn't match the first half for me. Overall, though, this is still an excellent film for bringing to light the greater story behind one man's supposed eccentricities.",

It is set in 1939 at the beginning of World War II and follows a brilliant mathematician, Alan Turing, who is recruited by the secret British Intelligence Agency MI6 to solve the German Code 'Enigma', which was thought to be unbreakable. Although the movie itself is spectacular, Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is remarkable. He can keep true to the name of the film and imitate Turing through his quirky and awkward body language. Everything from his movement to his speech impediments paint a vivid picture of what the master mathematician may have been, which is incredible seeing as everything Benedict Cumberbatch knew about Turing is what he read. He plays a very soft yet assertive genius who isn't always able to pick up on social cues and quite frequently creates awkward situations. His portrayal of Turing can easily be compared to Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\", or Ashton Kutcher in \"Jobs\". This is because he plays his part very well but is not over the top, so he never comes off as offensive. The movie is great for all occasions and provides a wonderful insight into the harsh times of The Second World War, as well as showing the \"nerds\" behind the frontlines working to end the war. If you are inclined to solving puzzles, this is a must watch film that will bring you back in time to the hardest code ever broken.",

            "content": "It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's \"Sherlock,\" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.\n\nAs Cumberbatch says near the start of the film \"are you paying attention\". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.\n\nI went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.\n\nThe film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. \n\nIt is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.\n\nIt has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.\n\nI know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.\n\nIn this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.\n\nOne of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for yourself.I  went to see this movie at a screening. I have to admit, I went into this movie not knowing anything about Alan Turing and Enigma, but I love movies based on true events; especially those about the history of our country. \n\nDespite not knowing anything about Mr. Turing or the events of his life, as soon as I left the movie theater, I went home and looked him up and spent the next few hours learning of his life, everything he did for this country and the invention of what we now call 'the computer'.\n\nI want to start by saying that Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie is outstanding. He plays Alan Turing perfectly; his accent, his movements and just the way he plays the character on screen is beautiful. I can honestly say that this is the performance of his career! \n\nThe movie focuses on different aspects of his life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war. \n\nThere's a quote at the beginning of the movie: \"are you paying attention?\". Throughout the movie, that's what I did. It's all that I could do because the story and the acting kept my eyes glued to the screen and I couldn't take them away. It's emotional, it's exciting and it is truly heartbreaking in some moments. It was a very comedic movie, too. There were some scenes that had me in fits of laughter and that's what makes it a beautiful script; despite the movie being based on the darkest days of World War 2, they added comedy into it which brought the movie alive. \n\nI remember getting home and after researching Alan's life, I wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again. It's rarely that happens to me but when this comes out in November, I will be straight to the cinema and purchasing a ticket to watch it. \n\nI've heard reviewers mentioning that this film doesn't focus enough on Turing's homosexuality. Now, be that as it may, it focus' enough on the subject. Remember: this movie is about his mind, about the man himself. He was a genius! \n\nThis is the best British movie that I've saw in a long time, and it's probably one of the best movies that I've ever had the pleasure of watching, period. \n\nI would recommend going to watch this movie when it comes out because it will take you into the world of Mr. Turing and the struggles and successes he made in his short life.I've read the reviews and mostly pointing out the inaccuracy of the details in the movie. I have never read or learn about Alan Turing or any evolution of Computers. \n\nBased upon the meaning of the movie, I think it is so fascinating. I believed the producers were trying to point out the fact that being difference is what matters. Ordinary things is boring and wont bring any changes. \n\nBenedict did a fine job as Alan, from being a curious over the head thinker (like he always does in Sherlock) to an insecure man. Oh! The young Alan did a great job especially that scene where he tries to hide his tears upon receiving the sad news about Christopher form the headmaster. All the characters were well played and the scenery of the movie is spot on specifically for the WW period.\n\nWhat's more striking about the movie is the indication of the way homosexuals are being treated back then. It just makes me sad, I mean what else could he have done if he was to live longer. \nThe Imitation Game (2014): Dir: Morten Tyldum / Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Charles Dance, Mark Strong: Brilliant true account telling of mind over matter. Set during World War 2 and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician brought in to crack the Enigma to decode German messages. Turing manufactures a machine for which he calls \"Christopher,\" named after a childhood friend. He suffers as a team player and alienates himself from others brought in to assist. He eventually sends out a crossword puzzle urging a meeting with anyone who can solve it under a specific time. Enter Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, bright young woman whom ends up engaged to Turing until he admits his homosexuality. This plagues him in his relationships until it leads to his suicide when it is deemed indecent by government and they place him on chemical castration. Clarke seems determined to accomplish her mission despite obvious disappointments in him. Strong supporting work by Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong either working with Turing or overseeing the project and threatening to halt it when results fail. Director Morten Tyldum details the project and its failings, frustrations and eventually its triumph when the war is shortened by about two years thanks to this decoding machine. While historians will appreciate this film most, it does present a tense time in our history where trials are conquered through a group of brilliant minds and one clever mathematician who ultimately brought victory and found heart break.

            "content": "Can machines think? This is the main question posed in \"Computer Machinery and Intelligence,\" a 1950s paper published by Alan Turing. The paper's concepts surfaced in his single-handed design and construction of a machine that broke the German Enigma codes during World War II...or so the film says. While the historical accuracy of \"The Imitation Game\" comes into question on several occasions, the outstanding quality of the film's acting, direction and story is no enigma.\n\nThe movie focuses on the life of Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist and cryptanalyst. The British Intelligence recruits Turing along with other cryptographic minds to crack the Enigma codes that the Nazis use as secret communication during the war. The film's narrative alternates between three significant times in Turing's life: his education at Sherborne School as a teenager, his classified work with Enigma during the war and the investigation surrounding Turing's sexual orientation in 1952.\n\nThe settings of the Enigma machines change daily as the war progresses. The small group of cryptographers has 18 hours each day to figure out the settings of the machines before the Germans alter the settings the next day. This is a virtually impossible task for the team to accomplish because of the infinite number of possible settings the machine possesses, causing progressive frustration amongst the team. Turing's initial rudeness, apparent social detachment and unwillingness to work with the rest of the team only add to the growing tension.\n\nTuring conceives, designs and begins to build a machine that he believes will be able to mull through the numerous Enigma settings possibilities at a considerably fast rate. A machine like this has never been built, much less proved to work. His endeavor brings about much skepticism and agitation from the team. Over time however, especially after the acquisition of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightly) to the team, Turing begins to treat his colleagues with respect and gains their trust.\n\nTo say that Benedict Cumberbatch had an amazing performance at this point in his career is the equivalent of saying the sky is blue, and it remains blue yet again as Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park.\n\nTuring as shown in the film is extremely intelligent but lacks normal social skills. He is not the most likable guy; he has trouble interacting with others, takes everything that is said to him literally and has a sense of arrogance that puts others off. However, there is also warmth about his character and he genuinely desires to be liked by others. Cumberbatch expresses both aspects of this persona beautifully.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally fantastic. Those who play the members of Turing's team (Matthew Goode, Allen Leach, Matthew Beard and Keira Knightly) have great chemistry with each other and Cumberbatch. Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing mimics Cumberbatch's portrayal well, and viewers will truly believe the struggles he endures from being different than everyone else.\n\nGraham Moore took home an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the film, and it's not hard to see why. The well-written script is the fuel for the gripping, emotional drama exhibited in the actors' performances.\n\nMorten Tyldum's direction is not to be ignored either. The interchange between the various time periods in Turing's life are done smoothly, and the non-linear story telling is carried out excellently. The writing, directing and acting present Turing's struggle well as a homosexual in the 1950s and the punishment that he had to endure because of it. While both aspects of the production are good from a narrative standpoint, the direction and the writing is also where the main issue of the movie lies.\n\nIn \"The Imitation Game,\" viewers are led to believe that Turing built the machine that cracked Enigma and conceived its design virtually by himself. In reality however, the Polish Intelligence gave a primitive version of the machine to the Government Code and Cypher School in 1939, and Turing was hired to make improvements on the machine based on his knowledge of computers. Also, unlike the movie portrays; Turing was actually well liked by his colleagues and was placed as the head of the operation until 1942.\n\nThis is one of several factual errors present in \"The Imitation Game\" that range from Turing giving his machine a name, to John Cairncross being a cryptanalyst and a somewhat influential character in the story.\n\nDespite these historical inaccuracies, the movie has received widespread critical acclaim. In addition to winning the Best Adapted Screenplay award, it also received nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is a riveting drama with stellar performances, excellent writing and solid direction. Among the better films of 2014, it remains a must-see for 2015.",

When others don't see when they refuse to open their eyes on the possibilities in what they refuse to see past. When there are more important things to see when the world is at war that focus our attention on other things rather see everything else around them. When we see that only the important are allowed in some places when some places are classified and meant for a few bright minded and loyal people. When we see the reason we get passed some places is we see what others see to offer our insight in what others can't see when it's an unsolvable puzzle. When only a few people are allowed to see something's when your brilliant, loyal and male. When we see others see to some puzzles first when they have been working on it and we catchup quite fast. When what we don't see we know when all intel is brought to those who are allowed to see that makes us see that time is of the essence when we see lives are at cost. When we see war is a battle between two foes but we can't see what they do next when we can't seem to get ahead of foes. When we see messages are sent back and forth to allies that they are able to communicate but we can't see when it's in code. When we can't seem to get past things that are unorthodox and see why things are the way they are when it's not normal and comprehensible. When what we are used to seeing making words and outcomes other things we don't see does the same when we see past the exteriors of a machine to its bare components. When no one can see what we see, we are able to see a world that our brain can't do alone when it's a calculation only machine can understand a machine to see. When we see others prevent us from seeing to go elsewhere. When what we can recall seeing we know we see others rely solely on seeing life for what is worth from the outside rather inside when we see life deeper then what's on the surface. When we naturally see dangers on the surface to seek refuge down below when it's safer and calms what we wish not to see. When we can always fix what's on the surface but something's we see deep within is an egima when the human being is a complicated thing to fully see. When what others see is enough to see when social conventions and calculations render us a calculation good enough to evaluate all what we see around us. When what we see we see with our vary eyes when tests make us see beyond the test but reveals much more. When we have always seen the world differently and others see we have a knack for such different perspective thinking to see we are not absurd but normal. When we see beyond the conventions that exist to know there is provable outcomes of why failure and success is possible when calculation can't provide answers to everything. When everything is possible but others are able to see past the impossible to possible that makes us see more clearer our images. When there are plenty to see when it's possible to see every outcome passes the test to be true. When we can't see past some enigmas to lose our mind at all possibilities we can think about. When we see others do more to serve them others to see the worst and we see time running out and we lose more innocent lives. When we see who to blame when they rather see other things that also don't seem to work neither. When what we can't see we get others to see for us when we can't do it alone or fast enough then others who have fresher and clearer eyes then we do. When we see the importance of getting passed our puzzles is crucial when it allows us to function normally that we see the world for what it is and not what others tell us it is. When we need to see passed what others could see to give the greatest challenge enigma a name that suits it's closest human relation puzzle, the bond between calculation & human intelligence. When something's we don't see it is revealed to us when we see we live under others creations and control to not understand it's functionality or puzzle as it is presented to us. When we can't solve puzzles that we can't see past the nonsense, bureaucracy, and many layered protocols within it. When life we see may makes us look different but in others eyes they see it as similiar to other things associated with what we don't normally see criminality. When other things we don't see we can't associate it with anything when we have no connection to what we can't calculate. When we see something's we get passed puzzles is seeing it like a competition to win and overcome. When we have see that only connection & deeper bond we have ever had was in our past that we don't see we have with anyone else that makes some calculations to problems have it's obvious answers. When we see some puzzles are hands on we can't get passed to only give up when the answer is not worth the time & energy. When others have seen enough to get passed those who have wasted time, energy and money to answer obvious problems to stop it at its tracks when some answers are hands on solution making. When we see some puzzles are meant to be solved with time to only give it to those who are not in control the control they need to get passed. When we see some puzzles are best solved with the support, time, and calculation those need to see more clearer. When we see countless problems arise in moments to not having enough time to solve them all before we continue with larger problems to only provide quick fix solutions with conventions we see without the deeper skimatics associated with it to get passed by. When others see what we don't reveal we are told with those with a keen eye in seeing passed the shallow to what's deep within. When we see what's deep within when it's surfaced and revealed to us in what we couldn't see we bury deep inside in what we don't know. When we are able to hide our knowledge and emotions deep within us when we solely relied on our human senses to get passed our dangers to calculate an exit strategy out. When what we couldn't see it is revealed to us in what others unearthed, we were to interpret and provide the connection between the unknowns to develop a calculation that we are able to see. When we see we were unable to see something's without the right formulas having all components for machines to look. When we see that what makes everything have it's distinct characteristic or properties is what components it has that makes it unique and different from all other countless possibilities. When we see what we are missing we add when we are able to resolve an enigma in what we don't see. When what we see is the absolute answer to puzzles we can't use when we need to see how others see to make them see that we are not in control and not seeing what they plan that changes the course of the war. When we see some answers we can use to solve problems we can't use when we can't let logic & ethics pass on purpose when we see we can't when lives are at cost that outweighs calculation, logic, ethics and connection when winning only matters. When what we no longer can pass we can no longer get past when winning is only on our mind that we remain in places seeing it through to the end. When what we don't see others have been seeing when what we don't see who is in control we see now when others are on-top of things. When we see that we lost when others unearth what they see. When we can't see a life with those whom we see we don't fit the mould of social convention we see what it means and is when it's dishonest to live with miscalculated answers. When others don't see such social conventions neither to only see other unsolvable conventions to live by to not accept a quick fix. When we see that we made a large contribution to the war by seeing the right time and place to use what we see to win. When we never got to see the horrors to see only the failures and success that progresses us further in what others couldn't see coming. When what we see we refuse to see when it doesn't matter when we were only willing to see such unconventional with others who would be able to solve and see our problem to only give up the thought. When what we try to continually get passed each day is what ails us when it's unnatural and incalculable to live incomplete continuously. When we see that we are not alone when what supports us propels us to see past our barriers when it is part of who we are and what we accomplished that we help pave away a future of progress no one could see coming. When we see our invention lead to another invention (the computer) which we are able to solve puzzles even faster. \n\nWhen we see our whole life and all of life is like an enigma that we try to make sense of it, we understand it and how others accept it. When others don't see our unorthodox ways we too become some sort of an enigma that others have to decipher. When we see are far less an engima then others might seem to be when we are renowned all over the world for our problem solving skills. When we don't see some problems arising that we couldn't see before when it never saw a problem to get past rather what propels us to go further. When we see that we do have a problem that we now try to pass but unable to when we see to late for what it is. When we see others in life try to get passed their problems, questions, challengers, foes, blockades, and the unknowing that we have to everyday deal with the larger puzzles then to focus on the little ones. When we see that life looking at every single puzzle that needs to be solved stops us from moving further when we don't know the answers to such questions when the time hasn't researched it further to give us a calculation to pass us right through, but instead we carry it with us and live with it. When we see living in times of progress, much is expected to know and pass us onto a new stage in our life when conventions dictate it to and we choose to not to follow willingly when we can't get pass our past that brings us back where we originally start. When social conventions has its expectations to only fit the mould and pass on by easily or have to wait for when it is ok to come out and move on. When we see we were able to get past our enemies and move forward a future and cultural phenomenon.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) We just watched another World War II flick, Greg. This one is quite educational.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Benedict Cumberbatch does a good imitation of Alan Turing. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: We meet young Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant mathematician, logician, and cryptologist. Turing is a socially awkward man who is fascinated with communication codes. He is applying for a position in the British military to help the Allied forces crack the coding system used by Nazi Germany. Turing is placed in charge of a small group of other brilliant minds who are assigned the task of deciphering the Nazi s  Enigma  codes.\n\nGREG: Things are not that easy for Turing. The commanding officer expects the code breakers to decipher messages in 24 hours. But the cipher codes change each day. Turing believes that he must build a machine that will determine the Enigma settings automatically. This effectively breaks the Enigma code permanently. But Turing needs help. He creates a math puzzle that is published in the British newspapers to attract mathematically inclined minds. One of the contestants turns out to be a bright young woman named Joan Clark (Keira Knightley). Turing hires her, but she isn t allowed to work with the other men - because she s a woman. So Turing surreptitiously feeds her secret documents so she can help with the code breaking. And now the race is on to crack Enigma before the Germans overtake Great Britain.\n\nSCOTT: The Imitation Game is one of the better movies of 2014. Like A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, this movie tells the story of a male genius scientist who is socially challenged and requires the help of a healthy, stable woman for his genius to be realized. Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific in this role and deserves Oscar consideration. The hero story here is constructed with care. Turing is sent into an unfamiliar world in which his vast creativity is put to the ultimate test. His abrasive honesty wins him few friends and attracts several enemies within the British military and intelligence unit. His only ally is his woman friend Joan whom we think is a love interest until Turing s homosexuality is revealed. Joan proves to be a loyal friend and mentor whose steadfast companionship, not to mention her own genius, proves essential for Turing to triumph.\n\nGREG: You re right that the story is constructed with care, Scott. Sadly, it bears little resemblance to the historical facts. Certain elements are true to life: Nazis, Germany, Britain, Enigma, Joan Clark, Turing, were all there at the same time. But the competition between Turing and the lead general, Commander Denniston, (Charles Dance) was fabricated. Turing s abrasive (borderline Aspergers) personality was exaggerated. The objections of the military to creating a machine to crack the code was a complete fiction. Apparently the truth of history wasn t enough to make a compelling story. What was true was Turing s homosexuality and his doomed relationship with Joan. This is where the tragedy of The Imitation Game hits home. After having literally saved the world from the Nazi onslaught, Turing is discovered in 1950 to be gay and is subjected to chemical castration (or face imprisonment). Turing was unable to live under those conditions and ultimately committed suicide. It wasn t until 2013 that Queen Elizabeth pardoned him. Unlike the other movies you mention, Scott, this one doesn t have such a happy ending for our hero.\n\nSCOTT: You ve pointed out the irony within the tragedy of this story. The very society that Turing saves ends up turning against him. Turing defeats the Nazis but he cannot defeat the English society that is intolerant of his sexual orientation. There aren t many hero stories in which the hero saves the people who kill him. It s truly a sad, embarrassing, and appalling treatment of a man who should have been revered.\n\nGREG: That s another of my beefs with this movie, Scott. They had to concoct a villain for Turing to fight against. So they created the  Representative  villain in the form of the Commander Denniston. He represents all the conventional thinking in the military and in British society at large. The unseen enemy is the oncoming German army. The writers also create an enemy in the form of time itself. Since the Enigma code is changed daily, the code breakers have to decipher the messages before midnight each night. So, we get a nice countdown to 12:00 every day which creates a nice sense of tension.\n\nSCOTT: Overall, The Imitation Game is two hours well spent, all the historical inaccuracies notwithstanding. Alan Turing is known as the Father of modern computer science and artificial intelligence, and this film gives us some insight into the challenges he faced in developing one of the world s first computers. Turings heroism may have done more to defeat the Nazis than that of any other single individual. This movie tells a great story and features outstanding performances from the entire cast. As a result, I m happy to award this film 4 Reels out of 5. Turing s hero story is a stirring one. The man has many demons to overcome and makes many enemies. Does his character become transformed the way a good hero should? Perhaps not. Ironically, his refusal to change may be the key to his heroism. Maybe this is a tale about a British society that refuses to transform as much as it is a tale about a hero who shouldn t need to. I give Turing s heroism 4 Heroes out of 5. Turing is surrounded by villains, including his own people whom he saves. The villains here are two institutions: (1) the Nazis with which Britain is at war, and (2) the antiquated moral codes of the English society that ultimately slay Turing. The manufactured human obstacles within the British military are throwaway characters who are caricatures or tropes of typical obstructionist characters in police and military movies. I ll be generous and give this entire diverse array of villains a rating of 3 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villain:  Hero: \n\nGREG: Scott, I m a computer scientist and Turing is one of my personal heroes. He laid the foundation for formal computing theory (the Turing Machine). I am thrilled that a movie that celebrates his genius was given a proper Hollywood treatment and didn t shy away from Turing s homosexuality. However, I can t reconcile the historical inaccuracies that pepper this film. It s a complete fiction that merely borrows the essence of the truth. I would normally agree with your score of 4 Reels, but I m knocking one off because I think the true story would have made an equally viable movie. I give The Imitation Game just 3 out of 5 Reels. Turing is a tragic hero in that he saves the world from the Nazi scourge, only to be destroyed by the very people he saved. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a wonderful performance and I agree that he should be nominated for an Oscar. There isn t much transformation here. There is a scene where Joan Clark lectures Turing on playing nice with his fellow mathematicians. After which Turing appears to make friends by sharing apples with his co-workers. But he overcomes obstacles that allow him to rise to the level of a true hero. I give this presentation of Turing 4 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, the villains here are pretty generic. Nazis are a pretty safe bet as a villain in any story. And Denniston gives Turing a ripping hard time. I can t summon more than 2 out of 5 Villains for this film.  Movie: Villain:  Hero:",

            "content": "A beautiful war drama about a man who literally changed history, but no one ever knew.\n\nDuring the winter of 1952, British authorities entered the home of mathematician, cryptanalyst and war hero Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to investigate a reported burglary. They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of 'gross indecency', an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality - little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, he was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine. An intense and haunting portrayal of a brilliant, complicated man, THE IMITATION GAME follows a genius who under nail-biting pressure helped to shorten the war and, in turn, save thousands of lives.\n\nAfter watching this film twice, it's certainly one of the gems of 2014. It's a war drama about a man who went through so much to win a war, but his life went the opposite way of what he deserved. He was a genius, a hero at heart, and history treated him wrongly. But if it weren't for him, who knows where we'd be today. Alan Turing was a bright and brilliant man, and this movie certainly recognizes that. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is my favorite role I've seen Benedict Cumberbatch in. I've seen him in a couple other films, but I absolutely love him here. He brings so much personality and life into the character of Alan Turing, and I feel like I have a good sense of the kind of guy he was. He wasn't the perfect guy, or the nicest, but that doesn't mean he deserved what happened to him (no spoilers). Even though he's not the best guy, he's still very easy to follow and relate to. You can see his broke heart in his eyes, and just how everything sort of weighs upon him. Him, along with the rest of the cast, all performed admirably. \n\nThe dialogue was also the highlight of this film. The dialogue was quick and witty, but it never felt forced. A lot of the dialogue had so much meaning to it, and some of the best scenes didn't even have Cumberbatch in the spotlight. There are plenty of emotional and tear jerking moments in this film that absolutely get to me and as I reflect on the events afterwards, it still plagues the back of my mind.\n\nI feel like I learned so much about this story. This was arguably the biggest part of WWII, and I had never even heard about it until this film. Granted, I'm still young, but the secret about the Turing machine never surfaced for 50 years (I think). I felt as if this film gave great justice to the situation at hand. I learned what I needed to know, I cared about the characters, I was interested in the situation at hand, and this is a story that was meant to be told.\n\nI guess if there's one thing I could change about this film, the runtime felt a bit too long. At a point, I thought the movie was going to end. However, it kept continuing. Although I felt that what they showed us had a lot of meaning to it, I just think it was a clash in tone, which was misleading. Having the emotion build up and holding it in for an ending that's 30 minutes away took a bit of an unnecessary toll on me. Regardless, it was still a wonderful story.\n\nIn the end, \"The Imitation Game\" was one of the best films of 2014, and is certainly one you don't want to miss.",

            "content": "Over the past 20+ years we have seen numerous films about the World War II era appear on the big screen. From \"Saving Private Ryan\" to \"Schindler's List,\" we have watched amazing, heroic stories being told that has left us breathless throughout. \"The Imitation Game\" is one of those movies: a biopic that focuses on Great Britain's top-secret intelligence program on cracking Enigma. Enigma was a German machine was translated orders in a puzzle that could only be cracked by their operatives. With the machine reprogramming every morning at midnight, it was considered impossible to crack. In comes Alan Turning (Benedict Cumberbatch) who believes he can defeat the machine's puzzle with a machine of his own. Together with the help of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and his team, they work to create the machine before Germany wins the war.\n\n\"The Imitation Game,\" while an spy biopic, is also a character study on Alan Turing. While the movie works to the inevitable climax where Turing and his team complete the machine, the film also flash-forwards and back in Turing's life. The movie depicts a post-war Manchester with a detective trying to figure out what Turing did during the war while other parts show Turing's life in boarding school. By the end of the movie (after the two or three twists in the movie come full circle), you start to wonder if you can root for Turing. The movie (and Alan himself) ask the viewer to depict who Alan was: a war hero or a criminal. After seeing this film multiple times, I cannot answer the question without having arguments for both sides. I may lean one way after one viewing and the other the next time. Perhaps this is the only flaw I can find in \"The Imitation Game.\"\n\nWhere the film truly shines is in Mr. Cumberbatch's incredible performance. Nominated for an Academy Award in 2014 (which was won by Eddie Redmayne for \"The Theory of Everything\"), Mr. Cumberbatch is all-in as the arrogant genius who, according to history professionals, helped end the war 2 years earlier than anticipated. While he did not win his Oscar this time around, I doubt this will not be the last time we see him up for nomination in the coming years.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is a great biopic that shows us the intelligence side of World War II. While it is not full of blood and war violence that other films of the genre are overstuffed with, the film keeps you on the edge of your seats with tension that many might not see coming.\n\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Three years after being released \"The Imitation Game\" still delivers with a stellar cast and a compelling story. The movie follows the true story of Alan Turing, a cryptanalyst for the British Army and his race to beat the Nazi's encryption system, \"Enigma\", at the height of World War II. Although this venue for film has been done time and time again, this movie takes a new approach to it which keeps the movie feeling fresh. The race against the clock creates a movie full of tension and stress which is shown by the all British cast with riveting dialogue.\n\tBenedict Cumberbatch is the star of the show, playing Alan Turing. The actor's wit and talent shine through in this film and make it seem as if he was born to play this role. Whether it's highlighting Alan's awkward social life, or nailing Alan's speech impediment, Cumberbatch is spot on throughout the film. With his smarts, he's able to truly captivate you through the screen and make you feel as if you're the one who must break the encryption system. But Cumberbatch is not alone in this journey. With supporting actors, such as: Keira Knightley, Matthew William Goode, Mark Strong and Allen Leech, this team of top secret British geniuses work together and feed off each other during the film. \n\tKeira Knightley who stars as Joan Clarke, the only female on the team to break Enigma, is flawless in her role as Alan's friend and colleague. The movie stays true to the real-life friendship between Joan and Alan as they go through the process of breaking Enigma together. The scenes with Joan and Alan highlight how a socially awkward genius can and does connect with Joan throughout his life and is a true friend of his in a world that is just not accepting of the way Alan is. \n\tAlong with the actors, the plot is something to be commended as well. While director Morten Tyldum could have given the viewer every piece of the plot from the get-go, he instead holds pieces of the plot back to intrigue the viewer's mind. By using this approach, the viewer is invited to get creative with where they feel the plot is leading them. With the guidance from Tyldum's directing and the creativity of the viewer's mind, the viewer is lead down a path which ultimately reveals the heartwarming yet heart wrenching climax of the film.\n\tWhere the film succeeds with Alan's professional life, it fails in his private life. Although we see in a few instances into his private life, I wish director Morten Tyldum would have gone into more detail on Alan's background to help draw the viewer in even more and get a better picture of Alan outside of his encryption cracking life. The movie could have also gone into more detail about the team that Alan is forced to work. Besides Alan and Joan, the rest of the team seems one dimensional and the viewer is never fully drawn in emotionally to the rest of the cast. Although the movie is not without its faults, these cons are greatly downplayed by what the movie does extremely well.\n\tOverall, this is a brilliant movie with a cast that blends together well and a plot that is fresh and interesting. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of Alan Turing and delivers every step of the way. You will be glued to the screen for the entirety of this excellent film. This is a must-see movie that will tug on your emotions like very few movies of this generation can.",

Alan Turing was found guilty of engaging in same-sex behavior, which was (regrettably, to put it euphemistically) illegal in England at the time, and to avoid imprisonment, Turing accepted a judge's verdict to inject himself with hormones as a means of self-castration. While \"The Imitation Game\" does feature a B plot in which Turing is investigated and eventually sentenced, the film largely glosses over the outcome of the trial, revealing to the audience the existence of the hormone injections and Turing's declining health with roughly six minutes left in the film. Turing's contributions to the Allies' victory in the Second World War were incontrovertibly significant, but it is only in the film's final moments that Cumberbatch reveals to a rather horrified Knightley the result of his trial and a few captions of superimposed text then detail Turing's suicide and legacy. \n\nWhen I was a child watching cartoons on TV, every once in a while during a commercial break, a commercial would air in its entirety, and right before the next one began, the last second of another commercial would slip in by accident. I imagine that the local TV networks were merely airing commercials simultaneously and that the wires got crossed somehow; what else could explain the end of a Mazda commercial being interrupted by the half-second appearance of a toll-free number for ordering Barbies? That is how I felt with the final act of \"The Imitation Game\"; a film about a misanthropic code breaker began, played, and ended, and the tail end of another far more interesting film about the horrid treatment of gay men in the mid-twentieth century managed to sneak in before the credits of the first film rolled.",

The film tells the story of the group of men and women who worked at Britain's code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park leading up to and during WWII.Their work was to break the \"Enigma\" code, which the Nazis were using to communicate with one another about their land, sea, and sky operations. Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) was one of an elite group of mathematicians, logicians and linguists who were hired by MI-6 to find a way to solve Nazi codes. By taking a pre-war Polish electromechanical codebreaking machine, or \"bombe,\" Turing and his team discover a way to crack the code.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" is as good as the hype has lead you to believe. Cumberbatch turns in a very powerful performance alongside by the usually charming Kiera Knightley. Director Morten Tyldum keeps the story tight, but does embellish a lot. However, the important thing to take away from this movie is the unbelievable significance Alan Turing has made to our history. Because of him, historians believe WWII ended two years earlier than is should have, therefore saving millions of more lives. In addition, Turing was a homosexual in a time where that \"lifestyle\" was not acceptable, and despite becoming a war hero, he was still arrested for being gay. He had his genitals chemically castration so he wouldn't have to go to jail and shortly after, he committed suicide. The appreciation of the accomplishments of Alan Turing and how he had changed and continues to change the world is the most important thing to take away. \n\nThe movie was nominated in eight categories at the 87th Academy Awards, received  five nominations in the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and was nominated in three categories at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. It also received nine British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival.",

Unfortunately, the dialogue is cheesy, unnecessarily over-dramatized and over-acted. It wasn't until the very end when the machine finally worked and Alan was having to deal with the law-breaking activity of homosexuality that the theme became as powerful as it had intended.

What does it even mean to think?\n\nIn our time of constantly advancing technology that has gone from the desks to our pockets, it is time to take a look at the man who started it all with his revolutionary enigma machine, as made in a time when homosexuality was a crime.\n\nThe Imitation Game for the greater portion follows the given Hollywood formula for what makes a safely-played Oscar-bait biopic, but is still otherwise as easy to follow as it is inspiring in its account of an underestimated individual who did something nobody could imagine. With a bit creativity and immense usage of logic, Alan Turing influenced the digital world as well as shorted World War II by approximately two years.\n\nRelatively new director Morten Tyldum treats this whole film like an imitation game in and of itself: mixing the continual rage of war with the running cogs in Turing's brain, with quick doses of humor peppered amongst the intelligent dialogue. The overall struggle in Britain over the second World War is surveyed by three different time periods: one of Alan Turing's educational years at Sherburne School, one of Turing's 1941 mission to build a code-breaker with his team of three men and one woman, and one in 1951, when Turing is interrogated by men who wonder if he, a homosexual, is a Soviet Spy.\n\nThe best choice that Tyldum made in directing this project was the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange, Sherlock) as the vulnerable mathematician Alan Turing. The British actor absolutely makes this film worthwhile with his heavy stutter and passionate yet subtle expression of disassociation. He is that rare recreation of a historical figure that easily wins over the audience with his obsessive mechanical vigor apparent from the contents on his desk. I honestly cannot get enough of how much of himself he pours into applying his knowledge of mathematics into something that will save lives. His character becomes all the easier to connect with when we see glances at his time as a child, where he found his first homosexual love with a boy named Christopher, who defended him from the cruel treatment of other students.\n\nOutside of Turing's own little world within his mechanical mind, the creation of warzones destroying the fabric of humanity adds to the impact. The feature is edited by Academy Award winner William Goldenberg (Argo, Zero Dark Thirty) who intersperses the feature with appropriate news reel footage of the war, and recreations of Germany's attacks on Britain, leading to children shipped out of the country on trains and innocent life after innocent life being lost with each passing second.\n\nIt would have been nice to see more of what was going on with the Germans as the war was going on, as to see both sides of the conflict, but the burden put on Turing's shoulders to encrypt their secret codes indeed feels heavy. But the one asset that best contributes to his ambition to help win the war is no other than Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, Pride and Prejudice), one of the only women working for the government at the time. If it wasn't for her character to provide the moral structure of the story, then The Imitation Game would have fallen back into a clichéd snooze fest of a biopic without a hint of inspiration.\n\nIf anybody were to take a simple glance at this story, they would think that this was precisely what happened over seventy years ago. But if one were to do some research on the story of Alan Turing, then the truth would come out: not much of this story is true after all. Here is one of the numerous articles I found about this issue. I understand that creative liberties have to take place when adapting a story onto the screen, but the best stories are the stories that happen in real life to real people, and I say they are not worth altering to fit our own imaginations.\n\nThe Imitation Game is I think one of the most important stories to have come out of Hollywood in the last decade, one that tells an inspiring story that continues to influence us today. You may even be surprised to know that the government kept the Turing Machine used to encrypt German codes a secret for decades: it wasn't until just a few years ago. Therefore, I recommend this movie to anybody who can get their hands on a computer or a Blu-Ray case, as true stories like this only come around publicly once in a blue moon.",

            "content": "I had thought that if a Brit was going to win the Best Actor Oscar (R) this year it would have been Benedict Cumberbatch for his portrayal of math (or maths, as the Brits say) genius and codebreaker Alan Turing but it was not to be. Although THE IMITATION GAME plays loose with historical facts, this is a great film with some fine performances, including one from Keira Knightley, who seemed to be channeling her inner Kate Winslet.\n\nThe story of the group of men and women who worked at Britain's code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park leading up to and during WWII was protected by the Official Secrets Act up to 1974. Their work was to break the \"Enigma\" code, which the Nazis were using for their air, sea and land movements. The Poles had broken an earlier version of the code in the 1920s but, by the start of the war, the Germans had made the Enigma machines ten times more complex, allowing them close to 159 quintillion possible code combinations - that's 159 with 18 zeros after it! The Allies found themselves unable to keep up with the changes that the Nazis were making to the code every day.\n\nTuring was one of an elite group of mathematicians, logicians and linguists who were brought in by MI-6 to turn the tide. He devised improvements to a pre-war Polish electromechanical codebreaking machine (called a \"bombe\") and his machine was ultimately able to crack the code with enough speed to allow the Allies to thwart the Germans' military movements. Unfortunately, war and espionage being what they are, the Allies couldn't allow themselves to be too effective at stopping the Germans for fear that their enemy would realise that their code was finally broken and create something new to replace it. Nevertheless, the work of Turing and his colleagues was credited with not only reducing the length of the war by between two and four years, it also resulted in a successful outcome for the Allies - something that was not assured when they began their work.\n\nTHE IMITATION GAME is more than a film about breaking a seemingly unbreakable code in the nick of time thus saving the world. It's about a man who was different; who felt like he didn't belong. Like the machine he was trying to break, Turing was quite the enigma himself. \"Brilliant\", \"driven\", \"socially awkward\", \"infuriating\", and \"condescending\" are just some of the words that can be used to describe him. \"Homosexual\" was another, and it was that characteristic that did him in. Back then, being gay was a crime. Thanks to a determined police constable who was investigating a simple break in at Turing's Manchester home in 1952, his secret was ultimately revealed. Rather than going to jail, Turing agreed to chemical castration - injections of estrogen to reduce his libido. A few years later, at age 41, Turing died of cyanide poisoning. It was thought that he may have taken his own life although that determination is still in doubt. He may have inhaled the poison in the course of his work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Turing's middle school days where both his genius and sexuality are blossoming. Back in Bletchley's Hut 8, Turing calls his bombe \"Christopher\" - the name of his best friend and, apparently, \"first love\" at Sherborne School. Though nothing sexual between the two young boys is shown to us, it is clear by his love for his machine that he did have deep feelings for his friend.\n\nThe adult Turing finds friendship and understanding in Joan Clarke (Knightley), whom he hires for the team after she completes his entrance test in record time. The two quickly realise that they are both outsiders. Cryptography is not woman's work (at least it wasn't back then), so Turing and Clarke devise a way that she can still be part of the team but maintain the appearance that she is doing something that is acceptable to society. Turing offers to marry Clarke to make them both \"honest\" but ultimately must take it back. Clarke, though, is more than just a beautiful mind. She understands how the world works far more clearly than Turing does. What she wants - equality and challenge - far outweighs being in a sham marriage.\n\nThe film itself follows a fairly conventional route offering no surprises, twists or turns along the way. Perhaps to maintain its PG-13 rating (Category IIA in Hong Kong), any love scenes - homo or hetero - are absent as well. This is somewhat disappointing as we're left wondering what, if anything, Turing did with his schoolmate, and who broke into his house and why. Cumberbatch's performance, however, is top-notch as the man who was as tough to crack as the code he was trying to break. It is very sad that once Turing's secrets were laid bare for the world to see, it cost him his life.",

Yet powerful performances and a worthy story still provide something entertaining to watch, with Benedict Cumberpatch delivering all that he hides in his sleeves for a thoroughly resonant picture. I still believe the film has the potential for better drama.\n\nThe Imitation Game was once included in The Black List, with its adapted screenplay lauded by many. I personally think its okay, since tge plot it features actually derives from real events, with some little extra bits added for drama which I think are sometimes odd and forced, probably serving the purpose of giving its actors more chances to display their skills. To name a few of these elements, the move of portrating Alan Turing as a anti-social, nerdy recluse and giving him a team of normal people that are meant to dislike and then like him, is not faithful to history while not being special as a plot element, weakening the plot. At one point after the team 'rekt' Enigma and proceeded with the fact that their success should not be disclosed, the script goes to say that one of the members realized the convoy his family was located world soon be raided, as he started begging for the others to disclose their work so as to save his loved ones. I know all these elements did allow the film's cast to shine, but they certainly didn't contribute plot-wisely.\n\nBut it all boils down to the fabulous acting of Benedict Cumberpatch and Keira Knightley at the end. Some critics said that Benedict Cumberpatch is the best actors of his generation. His skills are very much portrayed in a character with so much complexity and emotions. His thought often conflicted and abstruse, peerless in terms of academic prowess yet vulnerable as a person. Cumberpatch combined the benefits of his character to engender a memorable performance. Besides, the film also did a great job in publicizing Turing's homosexuality, a firm and glistering call out for LBGT rights. Such fact has been praised by lots of authorities, and I do think it's a good thing, though I do believe people shouldn't take such things seriously in movies. Lead actress's acceptance that her partner was gay is nice.\n\nI'd opine that the movie could be made better if the film emulates Schindler's List, that is to put more emphasis on the greatness and legacy of Alan Turing's work instead of just a few closing captions on the screen. The film could also cut off a few of those minor scenes like the tussle between Turing and his colleagues, and also reminiscences between Turing and Christopher which I think is trivial and unconvincing, so the pace can be faster while leaving more run time for the depiction of war just like what Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan did(but yea I know Steven Spielberg is unique), a more realistic and accurate depiction of the real event that took place in WWII. And so the film's not the best, and the max. rating's gonna be 7. I'll keep it as that.",

What he accomplished during WWII and beyond just before his death will forever be remembered, and The Imitation Game gives us a moving tribute to a brief period of his life that mattered most.  Even with some stellar acting from our lead Benedict Cumberbatch and quite the proper supporting cast, why do I feel like the climax never quite reached the top of the crest before coming back down the other side?\n\nI get that Turing was a tinkerer, but throughout the film, instead of feeling connected with a character's mind to see at least try and understand what's going on, the movie instead keeps the viewer at arms length, much like the rest of his team until the machine magically gets completed at the end of the second act.  Sure we get the machine cost 100,000 pounds and that it works on electricity from being unplugged or switched off and on countless times, but at least give the audience the benefit of the doubt to try and understand how it works with some more depth.\n\nThat aside, Cumberbatch and company put in excellent performances from beginning to end.  Keira Knightley and him shine together on screen with each other's nuances worn on their sleeves.  The importance of the film is doubled with the inclusions of Mark Strong and Charles Dance in brief, but crucial scenes they act the hell out of over the two hours.\n\nImmediately, my mind went to comparing this movie to A Beautiful Mind.  While that ended up being more of a love story and look into mental illness, The Imitation Game sticks to more of an espionage theme.  Perhaps that's why I still consider the former better than the latter here, but overall, whenever the silver screen gives us a chance to peek into great minds like these, I'm more than happy to sit back and be amazed.",

So it was a bit of a shock to find that Alan's character, who was described by reviewers as someone who couldn't get along with people,  was courteous and didn't throw wrenches at people like the athletic one did.  When the girl verbally abused him, too, with no provocation, as well as the time she was kind to the one who threw a wrench at him and told him he needed to get along with people, I felt the reviewer had it backward and that the film brought to light a problem we still have in the world: that of putting the responsibility of the bullying on the victim. Once solved we'll save our children, too.\nI was still glad I watched the film and felt the man who played Turing was endearing.",

It's a well made character piece with a powerhouse lead brilliantly capturing how this man helped crack an enigma. Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a mathematician who was employed by Major General Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) and Commander Alastair Denniston (Charles Dance) to work at the top secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, to help crack the German Enigma code that could help them win the war. Turing has come up with a blueprint for a machine that could break the code, but despite scorn and opposition from fellow code-breakers Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), Turing is determined to succeed, but he has a dark, illegal secret that will be his downfall. Benedict Cumberbatch really excels at playing Turing, a man who was notoriously impossible to get along with and always kept to himself, but knew what he was doing when it came to solving the impossible. It's backed by a good cast, and while it does go back and forth across Turing's life a bit rapidly, it's a well made film.",

It's at odds with the idea of films being allowed to wander. That's because it's manufactured to achieve its effect; which duplicitous lay it does well. It tells the story of Alan Turing who essentially won WWII by cracking the nazis in breakable code by essentially inventing computers. It features both a framing device and flashbacks so we have stories at 3 different levels. Cumberbatch is of course very good in the lead role but it's in how wheelhouse - irascible genius. Turing joins the mission out of a want to play games and solve problems much to the chagrin of everyone around him. As he develops his computer he battles the odds of disbelievers who he wins over, inevitably. It rises above because the Turing story is amazing and should be told more and is heartbreaking in its finale. Turing was likely autistic to some degree and also was a homosexual which was illegal in England. We also see all the ugliness of war in the MI-6 lying to the people, the government, the Germans, and allowing leaks to the Russians. War is ugly and unfortunate for all involved. The travesty is of course being a homosexual cost Turing his life despite everything he did for his country and the world. The direction doesn't do anything you don't expect it to do, and the story contains no real surprises. The supporting cast is uniformly strong, led by a delightful Knightley.

Die Schwächse seines Landes Grossbritannien besteht in der Verfolgung homosexueller Menschen wie ihn (eine Praxis bis 1967). Turings Stärke bewirkte, dass England den Krieg gegen Deutschland gewann - was wiederum durch die Schwäche seines Heimatlandes fast vereitelt wurde. Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) entschied den zweiten Weltkrieg für die Allierten durch die Entwicklung einer Maschine, welche die Enigma Codes der Deutschen entschlüsseln konnte. Seine Erfindung ist das Vorbild des digitalen Computers. Dennoch wurde Turing nach dem Krieg aufgrund seiner Homosexualität verhaftet und gezwungen, sich einer Hormon-Kur zu unterziehen, die ihn in den Selbstmord trieb. 50 Jahre lang hielt man die Information über Turings Erfindung geheim. Niemand kannte den Kriegshelden. Turing wird im Film als unfassbar arrogant, humorlos und unfähig, auf Menschen einzugehen, charakterisiert. Die Tatsache, dass er die Gefühle seiner Mitmenschen nicht im geringsten deuten kann, lassen darauf schliessen, dass er Anzeichen von Autismus hatte. Drehbuch-Autor Graham Moore schrieb die Geschichte des Codierungs-Genies wie ein Puzzlespiel. Der Film wird auf drei Zeitebenen erzählt: Die Ermittlungen nach dem Krieg, die Turing schliesslich vor Gericht brachten, seine Schulzeit und die Ereignisse während des Krieges. Der norwegische Regisseur Morten Tyldum mutet uns bei all dem nicht zu viele wissenschaftliche Fakten zu: Turing gewinnt den Krieg mit Hilfe von Menschen, die besonders dazu befähigt sind, Kreuzworträtsel zu lösen. Menschen wie Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), die Turing ausserdem Wärme und Menschlichkeit vermittelt. Sie ist die einzige Frau im Team, die einzige Frau in einem Männer-Beruf (was immer wieder für Schwierigkeiten sorgt). Turing und Clarke müssen beide ihre wahre Identität verheimlichen. Beide ergänzen einander. Besonders bewundert Turing ihre Fähigkeit, Sympathie zu erregen - was sie kühl erklärt: \"I'm a woman in a man's job. I don't have the luxury of being an ass.\" Nach dem gewonnen Krieg erleben wir Turing unter Drogen-Einfluss, unfähig, ein einfaches Kreuzworträtsel zu lösen. Ironie des Schicksals, denn ohne sein Wirken hätte der Krieg wohl zwei Jahre länger gedauert und ein grosser Teil der Briten wäre einfach verhungert. mehr auf cinegeek.de",

The supporting cast also did a bang-up job; almost everyone gets their moment in the spotlight, really really good all around. loved Charles Dance, wanna see more stuff with him.\n\nThe film also did a really good job jumping between the war and after the war; the cinematography kind of focused these switches. during the war was pretty colorful and more even and then after had a more cold British look that really made Turing's loneliness and sadness come to light. I also wasn't really expecting the focus on how his homosexuality affected everything - which i felt was an interesting turn; his isolation became more about that than his intelligence and it was even more of an antagonist than Germany in regards to the plot. real interesting stuff.\n\nI loved the film; i think it told the story of Turing cracking the Enigma machine really well and delved further into his story than I thought it would. definitely worth checking out. you'll go for the big screen, but the huge sound design once Turing's machine gets going is what'll make seeing it in the theater worth it.",

This is a fairly mainstream treatment of  a pretty exceptional story. The direction is strong without being flashy or bravura. The screenplay is fabulously written, but aside from a very-well-handled non-chronological approach, it's not particularly innovative.\n\nTurns out it's all about the characters and the stakes. \n\nAlan Turing was a genius and a hero (although I doubt he'd accept the second compliment). On the basis of this film he was probably autistic, certainly difficult and painfully vulnerable. Benedict Cumberbatch is tremendous, portraying him utterly fearlessly and with massive emotional depth that had me weeping more than once. The supporting characters are universally terrific, from Mark Strong as the manipulative MI6 boss to Rory Kinnear as the copper who uncovers more than he'd bargained for.\n\nThe work done by Turing (and many, many others) at Bletchley Park saved (probably) millions of lives. It ushered in the future of computing and artificial intelligence that is at the heart of everything we know today. It is vitally, vitally important. And it came at a price, the 'blood-soaked calculus' that required his greatest achievement to be kept completely secret for decades. But his personal stakes in this story go way beyond that, as his homosexuality kept him even more isolated, and his despicable treatment by the UK authorities (under the laws of the time) is heartbreaking.\n\nThis is a tremendously good film, and tells a truly human, important story.",

            "content": "In my review of The Great Gatsby, I said that director Baz Luhrmann \"has always been more interested in drawing comparisons between different themes and cultures than he has ever been in historical fidelity.\" Luhrmann often went out of his way to suggest parallels between our world and the Roaring Twenties, whether in his contemporary soundtrack choices or the speeds at which Gatsby's car could travel.\n\nWe approach a similar dilemma with The Imitation Game. It differs from Luhrmann's film due to its basis in historical characters, and if viewed narrowly as a biopic, it definitely has some issues. But if we look beyond the familiar beats of Oscar-bait films, seeing this as less of a portrait than a lens through which to view something else, the film gracefully and poignantly vaults over all its hurdles and emerges as one of the very best of the year.\n\nThe Imitation Game certainly does raise the question of whether historical accuracy should come before dramatic tension. There are clearly many examples in Hollywood where embellishment for the sake of dramatic effect has gone too far, often for no good reason except to make America look good - think of U-571 or Pearl Harbour in recent memory. And it's not just Hollywood that falls into this trap; as much as I praised The Impossible, I still had reservations about the way it potentially marginalised the indigenous victims of the Boxing Day tsunami.\n\nIf The Imitation Game had proclaimed itself to be a documentary or a docudrama, then many of the criticisms made about its accuracy would carry more weight. Speaking purely as an historian, it is frustrating that Joan Clarke's means of joining the team is made more fantastical, or that Alan Turing's machine wasn't called Christopher, or that Commander Denniston becomes more of a villain than his relatives claim. But to obsess over these details to the point of rejecting the film entirely is to misunderstand the true intentions of the filmmakers.\n\nScreenwriter Graham Moore, who won an Oscar for his efforts, said repeatedly in interviews that he wanted to \"honour\" Turing's work and memory. The criticisms that the film glosses over the character's homosexuality are very misleading: drawing attention to his sexuality over and above anything else would be much more of an insult than completely ignoring it. But more than that, these and similar criticisms miss what Moore and director Morten Tyldum were trying to do: rather than faithfully reprint every part of Turing's life, they wanted to use his work as a springboard into complex themes and ideas.\n\nAn equally helpful, if unusual, point of comparison would be with Apocalypse Now. I said in my now-antiquated review that, from a coldly rational standpoint, there are many aspects of Francis Ford Coppola's epic which are problematic; it's overly long, over-indulgent, Marlon Brando is poorly directed, a lot of the characters aren't properly developed, and it contains one scene of actual animal cruelty. But in spite of all these things, the film is a masterpiece because it explains the horrors of the Vietnam War in a profound and powerfully visceral manner.\n\nWhat The Imitation Game does so brilliantly is to take Turing's extraordinary achievements and use them as a foundation for a compelling and ultimately tragic examination of secrecy. The title refers not only to Turing's famous test around artificial intelligence, but also to the lies which those working at Bletchley Park are forced to live in order to do their work and save people's lives. The film is a great examination of the ethical problems of lying to protect people, and how secrecy and denial can eat away and destroy a person's very self.\n\nPerhaps the best scene in the entire film comes immediately after the team have cracked Enigma. After the cheers and tears have subsided, it suddenly dawns on the group that they cannot share their discovery with the outside world; if the Germans find out they have broken the code, they will adopt a new code and all the codebreakers' efforts will have been in vain. In order to protect their discovery, they have to withhold information and still let some ships be sunk. In a split second abstract mathematics becomes the reality of human lives, and we are shattered just as much as the characters.\n\nThis scene also illuminates the skill of Moore and Tyldum as filmmakers. In a more overtly Hollywood effort, the film would have climaxed with Turing's Eureka moment, before flashing forward to the end of the war and everyone going home. But like A Beautiful Mind before it, The Imitation Game tempers its triumphs with the frailty of human emotion. It adds conditions and consequences to the brilliant achievements of Turing and his team, and it has the confidence (unlike Ron Howard's film) to end on a deeply bittersweet note.\n\nSecrecy and deception follow Turing throughout his life. His relationship with Christopher becomes so strong because he doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else when they are together. Christopher's death gives birth to the adult Turing, who is constantly having to pretend to be someone else, covering up not just his sexuality but his innermost feelings, and projecting an image of distance or aloofness. Turing never celebrates his contribution to the war effort because his triumph is balanced by his inner conflict, and his advances in computing could be interpreted as him atoning for his own flaws. In trying to make machines think, and think faster than humans, he is subtly showing his hand about his own feelings of inadequacy.\n\nFor all the skill of Moore's script, precious little of this nuance would have come out without Benedict Cumberbatch. From the first second you see him, you instantly accept him as Turing; the physical resemblance is palpable, and there is an intriguing sadness in his eyes which demands your attention. He inhabits Turing, shrinking into his every pecular foible and tic, and lacking any of the self-consciously showy nature of many 'awards worthy' performances. It solidifies his reputation (as if such a thing were necessary) as one of the most consistently arresting actors of our age.\n\nOne of the other pleasant surprises about The Imitation Game is its playful side. When Turing states bluntly to Joan Clarke what they are going to be doing, Clarke pauses and then simply says: \"Oh.\" Many similar period dramas would have overegged the British stiff upper lip, reducing all the intrigue and high stakes to a mere comedy of manners. But this film has fun with the more rigid social mores of the 1940s, and Keira Knightley does a very good job with the scenes she is given.\n\nOn top of all that, The Imitation Game looks glorious. Tyldum proved in Headhunters that he can utilise shadows and composition to create tension, and here he directs with a steady and thoughtful hand, allowing things to unfold at a pace which is neither rushed nor ponderous. He is ably assisted by cinematographer Óscar Faura, who shot The Impossible alongside genre hits like The Orphanage and Julia's Eyes. The period details are immaculately captured, particularly the dark greens and browns of Bletchley Park and the stiff, starchy white of the men's shirts. As before, it never goes overboard with the period detail, but everything still looks and feels as it should.\n\nThe Imitation Game is a striking and stunning film which uses Alan Turing's achievements as a starting point for a detailed and heartbreaking examination of secrecy, ethics and human nature. For all the arguments about the film's resemblance to the real-life story, Tyldum's creative decisions pay off in spades, resulting in a beautifully mounted, well-told drama which is at turns distressing, thought-provoking and heartbreaking. It remains one of the best films of 2014, as well as an essential and compelling piece of cinema.",

Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly are fine enough (although not exciting), so it is likely the script and the direction that are to blame.
