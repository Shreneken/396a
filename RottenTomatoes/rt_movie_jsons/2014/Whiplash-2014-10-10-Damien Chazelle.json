            "content": "I reviewed the movie Whiplash. This is a movie starring J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller. The movie is about Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) who is an ambitious young jazz drummer, in pursuit of rising to the top of his elite music conservatory. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an instructor known for his terrifying teaching methods, discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into the top jazz ensemble, forever changing the young man's life. But Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher pushes him to the brink of his ability and his sanity. And as Andrew keeps pushing and pushing himself, he finally snaps. He charges at Fletcher and starts attacking him which leads to Fletcher getting fired from charges that students said about him. The students were saying he caused them harm physically and mentally. The story concludes with Andrew walking down the street when he sees a jazz club and looks at the sign they have posted by the door and it says Fletcher is performing. Andrew walks into the club where he meets Fletcher after his performance and Fletcher tells him he is starting a new jazz band and that they need a drummer that can play the collage notes he learned back when he was playing with Fletcher but when Andrew goes to perform fletcher deceives him and the band starts playing music that Andrew doesn't know so  Andrew finally snaps and takes over and the band starts playing the music Andrew was brought in to play. Andrew drums his heart out and that's when Andrew realized he finally became the drummer he was destined to be. Whiplash got a 94% on rotten tomatoes and got a 94%on what the audience thought this movie won five Oscars in 2015 for best sound mixing, best-supporting Actor, best film Editing, best-adapted Screenplay, and finally best picture. My thoughts of this movie were it was  phenomenal best acting I've ever seen. It truly tells a story. Miles Teller did a great job portraying Andrew. J.K. was one of the most menacing villains I've seen in a long time. And I'm surprised this didn't win best cinematography. The cinematography in this picture was outstanding, especially Andrew when he was practicing the drums, just seeing the sweat coming off the drums and his hands starting to bleed onto the drums just how they shot that scene was outstanding. In my opinion, I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Whiplash\" is a gripping and intense film that leaves its audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Directed by Damien Chazelle, this critically acclaimed movie was released in 2014 and has since become a modern masterpiece.\n\nThe story centers around a young jazz drummer named Andrew Neiman, played brilliantly by Miles Teller, who is determined to become one of the greatest jazz musicians of his generation. Andrew is accepted into the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, where he meets the enigmatic and ruthless jazz instructor Terence Fletcher, portrayed by J.K. Simmons in an Oscar-winning performance. Fletcher's teaching methods are harsh and unorthodox, as he pushes Andrew to his limits, demanding nothing short of perfection.\n\nOne of the standout features of \"Whiplash\" is the electrifying and soul-stirring jazz music that serves as the heartbeat of the film. The film's soundtrack, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is a masterpiece in itself, perfectly capturing the essence and intensity of jazz music. The music is flawlessly integrated into the narrative, adding depth and emotion to every scene, and elevating the film to a whole new level.\n\nThe performances in \"Whiplash\" are nothing short of extraordinary. Miles Teller delivers a career-defining performance as Andrew, portraying the character's unwavering determination and internal struggles with incredible authenticity. J.K. Simmons is a force to be reckoned with as Fletcher, exuding an imposing presence and an air of unpredictability that keeps the audience on their toes.\n\nThe screenplay of \"Whiplash\" is sharp and tightly woven, with a perfect balance between drama and suspense. The film delves into the toxic relationship between student and teacher, exploring themes of ambition, obsession, and sacrifice. It raises thought-provoking questions about the price of greatness and the lengths one is willing to go to achieve it.\n\nThe direction by Damien Chazelle is masterful, creating a palpable tension throughout the film that is both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. The camera work is dynamic and immersive, capturing the rhythm and intensity of the jazz performances with precision. Chazelle's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, making \"Whiplash\" a visual and auditory feast for the senses.\n\nIn addition to its technical excellence, \"Whiplash\" is also a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, examining the dark and often destructive side of ambition and the pursuit of excellence. It's a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, sparking conversations and reflections on the nature of art, mentorship, and the sacrifices we make in pursuit of our dreams.",

There is truth to trauma creating great art and neuropathways. I felt one thing was missing from this movie was a scene to really hit home how wrong the \"monster\" was. A simple meeting with the school where they informed him that they hired him to teach the students without emotionally damaging them and if he wanted to \"mold\" and manipulate the next best jazz great he could do it on his own time and with his own liability. telling him teaching does not require \"belittling\" a student to greatness so he can stroke his ego. Just a little more of that would have helped the audience understand how big this monster was and the ending would of been that much more satisfying",

I applaud the creators for making something that is riveting and suspenseful while at the same time is down to earth without a large budget or special effects, etc.  We all have that teacher in our past that everyone was afraid of and graded hard, and this touches that nerve.  Additionally, with the short burst practice and yelling sessions, the audience gets instant feedback into 'is the drumming good or not?' without really knowing anything (or in my case, even caring) about music.  The movie isn't about music.  It is about driving to greatness and what you have to sacrifice for that.\nOn the down side, I don't know how that guy ever had a teaching job.  And the ending was sloppy.  Why did Nieman agree to do it?  Why didn't they ever even have one practice?  Why didn't the band revolt?",

            "content": "During my examination days, I once said while carrying my failed literature test,  \"Art is subjective, literature is too, there's no standard answer to a piece of creativity.\" While most movies have their assumed ending, Whiplash is the only movie I've seen that gave two perspectives that actually makes a lot of sense. \n\nThe obsession for greatness, and Happiness, are the two polar opposites shown in this movie, and one's values will deeply affect how one sees this movie in a motivational film or a tragedy film. \n\nAs a motivational film, Whiplash has everything a great motivational film needs; intense, emotional scenes, impressive editing, and strong dialogue between two characters who strive for excellence. Nearly everything Andrew Neiman did in the film since his arrival at Fletcher's Studio band has the intention to be the best, trying to meet Fletcher's standards, but was constantly beaten down. In the end, even facing a career-ending performance that was set up by Fletcher, Andrew returned, and did not just perform, he impressed the one man who is his greatest hindrance and reached excellence. Truly an awesome motivational film.  From a perspective like this, one will see that a man can reach greatness with an immense work ethic and extremely strong resilience. \n\nBut on the other hand, some people view Whiplash's ending tragically. In the end, Andrew is under the spell of Fletcher, as he finally becomes the \"Charlie Parker\" Fletcher longed for.  \n\nBefore Fletcher, Andrew is already obsessed with his drumming, he stated he doesn't need friends, and he quickly discharged his thought on dating Nicole once he realized he need to practice more and he will stay up all night with messed up bloody hands just to get his part on \"Caravan\", but when even he was broken by Terence Fletcher, it is shown how Fletcher is as a person, he broke the mind of the obsessed and he has no intention of positivity for Andrew until Andrew proved himself. While Andrew himself tried to return to his normal life by calling Nicole, returning to his home and failed, only had one way out, proving himself on the big stage with his music career on the line. But in the end, Andrew still proved himself, he chose greatness over his humanity, and that is a choice. Something with no right answer. \n\n The clear cue is shown already early in the dinner table scene, when Andrew states \"I rather die drunk, broke and die in 34 and have people at the dinner table to talk about him than be rich, sober at 90 and nobody remembers who I was.\" \n\nAnd to me, Whiplash is a motivational film, I am moved by the amazing editing and the interaction between Andrew and Fletcher, they are both striving for excellence, and obsessed with music. The jazz pieces are amazing and the ending scene is one of the greatest redemption scenes I have ever seen. \n\nBut only one's values decide what Whiplash wanted to present.",

JK Simmons just delivered the best piece of acting I have probably ever seen no doubt about it. This character was scary and unphased but just when you believe this character isn't All that. The soft cloudy image you may have of him becomes a dark poisoned fog. The Best thing about the character wasn't even how scary he can be its the fact that what he says is the straight up truth, he understands how the world works far beyond other which is what makes him great. The fact that he doesn't get recognized for the work he puts backstage alone represents how people truly just look at the presentation rather than the story of the presenter. The main character himself was deceived by him throughout the Film. Lets talk about the ending, that is some of the best music I have heard and it was just a joy to watch. A phenomenon! The only Criticism I have is the undeveloped story of Nicole. I love how She was there mainly to represents the main characters confidence level throughout the movie as when he got into fletchers band he asked her out and when he became core member he became too cocky even so in the end but that's where it hit him that others have a life too and its not revolved around just him. Although these are all positives the fact that the members of the family has as little role as that is where I hoped for more. Two NFL 3rd league players who are always talked positively about versus a talented hardworking drummer who is always criticised. Would've been great to show who's on top but at the same time the ending was too perfect and there was no room for that. 9.9/10 overall",

            "content": "As it relates to reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I have seen consensus that Whiplash is one of the greatest films, of which I agree. However, I have seen other reviews of the film on the internet, saying that the film is nothing more than a bullying teacher and a talented drummer. I am here to explain my thoughts on why that is incorrect and to hopefully persuade one viewer who may have read those reviews and has or has not seen the film but in any case agrees with those standings. Whiplash, starring Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman and J.K. Simmons starring as Terrence Fletcher is a film about being the greatest by whatever means possible, and a teacher wanting to develop the greatest musician to ever be. The part of the film I believe most people have a problem with is all the violence and \"unrealistic\" anger of Fletcher onto Neiman. These scenes in the film, however, may not be the most realistic but do set the stage for Neiman to want to become the greatest drummer of all time. The film takes you through the struggles on that journey and what one must give up to be the greatest, and what a teacher must do and put his students through to eventually create and curate the greatest musician to have ever lived. While the film may be a hard watch for those who do not believe what musicians will go through to be the best, any person who knows music and a person who can appreciate what it takes to be the best knows that the film creates a feeling of greatness through impeccable acting, incredible drumming, and immersive atmosphere through the short one hour twenty minute \"epoch\" of Andrew Neiman aspiring to be the best drummer to ever live. Whiplash earns itself a first and solid 100% from me. I urge each person to watch this film, and experience all it has to offer, which is a lot.",

The story was so incredibly gripping thanks to amazing performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Simmons in particular was masterful; I don't think I've ever been more fearful of a character than I was of Terence Fletcher, and maybe that's because I'm a music student and I'm scarred in my own special ways, but I don't care. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and the last 20 minutes put my jaw on the floor. Chazelle depicts the descent into madness so well, both with his cinematography and the dialogue. The soundtrack was so well-tailored to this movie, and I was very pleased to discover that Justin Hurwitz wrote the score. He was great in La La Land (Mia and Sebastian's Theme, anyone?), so I was happy to learn that he and Chazelle are all buddy-buddy. While I still favor La La Land by a hair, Whiplash is incredible.

Bullying is a frequent theme and trope in American movies and TV. 85% of high school shooters suffered severe bullying, so it's time to root bullying out of film and television (other than to rightly demonise it). To glorify abuse and bullying in this manner is unacceptable. It's not a sign of genius, it's a sign of an incomplete life.",

Some other things that are worth bringing up is the character of Fletcher and the actor J.K. Simmons as well as Miles Teller and his character of Andrew. The two main characters. Miles Teller actually performs most of the drumming in the movie himself, he was the perfect choice to play the role of Andrew, and the character Fletcher is easily one of my favorite villains in cinematic history. Ive watched this movie 3 times in a row and that is because of my fascination with Fletcher. I can't really decide whether to appreciate him for pushing Andrew to the point of absolute success, or hate him for destroying Andrews life in the process. Nevertheless the movie tells a beautiful story about how absolute success requires so much loss, and the question you must ask yourself by the end of the movie is; is it really even worth it?",

Whiplash is a prime example of how a film can be a masterpiece without having the need for hundreds of millions of dollars and 20 different sets.

His acting is remarkable, as he is able to go from teddy bear nice guy, to in your face drill sergeant in a second which is hard to do for a lot of actors but he does it like its another Tuesday. Miles Teller was also great in this, as he makes you feel for his character throughout the film as he try's to simply get what a lot of real life people want, and that's recognition for commitment. The music, omg THE MUSIC!!! It is easily one of the most enjoyable parts of the film especially when you get to the climax, the final song of the film is perfect, right down to the last note on the page. Overall a masterpiece of a film and kudos to the Academy for rarely making a good decision and giving J.K. Simmons the Oscar he rightfully deserves, 3, 2, 1, lets jam.",

            "content": "An Insane Up-close and Personal Nerve Rattling Ride. A Chazelle Picture Comes to Life.\n\nNava Medikonda | 4/5 Rating\n\nDamien Chazelle has created a Jazz movie, one that reflects the struggle for musician's and their livelihood.\n\nWhiplash hinges itself as a love story between Andrew(Miles Teller) and Fletcher(JK Simmons). We are taken through a rough story that only becomes more crazy as time passes, ups and downs, its a perfect ride.\n\nThe films opening scene starts with the 2 most important characters of the film, and their perspectives on what a good drummer should be. Fletcher has an interest in meeting Andrew after he catches Andrew practicing the drums. The personality of Fletcher's darker side is already introduced, and Andrew's desire to impress is quickly obvious.\n\nThe goal of Miles Teller in the film is to become \"one of the greats,\" and JK Simmons in the film has the goal of \"pushing beyond the expected of a musician.\"\n\nTeller's character is easily a great setup because we understand his desire to become a great drummer, and we know and get snippets from his life, other than his passion for drumming. On the other hand, Simmons's character lacks the story of his own life outside \"teaching.\" This effect puts a viewer to question why Fletcher is so ambitiously bashing of his drummers, and the other musician's in the story. His character comes off as an evil villain trying to push an artist to their fullest potential, even though that may not seem obvious at first.\n\nThe art of the \"cut\" in Whiplash is extraordinarily fast paced, and a tension bringing illusion. The films editing is brilliant, and Tom Cross the film editor makes sure the audience is hooked to the screen.\n\nWe are continuously told the same message throughout the story to \"not give up.\" Andrew's luck may or may not be the worst, and his situation may, or may not be fair, but the story strives to tell the message, take chances when given the opportunity. Do not hide behind who you are trying to be, and do what you want to do, how you want to do it.\n\nAn astounding performance is given by Teller and Simmons. Teller portrays what it feels like to be an aspiring musician, and Simmons portrays exactly how a demanding abusing mentor would act.\n\nDamien Chazelles film is a film that is rare to come across. Its easily the \"one of a kind\" like film. The film was shot in 19 days, and a ARRI ALEXA \"Digital\" Camera was used, alongside a Canon EOS-7D Camera and Angenieux Optimo Zoom Lenses, and a few more unique lenses.\n\nWords aren't the right way to describe Whiplash. Its a cinematic pleasure. The film is impressive, and an audience won't get bored while watching it, the performance, the cutting, the sound, the music, the lighting, and the directional style all contribute to making this fantastic film. It is truly a movie that should be watched in theaters.\n\nAs for director Damien Chazelle, Whiplash has become his first film that gas gotten so much recognition, and its extremely understandable why. This film deserves to be called one of the greats, and its storytelling style in screenplay and the motion picture itself has awards coming its way.\n\nThe final performance in the film is exactly what the audience wanted to see, something unexpected, something that was impressive. Even after Andrew was thrown out of his music school, Fletcher was too thrown out shortly after. As the two meet up again, Fletcher offers Andrew a favor, playing in front of people who can potentially change his life. Andrew uses this opportunity to show off his skills, and Fletcher knowing Andrew as a great drummer, helps him do that. In the end, we don't see Fletcher as a sabotaging abuser who wants to crush a musicians dream, but someone who was trying to push a musician to greatness, to becoming great.\n\nThe films story is strongly a simple one, but the more connections a viewer makes, the more complex and personal it will get. The movie is entertaining, and watching JK, and Miles, for a short 1 hour and 46 minutes, it feel much shorter.",

While having no exact rhythm or sense made up for it, the color scheme is wildly under-appreciated and is what I think made the movie stand out as much as it did. The soundtrack is also great and is an example for how good a movie can be just based of the soundtrack. The fact that about 40% of the soundtrack is Miles Teller's actual drumming is awesome. Overall, this is a great movie that I can see becoming a classing in the near future.",

However, it is violent and contains several accounts of emotional abuse (-1 stars). \n\nSPOILERS: In a nutshell, Whiplash explores how far one can go to become \"one of the greats,\" in which the conductor, Terence Fletcher, strongly believes in pushing the musicians as far as possible to find the next \"great musician.\" He verbally attacks the students, hurls objects around the practice room, and breaks several things (which I found distressing). Additionally, the main character Andrew wants to fulfill his dream of becoming \"one of the greats\" and does whatever it takes to stay in Terence's band. Consequently, he neglects his physical and mental well-being to meet Terence's strict standards. He gives up on romantic relations and dedicates his time to drumming. The movie ends on a cliffhanger, and we cannot see Andrew's success/failure as a drummer. Understandably, this could have been deliberate to make the audience think about the relationship between Andrew and Terence. Even after the conflict between the two characters, Andrew may have finally gotten approval from Terence after his impressive drum performance.",

The performances, the script, and the direction are of course essential to its success, as is the economic run-time. But for me what really makes it sing is the way the movie's whole craft - but especially the editing and cinematography - cast it more as an action film than as something more conventional for the plot's structure. Almost everything to do with music in the film is cast with military/action overtones and the result is adrenalised, breathless, and thrilling - with a romantic subplot that's also suffused with heart and soul. All of this means that when a character falls, trips or some other genuine physical incident, it leaps off the screen and grabs the viewer with an intense impact that is missing in many genuine action films. A question at the film's heart  - if the relationship between teacher and pupil is bullying, abusive or inspirational  - is left tantalisingly unresolved, in the care of the viewer meaning this is a film for heart, soul, and mind.",

The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does.\n\nThe script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace.\n\nDamian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view.\n\n'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene.\n\nOtherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The film stars Miles Teller who doesn't have too much development outside of his passion, as it shows that his objective to succeed at drumming has taken over his life, both physically and mentally. He is supported by J.K. Simmons who proves why he deserved that Oscar for this role with such a terrifying performance. At first he appears as a strict teacher with sympathy for new and young students, but as time passes you realise he uses that kindness so that people open up to him, only for him to strike them where they're vulnerable. That switch from insane aggression to a (fake) sympathetic mentor highlights Simmons' fantastic range as when he's at his worst (in a good way) he makes the viewer nervous.\n\nTeller's characters drive to be the best he possibly can be is captivating as you see the lengths he goes to be the best, with physical damage getting involved. The rivalry (of sorts) that Teller and Simmons develop is both tense and thrilling as the outcome could be so unexpected.\n\nWhile Whiplash (2014) is a fantastic film with a engaging story, the main standout from it is J.K. Simmons performance, which deservedly won him an Oscar.",

            "content": "There truly are both no words to explain how good this movie is and thousands of words to explain how good this movie is. I'll start with the cast. J.K. Simmons is... holy fuck. His performance is one of the best of his career and of the 2010s. The energy he brings when Fletcher is manic is intense, and the wholesomeness he delivers is phenomenal. The psychology of Fletcher is complex and fascinating. There is no simple term for what he suffers from. Miles Teller performs the best in his current career. We beautifully see his transformation from his anti-social awkwardness and existential crises to his full-on sociopathic dedication to his success and his refusal to want to hate Fletcher and the need for approval from him. This is possibly one of the greatest portrayals of a sociopath in cinema history. For those who aren't fully educated on what a true sociopath is (thanks to our flawed education system), it is most likely not what you are thinking. Sociaptthy has barely any connections to psychopathy. The personality disorder is called ASPD (Anti-social Personality Disorder) and I recommend looking into it further if you are fascinated by Andrew Neiman. Enough with the cast, the pacing in this movie is a masterclass. The 2nd act feels like 4 hours that went by in 20 minutes but was actually 1 hour, probably a very confusing sentence but if you've seen the film you'd understand. The editing is *chef kiss*. The lighting is phenomenal, every scene feels like you are in a world tour jazz competition. The directing is unique and on key and is Damien Chazelle's best writing-directing credit he will most likely ever have. I'll wrap up this review by saying, I was shocked when I saw the Blumhouse intro in the beginning, and at the end, I think I realized why Jason Blum produced this; this is a horror film, the horrors of our real-world; the horrors of emotional abuse and untamed mental health; this film made my brain cry.

            "content": "Andrew Niemann will do anything to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world. We meet Andrew at the start of the film starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, a school which we are told is the best school of music in the United States. Despite not coming from any great artists or creatives, with his father being a moderately successful English teacher and failed writer, Andrew has made it here and is awaiting his moment to push up to the top. That moment comes in the form of the chance meeting with the teacher in charge of the best students at Shaffer Terence Fletcher. After this chance encounter with Fletcher in one of the practice rooms, Andrew is asked to join Fletcher in his studio band as an alternate drummer. After joining Andrew quickly realizes that Fletcher operates with violence and intimidation to push his students to achieve the best possible. Fletcher leaves every student for themselves to fight to the top in a very aggressive and cutthroat classroom and band. Despite all this Andrew takes this opportunity exited to push himself to be the best and achieve his goal. He will have to figure out what he is willing to sacrifice to achieve his goals.\n\nWhiplash is a wonderful depiction of an artist pushing to achieve greatness at any cost. This depiction is done through masterfully crafted cinematography, soundtrack, and the great performances of both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. To begin with Miles Tellers' performance as Andrew Niemann, a worse actor would have made the mistake of letting Andrew grow to confidant whenever success is achieved Teller, however, holds any sense of complete confidence off until the very conclusion of the move making that climax all the more satisfying. He allows for a small spark of passion to shine through the initial insecurity to give the audience something to take interest in and for Fletcher to feed off of and push. Now onto Simmons as Fletcher, with less dedication and intensity a less skillful actor could have butchered the part. Fletcher needs to be both the god and the devil in the film, he needs to give all the opportunities for Andrew to take advantage of and he needs to be the one to break Andrew down and keep him from falling into complacency. An actor who does not fully commit to being this would lose the interest of the audience early on. Now we can look at how the two actors, and in turn their characters, interact to help create such a good story. Alone Andrew would not be able to push himself to be the best, for better or for worse he needs someone to push him past the point of sanity and normal behavior to become the best in the world. A similar issue applies to Fletcher he himself is in a sense a failure he is not the best in the world nor has he produced his Charlie Parker, he is waiting for someone like Andrew to come by, he is waiting for someone with the right amount of passion to achieve greatness but with the insecurity to be easily manipulated. This is where the greatness of each actor's performance is shown the way each of the actors creates characters that play so well together both pushing to the limit of sanity to achieve their respective goals, Andrew to be the best, and Fletcher to produce the best. The final thing to look at in the things that go together to create this film would be the cinematography and editing and soundtrack. Whiplash creates a certain intimacy with the characters in times of tension with very close angle shots giving the audience nothing to look at and think about but the emotions of the characters. The filming also focuses heavily on putting the audience on stage with the characters you are not viewing the cation from the point of view of the true audience more a fly on the wall in the classroom or on stage. This gives the audience access to a part of the performance that is not usually seen. The editing and soundtrack also play well together with the camera's cutting and panning with the rhythm of the music. \n\nEvery film however is not without its faults and Whiplash is no exception to this. To begin the injuries attained from practicing so hard by Andrew are hard to believe unless he is practicing with very poor technique, why would one of the better drummers at the top music school in the united states have such poor technique. This film is also not the most gentle to watch it earns every inch of its R rating. It makes no attempt to make either Andrew or Fletcher good or compelling in a positive light, there is an understanding that both are selfish and see themselves as better than everyone else. This can be abrasive to some viewers, typical underdog stories will try to make us like the main character to root for them. However, when watching parts of this film it can almost be described as a car crash, with Andrew slowly losing his humanity and sanity to pushing himself to become the best, one watches with almost morbid curiosity. This aggressiveness with which it approaches the subject makes it almost impossible to relate to the characters this to some will remove most interest from the film as it can feel like your watching someone almost fetishize the process of an artist losing their humidity for their work. Another thing that one must really suspend disbelief for when watching this film is the behavior of Fletcher. It can be hard to believe that the best music school in the country would let their top instructor throw chairs and scream slurs at the drop of a coin. It can be even harder to see the students at said school going through all this with such complacency as to not make any form of complaint. \n\nI give Whiplash 4.7/5",

I first watched this movie when I was a sophomore in high school, 16 at the time. As a high school 16 year old who is approaching adulthood, I had a lot of optimism for the future. I wanted to do so many things and saw myself successful in many ways without knowing what was in front of me. Andrew Neiman was what made me realize the tumultuous and vulture like setting in life. The realism accentuated in the story pushes the themes of extreme pursuit, rejection, and resurrection to heights unimaginable. I'm glad JK Simmons won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as he did everything he needed to do in a role about psychopathic unconventional teacher. Also, Miles Teller is fantastic in the film as he captures the stoic accuracy of someone dedicating all their time to a venture. In the end, Whiplash is a transcendent experience that finishes with a bang in its closing minutes.",

            "content": "Whiplash is such a rare movie, an impressive technical achievement and a triumph when it comes to direction and acting. The movie follows an aspiring jazz drummer called Andrew, who is finally accepted into a prestigious conservatory. He is given a chance to participate in the conservatory's big jazz band by its BD, Terrence Fletcher. What he does not know is that Fletcher is a dream crushing, abusing, relentless, perfectionist person, willing to get Andrew to great lenghts if that means his band's success in competitions and Andrew's psychological and physical destruction. That leads to a love-hate relationship (mostly hate) between the teacher and the student. \nStarting with the technical aspects of the film, it is hard to finish watching this movie without admiring its wonderful editing, that successfully gives a lot of scenes their tension and terrifying nature. Its sound design is also worthy of praise, considering this is a movie about music. Cinematography is also pretty amazing and the simplicity of the makeup and costumes really fits every scene and situation.\nI actually felt really satisfied with the screenplay, as a musician myself. Most movies would have turned such concept/ premise into a joyful, dumb, prodigy-achieves-his-dream musical. But Damien Chazelle showed that the world of music is equally aggressive and relentless as any other working enviroment and that striving for perfection is something you cannot avoid, despite that meaning that the musician should sacrifice his mental and physical health and even put an end to his social life and relationships. My only problem is that, as a musician, I have never come across such authoritarian and evil BDs like Fletcher. It is quite impossible ans wrong, in my opinion, to be such a @sshole to other musicians, when in the end, the joy of playing music is totally gone, and replaced with fear of mistakes and mechanical, scared playing. Not even professional orchestras are that oppressive and terrifying for a musician to work at, let alone a conservatory jazz band. And even if a BD is that much of a perfectionist, that does not mean he should mess with his musicians psychologically and physically, that is a literal felony. That is the only problem I have with the movie, that I don't think an actually conductor would throw a seat at his drummer just because.\nDespite that, I will also give lavish praise to the two leads. Miles Teller is a very talented actor, and it shows in this movie. His movements, his actions, his interactions, are totally how a full time musician dedicated to his craft would act everyday. And J.K. Simmons, oh my god... I firmly believe that J,K, Simmons' performance in this film is in my Top 3 of all time. I love him in this movie. Sometimes I just watch the movie for him alone. He is so terrifying inn every scene, even if he is not meant to. His darkly comedic comments on his musicians' \"uselessness\" never fail to make me laugh, yet quickly shift to terror, simply because of hsi apperance and the fact that he capable of more than we can comprehend. His performance is a very sttrong 10/10 for me.\nOverall, I will say that Whiplash, despite some liberties it took and exaggerated, overblown stereotypes about the band, that cannot really exist in real life, Whiplash, is amust watch for its tense direction, fascinating screenplay and premise about the world of music and its performances that will be remembered for years to come.

He is recruited into the top jazz band by Terence Fletcher, alternately inspired and destroyed by the maniacal teaching techniques of the instructor.

Whiplash follows the trials of Miles Teller (playing Andrew) who didn't get anywhere near enough recognition for his part in this beauty, an aspiring drummer at Shaffer conservatory, desperate to impress the near tyrant like conductor Terence Fletcher (an Oscar winning J.K Simmons). That is pretty much it, but in terms of musical brutality, this will have you wincing at the screen (I've done a lot of wincing at the screen this week it seems) and almost watching through your fingers in your desperation for Andrew to be accepted. The last twenty minutes of the film are as nail biting and astounding as any thriller, turning a piece of music into a scene of torture whilst retaining the beauty of the sound and the visuals in a vortex of utterly brilliant film making. Original, compelling, and wonderfully acted, this is one of the best films of the 10's without any shadow of a doubt. \nWhiplash is curently available on BBC Iplayer.",

Director Damien Chazelle is also a musician, having previously had ambitions to become a jazz drummer before pursuing filmmaking. Indeed, his experiences in his high school band directly influenced various aspects of this film. You can definitely feel that individual passion and experience behind this film.\n\nThe intricacies of music are shown to great effect via the technical aspects of the film. The editing and sound mixing make you feel every single beat of the drum and every note played by the band. The intensity and passion of the musical pieces just oozes from the screen with every shot. I've never seen music so perfectly portrayed on film before.\n\nJK Simmons is phenomenal and terrifying as Terrence Fletcher, the abusive bandleader whose attempts to push his students to the absolute limits of their abilities pushes the line between inspiration and abuse. I love how nuanced his character is. He could easily be presented as a simple bad guy, but we get to see his point of view and gain an understanding of why he does what he does. It makes you think about the costs of obsession and the things you have to lose in the pursuit of perfection.\n\nReally, I think every aspect of this film is perfect and it will remain my number one recommended film for the foreseeable future.

However, there are apparently technical inaccuracies in terms of the music theory/terminology - e.g. asking people to count in BMP makes no sense. That, for me, is a big letdown. Some of the dialogue from the background characters also felt a little unrealistic, but perhaps American university students actually talk about such topics like that. On the other hand, the acting, cinematography, visual effects, editing, and soundtrack are all on point throughout, with the exception of the low budget truck collision CGI. Massive respect for Miles Teller for learning jazz drumming for the role as well. In sum, there are lots of memorable scenes, there's funny dialogue, and the film is unique.

I was fairly satisfied with La La Land and slightly bored by First Man, but Chazelle proved himself a great storyteller capable of coaxing the best performances out of talented actors in this one. The freneticism, anxiety, and general madness all comes through to create a truly affecting experience.\n\nMiles Teller does fine, But J.K. Simmons makes the film, for me. He takes a character that could easily have been a one-dimensional villain with a character arc that we have all seen hundreds of times before, but Simmons plays Fletcher with a brilliant nuance and balance that makes you despise him like Andrew whilst respecting him all the same. Not many characters successfully encapsulate this duality.\n\nThe story offers few surprises. While the musical sequences are impressive, the ending was a bit oversweet from the tone of the whole piece. Perhaps it is Andrew's imagination or perhaps the world arranged itself to lift him up perfectly, but it seemed weak. In this film, though, you have to search for flaws buried in its strengths, of which there are many.",

Miles Teller is also great, and helps to amplify the chemistry between himself and Simmons. Director Damien Chazelle greatly captures the physical and mental toll that Fletcher's psychological \u2018torture' begins to show on Andrew, using a variety of film techniques. The brilliant writing is capable of capturing the true extent of Fletcher's evil humour, brilliance and his scarce humanity. Chazelle also demonstrates an exceptional ability to edit and direct the rapid paced and high tension segments of the film, which is able to effectively engage and relate the viewer to Andrew and Fletcher's dysfunctional and at times crazed relationship, maintaining the pacing and never inducing a disinterest or boredom. Also some great visual shots during the the high impact tension scenes, which help ground the audience during these sequences. Also, (to no surprise) no musical choices are phenomenal, from the funky stuff displayed throughout the performance scenes, to the eery and well placed sounds that help amplify an important or tense sequence. All of these significant pieces come together to form a truly well-realised Thriller that will keep you engaged from the opening credits. It may very well be the epitome of an 'edge of your seat' Thriller, one could even describe it as a masterpiece.\n10/10",

Fletcher is highly regarded for his skill in anything jazz and teaching talents, also a man with a ruthless reputation for his certain teaching methods. Fletcher is known to bring the best ability out of his students but that is achieved by the intimidation and belittling of his students as he strives for perfection each and every note no exceptions, this creates a pretty hostile environment that not many can endure. Andrew sticks with this as he has no musical pedigree and he believes this may be his only chance to truly prove his worth. While the tension is always unbearable Andrew will quite literally stop at nothing to achieve his goal, blood, callused hands, & car crashes be damned.  \n\n\nI was pleasantly surprised the first time i saw this film, an exciting drumming movie!  The on screen connection between Miles Teller & J.K. Simmons is very strong and the movie really sets out to portray a very tense vibe between the two. Very inventive cinematic elements with color and camera work that really gives this film a whole Jazz feel to it. The plot and script leave a little to be desired but the incredibly real drumming talent Miles Teller has makes up for that along with Simmons' very intimidating nature you really focus on those two grippingly.

Fletcher is just written for the Oscar: he is shouting, swearing, hitting and has the best, clever lines in the film. Writer/director Damien Chazelle adapted this from his own short film and it should have only been a short film. This is because Whiplash doesn't have the right elements to be called an accomplished film. It doesn't explore the character's desire for music. A silly and pointless girlfriend line that never develops. Almost nobody in the band talks, they only stare or only comment, \"Don't touch my folder\". Either Damien Chazelle doesn't know how to write a proper dialogue apart from swearing or couldn't be bothered to write something with real meaning. In the last 30 minutes of the film we are presented with a storyline about a previous student of Fletcher's who killed himself. From that point nothing in the film makes sense. Characters' choices and the way they act in the final few scenes is really unbelievable and silly.",

The fact that there were only really two characters to the whole story, everyone else just merely filing in space, did not detract from the mesmerising story of one young man's dream to be the best drummer, and an older man's passion, albeit brought to us in an unconventional, mean, scary and most of the time, just plain horrible way, to bring out the best in his students. The chemistry and connection between these two characters had me from the start, and I found myself holding my breath and even clenching my fists during the final scene, completely enchanted by the talent and emotion. Beautiful, mesmerising, intense, emotional... a big thumbs up from me. Not giving it five stars only because, as much as I loved it, I'm not sure it's a film I would want to watch over and over again, but I definitely would watch it maybe once more.",

We always envision art as a beautiful thing that comes out of bright place, and we think of artists as open, interesting people. Damien Chazelle takes that idea and crushes it with a story that is almost the complete opposite.\n\nWhiplash is all about breaking expectations and creating suspense, as well as generating sympathy for the main character, in an environment where we wouldn't expect unforgiveness. Fletcher is ruthless and he's obsessed with perfection. Most artists agree that \"perfect\" would be nice, but it's ultimately impossible. Damien Chazelle was able to take that idea of such a hyperbole, and he put it on the big screen in a narrative that can't look away from. \n\nThe environment of the film is one of the best aspects of it. The creative choice to have this movie center around the drums speaks volumes not only narratively but cinematically. What better instrument than a literal instrument which so much power and drive and force and VOLUME and impact. It was a brilliant choice and the movie couldn't have better in another environment, especially with the characters that were placed in them.\n\nIt is only fitting that Whiplash pits these two powerhouse characters both obsessed with perfection. A student who wants to be the best being worked by a teacher who wants the best. It's a pseudo-Jekyll-and-Hyde foil that only gets stronger and more dangerous even after the climax of the film. \n\nThe very end of the film may be the best part about it, when we get to see the main character finally stand up to Fletcher on the stage. All the power struggles between the two characters leads up to this exciting back-and-forth that Chazelle executes beautifully. The movie definitely could've ended with the ball in either Andrew or Fletcher's court, but it didn't. The choice for them to be in it together was most likely a difficult choice, but it was a very good one.\n\nWhiplash is an amalgamation of this somewhat exaggerated experience of being an artist, and creates a visually pleasing, cinematically captivating, and ultimately breathtaking experience.",

Neyman works harder when someone proves he is not worthy of something.\n\nRise - Neyman selected in band\nFall- Fletcher almost decapitates him, in the\niconic Rush-Drag scene\nNeyman not main drumer\nRise - Neyman plays well in the show as he\nhas learned Whiplash by heart. he also\nloses the script, I still believe Fletcher\ntook it\nFall - Fletcher brings in another player\nintentionally to rise Neyman\nRise- Neyman masters the act even after hard-\nworking till 2 am and hands all blooded up\nFall- Neyman's accident\nRise - the dedication of still playing with blood all over his body\n\nAt the climax Fletcher intentionally doesn't give Neyman the script to make the ultimate Fall.

This movie has one of my favorite performances with J.K. Simmons he just embodies this role and it so entertaining to watch when he is on screen. I loved the ending to this movie who would have thought a 5 minute montage of drumming would be so entertaining but Damien Chazelle just adds these stylish edits and camera pans it is so mesmerizing to watch, I think that is my favorite montage put to screen it is the ending montage this movie is rivaling Parasite's montage for my favorite but I loved the drum montage. This movie is a character study for Simmons character and Tellers character and it accomplishes it very well. I love the opening scene it really shows who the characters are without fleshing them out. Some may find the ending bad but I liked it, I normally like ending like these and I liked this one, I like thinking about what the character will do after and this has me thinking about it after it's all finished which are the movies I love.\n\nThe acting in this movie is outstanding and the talent put to screen with Simmons and Teller two amazing actors, Teller should have got a nomination. The sound design and sound mixing with all of the instruments is outstanding and it sounds so good. The cinematography is amazing with the color correction and the lighting in the practice room look amazing. The script and dialogue are amazing and it is one of my favorite scripts. Like I said before the editing is mesmerizing and this movie has my favorite edits in any movie. Like I said before the last montages are very good and the whole movie has some of my favorite montages put to screen and they are so darn entertaining and the montages are so good with the sound design, editing and acting it all comes together to bring us a masterpiece of a movie. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

If you think that the point of the film is that Fletcher is a terrible teacher and a crazy psycho, (you're wrong) you still have to wonder if he is a part of why Andrew is as passionate as he is.

            "content": "Occasionally there comes a film that challenges its viewers to delve deeper into the human psyche. Such films are a necessity in today's fast paced society, as they raise philosophical questions and provide valuable insight; items that are integral to our self-development. Whiplash presents several central questions to all who aspire to rise to the top of their passions: How far can an individual push themselves? How much is an individual willing to sacrifice in the pursuit of greatness? The film gives a glimpse into the life of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller); an aspiring drummer attending an elite music conservatory in the heart of New York City, later gaining the attention of the school's renowned and elite jazz band conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Neiman's character is shy, introverted, and seemingly out of place in a school where everyone seems to know each other. This is contrasted by Fletcher's authoritative, demanding, and unrelenting nature. The film dives deep into the relationship between mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, as Fletcher pushes Neiman to the limits both physically and psychologically in an attempt to mold the next great jazz drummer. The character arcs are fantastically done, and the storyline is very well paced. The film wastes no time setting the tone, as the opening scene immediately sets a tense aura, as Fletcher's character does a fine job conveying a sense of dominance and ruthlessness, while Neiman's character conveys insignificance and submission. Three main acts are present in the film, each showing where the protagonist is on his quest to be the greatest jazz drummer of all time. Damien Chazelle portrays this journey brilliantly, using clever lighting in crucial scenes and fast-paced camerawork to convey a sense of urgency and chaos. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons portray their respective characters with vigorous passion, providing life into Neiman and Simmons' relationship. Shots of blood, sweat, and tears remind viewers that greatness comes at a cost, and to persevere requires dedication and courage. Whiplash is an electrifying and captivating piece of satire; a testament to what perseverance and determination can achieve. Terence Fletcher is a personified dramatization of the age-old adage of pushing ourselves beyond what is expected. Whiplash is fundamental viewing for mentors and students alike, as it challenges viewers to relate the messages portrayed in the film to their own pursuits. It is a film that deserves recognition for years to come, as its core message will remain relevant so long as humanity continues to exist.",

            "content": "When one watches two incredibly similar films within the place of a few weeks they simply cannot help comparing the two. In the case of this film it was somewhat disadvantaged in my estimation of it due to the fact that it pales in comparison to the wondrous, entertaining Madame Sousatzka (1988). Nobody could fault any second time director for not having the talent of John Schlesinger but Damien Chazelle is lacking in the ability that Schlesinger had to make us understand the motivations of unlikable characters and bring to life scenes of subtle, uncomfortable conflict. The film is still passable and worth watching but it is hardly deserving of multiple Academy Award nominations and appears like a weaker version of other films within it's genre.\n\nAspiring drummer Andrew Neiman, Miles Teller, studies at the Shaffer Conservatory and falls under the sway of abusive music teacher Terence Fletcher, J. K. Simmons, who pushes him too far. Fletcher has an obsession with his students and singles out Neiman as a target of his rage, hitting him in front of other students and forcing him to practice for hours to the point of injury. This wreaks havoc on Neiman's personal life as he breaks up with his new girlfriend Nicole, Melissa Benoist, to focus on his drumming and neglects his father Jim, Paul Reiser, who raised him on his own after his mother abandoned them. Neiman wins a position as head drummer in the school band but struggles to make it to a performance on time and is treated cruelly by Fletcher after he arrives having been injured in a car accident. He makes dark discoveries about Fletcher after this event and steps back from his ambitions for a time to focus on his mental health before returning to drumming but a chance meeting with Fletcher presents it's challenges.\n\nThe film should grab you with two emotionally complex performances that convince you of the troubled mind of the protagonist and the strange charisma of the abusive teacher. Sadly, both performances are rather one note as Teller is predictably a sop of sorts with a lack of any backbone which makes it hard for us to care about him. He mumbles through every scene and outside of scenes of him being abused he is not engaging with his various relationships failing to hold interest. Simmons is decent as the overbearing teacher with his menacing, fiery eyes and deep voice being put to good use but because we never learn anything about his character's internal life he doesn't get a lot to do. Comparatively Shirley MacLaine gets to show a full range of emotion as Madame Sousatzka as her abusive tendencies and overbearing personality is balanced with scenes of her being genuinely caring and funny which allows us to understand why her student would remain so in her thrall. There is also a better chemistry between the two leads in Madame Sousatzka with the push pull between them featuring an electric conflict in which you understand the perspective of both people in opposition.\n\nWhat the central thesis of the film is I could not tell you. Well, perhaps I could explain my interpretation of the final scene in which the film seems to endorse the idea of abuse from teacher because supposedly it will push a student to become a better drummer. Unfortunately the film does not present this disturbing idea in a way that was compelling because the climactic scene in which we understand that Neiman is suddenly a great drummer and are pushed to attribute this to the teachings of Fletcher. Had a director like Schlesinger worked with this material the build up to this moment would have been stronger and the moment where it finally clicks for Neiman and the audience would have produced a dark thrill. As it stands Chazelle proves himself to be incapable of capturing this same excitement and rush that a more accomplished director with more to say about damaging relationships would have.\n\nIn 2014 this film managed to earn a Best Picture nomination in one of my least favorite lineups of all time as it was an average sophomore effort raised to the level of a masterpiece in the eyes of the public and the critical community.",

Milles teller plays the drums since he was seven years old and. a lot of things are good in this movie but for me the best is soundtrack, I have to accept I`ve never listened jazz but now I always listens while I`m doing homework.

The movie was shot incredibly well, specifically the drummimg scenes. The movie does a great job of depicting emotional abuse and its effects.

It's very different movie than the ones I've seen, I loved this movie,but the problem is that the movie sometimes is a little exaggerated, like when Andrew is crashed by a car and even though this bleeding is going to touch the concert. Look i don\u00b4t have any trouble in which the movie has only two main characters, the problem is that they doesn't have much personality,we know that both like music and well thats it.In conclusion Whiplash it's an outstanding movie but it's not perfect",

At the center of this all are stunning performances from Miles Teller and JK Simmons, so crucial to creating the very unique teacher-student dynamic the film portrays as we see Andrew pushed again and again relentlessly to become the next jazz superstar. This does mean, however, that it draws many similarities to \"Black Swan\", and so this also means that I did find the film somewhat repetitive, though it was just enough to hold my attention. My main problem with this film though is the ending. I felt that the screenplay had a brilliant ending in mind, but I never came to see the ending as Andrew's descent into madness and saw it more as a struggle triumph, which makes for an ending that feels incomplete. I owe this to the film's swift change in tone when Andrew realizes how Fletcher has torn him apart. We feel that he has definitely learnt from the experience, which then makes it somewhat questionable that he didn't see Fletcher's invitation as suspicious in anyway. Ultimately, he falls yet again into the trap, which I just couldn't quite buy considering how much more tonally quiet the 20 minutes prior to the ending had felt. I did come away, however, utterly distrubed by the fact that Fletcher could have had all this planned in the first place, and that he ultimately succeeded on such a brutal plan. Overall, however, even with all the puzzle pieces in place, Whiplash fell a little flat at the end in comparison to its thrilling first hour, which is a shame.",

The film was very intense, I will give it that and had great drum/jazz solos but the main point was absurd. That to be a great you must be brought to zero, which I dont think is true.

            "content": "Damien Chazelle has become a notable rising star in film direction in the past decade; his 2016 musical, La La Land was the subject of the infamous Best Picture mess-up at the 89th Oscars. Despite this, after a Best Director win, Chazelle has been tipped as a great and one of his films that demonstrates this perfectly is his 2014 breakthrough, Whiplash, the story of an ambitious young student under the tutorage of an abusive music instructor. Chazelle has crafted an exhilarating and detailed film, owing less to a La La Land-esque musical but rather to sports movies, like Rocky. Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a young and hugely ambitious drum prot\u00e9g\u00e9 desperate to impress his notorious instructor, Terence Fletcher. J.K Simmons stars as Fletcher and is certainly the star of the film; his muscular physique and sharp tongue create a monster, yet one who remains human enough to remain terrifyingly believable. Slowly, we see the film turn into a game of cat and mouse as Andrew is relentless in his pursuit to impress Fletcher, who argues that tough love is the only way to breed musicians that make history. Whiplash is brutal when it needs to be, Tom Cross' editing adding a sharp execution (often cutting to the central drum kit) to Chazelle's attentive direction. The film is unforgiving in its pace, managing to turn even the most permissive drum solos into gripping dramatic set pieces. Even as the film descends into melodrama, plot-wise (literal car crashes begin to overtake the metaphorical), Whiplash never loses that golden forcefulness and intensity that makes it work so well. For a film about music, Justin Hurwitz provides a fitting score, his striking, bouncy music immersed within the jazz standards. The score feels like the film itself; brassy and pacy, yet somehow relaxed and perfectly measured at the same time.\nWhiplash is a fine film; Chazelle's aptitude for detailed and thoughtful direction is clear and, even when the story trails into the unbelievable, you can't bring your eyes way. Simmons is stellar in his performance, his delicious brutality making him well deserving of his Oscar. Whilst La La Land shows Chazelle paying homage to the bygone movie musical, its predecessor is a very different film; nail-biting and uncompromising, Whiplash is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking",

Also, it was crazy to me that so many of the students that are portrayed are so introverted and submissive to Fletcher's domineering character. I've had college professors try to swing their ego around me but I was raised in an environment where I realized that taking a beating often leads to more beatings. I've gotten into it with numerous teachers who have done this because it is more important to stay true to your morals than to sacrifice your character because it's easier. It's true that say in the military being pushed allows you to handle pressure that you otherwise can't, but it often comes at emotional costs and generally only helps maybe a person or two succeed while most people fail where they could otherwise have succeeded in the civilian world. Fletcher's ideology is severely flawed and Neiman points out this flaw adequately in the cafe, because there are a number of people who can succeed with attention and love that will wither and die under brutality. Participation rewards have been proven to be detrimental, and we face a generational crisis where people don't know how to handle pressure and try to commit suicide at the first real failure they encounter because they never had to deal with failure until adulthood. However, people have their limits and there is only so much any person can take before they crack, so there has to be balance. Neiman has to give up just about all of his personal relationships in order to succeed, and that is based in a post-modern way of treating the human like a machine that's completely outside of the realm of reality. I absolutely loved the ending, because when a control freak is trying to destroy you or punish you, rule number one is never give them what they want. You HAVE to stand up for yourself, and never let abuse just slide on by like it's nothing. If you don't do this you will always be the slave and they will always be the master. Probably my only problem with the movie is the character's drive to leave behind a popularity legacy rather than legacy that builds families, which in turn build nations and create the foundations of the backbone of history. Might deserve a 4 and half, but I have to give it a 5 because of how emotionally involved the film got me. Great movie, fantastic acting, fantastic cinema.",

I found myself really intrigued by the film. I enjoyed the premise of it, as well as the consistent build to Andrew and Fletcher's showdown. At times it made me uncomfortable, such as when Andrew was pulling himself out of the car wreck to get to his competition. As a result, I found myself really emotionally invested in his story and his ability to prevail. Having seen Chazelle's other film La La Land prior to this one, they seem to have a similar hopelessness to each other. I enjoy that each film ends not in the way that you would expect, but in the way that is appropriate for the story. At first, when Fletcher asked Andrew to come play for him, I was shocked at how kind he was and how out of character it felt. I appreciated that he came back at Andrew later with a vengeance in the final performance of the film. JK Simmons performance as Fletcher was truly so incredible and believable. As the character, his presence was so powerful and he possessed so much control of his environment. This was especially evident in the scene where Andrew and the other two drummers in Studio Band had to compete against each other to get the seat. He has this maniacal fervor that just escalates as the scene goes on, and it's so incredible to watch and experience. Overall, through Simmons' performance and the riveting story told, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It's definitely one that I would go back to watch again just to see if I could catch more details in Simmons' riveting performance!",

IT'S EXHILARATING AND BLOOD PUMPING ALL THE WAY THROUGH. \"WHIPLASH\" IS ABOUT A DRUMMER (ANDREW NEYMAN) WHO IS TRYING TO GET INTO THE TOP JAZZ BAND, AND THE TEACHER/CONDUCTOR TERENCE FLETCHER (WHO IS PLAYED BY J.K. SIMMONS) IS VERY ABUSIVE AND DEMONIAC TO HIS STUDENTS. NEYMAN MUST SUFFER THE PAIN AND PUNISHMENT THAT FLETCHER PUTS ON HIM TO BE HIS NUMBER 1 DRUMMER. MILES TELLER AND J.K. SIMMONS FIT THE CHARACTERS PERFECTLY. TELLER BRINGS AN INNOCENT AND PERSEVERING QUALITY ABOUT HIM, WHILE SIMMONS SHOWS A DEVILISH AND QUITE HORRIFIC QUALITY ABOUT HIM.  THIS MOVIE EXPLORES ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IMPACT IT HAS ON NEYMAN AND HIS LIFE. THIS MOVIE REALLY SHOWS WHAT ONE WILL DO TO BE WHAT THEY WANT. THE SCREENPLAY IS FANTASTIC AND AMBIGUOUS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS TO THIS FILM THAT MAKES YOU WANTING MORE EVERY SECOND. THIS IS WHAT MOVIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. IT'S SUPPOSED TO GRAB THE VIEWER'S ATTENTION AND REEL HIM INTO AN EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'LL NEVER FORGET. THE MUSIC IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCORES YET FOR A MOVIE.JUSTIN HURWITZ IS THE COMPOSER FOR THIS MOVIE AND HE DOES A SPECTACULAR JOB BY USING JAZZ TO INCORPORATE INTO THIS FILM. THE MUSIC ALONE PUSHES THE MOVIE TO BECOME WHAT IT IS NOW AND GIVES A WHOLE NEW CHARACTER TO IT, BECAUSE WITHOUT MUSIC, WHAT WOULD FILM EVEN BE? OVERALL, \"WHIPLASH\" BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW AND THRILLING TO THE AUDIENCES BECAUSE OF ITS INTOXICATING MANNER AND SHOWS US THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN A MOVIE. I AM GOING TO RATE THIS FILM A 92%.",

And about that instructor. Imagine if J.Jonah Jameson from the original Spiderman trilogy shaved his head, decided to become a music instructor and become really vulgar. That's a 100% accurate representation of Terrence Fletcher. J.K Simmons does a terrific performance of a man who's trying to find the next great and he's going to everything it takes to find it. The soundtrack is by far one of the best soundtracks of all time. I've still got the song Whiplash stuck in my head.

More than anything, this movie is about life: The pace of life, the idea that people don't wait in life, the idea that the world around us is filled with many difficult things that are hard to get through, and throws us around like we are in a boxing match.

Simmons. As mentioned in part above, Teller and Simmons do excellent jobs with what they're given and the duo's seamless integration into their roles and sheer sense of personality and layered performances are easily what makes the film as good as it is. Teller's total investment into his character's dreams and goals bounces off well against the ferocious performance J.K. Simmons offers as his raw mentor, Terrence Fletcher. Simmons, in particular runs away with the film, delivering an out of bounds, monstrous performance that has you hanging on carefully to every word he says. Whiplash also serves as a neat subversion of the typical musical tropes, in part because while it does tell a heartwarming tale of fulfilling dreams and offers an insightful look into the future of the youth in society, which is also a good thing, its also not content on the traditionally polite and free lance direction the genre is typically know for, adding in a raw and powerful sense of intensity most would accommodate with a drama film. The film moves at a quick pace and its filled with enough entertaining moments to keep it up. Damien Chazelle's willingness to embrace the characters and the subject matter however is what catapults the film to the next level. By digging deep into the personal wounds of his leads and offering a more intense depiction of the musical genre, he also offers an arguably more realistic approach as well. However the film doesn't let its uncompromising approach to ruin its overall sense of heart, as he allows time for the passions of his characters to develop naturally in the film. Whiplash moves to the tune of its own rhythms which is all aided by the seamless editing and sound mixing by Tom Cross. The film's many musical segments are entertaining and hard not to follow and the decision to alternate between Neiman's ace drummer skills and the orchestra is what makes that unforgettable finale so memorable and inspired. -",

            "content": "An ambitious, young drum player Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) attends a prestigious music school where he plays for Terrence Fletcher's (J.K. Simmons) jazz band. Fletcher is known to be an extremely tough and stressing conductor with incredible talent. While performing for Fletcher, Andrew finds himself prioritizing drumming over sleeping and relationships with his family and girlfriend. He practices for rigorous, extensive hours a day often until his hands bleed and are unable to continue. The film has won multiple academy awards, but is often noted to lack believability. \n\tFletcher is extremely hard on his students for things a conductor should reasonably be upset at such as being off tempo or not memorizing sheet music. The film; however, exaggerates this anger where fletcher throws a chair over Andrews head, physically slaps his to better his tempo, and emotionally abuses him by bringing up his family issues in front of the whole class. Although certain scenes of the film are over exaggerated and unrealistic, the general message is still valid: passion is poison. \n\tThis intense theme is portrayed vividly with explicit scenes throughout the film. Andrew is seen practicing an intense piece when his hand starts to bleed. Instead of stopping to rest, he soaks his fist in ice water, bandaged the wound, and continues to play. He repeats this until his practice is over. Another scene shows Andrew running late to one of Fletcher's performance. Andrew gets into a brutal accident where his car flips over and his face splits open. Instead of rushing to the emergency room, he rushes make the performance on time. These scenes portray passion on the highest level. With the music industry being an extremely competitive field passion separates the talented from the determined, and Andrew was determined to keep his spot in the jazz band. \n\tThe movie could be shortly described as intense. This is supported through the film's soundtrack as well as the title named after one of the songs \"Whiplash.\" Whiplash is and injury caused by a severe jerk in the head. As a drummer, Andrew is constantly swaying his head with the tempo of a song, and the song Whiplash is played at an extremely high pace. The song perfectly correlates with the movies intensity and theme on passion.\n\tWhiplash is a perfectly crafted film portraying an extravagant message on passion in the music industry. Although some scenes may be seen as unrealistic, the intensity of them is further supported through the soundtrack, title, and theme. The exaggeration is there with the purpose of creating a thrilling, seat- edging film, and it does exactly that. All of these different aspects come together to form a creative and unique take on a real life based plot.",

            "content": "Independent films have grown increasingly popular as of late. 2014 was filled with these types of movies that seemingly came out of nowhere, and \"Whiplash\" was one of the frontrunners.\n\nMiles Teller plays Andrew Neiman, an aspiring jazz drummer attending Shaffer Conservatory in New York City. Terence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons, is a well-respected instructor at the university who takes notice of Neiman and recruits him for his studio band. Neiman's excitement to join the band is short-lived, however, as Fletcher's brutal methods of teaching prove immensely taxing, physically and emotionally.\n\nThroughout the film, it is difficult to tell if Fletcher is a protagonist or antagonist. Do his methods truly better his students or is he just trying to find his own Buddy Rich? Where does an instructor draw the line? Is being one of the greats worth losing one's humanity?\n\nNeiman desires to be great, and this is shown in his decision-making throughout the film. His passion allows him to endure Fletcher's physical and emotional abuse, and the battle of wits that ensues between the two actors is where the movie shines.\n\nDamien Chazelle's writing and direction fuels the intensity of the performances. Chazelle himself struggled to make it as a jazz drummer in high school, and he even had an intense music instructor who inspired the character of Terence Fletcher. His musical experience is evident in the script, and the quality of the jazz music is no doubt a testament to Chazelle's guiding hand in the production.\n\nThe music itself is captivating, and Fletcher's ferocious conducting is not only the product of good acting. Simmons graduated with a music degree from the University of Montana, where he minored in composition and conducting.\n\nTeller also possessed some experience in rock drumming tracing back to his teen years. Rock drumming and jazz drumming are two different monsters, however, and for two months Teller trained three to four hours each day under professional drummer Nate Lang in preparation for his role. Because of his hard work, Teller was able to actually play, in portions, the difficult pieces Neiman performs in the film. However, the fluidity and intensity of Neiman's drumming is more of a testament to Tom Cross' editing.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of this film will have viewers' eyes locked onto the drama; it is one of the most emotionally gripping finales I have ever seen.\n\n\"Whiplash\" is an impressive feat by 30-year-old Damien Chazelle, winning three Oscars including the well-deserved Best Supporting Actor recognition awarded to J.K. Simmons. It is a fast-paced, full-throttled drama that will have viewers on the edge of their seat until the last drum stroke.",

But the story is about much more. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a freshman music student who wants nothing more than to be one of the greatest jazz drummers of all time. He is practicing in the halls of Shaffer Conservatory when the imposing music director Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) walks in. He is the conductor of the school s award-winning jazz ensemble. Fletcher auditions Neiman and allows him in as an alternate drummer. Fletcher drives all his students with both physical and emotional abuse. It isn t long before Fletcher starts abusing Neiman by throwing chairs and slapping him.\n\nSCOTT: Neiman is obsessed with being the best drummer of all-time. He practices until his fingers bleed onto his drumset. He breaks up with his girlfriend so that he can spend every waking moment fulfilling his dream. Fletcher creates a ruthlessly competitive atmosphere to bring out the best in his players, and Neiman knows he cannot miss a beat if he wants to keep his job on the band. One day when Neiman gets into a bad car accident on the way to a competition, he chooses to arrive at the competition battered and bloody rather than lose his spot. He attacks Fletcher after Fletcher dismisses him, and is expelled from Shaffer. But the two men later cross musical paths one last time.\n\nGREG: Whiplash is a battle of wills between a young man who wants to be the best jazz drummer no matter what the cost to him personally, and a man who wants to train the best jazz musician no matter the cost to those he teaches. And this is the difference between a hero and a villain. According to Joseph Campbell (mythologist and author of The Hero With A Thousand Faces) a hero is someone who will do anything he can to get what he wants at his own expense whereas a villain is someone who will do anything he can to get what he wants at someone else s expense. This sets up our young Neiman as the hero and Fletcher as his villain. The movie doesn t waste any time getting to the heart of this. And in some ways I thought it rushed certain plot points. There is a wonderful scene with Neiman and his father (Paul Reiser) at dinner with his uncle and community-college cousins. They re having a battle of opinions over whether it would be better to live a long happy life or a short and spectacular one. Neiman points out that Charlie Parker was the best jazz musician of all time. The uncle throws in that he lived to be only 35 years old. But Neiman is unrelenting, firing back that while it may be true that Parker lived a short life, he impacted everyone as they are still talking about him around the dining room table.\n\nSCOTT: Whiplash surprised me. It s a low-budget movie without a huge star in it, and yet it is very effective in capturing the most important steps   and missteps   in life. Whiplash pits two men against each other. One is an underdog, an up-and-coming college kid who will do anything to become the best at his craft. The other is an older, established teacher who will do anything to remain at the top of his profession. You would think that the teacher is the helpful mentor figure here, but you would be (mostly) wrong. These are two characters destined to collide. The kid s triumph over his evil mentor is the crux of the hero story, and it is both fun and disturbing to watch. Although I enjoyed this movie, I m left somewhat confused by its message. Maybe ambiguity about ambition is the point of the movie. On the one hand, Fletcher s teaching methods inflict emotional damage on his students. On the other hand, we learn that his methods ultimately turn Niemen into the best jazz drummer Fletcher s ever seen. I m reminded of Tiger Woods, whose father Earl ruthlessly drilled greatness into Tiger but at great personal cost. Is the movie telling us that this is the only roadmap to greatness? I hope not.\n\nGREG: I think you ve misplaced the role of Fletcher. He is a mentor - but a dark mentor, villainous in his approach. He recognizes talent in the young Neiman and while Neiman is trying to impress his mentor, the mentor refuses to acknowledge any talent the young man may have. Fletcher believes that only by challenging the student will the greatness arise. In the end, Neiman is humiliated by Fletcher and Neiman is ready to quit. But at the last minute he turns around and takes control - not just rising to the challenge Fletcher has laid down - but overpowering him with his intense drumming. Finally, the master has found the student he has been seeking and the student has found the teacher he deserves. I think this movie is telling us that one can achieve greatness only at huge personal expense. And it is left to each of us to decide if the price of greatness is worth it. As Neiman points out in his dinner-time argument, if greatness were easy, everyone would do it. It s pretty clear that the moral of the story is that if you want to be great, you have to give it 100% of everything you have. Nobody achieves greatness giving their best 90%.\n\nSCOTT: J. K. Simmons does an absolutely wonderful job portraying the villainous Fletcher. His performance may even be Oscar-worthy. I think you re right, Greg, that Fletcher is an anti-mentor. Just as we have anti-heroes (e.g., Nightcrawler), we also have anti-mentors who send heroes down dark paths that can lead to ruin. It s then up to the hero to overcome the dark mentor. In Whiplash, Neiman s dad plays the good mentor role whose unconditional love is there to counteract Fletcher s bad mentoring influence. I don t think we ve seen dueling mentors at all in the movies this year, and Whiplash shows this battle in full force.\n\nGREG: I think this is also dueling father figures, Scott. At the end of the film, Neiman is humiliated and goes running to his father for solace. At the moment he is about to surrender and fall into his father s arms (going back to the safe and comfortable) he turns instead and fights back against the conflict-ridden father image that Fletcher offers. You re right, Simmons  performance is spot-on. It is forceful without being over the top. This also reminds me of the coming-of-age stories of a teen who has to beat his father at sports to emerge as an independent adult. Also, this is reminiscent of the samurai movies where the student must endure torture from the master in order to discover the hidden kung-fu master within. Paul Moxnes has a family-oriented hero structure that includes the good mentor and the evil mentor or wizard. Fletcher is offering Neiman the road to greatness, but it is a dark path.\n\nSCOTT: Whiplash is a fascinating coming-of-age tale with a dark edge to it. This movie had my full attention for nearly two hours and I give it credit for emotionally moving me and offering surprises at the end. The performances are rock solid and there are also some damn good musical performances throughout. I m more than happy to award this film 4 Reels out of 5. The hero journey follows the classic pattern and throws in a few welcome surprises. Neiman is cast into a dark, dangerous world and doesn t realize how much he s in over his head. Fletcher s mentoring seems destined to hurl Neiman toward destruction, but with love and encouragement from his good mentor, our hero musters up the strength and courage to outwit his evil foe. There is a love interest, a father figure, dueling mentors, and more. I see no missteps here at all, only outstanding performances from the entire cast. I m giving our hero 5 Heroes out of 5. As we ve noted, the villain character is an anti-mentor whose cruel, self-aggrandizing methods come at the expense of our hero. I m thrilled that Whiplash shows us a rarely-seen brand of villainy. This film teaches us to be wary of how we choose our mentors; not all of them look out for our best interests. Fletcher is a lying, cold-blooded, abuser who doesn t quite get his full comeuppance at the end but is nevertheless defeated. I m giving him 5 Villains out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: Whiplash had very little that left me wanting. I thought the love interest was sort of thrown in with little development, so I didn t really feel a sense of loss when Neiman dumps his girlfriend. Also, the father/son/uncle/cousins story was not fully developed - but it was enough to show a contrast between the thinking of someone who wants to be excellent versus the rest of us, content to do  just fine.  But these had to be given less time so that the contest between dark mentor and rising star could be investigated to its fullest extent. I give Whiplash 4 out of 5 Reels. I agree with you, Scott, that Neiman represents the classic hero coming of age story. In the classic tradition of  when the student is ready, the master will appear,  Fletcher and Neiman come together at a time when each is seeking the other. And Neiman makes the transformation from neophyte to master in 120 minutes. I give Neiman 5 Heroes out of 5. And what a wonderful gem of a villain/mentor we have in Fletcher. He is driven not to be the best, but to find someone he can mold into the best. We get a sense that he is living vicariously through his students, perhaps having given up on his own greatness hoping to live it out through others. This is not a simply evil character, but a textured and even tortured soul. I give Fletcher 5 out of 5 Villains. Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

It's not a simple story of about drumming and some bloke with a pig fetish. It's a deep, heartfelt story about obsession and commitment, and what that can do to a man. Miles Teller delivers a career defining performances as Andrew but is greatly overshadowed by JK Simmons. Simmons take this movie from good to great and elevates it to amazing. Considering this is Chazelle's debut feature; it's a god damn amazing first attempt. If you've not seen this literal masterpiece; please, do yourself a favour and see it.\n\nThis story is not just a simple story about music. I hate it when people say that. This is a dark story about how obsession can drastically affect your life. Chazelle has masterfully wrote this harrowing tale and if is his opener; I cannot wait to see his final piece. Combine Chazelle's awesome plot and screenplay with a fantastic climax and a brave, bold ending, and you have a freaking awesome drama that I see debuting a very promising career.\n\nTo say that Captain Pig Fetish was anything less than awesome, spectacular and amazing in this movie would be an insult to his wonderful performance. He made this movie his personal pig and took it to town. Without him, I dare say this movie wouldn't be as good as it is and he definitely elevates this movie above everything else. Accompanying Simmons is the amazing Miles Teller, who plays his role of Andrew expertly and is the perfect protagonist for this movie. His more barren, emotionless nature really fits in with the themes of this movie and helps sell them to a tee. The 'chemistry' between Simmons and Teller is one of the best things in history. I adore them in this movie.\n\nThis movie is also technically flawless. The cinematography is awesome throughout, especially the climax where the camera moves in line with the music. I think it's an excellent looking movie and definitely proves that Damian Chazelle has promise. Another note is how dark and bleak the colour pallet is for the costumes and sets. This might seem like a bad thing but I personally think it works perfectly in line with the themes in the movie.\n\nI cannot find a major flaw with this movie. Granted, there isn't really such thing as a flawless movie but I cannot find a major flaw that takes you out of the viewing experience. The music is excellent. I mean the acting is spectacular. Perfectly written, spectacularly directed and honestly one of the best dramas made in the past decade. Please watch this movie if you haven't, it's an amazing movie and you will definitely not be disappointed. I'd rate it a 10/10 purely for the pig line alone.",

It gives you a false sense of security as the film begins with a young finely talented student Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) plays the drums as he dreams to be the finest drum artist appreciated by others, of his new generations. Then, he comes across with a rather different type of a music instructor who will cause anything to realize a student's potential of music. As these two characters, conflict on each other, most of the film progresses, these events with very intense sequences that made my hands gripping with sweat.\n\n Whiplash can be diversified into a category of a dramatic film relating to the main topic of jazz music and a thriller film that never lets the audience take a deep breath of comfort throughout. The film illustrates perfectly of what every student might have feared the worst teacher who considers as enemies towards his/her's student, who will literally commit anything to find his or her's potential. An instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons) is the exact type of professor that always challenges the student and drop them to hole of death which they can never climb to breath fresh air. While, the instructor being very relentless and brutally eager, he has a side of appreciation as he peels off layers of the student's potential. J.K. Simons portrayal and performance of this fearful relentless instructor is one to appreciate and gives a courageous and terrifying performance in which we as an audience, starts to be violated like as Andrew Neyman. On the other hand, a hard working, inspiring student acted by Miles Teller, who has a true dream by heart is the one who meets Terence Fletcher as an instructor, and gets horribly treated, called with varieties of swear words and psychologically tormented, is so heartbreaking and unbelievably touched. He gives a woody and thoughtful performance as he the protagonist gets forced to fall down to hell and rise up facing a somewhat battle against Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons). It is so riveting of a process of how these personally opposite people clash with each other.\n\nThis film is intense, inspiring and hand gripping from start to finish making it a brilliant praiseworthy filmmaker Damien Chazelle, one to look forward to and be inspired. Also, a riveting vehicle for stars J.K. Simons and Miles Teller, one's worthed to be complemented. This film has no sharp or outstanding flaws, making this one of the finest pieces of work of that time of period. This is definitely one of the best films of 2014. I knew nothing but a confessed drum artist, but glad that this film exists to illustrate these stories in an unconventional method. In other words, it's an 100 minute thrill ride that keeps thrilling the audience.",

If you are scared to see this movie because you love JK Simmons, as long as you love music or top notch movies, you should enjoy it. Since it's Damien Chazelle, it's all about the music. The last 10-15 minutes of the movie are taken up by one tune, called caravan. It's a lot to handle at times, especially in the scenes where Andrew's hands bleed from playing so much or the car crash scene. However, it is worth it. Unless you don't like movies about working hard to achieve your goal with bumps in the road. Then watch grandma's boy or something, but don't be saying this masterpiece is bad.",

The screenplay, written by director Damien Chazelle, arrests the viewer early on by establishing an incendiary relationship between the driven young drummer and his instructor, who subjects Neiman and other band members to physical and verbal abuse in an attempt to extract brilliance from them. Chazelle extracts that same brilliance from his cast and crew, capturing the competitive intensity and dread inherent in trying to succeed under the tutelage of a genius-turned-monster. The soundtrack from composer Justin Hurwitz is an exciting, frantic, and well-performed jazz that reflects both the chaos and dedication to craft that Fletcher employs with his band. Neiman's disturbing experience lasts right up to the final scene in which the viewer is treated to a deeply satisfying, well-earned emotional payoff, as well as the best musical performance of picture.

Yes at his mere age, Damien Chazelle managed to deliver something as raw, intense and brutal as I've ever seen put onto film. Seriously every frame and scene feels like it's about to burst with tension, and that's thanks to a whole cumilation of things for sure, but mainly Chazelle's direction. For one, the choices he makes with the sound (and visual) design are incredibly careful and considered and leave a lot of room for silence, whilst the performances he gets out of these incredible actors build tangiable characters who's relentless pain consequently feels real and personal when it could have easily felt forced. Maybe there's a more intimate relationship I form with the whole thing because I'm a musician, but I was on the edge of my seat and hugely involved from start to finish, feeling every cut and tear and hair stand up whenever Andrew was put under pressure (which need I say was a heck of a number of times).\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: There's not a lot of breathing room for all that tension - but that's just as much a criticism as it is a compliment. The flaws thereafter really only lie with its singular message, but it is arguably admirable that the film has such a determined vision considering it's a debuting attempt from Chazelle.\nVERDICT: Most talent grows from a seed, but Damien Chazelle is allready a tree... the only place now is the sky.",

It is so hard to say a movie is perfect, but Whiplash... is.\n\nThe character development is so sublime, the build up of Andrew through the use of a random relationship sub-plot is so irrelevant to his life, they get together and they break-up that's what we are being shown and that's what Andrew's sees. The conversation at the dinner table, in a society and a family where talking against American Football is taboo, however the drive and frustration Andrew feels makes him absolutely adamant that Jazz is no different. The film shows such amazing and unique ways to portray somebodies devotion to something, their undying passion, when critics say its better to show than tell, they mean to use words but without saying \"I am passionate about ______\" and blood in ice cold water is a pretty good way about it, and pretty damn cinematic too.\nTerence Fletcher is just perfect, imagine everything you want in a character defined as strict teacher, double it, then triple it, that is what you get and its amazing.\n\nIf you ever thought a film of 1 hour and 45 minutes could not possibly inspire you, then watch Whiplash.\n\n10/10 - Subjectively perfect, objectively inspiring.",

The final scene with the interminable, bloody, sweaty, boooring solo is particularly narcissistic. The author is extremely busy studying himself as he studies, resulting in an excessively self-aware, locked-in study of extreme obsession that is neither original (\"the Red Shoes\" come to mind) nor ultimately inspiring.

I really liked the point one of the characters made when they said \"Good Job!\" is probably the worst thing anyone could ever say to someone, bashing on the celebration of mediocrity.  Obtaining mastery in anything requires blood, sweat, and tears, and too often we're happy with settling for something less.  We need people to push us to become more than we think we can be, but to what degree is it healthy and productive?

            "content": "One of the best aspects of movies is that they can make any subject, no matter how mundane it may seem on the surface, into a compelling watch.  \"The King's Speech\" somehow managed to make the story of a man with a stutter as riveting as any underdog sports movie.  And \"Whiplash\" makes the tale of a music student in a jazz band with the instructor from Hell into an absolutely exhilarating experience.  By the time the film ends, the audience feels almost as wrung out as its lead actor undoubtedly felt after some of the takes.  Well, almost...\n\nMiles Teller plays the student, a young drummer at a prestigious New York music school who finds himself in a jazz band conducted by, to paraphrase Red from \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" the hardest screw to ever walk the halls of the academy.  J.K. Simmons plays said screw, and though he'd been a highly talented character actor well before \"Whiplash,\" I can guarantee you've never seen him quite like this.  Let's just say that Best Supporting Actor Oscar from a couple years ago was well earned.\n\nThis guy conducts the band like a drill sergeant, barking obscenities at any unfortunate sod who happens to hit a wrong note.  Actually, he makes R. Lee Ermey in \"Full Metal Jacket\" seem downright cuddly by comparison.  There is no insult he won't spit, no piece of furniture he won't hurl.  Nothing is sacred or off-limits, not even a wayward mother who abandoned her infant child.\n\nAt the film's onset, he takes an interest in Teller because of his nimble drumming skills, and from then on he seemingly begins to wage a war on the kid, almost as if he's determined to break him.  But is that REALLY his goal, or is this whole campaign really just an attempt to push him beyond his limits, to help him achieve greatness?\n\nWell, I'll leave that for the audience to decide.  We know what the teacher himself believes, but I don't necessarily think that makes it true.  It's a topic that deserves discussion, and I don't think it's an easy closer.  It was on this very point that I very nearly took points off the film; some of the teacher's actions are so downright abhorrent that I find it hard to rationalize, no matter what the end result.  Fine line between hard motivation and abuse.  \n\nBut then I began to think that \"Whiplash\" WANTS us to feel conflicted like this.  It's the film's intent to dig into these emotions.  While it would seem that the film is making an argument for one stance, the brief subplot of the former student surely implies that the \"extremely, EXTREMELY tough love\" approach is not as sound as people may believe.\n\nAnd to the film's--and Simmons'--credit, there are a few moments that humanize the character.  He's not a one-note monster, and although it's a role that teeters dangerously close to the realm of cliche, Simmons never crosses that line.  A lesser actor may have turned this guy into a caricature, but Simmons finds just the right note.  He displays an almost Daniel Day-Lewis type of screen presence; you can't take your eyes off him.\n\nTeller is very good as well.  Here's a young actor who seems to be struggling a bit with his film choices as of late, but if nothing else, he'll always have this one and a role he absolutely owned.  He's fantastic at every turn, whether it's during his early, likable stages, or his later, more petulant persona.  Some of Simmons' callousness appears to rub off on him, and he becomes a bit of a self-righteous little prick.  (Though to be fair, during the family dinner scene, it's hard not to blame him for lashing out.)   Additionally, I have no idea whether Teller truly did all the drumming himself, but he's certainly convincing.\n\n\"Whiplash\" is a true gut-punch of a film, the kind that's not always likable, but one in which you're always FEELING something.  I can't really say I \"enjoyed\" it per se, but I don't think you're really supposed to, and in that regard, it is supremely effective at what it set out to do.  Masterful work here from writer-director Damien Chazelle.\n\nAnd another thing...it ends on an absolutely pitch-perfect note.",

            "content": "When I started Grade 11, all my friends told me to avoid getting into Mr. Johnson's math class. He was a hard teacher, they all said. Well, as luck would have it, I got his class. As soon as the first lesson ended, I marched over to the vice principal's office and asked to be moved into another class. I remember the vice principal being polite but not overly sympathetic. He told me it would take a few weeks to move me out. The next day I went back to Mr. Johnson's class thinking that I would be okay. I could tough it out for a few days. But something happened that surprised me. I started listening to the man and I realised that he wasn't hard at all. He just expected his students to learn. Three weeks later I received word from the vice principal that my request came through. I went back to the VP's office and told him that Mr. Johnson was the best math teacher I ever had. There was no way I would leave his class.\n\nWHIPLASH has been called a cross between THE PAPER CHASE and THE KARATE KID with a huge dose of FULL METAL JACKET thrown in for good measure, and the film certainly starts out that way. Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller, THE SPECTACULAR NOW) is a first-year student at the prestigious (and fictional) Schaffer Conservatory of Music in Manhattan. He is a jazz drummer with ambitions to be the next Buddy Rich. Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) leads the school's premiere jazz studio band and all the jazz music students have dreams of studying under Fletcher's tutelage. Very few earn the opportunity though, and getting through Fletcher's door is no guarantee that you will stay for very long. He pushes his students harder than they ever thought possible and along the way he sometimes achieves greatness from them. Unfortunately for the students, that greatness can come at a huge personal cost.\n\nNow here is where WHIPLASH differs from THE PAPER CHASE (and where Fletcher differs from my math teacher). While Professor Kingsfield (played by the wonderful John Houseman) pushed his law students with erudite and pithy comments, Fletcher is a misogynistic, homophobic, sadistic and amoral bully. Like Kingsfield, he starts off as someone you love to hate but then he becomes someone you just hate. That makes the film challenging to watch. There's an old saying that those who can't do, teach and that seems to be evident here, both in Fletcher and in Neyman's father (played by Paul Reiser), who is a failed author-turned-high school English teacher. Although Fletcher rejects failure as an option both in himself and in his students, he seems to have lost the plot. In a pivotal scene, we come to realise that he is less concerned with training his students to become respectable musicians than he is with cementing his own place in history as the teacher of jazz legends.\n\nTry as he may, Fletcher meets his match with Neyman, who refuses succumb to Fletcher's mind games. However, in his efforts to meet his teacher's impossible standard, Neyman loses part of himself. The film's closing scene at Carnegie Hall is both a psychological battle between the teacher and student, and a physical battle within themselves to go to places they may never have been to before. But there is no real happy ending to WHIPLASH. Neyman and Fletcher are both winners and losers. The film ends at the right moment and it gives the audience plenty to think and talk about as the lights come up. What will tomorrow be like for Neyman and Fletcher? Being at the top of one's profession can be exciting, but it can also be short-lived and lonely. Greatness has a price.\n\nWHIPLASH is the brain-child of 29-year-old director and screenwriter, Damien Chazelle, who is fairly new to the movie business with only one other feature film under his belt. (While the film draws on his own experiences as a high school drummer, Chazelle is a Harvard graduate with a degree in environmental studies.) Like many indie projects, WHIPLASH started off as a short film. Chazelle submitted it to Sundance last year where it won the festival's Short Film Jury Prize. With that laurel, he was able to secure funding to make a feature length film starring Simmons, who also played Fletcher in the short. Teller, who has been playing drums for more than 10 years, apparently practiced for 12 hours a week for a year to prepare for his part. Most of the drumming you see on screen is Teller's, as is most of the blood.\n\nNot surprisingly, the feature film has also picked up a couple of awards - the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival - and is already being touted for Oscar nominations for both Teller and Simmons. Both their performances are stellar and their wins would be well deserved.",

In a world where movies are audience screen-tested, tweaked, and then constantly shifted further and further away from the director's original ending to appease idiot masses, this gem of a movie is not afraid to leave you thinking and guessing (and if you really, really don't like being given the ability to fill in a few holes on your own, you can find the closest thing to an alternative ending via the director's interviews on the interwebz)",

His talent was spotted by Fletcher one day and he took him under his wings and startet taunting him cruelly in exchange for a spot on his jazz band.

Miles Teller did a fine job as the lead, but overall his character, Andrew Neyman, takes a back seat to the real star, Fletcher.

I'm a bit sick of the genre to be honest- after the brilliant 'Shine', every other one has just disappointed me really. Whiplash fixed that though. Oh, boy, did it fix it. \n\nThis one has a dark edge, much darker than what you usually find in films about musicianship. I'd say that it doesn't even offer the message that it's worth it in the end, and that's pretty brave. Whiplash doesn't really care- it has a goal and it goes for it, just like, well, everyone in the film itself really.\n\nSimmons steals the show with a truly malice-filled performance; his character is bravely unlikable and we don't see enough of that today, other than from cartoonish villains who are just there to get beat by our hero. \n\nIt's still a film about drumming, and whilst the drama is certainly there too, there's still a lot of drumming. I like jazz and I am  a ( very, very, poor) drummer myself so I enjoyed all of this but if you aren't in to drum solos- some of 'Whiplash' is likely to bore or frustrate you. \n\nIt has the characters, the drama, and the authenticity but it also hits the standard movie notes- it has its build ups and its turns and it covers a surprisingly large amount of ground without ever becoming overlong. \n\nWhiplash is entertaining in a conventional way but it's also truly exhilarating. It captures both physical and emotional intensity in a way that I haven't really seen since, yeah, 'Shine'. It takes on a lot, and manages to deliver.",

            "content": "First of all this is the must see movie in cinema at the moment. The movie is Black Swan on cymbals, it's a diverse work of genius in human thinking, the kind of emotional highjacker that all writers hope to achieve. We get so wrapped up in Andrew Neyman's desire to achieve greatness that we have no idea what's going to happen next. Tragedy, suicide, murder, love, death, and triumph are all possible in the pulse of the script.\n\nThe lead character, Andrew Neyman, is a shy introverted kid with a single minded desire for greatness, a desire that the ruthless and perhaps sadistic Terence Fletcher sniffs out and dangles before him, permitting Fletcher to influence a psychological hold over the young musician.  \n\nInterestingly after Neyman bumps his head at the start of the movie, things get a bit hazy and this film could easily be 'inception' or just Neyman's brutal reality, as he ends up in a nightmare realm full of his own fears and exerts little control over his rage, confronting his family, his peers and his mentors. At times the formerly introverted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has exuberant confidence to overcome the emotional hurdles in his life, at other times he is inflicted with the worst case scenario setbacks one could only find in dream like fantasy. The running theme of dripping blood is comatosing, it reminds us that this kid is on the edge and the bloodletting continues to build up anticipation of an intense eruption which could swing one way or the other.\n\nSecondly I was a bit disappointed to read detractors like The New Yorker's Richard Brody who complained that the protagonist was a tunnel visioned individual with no passion for creativity, and the film failed to capture the essence of jazz. Quite simply I don't understand why critics pick holes like this in movies, such critics are basically reality tv junkies who've forgotten that movies are only two hours long, we don't expect to go to the cinema to come out four days later having a well rounded view of the lead character's entire life. This film is a tension boiler with psychological impact, if you want to go watch jazz there are plenty of musicians worth supporting and talking about, why spout a highbrow opinion on music about the one movie with a jazz element to actually come out of cinema.\n\nFinally Whiplash deserves credit for the emotional roller coaster it provides, winner of both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, the movie delivers every beat without rushing or dragging in a brilliantly rhythmic cinematic masterpiece. \nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

Oh, let me count the ways...\n \n******SPOILERS******\n \n1 - The Charlie Parker \"cymbal\" story was quite a bit conflated.\n \n2 - If you're drumming \"so hard\" that you bleed massively *and* often, you're doing it wrong.\n \n3 - Buddy Rich as the sole inspiration? All the musicians and music enthusiasts I know love so much music, not just one thing / one artist. Even limited to jazz drumming, why not *also* Max Roach, Art Blakey, jo Jones (of Charlie Parker \"cymbal\" tossing fame), or a cadre of other great drummers past and present?\n \n4 - Drumming fast and hard shown in the movie as some sort of pinnacle is a highly odd choice for a movie about jazz. In reality, the great drummers make it look effortless.\n \n5 - You can probably only punch through a snare head if you've got razor knuckles or the snare is a toy snare made of vellum or something.\n \n6 - What is the motive for Fletcher (teacher) to aim to sabotage his own performance simply to teach the kid drummer a lesson?\n \n7 - Similarly, what is the motive for putting other players in the band at risk as well? And the motive for having a trio of drummers \"hard play off\" for 3+ hours while the rest of the band hung out in the lobby?\n \n8 - How on earth could someone in a t-bone car crash with a truck get out and run to your performance and still play even remotely in time?\n \n9 - How on earth would a competition let you walk in all bloody like you're a zombie (or walked away from a t-bone crash with a truck) and then still play?\n \n10 - Do drummers even have page turners?\n \n11 - As an experienced core drummer, why would you let your very new underling mess with your kit? Moreso, why would you specifically tell him to tune it for you?\n \n12 - A drummer who didn't make the cut because he couldn't remember a tune beats by heart? Um... even if he practiced it for hours and hours with the band?\n \n13 - A \"conductor\" yelling \"not my tempo!!\" continually and slapping a student (also continually) meant he should've been fired far earlier.\n \n14 - Rental car randomly closed at 5pm, but you get them to re-open for you, but you leave your sticks in the lobby and then when you go back 10 minutes later, presumably 20 minutes after they close, you just simply walk in and grab your sticks where you left them.\n  \nNot implausible, but odd choices for the sake of telling a story that could have been better told with more accurate depictions of things.\n \nWhat they got right... \n1 - \"Good job\" is probably one of the worst things you can tell someone who's put their all into anything.\n2 - It's good that he didn't get the girl.

            "content": "You know, one question i ask myself on whenever i miss out on a film that's not only has been out for 2 years and is taken me now to watch, also considered the best film of that year, is: Why? Why the hell did i not watch this sooner. And it's a rare example for me to say this. And it can be even more rare of me to basically go into a film that despite what fantastic rating it gets, i can get so emotionally invested into it that i forget i was watching a movie to begin with and more as a experience. And that brings me to this little gem: Whiplash. The best film of 2014, nominated and put veteran actor JK Simmons and small time actor Miles Teller into Oscar winners, and put director Damien Chazelle on the mainstream Hollywood spotlight (doing the screenwriting for another tense thriller from this year of 2016: 10 Cloverfield Lane.) And like....holy crap. This is just pure fantastic. Everything was amazing about it. Sure it had some issues, which every film has no matter how great the quality, but they were so far none that it only boiled down to these two: One slightly cliched scene at a dinner table & some music notes used with the background soundtrack. Now the rest of the film? Jee i mean i could go on with that forever. A fantastic cast, LEGENDARY performances from Miles Teller and ESPECIALLY JK Simmons, great pacing, a well layered and simple to follow story that likes to poke fun at cliches here and there, well constructed shots and well made cinematography, a kick ass and SUPERB finale that is just so awe inspiring and so palm sweating that you need to see it to believe it, pretty damn impressive drums from actor Miles Teller that he made me move my head to his beats, and a soundtrack that jesus christ were can i find and listen to all day because that right there is how you do a soundtrack. Overall, do yourself a favor if you haven't seen this to go and do so. Please. I DEFINITELY made the mistake of waiting, and i sure as hell am glad i saw this. Unforgettable in every sense and i can now see why it was the best film of 2014 along with Nightcrawler and Birdman.",

            "content": "Whiplash surrounds the story of a prodigious drummer named Andrew Neymar enrolled at Schaefer Music Conservatory, an acclaimed fictitious school in upstate New York. The plot focuses on Andrew's quest to impress his father, a struggling writer and his family who do not see his full potential. Conflict ensues when Andrew meets Fletcher an egomaniac who serves as the conductor of the jazz ensemble at school. Although he gets results, he is torturous to his students and uses fear, intimidation and embarrassment to mine the best results out of his students. A quote by Fletcher that particularly struck out to me was when he said, \"No two words are worse than good job.\" At this point in the storyline we see the true nefarious nature of our antagonist and understand that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. His techniques are both physically and verbally abusive and especially to Andrew who he sees as a punching bag of sorts throughout the film. Whether he's throwing symbols, a drum or physically hitting him on the face he does everything in his power to break Andrew. I argue that the film is using this fact as a social commentary on how society breaks people down to the point where their wills fall and the powers that be use the opportunity to control the lives of others. Andrew I also would argue is trying to come to grasp with the unfulfilled void from his childhood which he believes he can receive through the jazz ensemble. Although the film is listed under the archtype of the initiation which I will go into more, I see it as having elements of the archetype of man v monster as he is ridiculed and dehumanized by Fletcher. The movie is both a physical and emotional journey and initiation for Andrew. At the beginning of the film he is lost and takes solace in his abuser and pushes himself to levels of perfection that he cannot attain. He beats himself up when he does not succeed and starts to lose his grip on reality. By the climax of the film he faces his depression and fear head on and has a coming of age moment when he is on stage with Fletcher and his band by which he reclaims his will and metaphorically breaks free from the bonds that he was entangled in despite Fletcher figuring out he helped get him fired. Even near the resolution of the film it has elements of a love story as he gets the girl and then loses her from selfishness but then ultimately can't win her back. Overall I thought that the film was fantastic and his jimi hendrix like solo at the end helped to cement his initiation and looked like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly type of moment. Throughout the film Fletcher says he is tough and demanding because he wants to push people beyond what is expected sort of like how Charlie Parker was pushed and became a world famous musician but in the end I argue Andrew does become his own version of Charlie Parker because of his grit and determination.",

            "content": "\"Whiplash\" is not only one of the most intense, disturbing, and thought-provoking movie of the year, but is quite possibly one of the best movies in cinematic history.\n\n\"Whiplash\" follows the story of a young boy named Andrew, who is a young drummer at one of the top schools in the country. He strives to be the best at his craft, and soon finds himself under the influence of a man named Terrence Fletcher. Fletcher is a music teacher who teaches in an unorthodox manner in order to push his students beyond their limits. At what cost is being the greatest worth it though, and is the path to hell worth the pursuit of  a dream?\n\nTo start out, the acting here is phenomenal. Miles Teller puts on an Oscar worthy performance, and has climbed out of his drunkard Hollywood niche to star in an amazing film. He brings so much to the table, and does a great job of bringing his character from one place to another. He brings a lot of emotion to the role, and I'm definitely a Miles Teller fan boy now. On the contrary, J.K. Simmons is the real star here, as he gave one of the best supporting role performances of all time. He was a revelation, as he stole the show in many ways. He truly is a hardcore asshole that will do anything to find his next \"Charlie Parker\", and at no cost will he give up his methods. Both actors were amazing here, and they definitely made the movie for me.\n\nThe movie is also very intense and disturbing. I have never sweated so much when watching a film, and this movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its run time. By the time the credits rolled, my face was drenched in sweat, and my hands were numb. No movie has given me as much anxiety as this movie has, and it truly was an experience. J.K. Simmons is the most hardcore guy I've seen in a movie, and not only does he deliver emotional abuse onto other characters, but it really has an impact on everyone around him, including us. He was the main reason for the anxiety I had throughout the movie, and I'm sure there is a compilation out there of all of the derogatory lines he said throughout the film. \n\nSpeaking of which, take this from someone who has anxiety (me), and let this be a warning. If you suffer from anxiety, this film will be an experience for you. it is nail biting in every way, and makes you want to pass out at times.\n\nConsidering Simmons threw out many witty and abusive lines, you can't help but laugh sometimes because of how disturbing the scene is or just how uncomfortable you are. It makes you feel like an asshole sometimes, but in reality, that's just life. There are plenty of dark, comedic moments that aren't necessarily meant to be funny, but rather the point of this film. It really makes your heart beat quickly, and the movie managed to do an amazing job overall. \n\nI also give a lot of credit to the director and the writers, as they really created a genius film. I loved the director's style, and his use of low budget camera work really impressed me. He set the tone well for the movie, and really did a great job of bringing us from Point A, to Point B. The screenwriters wrote a brilliant screenplay, one that kept me on edge and one that relayed a deeper meaning. This was an intelligent script, and one that was thought-provoking. I loved the direction and tone of this movie, and it makes me admire the talent behind the scenes. \n\nOn the surface, the movie is about a drummer boy and his pursuit to greatness, but his path getting there is absolute hell. When you dig deeper into the meaning, it makes the film even more disturbing and insane. The movie relays a message that makes you think, \"Is pursuing my dream worth it if it means traveling along the path to hell?\". This film makes you question many things, and shows that the path to greatness is not necessarily worth it. Andrew practically kills himself just to be remembered as one of the greats, and it really makes your jaw drop. There's also the question of what's the point of being the best, if you're not happy with what you do? In the beginning, Andrew is so passionate about his drumming and has a love for the art of it, but by the end, he absolutely hates drumming, and it pretty much ruined his life. It really makes you think about many things, and I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since Day 1. \n\nAt one point in the movie, one character questions whats the point of living if you can't be remembered. It really hits the topic that many people think about, and that's just being remembered for something. Now, although it's nice to be remembered, is it worth losing your life over?\n\nThere were plenty of memorable scenes here, with my favorite being the finale. That was the most intense and epic finale I've seen in my life, and is certainly one that had my heart racing. There was so much flare and meaning behind it, and nothing has made me more stunned than this ending. \n\n\nThis movie just feels so real, and everyone will be able to relate to this movie in some way shape or form. This movie is dark in many ways, and will definitely hit home for a lot of people.\n\nIn the end, this movie is my favorite movie of all time. There's no denying that this is an amazing movie, and every time someone asks me what my favorite film is, without hesitation, I say \"Whiplash\". I will remember this film forever, and it is truly a perfect film. It deserves, a perfect score.",

But think of what could happen if Andrew couldn't take Fletcher's ruthless ways of teaching any more. My father once had this kind of temper with me when I was struggling with my math homework. He wanted perfection also. But I told him, \"Dad, NO ONE is perfect in this world.\" Yet he said that we can try to be perfect. I bore with his temper for a few more years, without spilling out the beans yet. Before I did spill the beans, I actually wanted to commit suicide because of what I fear he'll do next with his unbearable temper. Later my counselor found out that I tried suicide, and the next day, she immediately called an important meeting with my parents. After the meeting, my father finally understands that he can push me to the level in which perfection equals obsession. He apologizes to me for all he has done to me. Unfortunately, the idea of reaching absolute perfection has been carved into my brain like caveman carving pictures into walls, permanently. That soon turned my attitude away from My mental health and only focusing on perfection. And now, I have intense OCD that is just as unbearable as the temper that my dad had when I was younger. To this day on, when someone mentions my dad's ways of teaching, I always talk bad about him. The main point I'm trying to make is that perfection needs to have a look at the reality beforehand. If you want to be at the top of something, you have to be honest with yourself: Can I make it? At what cost? Before things go out of hand. I hope you critics take my message seriously.",

WITH ALL THE DETERMINATION. gosh i want to make jazz companion films for like EVERY standard now just to visualize how grooving jazz can be. the drums are obviously the most shot here, but even the close-ups on the horns, bass, and piano are just jaw-dropping. the writing was almost exposition-less and kept moving with twists and turns the whole way (MUCH LIKE JAZZ) and it feels much shorter than the film turns out to be. J.K. Simmons also shines incredibly, such intensity and range; you really see it here. he's much more than a character actor like he seems to get cast all the time - truly great. if you've got time over the holiday weekend, get out and see this one, it's absolutely worth the money and time.",

JK Simmons truly deserves the recognition he received for his performance in the movie as well.  I think ultimately what I struggled with in watching the movie was actually how much I actually enjoyed it.  There's no question this movie kept me engaged, made me think, and had me on the edge of my seat many times actually, but did I actually like it?  I would say probably not, at least not until the final 20 minutes or so, but the payoff is pretty great, and ultimately, I think this movie does do an exceptional job at evoking a lot of discussion.

Miles Teller is great as Andrew, engaging, realistic and genuine. You care about him and want him to succeed. On the other hand J.K. Simmons as Terence is a frightening force that you love to hate, and it would have been a travesty if he didn't win the Oscar for best supporting actor. The script for Whiplash is so good as well the back and forth between Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons is intense, heartbreaking and absolutely savage on Simmon's part.

I was along for the ride but wasn't drawn into it thinking it's another trope with Jazz & drum sticks (instead of punches & round-house kicks). Even when the two characters meet months later as the movie is winding up, I was thinking \"sure, let's humanize the teacher here, he'll say a few good lines, let's roll the closing credits...\". Then I was shown the real soul of the movie with real refreshing take on screen-play and story-telling.\n\nWhen the movie ended at an exhilarating finish, I fully appreciated the mis-direction and the intentional ambiguity the director & screen-writer had woven into the film. The true intentions of the teacher is certainly ambitious where I had to ask a friend what he thought it was-sure enough we had different views on it.

            "content": "Whiplash is a movie about a talented young Jazz drummer, Andrew Neiman, and his experience as a first year student at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the country. The movie focuses around Neiman getting into the highest-level Jazz ensemble at Shaffer, conducted by the ruthless Jazz conductor Terence Fletcher. \n\tI thought the movie was excellent. It is in the genre of movies that focus around a talented individual whether athlete, musician, brilliant student etc. and their struggle towards greatness and success. Think Billy Elliot, Drumline, Searching for Bobby Fischer, Finding Forrester. And as usual in this type of movie there is always a coach or mentor pushing them towards excellence. \nWhat made this movie especially interesting was the music instructor Terence Fletcher played by J.K Simmons, who many times plays silly and dorky characters. In this movie his character is instead an unforgiving and ruthless instructor (also somewhat physically imposing) that requires such perfection from his musicians that he comes off sadistic and almost deranged. But claims that these tactics are to bring out the best in his musicians and hopefully create one of the \u0093greats\u0094.\n\tThe Jazz Drummer, Neiman, also makes this movie, though in a more predictable way. His character is hell bent on reaching Fletcher\u0092s expectations and will stop at nothing to do so. Though I don\u0092t want to give away how because it\u0092s fun to see. The actor who portrays this character has no challenge unleashing his own inner beast as we watch him intensely sweat and destroy the drums. \n\tBut what makes this movie exceptional is that it goes beyond just making the usual-man/women triumphing over adversity with incredible talent-film. You know, the type of movies with a clear trajectory of the main character demonstrating their skills, not quite having it, gruelingly pushing themselves and then eventually succeeding (giving us as the audience feelings of euphoria!). This movie left me unsure what to think when it ends. The relationship between the instructor and the instructed is not clean, but instead complex. The instructor is never clearly defined as a protagonist or antagonist. And the clear protagonist, Neiman\u0085. is he too obsessed as a musician? It left me with the question, does one have to be almost unhealthily obsessed to be \u0093great\u0094. Looking back in human history at great people, many of them do seem to hurt/neglect themselves or others along their quest towards greatness. \n\tIn the end this movie was intense, ripped and roaring and yes filled with literally blood, sweat and tears. The drummer can legitimately shred and was exciting and fun to watch. Also, if you never listened to Jazz you may start or if you forgot about it like I did, you may start again.",

This stunning film which is starred by Miles Teller as Andrew who is the main character, J. K. Simmons as his teacher, Paul Reiser as Andrew\u00b4s father and Melissa Benoist as Andrew\u00b4s lover, is about the relationship between an ambitious jazz student and an extremely strict teacher,\nThe story begins when Andrew Neiman,a first-year jazz student  at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, is discovered by the most respected teacher at that conservatory while playing the drums ina music room late one night. Eventually, he invites him to his band and puts him through a series of tests not only of his drumming but also of his resilence. Will Andrew be able to live up to the challenge or will he give up?\nThe movie is filled with tension as Fletcher demands more and more of his talented student pushing himto the limit. The flick raises some questions as to how far teachers should go in order to achieve excellence. Both Miles Teller and  J. K. Simmons give convincing performances as the film goes on which is accompanied by the top New York jazz music. Simmons won an Oscar for his part and he truly deserves it.\nI thoroughly recommend \"Whiplash\". This highly-entertaining must-see will keep the audience at the edge of their seats.

Miles Teller plays Richard Gere (not actually) as the aspiring Buddy Rich, put is more than put through the wringer by Fletcher (the insane, abusive perfectionist jazz teacher). The music is good, there is a vague Deborah Winger role (abandoned in pursuit of excellence), and Telller's father is no Robert Loggia, but a high school English teacher.\n\nThe climax is incredible - in the original use of the word - not credible. In the last 30 minutes, the perfectionist, no longer a teacher, accidentally lures Teller into a professional concert in Carnegie Hall, only to pull the rug out under him, depriving him of the charts he needs to read. Undeterred by failure plays blistering drums that ultimately wins over the demented Simmons/Fletcher.\n\nThis is a rare film, at times compulsively watchable and yet beyond cliche, reaching so far over the top, your jaw should drop with it's inappropriate. It is the hyper-masculine world - no women allowed (they would never stop screaming ABUSE!) - that reminds you why it is still a man's world without ever once saying anything about gender.

            "content": "Whiplash follows the magnificent story of Andrew (played by Miles Tiller), a solo-drummer striving to be the next great jazz revolutionary of his time, and an adversary music teacher, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). The two compete in a zero sum power relationship throughout the film. When one gives into to the other's prowess, the opposing character loses authority. For the most part, however, J.K. Simmons plays the power role in this film. From the very beginning, after Fletcher runs into Andrew by coincidence, Simmons holds the greater power, telling Andrew to play or stop playing. Already in their first encounter, Fletcher gains mastery of Andrew's lack of self-authority. Director Damien Chazelle does an excellent job of portraying the struggle between teacher and student by putting us right behind the drums themselves and allows us to feel the tension between Fletcher's aggressive, almost physically abusing teachings and Andrew's burning, aching desire to be the best there's been. These cinematic effects are much more emotionally appealing than if we had just seen Fletcher yelling at Andrew from a camera off-stage. Chazelle should also be applauded for his music selection in the movie. Being a musician for the past eight years, I know that both \"Whiplash\" and \"Caravan\" do a phenomenal job of projecting the emotions of the incredibly dynamic characters. Both songs are very uptempo and swung very, VERY hard. Also, the music perfectly complements the script. Caravan has a very intense, difficult drum solo that leads into the end of the movie. Ironically, if any of the songs in the movie are to represent the plot, it's not \"Whiplash\", but rather \"Caravan\". Since earlier in the film, Damien presents Andrew with a struggle. He makes it impossible for Andrew to accomplish playing in \"double-time\" swing. This requires hours, weeks, and months of practice and skill as the swing is at an insanely fast tempo, requiring Andrew's wrist to move at an unhuman speed. However, Damien Chazelle gave this struggle a double purpose. Not only does he finally gain the ability to play double time swing by the end of the movie; metaphorically, he overcame an even bigger feat, finally beating his damn music teacher in the war for power. Or so we think...\n\tUpon watching for a third time, I begin to see that the finale of the movie is not as triumphant as we think. Throughout the movie, cinema effects and music choices all show us that Andrew's ultimate goal is not to become great, but to prove his teacher wrong. All the time, we've been thinking Andrew was the hero; trying to become the best. However, Fletcher's goal was to create his own prodigy in order to fulfil his own narcissistic ego. During the last scene of the movie, Fletcher makes a fool of Andrew by switching up the order of the songs to one that he does not know. He then comes back on stage and overrules Fletcher's authority and begins to play the song that he knew the best: \"Caravan\". People applaud for him because he finally showed everyone how good he is, right??? Wrong. All Andrew did was do what Fletcher wanted all along and come back to him in order to show everyone how good a teacher he is. \n\tIt took me three times to really understand what Damien had wanted us to see all along, a tragic, yet falsely triumphant ending for Andrew. I believe that any movie with a great choice of actors, excellent music choice, deeply symbolic messages, and such a greatly dynamic character struggle like the one shown in Whiplash deserves your time and money. GO WATCH IT.",

Then, returning home, I just sat on the couch smoking for nearly an hour, motionless, contemplating about the movie. The next morning, the same thing happened and since then, from times to times I go back and think of it again and again. This is how I know that this movie is at least a \"9/10\" for me. It's not that often that movies have a tremendous impact on me like this one. \n\nThe movie itself was as fast-paced as a jazz masterpiece, mixing up emotions, changing pace and then leaving you with a feeling of awe. Simmons was AMAZING! Words cannot describe his acting in this one. Especially in the scene where he threatens to \"demolish\" the guy entering his stage before a concert, was hilarious and intense at the same time! He managed to convey a character that really exists out there, pouring poison into the love of many many young artists for their art. \n\nAll the cast gave their best effort, painting a canvas of intense emotions for the viewer. I easily put the movie up there with all the great \"music-themed\" movies like the Pianist, the Red Violin, the Solist, the Legend of 1900, etc. I am not a jazz player or an instrument player whatsoever, so having a movie \"get to me\" so much proves that this is a must see for everyone!",

It concerns Andrew Neyman, played superbly by Miles Teller, in a breakout, career-making performance. He is a gifted 19 year-old aspiring Jazz drummer who wants to be great, like his idol the legendary Buddy Rich. Andrew attends a prestigious Manhattan music school, where he catches the eye of the school's most notorious professor, Terence Fletcher, marvelously played by J.K. Simmons in an awesome scene-stealing performance that won him the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actor Guild Award, and BAFTA Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. Simmons is absolutely unforgettable and burns a hole in the screen every time he appears. Andrew is thrilled that Fletcher has picked him for his elite ensemble band, but has no ideal of the inhuman abuse and pressure that Fletcher will unleash on him, which will include brutal insults, slaps across the face, and objects hurled at him. Fletcher does all this to get the very best out of Andrew, he believes that by having no mercy he will make a virtuoso musician out of Andrew, who plays his drums so hard and with such intensity that he literally makes his hands bleed. Teller who does most of his own amazing drumming is truly impressive and delivers a jaw-dropping portrait of young musician struggling for greatness. Simmons is astounding as he turns from caring mentor to heartless sociopath. The battle of wills between Teller and Simmons is the heart of this fascinating film. Striking cinematography by Shaone Meir, with beautiful original music by Justin Hurwitz. Sensational direction by Damien Chazelle, who also wrote the captivating Academy Award nominated adapted screenplay, and gives us a unique motion picture that is a prime example of bravura filmmaking. Nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture. Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "What price success? That's basically the question asked in \"Whiplash\" (R, 1:47). Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal? How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential? When does motivation become abuse? We've probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything, or had a parent, a coach, a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it. Well, what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation? Can we expect the result to be excellence - or tragedy - or both?\n\nMiles Teller plays Andrew Neimann, a freshman at an extremely prestigious (but fictional) music school in New York City, called the Shaffer Conservatory. Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great, but to be one of THE greats. His only friend is the single father (Paul Reiser) who raised him. He doesn't have friends or girlfriends. He needs to be free to focus on his music. He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer's most demanding professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who picks Andrew for the school's very exclusive Studio Band. Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987's \"Full Metal Jacket\" look like a purring kitten. Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood, sweat and tears, but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor. Fletcher regularly abuses all his students - emotionally and even physically - especially Andrew.  It's Fletcher's idea of motivation. He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness, and greatness is what Andrew covets, but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial. It's toxic. And combustible. As the tension builds, Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher - if Fletcher doesn't destroy him in the process. It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps. Inevitable.\n\nBesides asking some very important questions, \"Whiplash\" gets credit for excellent execution - mostly. First of all, the acting is terrific. Simmons deserves all the awards he has won for the role and one wonders why Teller wasn't nominated for any awards. The film's cinematography and editing really add to the onscreen tension and the music is so much a part of the story-telling that it's practically a character unto itself. This film will probably do more for jazz than any film since \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" (1999). The only real problem I had with this film is the ending. What seems to be a strong narrative thread, a consistent message and a uniform tone (all thanks to writer-director Damien Chazelle, who based the characters on his experiences as a music student) gets off track in the film's final scene. This movie is simply 30-60 seconds too long. Except for that, this is a very artistically intense film and deserves a look - and more than a passing thought about the questions it raises. \"B+\"",

One of the best performances in any role I have ever seen.\n\nMiles Teller may be overlooked for his relatively less emotive role as Andrew. This is a shame, but he is young and will draw more expansive roles thanks to Whiplash. A star in the making to be sure.\n\nAnd of course the cinematography and music.

Culminating in one of the more tension riddled finales of recent memories and featuring some of the most brutal ego tearing scripting this side of Full Metal Jacket, up and coming filmmaker Damian Chazelle's searing drama is against all odds, a drama cume thriller of the highest order.\n\nFeaturing some of last years most outstounding performances from both the ever growing Miles Teller and the always good yet never before so commanding J.K Simmons, Whiplash will have you constantly on the edge of your seat, frequently forgetting to breathe and riveted every step of it's running time due to an all round package that has rightfully become a player and often winner in this awards season. It's stunning to consider this is one of Chazelle's first features and for a man perhaps best known for scripting the Elijah Wood thriller Grand Piano, this is a sure fire heralding in of a major new filmmaking talent. Chazelle handles proceedings like a true professional, the editing, the pacing, the direction of actors and the award calibre scripting is all of he highest order and it's evident throughout that Chazelle is a naturally gifted filmmaker. Whiplash truly is an exciting mix of dramatic tension and thrilling interplay between budding musician Andrew and egotistical conductor Terrence Fletcher that sees Chazelle draw out a pair of rivals that will live long in the lore of cinema history.\n\nSince his arrival on the film scene in films such as Rabbit Hole and more recently The Spectacular Now, Miles Teller has threatened to break out at any moment and if The Spectacular Now was not proof enough, there is little remaining doubt after this effort that Teller is one of the finest examples of young talent in the industry today. Teller's character of Andrew is a multilayered one and one that doesn't necessarily win over our affections completely. His a complicated young boy, driven to the point of arrogance and not overly warm, yet his a figure we want to see succeed, if not only to spite the evil incarnate that is J.K Simmons's Fletcher.\n\nA recognisable face over many years of supporting work in Hollywood, it's a true joy to see Simmons unleash in a stunning portrayal of a man driven to drive others to the point of no return. Whether spouting out some of the most vile abuse possible or talking calmly to potential future musicians that he can use in his band, Terrence Fletcher is a force to be reckoned with, a tornado of aggression and pent up rage. It's one of 2014's stand out performances and a role that saw Simmons collect a thoroughly deserved Oscar at the Academy Awards, it's a win that is wholeheartedly earned and deserved.\n\nWhile Whiplash has a few narrative missteps and a handful of questionable scenarios (particularly one scene involving a car accident) it's not enough to sully a film that you suspect will be living a long life in years to come, being studied by start out filmmakers, budding actors and lovers of all things good cinema. Just don't go showing anyone considering a potential sojourn in a music school, as Terrence Fletcher may just be enough to scare them away for good.\n\n4 and a half bloodied drum kits out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check into - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

A few months ago, I didn't even know this existed, but I heard many positive reviews, as well as #6 on WatchMojo's Best Films of 2014. Soon after, it got a Best Picture nom, so I had to see this.\n\nWhiplash is definitely not your average band-type film; if you've seen the trailers or the film, you know what I'm talking about. I was on the edge of my seat from the first time J.K. Simmons' voice went over 80 dB. Yeah, it was pretty intense for a film about drums.\n\nObviously, the acting was for sure what made this film so successful. Miles Teller was very very good as the young Andrew Nieman. I think he may have improved on his performance in the Spectacular Now. Very bright future for him. J.K. Simmons..... WOW.... Every time he opened his mouth or reached for an item, I cringed. He should win the Oscar in his category.\n\nWhat I really liked in this film though was the message it gave. Do whatever you can to be the best of the best, and whenever something stands in your way, just use it as motivation, including your teacher throwing a chair at your head because you're not perfect.\n\nIf I could choose a 6th nomination for Best Direction, Damien Chazelle would 100% be my choice.

I would've preferred something more realistic. It's just inaccurate as hell. Even the Charlie Parker story, they get completely wrong. I think Chazelle just wanted to tell an exciting story, and laser focused on that at the cost of everything else. (He's just as myopic as the main character, basically.)

For anyone who ever had the motivation to achieve something and who felt the pressure to live up to expectations so impossibly high (and therefore probably impossibly stupid), this film's for you.  J. K. Simmons is smooth, dedicated, and downright nefarious as the teacher and Miles Teller holds his own (and really holds the sticks) as the student.  However, it's the pacing of the film and the eclectic cutting that really scores - sure there are a lot of drum solos but they are pretty mesmerizing - and then there's that sucker punch.  Nothing too deep here, unless you want to ponder about whether motivation is made stronger by obstacles or simply wiped out (could go either way, I think).  In any event, this is one film that you shouldn't miss.",

J.K. Simmons is phenomenal as Fletcher, the tyrannical music instructor.  Miles Teller as Andrew, the gifted pupil, does a solid job of keeping up with him scene for scene.  Conceptually, it is intriguing, though it never takes full flight.  The main issue is with the script which is painfully amateurish lacking in imagination and cleverness.   Due to poor scripting, we never truly see the battle of wills between Fletcher and Andrew come alive until the last 20 minutes of the film.  We find ourselves with several silly filler scenes and ill-used secondary characters (i.e. Jim and Nicole) neither of whom contribute much to the overall theme or story.  Since we don't have much that is insightful verbally, the director is heavily reliant on plot devices with thick metaphors to move the story along.  One of the biggest disappointments (at least to me) is the ending.  It could've ended about a minute and a half sooner with an abrupt cut.  If it had, I could've overlooked its slim story, pacing problems and lack of character or thematic development in favour of a more ambiguous, thought provoking end.    All that said, the film stayed with me, even if for mostly unfavourable reasons.",

In the process, they push each other from the edges of their respective careers and lives -- to a place of mutual admiration and realization of dreams comes true.

It is easy to see why this film won the Oscar for this category.\n\nWhat I find really brilliant is the use of sound in this film. There are great moments when the diegetic music within the film blends with and transitions into the score of the film. There are also super tense moments highlighted by haunting moments of total silence. As I have said before in other reviews, the lack of an element is just as effective as the element itself. The greatest \"silence\" in this film is probably at the conclusion of this film when we see the two main characters' sets of eyes as they look at each other, now working together, understanding each other.\n\nThe acting is beyond phenomenal. J.K. Simmons, one of the nicest guys in Hollywood is absolutely terrifying, but you also can't help understanding where he comes from when he explains he is trying to get students to recognize their potential. If abuse is what it takes to create the next Charlie Parker, it is justified since you are giving the world the next great artist. As for Miles Teller, his acting apparently fell short of Oscar-worthy. I feel his performance was somewhat underrated, but I do not believe it was his fault - some of the dialogue his character had was a little flat from time to time.\n\nThe best aspects of this film happen in scenes that involve music performance, whether it is a rehearsal, a competition, or what will become one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history. In scenes that examine Teller's character outside of his music performance there are strange and somewhat forced aspects. I nearly roll my eyes at the scene where he talks with his family (I think) about how they should pay more attention to him because it is all about the rivalry between sports and the arts. I like it because it shows how much of a jerk Andrew can be, but it practically force- feeds the audience the idea that the arts are not respected enough. However, I suppose this is realistic dinner conversation, especially the dialogue coming from Andrew.\n\nThis is a movie with very few flaws and I give it my highest rating.",

That's not to say its god awful, no chance, it actually has 2 really compelling and gripping performances by actors on 2 different sides of the spectrum, the story is intriguing if not, well completely predictable and it has a gorgeous grade to it, in what is a well paced but not entirely precise edit of above average shots. Whiplash follows the story of Andrew, a young and budding jazz drummer, who happens to attend one of the most sought after music schools in the world. Not only is it one of the most sought after music schools, it also happens to have Terence, Satan himself, teaching within its walls. Soon Andrew finds his way onto Terence's perfectionist band and well you can pretty much slap the rest down as a we have seen it all before story and plot development. So apart from the overlying theme of obsession over craft, lets just ignore anything else going on in this film apart from the 2 lead actors, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller, who really this story is all about, they are Ying and Yang, black and white, heads or tails. They essentially fuel the entire thing from start to finish with Simmons experience, mopping the floor with Teller, until the later scenes, something resonate of the characters and story arc within the piece. As I said, this is a spanking set of performances by the duo, but lets be honest, Oscar worthy? No chance! The supporting cast are given a huge range of nothing to do, with actors like Paul Reiser, getting the most beige character i've seen in a long time. The film does look pretty and polished, with some nice dynamic shots throughout, some of which are nice, some of which Fincher would slap the 7 shades of shit out of his DOP for allowing their inclusion. The opening shot, for a tracking shot, seems so shakey and unstable, other shots just seem like they have been framed in the most bizarre way possible. Some of it doesnt sit well with the eye, however when the film is visually at its best is when the band are performing, with snapping cuts to close ups and peculiar low angles allow us to get a grasp on the pain and war these 2 men are going through. I'm giving this movie a hard time, not because its terrible but because films like this, always pan out the same way, from the very beginning i knew exactly what was going on and where we would end up in 1 hours time, thats not good. I knew every jolt, every pace, every twist and turn it had to offer and from my take on what the film is about, this film should be constantly flawless visually and emotionally and pack as many sways in story that you could possibly expect. It is fun, its fast paced, its well acted and the music is toe tappin but useless supporting characters and a yawn inducing plot, makes for a film that should be bursting with struggle and energy, tame and temperimental. It likes true passion, not from the actors but from the script and that is what makes this a massively underwhelming film to watch.",

I never felt that Mr. Fletcher was anything but passionate about building up his students, it was a great picture of many incidents that have happened that made the news, while watching Fletcher \"coach\" his team It reminded me of football and great coaches using every technique they could to get the most out of students.  At one point I thought the movie was going to end up a little short but the climax a battle of will between Neyman and Fletcher is as good as any sports movie though I like the way whiplash goes more than the often formulaic nature of sports movies.

            "content": "Precision can be defined as the quality of being exact and accurate. Instruments working together to create music depend on precision to even sound acceptable for musicians. Great music comes down to the finest strands of musical notes that actually makes a difference and separates the greats from the ordinary pack. These stories are not lacklustre musical romances, these are dramatic character determination tales that maintain the power to transfix and blow away because this style of music is an art in itself. Dramatic music films are rare nowadays and if made they are normally teenage musical competitions that are never going to be a consuming watch. But finally, one has been made, and seeing as it has been created by fan and former youth jazz drummer Damien Chazelle, the film is always going to thrive as a tenaciously riveting factual insight. Chazelle\u00e2??s first love was filmmaking so he accomplished his life goal, but he at a teenage age tested himself out as a jazz drummer with an intense music teacher to guide him. It seems the profession required too much for Chazelle to make it in, therefore he resorted to making a film about jazz drumming, and he downright has made the right choice, as Whiplash is a thrilling investigation of a profession that requires dedication and a metal of ruthlessness to even last in.\n \nWhiplash is pretty much a routine drama film that utilises the unique topic of jazz drumming to bolster its promise of delivering consuming drama. Whiplash concerns a 19-year old talented jazz drummer named Andrew Neiman who by chance auditions for the renowned conductor Terence Fletcher at Shaffer Conservatory, the best music school in the United States. Once he joins the class, he witnesses Fletcher\u00e2??s ruthless teaching methods but is relaxed when Fletcher courteously asks about his family. Fletcher is in truth a master manipulator and when Neiman enters the room to play he experiences a fierce backlash to his drumming resulting in a chair being thrown at him, to continuous slapping until ultimately Neiman is reduced to tears. Neiman pushes himself after this event to his physical limit, and when Fletcher coldly pursues another drummer, the friction between the two builds to a climactic fracas. Nevertheless, both the protagonists meet for a final performance together on stage for all the world to see their friction and their talent. All other plotlines that don\u00e2??t involve Neiman\u00e2??s drumming determination and class abuse are rendered futile and unnecessary as they lack the visceral, aggressive entertainment that comes when one person is driven to bleed with his drumsticks in order to be the best and the other is ruthless and unrelenting in the way he trains his students. The film actually makes Neiman bluntly state to his girlfriend he can\u00e2??t proceed with their relationship because of his drumming ambitions wanting nothing to get in the way, similarly to the manner in which Whiplash\u00e2??s best scenes are its vicious drumming lessons and not the unexciting sub-plots. Who knew that jazz drumming would be so fascinating as literal blood, sweat and tears will have been shed by the end leaving you gaping at how hard jazz perfection really proves to be in attaining.\n \nMiles Teller, star of teenage party films Project X and 21 & Over stars as the young aspiring drummer Andrew Neiman. He wants to be one of the greats of music, like Buddy Rich, who was billed as the world\u00e2??s greatest, but his arrival at Shaffer transforms his character into a determined young man that will go to anything to be the best\u00e2?\u00a6 but only if his teacher lets him! Teller has never really broken out from the younger roles he receives, but Whiplash provides him with a stepping-stone to a more dramatic career. Teller embodies his character\u00e2??s inner determination and anger so well that he never gets overshadowed by Fletcher\u00e2??s ruthlessness, making his ascent into a great drummer all the more believable because it appears as if Teller really has tested himself and come out the other side stronger. J. K. Simmons portrays the ferociously vicious Terence Fletcher, whose aggressive manner of teaching and improving his students takes Whiplash into shocking territories. Simmons ruthlessly demolishes the role and surprises you even further with a character that appears profoundly interesting beneath all the terrorising he does. This performance to me came as no surprise for in the original Tobey Maguire-Spiderman series, he portrayed the pompous editor of the newspaper Peter Parker works at, and in this role he gives a barbarously vocal performance. With Simmons it is not just anger though, as he is involved in a touching emotional moment that resonates with you giving his dark and unfriendly character a dimension of humanity. He is the favourite to win Best Supporting Actor at the upcoming Oscars and even though Duvall, Hawke, Norton and Ruffalo are all credible nominees, Simmons freakishly tramples over them with a performance that overwhelms and devastates everything in sight.\n \nThe power struggle between Neiman and Fletcher is undoubtedly the plot of the film that has made Whiplash a Best Picture nominee. Neiman begins Fletcher\u00e2??s class subservient to his power and abuse, but as the methods of teaching develop into a psychological problem for Neiman, he begins to want to usurp Fletcher\u00e2??s place in the hierarchy and end his bullying. Fletcher never breaks stride in his ferocious attitude as he constantly strips the resilient Neiman of his integrity by testing his technique, power, groove and speed repeatedly, even replacing him when he slacks. These moments of struggling that fluctuate towards the end of the film provide scenes of such impact that they easily become the moments that leave you fond of it. Especially the final scene between the protagonists in which both are on stage together ridiculing one another until they realise the music is about to make a legend. Their differences are put aside for both of their loves for jazz music and therefore when they merge, all the hierarchies and bitterness is just dissolved in the blink of an eye and what you see is a connection between two warring souls whose disparities has made this film one heck of a thrill ride. Whiplash like a piece of music crescendos when you want more as its characters are unified by the same personal ambition, but as it cuts, the polished film that is Whiplash fulfils its dramatically intense potential with such satisfaction.\n \nJazz reached its utmost in the 20\u00e2??s, as it came during a period where America was roaring. The feel of the 20\u00e2??s can only be characterised as jazzy; a shiny and polished atmosphere of classiness. Whiplash concerns itself with jazz drumming and therefore it required the appearance and feel of the 20\u00e2??s juxtaposed with a contemporary setting. Tom Cross\u00e2?? editing deserves to be praised for it perfectly emanates a jazzy mood with a shiny, sleek, classy looking film. The atmosphere cleverly radiates the profession the film is investigating allowing you to immerse yourself in the songs used such as Hank Levy\u00e2??s \u00e2??Whiplash\u00e2?? which is used for the title of the film and the intense \u00e2??Caravan\u00e2?? that is used to test the drummers to their limit. It is the best, serious film there has ever been about music that isn\u00e2??t a teenage musical contest making Whiplash deserved of its Best Picture nomination, but even though it probably is not going to win, it should be remembered as one of the best of its year. With the musical genre that is jazz dying away, Whiplash has arrived at the perfect time to stimulate you to want to be the best; if J.K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher doesn\u00e2??t make you want to test your limits, then I guess you were \u00e2??discouraged.\u00e2??\n\nWhiplash is rich in musical prowess and bursting with dramatic intensity thanks to its focused screenplay, balance of shock and uplift and one very brutal performance from J.K. Simmons.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        8/10",

It's one movie of its kind with incredible characters and real chemistry between them! I mean just look at J.K Simmons in Spiderman and imagine him with much less patience and a much more scarier attitude; thats exactly what he's Whiplash. He's freaking incredible, scary and really an outstanding performance! That Oscar really is well deserved! The dialogs are just as awesome, and all the main characters are really relatable. Andrew is in the first 30 minutes like this shy boy, but really develops into something greater. This movie really found a place in my heart, not from a romance-perspective but more in a relatable one, because holy **** I can definitely relate to Andrew's hard fight to accomplish success, to fight and not to give up. He gets frustrated, depressed and tries harder and harder, but doesn't give up. That's almost like life in a nutshell. \n\nIt's a really great movie that truly surpassed my expectations. It's not boring for me, but might be for someone else. But you can't ignore the excellent cinematography, it's superb! \n\nI'm literary standing up, clapping to Whiplash to its cool, flawless, unique and characteristic aspects. \nWell done! \n\n8/10",

The band is conducted by respected and feared Terence Flecther (J.K. Simmmons) whose methods are abusive and violent...\nThe movie thrives through with it's great music scenes but most importantly by it's amazing actors. J.K. Simmons was a phenomenon, a devil as a teacher but an normal mortal elsewhere and his balance playing these mind sets was perfect. You really didn't know what he would do next. Miler Teller was also good and he plays the obsessive drummer with style and class...and blisters and bloody fingers.\nOverall, this was a story of battle of wills but it also was a story of obsession, the very bad kind and the desperate ache of approval.

I love this scene because it shows Neeman's determination towards this Jazz Band, and it also shows that JK Simmons character has a soul, he made him stop drumming because it looked like he was gonna drop dead, it also shows that he has a breaking point where enough is enough, even though in a earlier scene he said \"get your blood off my drum set\".

            "content": "\"Whiplash\" left me speechless. Powerfully acted and mature, this film is a spectacular journey that it is both meaningful and rewarding. It unravels itself smoothly and it slowly becomes a deep dive into the musician's psyche.\nThe film starts right off the bat as we see a young aspiring drummer Andrew Neyman, interpreted by Miles Teller. He is a student at the Shaffer Conservatory in New York, and he is practising with his drums. And then, he is startled by the sudden appearance of Terrence Fletcher, a famous teacher at that school. This character enjoys an outstanding performance by J.K Simmons. To put it simply, he's such a multifaceted character and a first class antagonist, that he made me laugh out of pure amazement. And you must believe that I don't often do that. Anyway, he asks Andrew to play for him, and after a while, he leaves, leaving Andrew dumbfounded. So, the story goes on for a few minutes, until Fletcher ultimately makes Andrew part of his band. Later on, we can see through the eyes of Andy the harsh treatment of Fletcher to his band, and how his violent personality and strictness makes this story a lot more intense. As the movie advances, due to Fletcher's severe methods, Andy's personality slowly changes from his timid, quiet personality to a lot more anxious and competitive one. His relationships crumble, due to his desire of becoming the best. He tries his best to impress Fletcher and he fails, but then succeeds, only to be tested again and be pushed to his very limits. This film benefits from an amazing climax as well as other incredible scenes, too. I felt that Andy's love interest arc could have been a little bit better, but works anyway. And I think that the greatest strength of this movie also happens to be its only flaw. This film relies too much on the importance of the relation between Andrew and Terrence, therefore, other supporting characters are slightly overshadowed. Nevertheless, it's not much of a problem either.\nIn conclusion, \"Whiplash\" is a true cinematic experience. It is well worth your time, and if you want to feel some real tension, you definitely need to watch this movie, no doubt.",

One day, he meets Terrence Fletcher played by Oscar winning JK Simmons who is the complex instructor who manipulates the emotions of the talented musicians under his tutelage. Fletcher is tough on his players, even cruel at times pushing them beyond their limits. He has created the best Jazz Ensemble in the school due to his methods. Andrew starts as second chair, only to be pushed further by Fletcher to push beyond his abilities. Andrew loses his way pushing obsessively to play until his hands bleed to become what Fletcher wants. When Andrew becomes complacent, Fletcher pushes back cruelly by putting someone from his previous ensemble in his place as core player to push Andrew to be better. Fletcher gets to the point of pushing Andrew too far, causing a altercation that changes both of their lives. JK Simmons is genius in his performance as Terrence Fletcher, complicating our impression of him even to the end with that love hate relationship. A must see movie.",

            "content": "A phenomenal film that exposes some wonderfully nuanced layers behind a couple of electrifying performances. To this note, the performances of Teller and Simmons manage to marry two distinct characters, in which polarizing differences unfold into a relationship of shared affinities. The resulting affect is a film that, no matter how uncomfortable it makes us feel (and it brings out some intense emotions), we are left with a profound tension between the positive and negative impact of this relationship, a confusion of where the line (a question that is posed near the end of the film) of right and wrong sits, of what is helpful and harmful. And ultimately it is this dynamic that allows this film's powerful exploration of the cutthroat nature of elite music training/competition to become a commentary on the larger human tendency to struggle with excellence and failure, healthy obsessions with perfection and controlled success. The strongest poetic symbol of this tension comes in Fletcher's (Simmons) insistent declaration that, \"The most dangerous two words in the english language are 'Good Job'\".\nStanding above the marriage of these two performances is a raw and honest film direction that mirrors the frenzied movement of the music itself. The pace and positioning of the camera work uses angles to give us added perception to the dramatic interplay between characters. It interprets a scenes emotions through a mix of close ups (at time allowing the vision of a slight grimace to portray more than words, at others allowing the instrument itself to carry the dialogue). And the back and forth movement between the increasing emotional interplay between student and teacher is captured through camera work that sits almost slightly behind or ahead of the scene itself (\"Are you dragging or are you rushing!\", as Fletcher would say).\nThere are so many powerful moments in this film. It tells the story of a young aspiring jazz musician (drummer) attempting to make it in an elite music school. It centres around the relationship that sparks between student and a popular teacher. However, this relationship sheds light on the students (Neyman) own relationship with his past and upbringing, his father and the loss of his mother, his inability to get out of the shadow of the successes of his siblings (and others). There is an absolutely wonderful scene around a supper table in which Neyman is left to defend the sort of subjective nature of success as a musician (to perhaps the more measurable success that comes in other fields). The illumination of this subjective nature only pushes him towards a more concrete notion of his goal, which is expressed so incredibly well in another wonderful scene between him and his girlfriend through which he articulates exactly what success looks like (another transition point in the film).\nMy personal reaction to this film came with a slew of emotions. The truth is we are left not so much with answers in the end as we are images. We are left carrying a mix of anger and disbelief with feelings of happiness and joy. There is certain wanting for justice that comes out of the journey of this relationship between teacher and student, and yet we are not quite sure what this justice should look like. For me, I had to take a close look at my own relationship with success and failure. I had to examine some of those characters who have existed in my own life (and I think we would all have at least one). I had to deal with those feelings of not quite living up to some measure of success (whatever that might be interpreted as), and also learning how to react to failure. I had to deal with anger as I watched this film, anger over the truth that for however hard we try, there always seems to be someone who is better than you at nearly everything we do. And learning where this leads to defeat and where this leads to motivation to try harder is a tough line to draw, especially when it tends to come with so much personal baggage.\nAnd ultimately it brings up questions about what matters in this world, and why it matters. To what end do our achievements bring worth, and what does it mean to be remembered (and what does it mean to recognize that we will not be remembered, certainly not beyond the immediate relationships we impact in the few years that we have on this earth).\nThis film is about much more than music. I am not sure how accurately it describes the cutthroat nature of the competitive music scene. But in my own limited experience I would say it likely comes somewhere i the vicinity, and is likely similar as well to what comes out of the professional culinary world as well (of which I observed through my wife's career). This world, careers, relationships, can be cruel things to navigate and to balance. And yet there remains something powerfully important about how we navigate these things, not just in terms of our happiness, but in how we perhaps feed in to and inspire others in their own successes and failures.",

No, Whiplash is not a real film, not yet - what is really worrying for me is how it managed to fool the Academy.",

Fletcher's jazz band is the pinnacle of achievement for any ambitious student. But Andrew soon finds out that Fletcher, played with glorious fire and brimstone by character actor J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man; Juno), is an uncompromising, impossible to satisfy task master of the highest order. His training crosses the line into physical and emotional abuse, and Andrew finds himself all the more eager to please - and best - his mentor. \n\nSimmons is pure adrenaline giving a performance that has already won him multiple awards and most likely the Oscar next month. He comes on like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, unrepentant, uncompromising, and unforgiving of even the slightest infraction. Teller, a young actor navigating his way through YA material like the Divergent series and soon to play Mr. Fantastic in the Fantastic Four reboot, gets the role of his life here. \n\nThe finale of this film is so powerful it will have viewers on their feet when the two leads faceoff on stage. Will Fletcher finally crush Andrew's dreams forever and drive him away from music, or will Andrew step up and shatter his tormentor's hateful cynicism. \n\nWhiplash has received 5 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It opens to today in Charleston. It's an unmissable experience.",

And that's just describing it, 'Whiplash' is as ferocious as the title suggests. Taken from a piece of music played in the film it follows 'Andrew' (Miles Teller) a newbie at America's most prestige music school - and his meeting with controversial and testing instructor 'Terence Fletcher' (J.K Simmons).\n\n'Whiplash' is a film I missed when it initially released in cinemas because it wasn't playing where I am. Well for one day it was on and I took my chance. \n\nI don't know anything at all about the world of big band music, or how they get there. So my view on its accuracy is non-existent. But what I do know is 'Whiplash' is a damn fine movie. The film builds up and becomes more and more frantic the further 'Andrew' gets to his dream - and further from himself (or at least towards his more 'primal' self). \n\nThere's a brief relationship which seems a little of place given how well defined everything else is. 'Andrew' starts off meek and timid never shown more evident then the first time he meets 'Nicole' (Melissa Benoist) and his last meeting. It appears that the aggressive technique works on Andrew. His idea that people need to be pushed further than they're expected to be is an interesting one. 'J.K Simmons' does a fantastic job and I can see the reason for his accolades. He really showcases his character complete indifference to those around him - his only intention being to find the greatest musicians.\n\nIt's paced to the beat of a drums tarting with a solid tempo and raising it along with Andrews growing want and need. Equally 'Miles Teller' matches 'J.K Simmons'. Their essentially hate hate relationship only works so well because of each actors commitment - my favourite scene between the two being a shouting match where you can finally see that 'Andrew' is at his level.\n\nFull of award winning performances and excellent pacing. There isn't really much if anything to fault. The relationship between slightly psychotic teacher 'Fletcher' and newcomer 'Andrew' is one of the most interesting Iv'e seen on-screen. The tempo constantly raises as the stakes and hunger of 'Andrew do. It shows the lengths someone will go to for the success they crave. Sabotaging their own happiness mentally and physically - destroying relationships for a persons approval who has the key what they want. (and that goes for both)",

Young drumming student at a prestigious Jazz school gets a chance at the big time when his talent catches the eye of the schools most discerning instructor. Um, that's it. Is Whiplash an inspirational tale of how persistence and hard work leads to greatness? Far from it. Writer/director Damien Chazelle expanded on a dark chapter from his youth, and spun Whiplash into a sepia-drenched, single-minded thriller dealing with obsession, betrayal, and an instructor whose methods would've raised the eyebrows of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. In math terms, Whiplash's delivery can be described at y=x; it's an austere and cynical exercise in relentless tension buildup that keeps petty distractions like character development and continuity to an as-needed basis. Whiplash is simplicity personified, augmented with brilliant editing and a honed script that'll suck you in and spit you out in a way few films do these days.",

The movie is about an inspiring drummer who tries his utmost to impress the top instructor in his school. After showing him his determination and dedication to his art, he gets promoted to be the head drummer in his orchestra but the teachers ruthless methods and constant search for perfection, takes his toll. The movie is original and entertaining from beginning to end. The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it's J.K. Simmons nasty methods that impressed me. The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short, for some unknown reason but it's very entertaining and I'm glad that it got the recognition that it deserved. If your not into drumming or jazz music, the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis is the first major film from Damien Chazelle who also wrote the strange Grand Piano starring Elijah Wood. With such a small budget, he really did get the most out of actors which got J.K. Simmons an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe for Best Supporting role. That just proves that audiences always like a good baddie! Anyway, Miles Teller who also starred in Divergent, 21 and Over and Rabbit Hole, hasn't done to bad since he came on the big screen 2010 and he has a major role as Mr. Fantastic in the new Fantastic Four franchise. J.K. Simmons has starred in over 100 movies but he's mostly known for playing J. Jonah Jameson in the Spiderman movies. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I hope that more people will get to watch it, now that it's on DVD.\n\nBudget: $3million\nWorldwide Gross: $14million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an inspiring drummer who gets pushed to the limit by his ruthless teacher. 8/10",

            "content": "Definitely one of my favorite nor an Oscar contender this year. Not just a musical film but also one of the best psychological films I've seen for awhile. I'm a musician myself and I can relate to it. Somebody just shaken me up to watch this film and I thought to myself, this is just another musical film that has good cinematography and all kinds of musical stuffs. But I've proven myself wrong. It is one of those films that is beautifully written, has wonderful performances, and sometimes it is a nail biter when tension heats up. Every musical performance, every live performance, the sound of those jazz music, it is just dazzling to watch. J.K Simmons as Terence Fletcher, I mean, my God, how good this guy is. He performs as a musical instructor and he is such a bad ass with it. I mean he reminds me of my teacher before with that kind of attitude. He is such a perfectionist that he wants his tempo and sound satisfying. And dude, Miles Teller as Neyman, this guy nails every performance. Like he feels for his character, the need and the sacrifice of being a great musician. I saw him act and to tell you honestly, he was good in that film \"The Spectacular Now\" thus he is great in this film. This film surprised a lot of critics. You never saw it coming from a director and screenwriter who is just starting to shine. Remember Damien Chazelle everybody. Hope to see more from him. This is one of those films that has brilliant performances, acting wise it is just beyond expectations. Definitely a must watch. Perfect 5 stars!",

Which is quite obviously the point of the movie, Throughout the movie it is made apparent how the art  of jazz has taken a back seat in a world dominated by sports. You can really see the love and care the director, Damien Chazelle, has for the art of jazz. From the shot angles focusing of the instruments to the dull lighting of the picture it made you really focus on the music and the intensity of the performances of miles teller and J.K. Simmons. I loved how the instruments were almost characters themselves. That's not to take away from how good both teller and Simmons were. From the way Simmons could go from the relaxed teacher to the fury filled eye demon he seemed to be. As the picture progressed we learn why he has to be so seemingly cruel, and we see that he is not cruel but just a man who is holding on to the art of jazz and refuses to let it die. It is a gutsy call to action to not accept mediocrity, but to fight for what we love and to fulfill our full potential. Whiplash seems like a simple jazz movie, but is actually one of the most important and really one of the best movies of a year filled with greats but one of the greatest ever and it is the best movie i have ever seen.",

            "content": "Whiplash is true to its title. It throws you around with impunity, yet Chazelle exerts tight, exacting control over his increasingly feverish and often weirdly comic melodrama. Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, Whiplash is a brilliant sophomore effort from director Damien Chazelle and a riveting vehicle for stars J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller. If you can appreciate the sight of two totally dialed-in performers simmering until they boil over, that's enough. Whiplash rises on the strengths of a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance from J.K. Simmons and a great soundtrack to complement it, turning what could have been a rather bland story of a determined drummer into something a little more memorable. In a stunning performance, Teller resists the impulse to sugarcoat Andrew's egocentricity. Simmons is equally impressive, lending Fletcher just enough humanity to render his monstrousness all the more shocking. This is a muscular and accomplished work of kinetic cinema built around two tremendous acting performances, and it's really about teaching and obsession and the complicated question of how to nurture excellence and where the nebulous boundary lies between mentorship and abuse. Sum up the plot and it sounds interminable. Watch the film and it will spit you out elated, exhausted and cheering for an encore.\n\nVERDICT: \"Instant Classic\" - [Positively Acclaimed Reaction] Usually I give this rating to a movie that I believe is absolutely outstanding and has little to no flaws in it. Audiences, who haven't seen this film, must see it right now! (Films that are rated 4.5 or 5 stars)",

            "content": "No one ever said achieving greatness beyond what everyone expects and being immortalized for all time as a bonafide legend would be easy. It has never been an easy path and it is usually riddled with pain, suffering, anguish and personal loss along with potentially losing the love of your profession in the process. The mentor/student relationship has been done before but it reaches an all new level of barbarity and shocking intensity with Whiplash. It throws everything about that tired genre out the window, exploding it beyond recognition while swearing gross obscenities and slurs at it. To say it will leave you breathless is a huge understatement, but it also might make you think about your own potential and how one would reach their own pillar of greatness. That is hopefully without the specific teachings of Terence Fletcher hurling objects and cruel insults at them.\nAndrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is a very gifted, young jazz drummer who wants to be seen and respected as one of the greats, willing to do anything to get there. He is enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory in New York City, the best music school in the country. Andrew trains endlessly to get noticed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a well-known conductor at Shaffer who is looking for a new drummer alternate. Andrew seemingly gets in the good graces of Fletcher and is thought to be liked by him. But that quickly fades away as its revealed that Fletcher is a cruel, sadistic, manipulative teacher who stops at nothing to bring out the best in his students. While he is brilliant and has much standing when it comes to music, he becomes a bitter enemy to Andrew as they butt heads and Andrew lays his claim to be the prominent drummer at Shaffer no matter what Fletcher thinks. Andre gets pushed to the brink of his own sanity and never rests until he gains the respect of Fletcher and achieves the position as one of the greats.\nFor all the buzz Simmons has received for his performance, it was a long time coming to finally see him on screen. The final product was even better that I ever anticipated and it's truly one of the best performances of the entire year. Simmons basically owns the entire movie and never lets up. He is a literal force of nature, a swirling typhoon of rage; anger and passion that will envelop anyone who dares to challenge him or threatens anyone who would sabotage his band. Never have I seen an actor so magnetic and fervent in the way that Simmons does it. This was basically made for him and I could never envision anyone playing this role or even coming close to his level of intensity. \nHe has made a career as a brilliant character actor for decades, but never being the star. He is known for being a scene stealer, whether it's a brutal neo Nazi Vernon Schillinger in Oz or the boisterous, loud mouth publisher of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man trilogy. With his charisma, biting sense of humor and powerful emotive abilities, he rightfully steals many of the scenes in Whiplash. Simmons always excels in any role he is put in and lays claim that he has been unnoticed by many of the populace for too long. With this one role, he quickly rises from being that guy who was in that thing to a sure fire Oscar contender. \nWith so many memorable films this year, Terence Fletcher stands out as something bigger and eventually will become more iconic. His look, style and general way of doing things is menacing that is reminiscent of a super villain. Clad in black from head to toe with a chrome dome and an expression on his face that could shatter glass, he has a look that doesn't want to be messed with. But the way that he is presented shows that he isn't outright trying to be an asshole just for the sake of being one and has many layers beneath him that show a method to his twisted madness. He is a very hateful guy who breeds contempt but at the same time, you can't help but somewhat understand him and realize that a teacher who wants to bring out the best has a point. \nEven if it's a rather physically and mentally damaging way of going around it that no normal teacher would use. He is a very complex character that begs to be broken down where you are curious to his upbringing that would cause him to be such a brutal teacher of music. But the best characters don't need a reason or a backstory to reveal why they do certain things which makes him all the more engaging and magnetic. You are immediately drawn to him because there is so much you don't know about him but to reveal anymore would damage the mammoth mystique that was previously built up. At times he is like a Bond villain who controls all that he sees and hears and has his students used as mere pawns in his manipulative game. Fletcher uses whatever you give him to his advantage and breaks you down mentally with that information. \nThe way he masterminds his devious plans is downright brilliant where you can't help but marvel at how it went about. I cannot recall a more sick and twisted scholastic professional since Paul Gleason's Richard Vernon from The Breakfast Club. Teller continues to show that he is a great dramatic actor with another stand out role. He brings the needed vulnerability to make Andrew human and relatable but not necessarily someone we root for initially. Andrew screws up a lot which gains a few enemies at Shaffer and the acidic scorn of Fletcher which makes his plight against him all the more complex. If Andrew would have done a few things differently, it may have been an entirely different movie but then again maybe not. Teller goes face to face and toe to toe with Simmons every step of the way to show that he belongs in the band where they bring out the best in each other. \nTheir chemistry together is red hot and bristles with tension every time they are on screen together. You wait for something ugly to happen and a potential bomb to blow up, and it doesn't disappoint as the resulting blast is bigger than one expects. It's a great showing of a talented young upstart and a well-respected veteran going off of each other and literally off of each other as they come to some serious blows. It was as much as Simmons making his presence known in a star making performance after so many years as it was Teller staking claim as one of the best young actors today and one to look out for in the future. Teller has already shown his immense talent playing tortured characters in The Spectacular Now and the under seen and underrated Rabbit Hole. \nBut he steps up in every way with Whiplash showing immense character development with an intense transformation. You can see him breaking down mentally as well as physically as the movie goes on where Teller shows his impeccable acting and emotive skills by hardly saying anything and lets his body do the talking. The pain and anguish he goes through is even more powerful by the tired and exasperated look on his face that easily speaks volumes. He eventually becomes just as brutally honest as Fletcher to his family, girlfriend Nicole (Melissa Benoist) and fellow students, berating them for not understanding the hard work that comes when being a jazz drummer at an elite school. The way that Teller tells people off doesn't come off as condescending but truthful in many ways and has a natural honesty that comes off the screen. He slowly comes into his own not only as a musician but as a man who quickly takes charge when he needs too and doesn't take a no for an answer. Seeing two freight trains in Simmons and Teller go 200 mph at each other makes for excellent viewing and one of the best 1-2 punches of the entire year.\nDamien Chazelle really came out of nowhere with his sophomore feature and immediately places him on the list for the most promising directors and screen writers. He has received much acclaim from his first film, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench which I have yet to find anywhere on any streaming site. Its one of the best sophomore films in a long while and one that quickly ignited the cinematic landscape. It's a great mix of humorous verbal barbs, musical performances, napalm like rage with a powerful message of following ones dreams. Chazelle crafts an all too real world of a cut throat music school where only the best of the best need apply and only the strong survive. \nIt's not a portrayal of all elite schools but it could for many professions where the slightest, most insignificant thing that you would never notice would set off the wrong person who holds your future in the palm of their hand. Since it never really lets up, the pacing is perfectly executed where the tension and the situations are ramped up every time. Andrew goes through more pain and Fletcher gets more vindictive as the movie goes on and you're left hanging on the edge of your seat. Chazelle has a very unrelenting style that doesn't let up and grabs you by the collar in so many ways. If you're not being attacked by Fletcher with a string of gross insults, you're engrossed by the gorgeous music and the amazing accompaniment in the background. \nThe music played was on point, sounding spectacular every time even if someone was off key or not in Fletchers time. Everything went so well with one another and much like a band masterminded by Fletcher, it never felt like it was incomplete, rushing or dragging. There were some amazing sequences that were increasingly intense. One scene half way in particular had me yelling obscenities, with my arms thrown up in the air and my mouth aghast to what I had just seen. It's completely visceral and shocking that goes really well with the all-around chaos of the film. The tryouts were brutal as well as Andrews very first day in Fletchers class that will leave you awe struck. \nAndrews practice sessions were like seeing a man literally torture himself, where he bleeds, sweats and generally puts his sanity on the line to impress Fletcher enough to place him in the band as lead drummer. Of course the editing is what makes Whiplash work so impeccably well and without it would not be as lauded as it is. The editing by Tom Cross was absolutely fantastic and mesmerizing. The abrupt and quick cuts made it flow so much easier. It was almost like watching a music video at times as the beat of the music timed with the editing to make a collage of imagery and sound. You see every bit of the band from every corner when they play and the quick cuts allows you to swiftly take it all in with one swoop. The cinematography by Sharone Meir was also excellent and showed the solitude that would follow Andrew. \nFor much of the film, he finds himself enclosed within his own prison of being the best and the camera shows that very well. It presented Fletcher as the ultimate head honcho like a god some of the time and it built up their confrontations beautifully. When Fletcher is berating Andrew and the camera gets up close, it feels like a heavy weight fight. I also loved the sound and how it was included. When the other players in the band prepare, you hear all the sheet music being flipped through, instruments being handled and calibrated to their own specific likings to make a gorgeous cornucopia of sound. The exciting and thrilling climax uses all of these elements to create one of the best sequences in a long while. As for the ending, it was brilliant in so many ways that perfectly extenuates all that was preceded before it. There was so much to go over and dive into that it made for excellent viewing. \nThe script was full of dark humor as well as some bitter hidden truths to being seen and respected as one of the greatest in ones respected field. There were some of the funniest and cruelest verbal takedowns that I've heard in a long while and the relationship that Fletcher had with his students reminded me of R. Lee Ermey's Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, where he also took no prisoners, spewing hilarious vitriol at his soldiers and also saw fit that his men were the best of the best. \nWhile it would have been easy to paint Fletcher as an outright evil villain and to see him that way, that's not how he was presented. Throughout the film he shows some type of compassion for his students and shows that he cares to guide them to greatness. But at the same time doesn't apologize for his actions which are realistically how much of the world works now. It also doesn't paint Andrew as a completely sympathetic character as he knew somewhat what he was getting into and the mistakes that got Fletcher mad at him were his fault. The dichotomy shown has two characters presented one way but shown the opposite later on to create a complex study of both of them.\nFletcher makes an excellent point saying that \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.\" People become complacent when they are told that what they are doing is only good enough and not terrible or amazing. There can be no improvement if one is simply told that it's good for now. While I don't necessarily agree with all his methods, every teacher should aspire to push their students beyond their limits and make them realize that every little thing counts. In an arena as immaculate as jazz band where everything must be perfect, it shouldn't be out of line to only accept greatness. The legends achieve that status by putting up with everything thrown at them when they think of quitting the most and the future looks as bleak as ever. Whether it includes slaps in the face, thrown chairs and homophobic slurs is anyone's guess. \nYou'd be hard-pressed to find another film like Whiplash and another character like Terence Fletcher. Whether you hate him or love him, he leaves an impact and will have you thinking if you have what it takes to put up with anything and everything to be great. Chazelle lays his own claim for greatness with his only second film, his first hardly seen but may garner some more attention now. Unapologetic, intense and bludgeoning, it's the ultimate portrayal of the mentor/student relationship but only way more sick and twisted. Whiplash isn't just the title of the film and one of the songs that Fletcher gets the band to play, but it's also the effect you have when you're done watching the film. It comes out of nowhere to crash right into you, shocking you into submission and leaving you breathless to where you hardly know what hit you and you don't even have any words to what just happened. It's hard to find another film from last year to have as stunning and meaningful an impact where you still think about it days later. Five thrown chairs out of five.",

One knock I have on the film is the pretentious cinematography. It was annoying to see the many avant guard style close ups, I was not impressed; I was embarrassed. It was as if the DP and Director was trying to prove a point. Shots such as those have been overused in cinema and I did not approve of their constant placement throughout the film. That being said, they were applause worthy during the performance sequences. All in all, this film is a must see simply because it creates its own world in which perfectionism plays a key role\u00e2?? maybe by watching this picture you'll take a vacation.",

Whilst I was fixated by 'Birdman' and found 'Boyhood' a generally entertaining watch, 'Whiplash' is by far the most riveting and sensational drama I have viewed from 2014. J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. His performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement. The final drum solo ends the film on a high note and keep its audience lingering on the edge of their seats, it is powerful, it is intense, it is a near-masterpiece!",

He gives a Heath Ledger level performance and completely earned his Oscar. Miles Teller gave a perfect performance and was an inspirational lead in an inspirational movie. Next up is directing. Damien Chazelle's direction and writing is flawless to say the least. The smart overhead shots of instruments really show that the actors know how to play them.

He wants to be the best in the world, he wants to be remembered as a legend, and along comes J.K. Simmons playing Terence Fletcher who proves here that he is so deserving of an Oscar, I'm so happy he won the award, because this performance is a hit out of the ball park.  Teller and Simmons play off of each other so well that every encounter you have no idea how it's going to go down.  Will Neyman break, will Fletcher break?  Are their limits to greatness?  At what cost can we aspire to be great?  This isn't a film about people taking it easy to make their dreams come true and someone just happens to come along and tell them they're cool and give them a bunch of money.  This is a film about practice, about hard work, about sacrifice, about blood, and about what it takes to become the stuff of legend.

This film had me on the edge of my seat and the way how it's directed gives the film great intensity. The film flew by and I can't believe it's almost 2 hours long. The only thing that stopped me giving the film 5/5 was that I thought the film ended a bit too soon for my liking. It felt like the story was incomplete, hopefully a sequel will be made, every other film seems to get a sequel nowadays!",

The intensity of the film raises as it progresses, and the movie's finale is the most breathtaking and satisfying finale I have ever seen. Whiplash is a very special movie, although it may have some aspects that can be related to earlier films. Not enough words can be said in this review to truly explain my love for the movie, I think everyone should see it, without question. 5 out of 5.",

The story revolves around Andrew Neyman a young jazz drummer who obviously has talent.  He is enrolled at Schafrer Music School one of the top schools in the country for music.  While there he meets a stern, vulgar, hard nosed teacher who demands absolute perfection.  J.K Simmons plays the teacher Terence Fletcher who has methods that probably aren't acceptable at most schools, though it seems somewhat ok at this prestigous school.  The acting is unbelieveable and Simmons steals the show.  He is spot on and believable in his acting.  The guy kills it with his emotion.  Teller displays good acting chops also.  One thing must be said...the drumming scenes display an intense realism, and the emotional levels of some of the drumming scenes are top notch.  The finale scene is gripping and it reaches a gratifying yet stunning level.  The relationship between teacher and student is the only thing that matters in this movie and it more than delivers.  A must see do to the acting, story, and realism displayed in the film.",

            "content": "Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He has been playing drums from a young age and aspires to become one of the greats like Buddy Rich. Famed conductor Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) walks in on Andrew practising in the music room late one night and eventually invites him into his studio band as the alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner (Nate Lang). Fletcher is abusive toward his students, mocking and insulting them; when the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece \"Whiplash\" and Andrew struggles to keep his tempo, Fletcher hurls a chair at him, slaps him, and otherwise humiliates him in front of the class. At a local jazz competition, Andrew accidentally misplaces Carl's sheet music; as Carl cannot play without it, Andrew steps in informing Fletcher that he can perform \"Whiplash\" from memory. Fletcher promotes him to core drummer. Soon after, Fletcher recruits Ryan Connolly (Austin Stowell), the core drummer from Andrew's former lower-level class. Ryan is clearly a worse drummer, but Fletcher promotes him to core almost immediately, infuriating Andrew. Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew practices until his hands bleed and breaks up with his girlfriend Nicole (Melissa Benoist), believing she will distract him in his mission to become one of the greatest drummers in the world... \n\n\"Whiplash\" premiered in competition in the US Dramatic Category at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 16, 2014, as the festival's opening film. Sony Pictures Worldwide acquired the international distribution rights. At the 87th Academy Awards, Whiplash won Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Supporting Actor for Simmons, and was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. The screenplay for this film was featured in the 2012 Blacklist; a list of the \"most liked\" unmade scripts of the year. Director Damien Chazelle gives us a intense and inspiring piece of film diving into the world of wanting to achieve musical greatness and its consequences. The movie has a build up almost like a sports movie and the struggle for perfection, the wish for recognition by the antagonist and the love for the instrument. The rhythm, the cinematography and the great performances creates something unique that will stay with you in mind and heart. Miles Teller gives a great performance even if he feels a bit too dazed and zombielike at times while J. K. Simmons is truly an A grade asshole in his role as Fletcher. I believe in pushing people into greatness, but there\u00b4s different ways of doing that, and Fletcher\u00b4s way is not fully the way in my opinion. He is unlikeable, but he forces the film and the storyline forward and you can\u00b4t help wanting to know if he gets what he deserves in the end. But, he is at the same time that force yelling at you when you\u00b4re not good enough and taking you to new heights. The movie puts forward the question what is great and what is just good enough. It\u00b4s in the eye, or in this case the ear, of the beholder. I love how intense Chazelle has worked with both Teller and Simmons to make the story believable music scene wise. Just the closeups of the drums are pure perfection. Teller is ferocious on the drums and I got really inspired to sit myself behind a drum kit to live out my long time dream of being a drummer. Melissa Benoist is lovely as Nicole, but she got maybe a bit too little screen time in my opinion. My only real critique was the sometimes haphazard editing at times that I felt disrupted the balance and flow. \"Whiplash\" is nevertheless a fine piece of film.",

Both protagoaist's OCD and perfectionism come across very strongly in this film.  Some steam is lost after the \"fight\", and the last act is a bit contrived.  All in all, a good film that shouldn't be put on the level of a Birdman or Grand Budapest Hotel from the same cinematic year, but is definitely worth seeing.\n\nGrade = 7.5/10",

            "content": "\"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than \"good job\"\" JK Simmons Oscar winning Fletcher tells aspiring drummer Andrew, and it's an opinion which sums up his character better than any other.  This is not the pat-you-on-the-back, \"I'm so proud of you\" type of mentor you get in your usual rookie rises to the top film.  This is a man who truly believes that in order to achieve your best, you can never be content.  In his search for the next big thing, Fletcher believes that praise is great if you want to make a musician worthy of a Starbuck's jazz CD, but to get the best requires blood, sweat, tears, and a well timed chair (or cymbal) thrown across the room at anybody who may be stopping your band from achieving perfection.\n  Whiplash introduces us to Andrew- an aspiring young drummer at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory in New York who gets noticed by Professor Fletcher, the school's most respected mentor and leader of the Studio Band- Shaffer's top jazz ensemble. Andrew comes into the film as a loner with a fierce desire to succeed where his writer-turned-high-school-English-teaching father did not.  Fletcher spots a potential prodigy, or \"the next Charlie Parker\", as he puts it, and refuses to let him settle for anything less than being the best.\n  Writer and Director Damien Chazelle seems to have taken Fletcher's mantra of constant improvement to heart, taking his 2013 short film of the same name and doing far more than just upping the run time.  It's a testament to the quality of the story, the acting, and the direction that the film doesn't feel stretched.  Fletcher remarks at one point that a year can make a huge difference when it comes to a performer's output, and this is certainly apparent in Chazelle's direction here.  His camerawork is sometimes frenetic- music sheets flashing across bright lights and bandstand tunes; sometimes slow- beads of sweat bouncing off cymbals and blood filling an ice bucket.  At other times he's content to sit back and let the drama speak for itself.  Like any good musician he knows when to slow down, when to speed up, when to go all out, and when to fade into the background and let other instruments come to the fore.  The fact that the film won both the Grand Jury prize and the Audience Award at Sundance 2014 (a feat all the more impressive as it's only Chazelle second full-length feature), should be enough to let you know that you are in for something special.  One hopes that Chazelle didn't bleed quite as much as Andrew did in order to get the finished product, though. \n  The relationship between the two main characters is what makes Whiplash tick, and makes the run time fly by, in spite of the fact that most of scenes are low-lit interiors.  Andrew's conflicting love/embarrassment of his father is mirrored perfectly in the hate/admiration he holds for his new teacher.  It's easy to see where both Andrew's hate and admiration for Fletcher come from- every time Simmons is on screen he is both captivating and terrifying.  He sweeps into the room and everything goes quiet until he says otherwise.  In fact, everyone is so scared of him, it becomes apparent that Fletcher's interest in Andrew comes not just from his musical ability, but from his ability to take a licking and keep on ticking.\n  JK Simmons is of course the star of the show.  As the man most famous for yelling \"PARKER!\" in Sam Raimi's Spiderman movies, you may be forgiven for expecting \"J Jonah Jameson Goes to Music School.\"  However, while Simmons in Spiderman played an enjoyable caricature of the angry boss, the Simmons we see in Whiplash takes what undoubtedly the meatiest role of his career and shakes the opportunity firmly by both shoulders.  A bully who fires out hurtful (and hilarious) zingers left and right, Fletcher is not so much a villain as a formidable, believable adversary.  A lot of times in the past, though, acting Oscar nominations have been given to great turns in mediocre films (see Blue Jasmine, Birdman).  This is not the case with Whiplash- though Simmons may be the best part of it, this film is the exceptional sum of exceptional parts.\n  Teller faces the unenviable task of both having to act alongside what is clearly an Oscar-worthy performance as well as being the brunt of most of Fletcher's on-screen aggression.  The fact that Teller made it to the end of production shows that he must be possessed of the same determination as his character- that's real sweat and real blood you see pouring off Andrew in the film.  The time Teller put into his drum training is clearly evident on screen too, and as Andrew's obsession with being the best takes him to the brink of a nervous breakdown, we watch the relationship (perhaps \"chess game\" is closer to the truth) between teacher and student from the edge of our seats.  The tension in Whiplash comes from waiting to see if Andrew will get it right, and what Fletcher's reaction will be if he doesn't.\n  Indeed Chazelle makes the interesting choice of making Andrew hard to like for most of the film's running time- an angry young perfectionist who throws away those who can't do anything for him and looks down on those with less talent- and one of the reasons that the movie still works is in emphasising the emotionally-scarring effects that family members and teachers can have on a young impressionable mind.  Andrew is hit repeatedly, but like Jake La Motta in Raging Bull he refuses to go down, and for this alone his character retains our admiration.  Chazelle makes clear the reasons for Andrew's desire for approval in his absentee mother, his exceptionally normal father, and in an interesting dinner scene, where his musically illiterate family downplay Andrew's spectacular achievements to heap praise on his quarterback cousin.  \n  JK Simmons actually sustained two cracked ribs in one of the film's more physical scenes, and it's not surprising, as palpable tension drips from every frame.  By the finale- which can only be described as a fierce battle of wills- the tension is so high you may well be as sweaty as Andrew after one of Fletcher's practices.   Justin Herwitz' score deserves all the praise that will undoubtedly be heaped upon it- though, if you're anything like me, you may find yourself unable to enjoy it fully because you're sitting ready to dodge a flying chair form Fletcher that could come at any moment.",

A lot of us underdogs do not get to realize our dreams, but Whiplash is the story of our collective blood, sweat and tears being reincarnated into one drummer who suffers and sacrifices, but then perseveres and finally stands alone- victorious.\nAt the Shaffer Conservatory in New York- it begins. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is alone setting the tempo of practice making perfect, sweat dripping music playing. Suddenly a man walks in on him practicing, \"Why did you stop playing?\" the man said. Andrew is quick to pick up his sticks but as soon as he picks his head up the man is gone, only returning briefly for his forgotten jacket.\nIn that moment, Andrew just gained the attention of Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) the maestro of the school's and possibly one of the country's greatest concert bands. Soon after, Fletcher gives Andrew a shot in his band.\nWhat ensues afterwards is a struggle that almost anyone can relate to, but Andrew has a legitimate shot at realizing his dreams. He suffers for it and sacrifices a lot for this opportunity. Even the smallest mistake could set Fletcher off at any given moment, and his anger (or rather his passion) knows no bounds. \nThe road to success can be a rocky one, but it takes a bold spirit and an undeniable hunger to persevere, and not only does Andrew has that hunger, that drive, but he's holding up the middle finger and listening to cool jazz as he does it.",

Simmons's master and slave tango. In fact, one of my problems is that Teller didn't get any Best Actor nods for his utterly grotesque, quietly smoldering intensity as a self-torturing artist while Simmons swept the Best Supporting category just for, I suspect, the flashier role. Simmons's acceptance speeches were all class acts, but I found the character to be a flat stereotype of the tyrannical maestro with obvious \"pieces of sugar,\" begetting an average performance with only a handful of notes - well-conducted notes in terms of literal conducting form - but still only a handful nonetheless.\n\nIt's unclear whether Terence Fletcher is a revenge-driven bully or a no-nonsense educator who truly believes in his prodigies and elicits the best out of them. It's too easy to say he can be both. He never seems to doubt his extreme methods, covering up his former prodigy's suicide as a car accident and mourning more for the loss of beautiful music than regret at pushing a student to his death. Fletcher starts off as the kind of unsentimental idealist that makes for an interesting character, but the revenge plot is too inorganic and just plain evil, and the chrome-domed, tight-black-t-shirt uniform (while well-worn) makes him too freakily reminiscent of that douchey designer played by Miguel Ferrer on \"Will & Grace\" who also liked to make people jump through hoops for his own amusement. Did Fletcher suffer some kind of trauma in his past to become the way he is, or did he also endure and conquer a similar drill sergeant music teacher?\n\nAnd while I'm not a drummer, I like to think of myself as a musician with good rhythm, but I didn't find the tempo exercises to be that clear. WAS Andrew rushing or dragging? I'm still unsure. Furthermore, was Andrew's last drum solo a fuck-you to Fletcher, or was he trying to gain his respect? Are we to admire Andrew's crazed tenacity or feel sorry for his Stockholm Syndrome? Once again, it's too easy to answer C) All of the above. If there were at least one last shot of Andrew's father outside the door looking lost and hopeless, maybe I'd buy the latter. Fletcher's gestures of approval seem to indicate a rapport building, but isn't the whole point of Fletcher's pedagogy to never say \"good job\"? Andrew ought to never measure up in Fletcher's eyes, but we don't get to see what happens after the movie ends, so it's too cooked of an ending.\n\nI do have one other compliment for Melissa Benoist who plays Andrew's #WCW.  Her girl-next-door affability lights up the screen.",

I liked how the ending was kind of ambiguous, and how psychologically it was pretty complicated. That said, I didn't get into the music scenes, which is because I'm ignorant, it's not the movies fault.

Simmons) is abusive, and insulting to his students and pushes his students to the edge in playing and getting the right notes to his standards. Andrew is pushed to the limit that will have him focus on the music notes and the pitch at all times, even if it's avoiding his personal life. \n\nDirector Damien Chazelle managed to keep this drama piece entertaining, and jaw dropping. Chazelle kept the movie unsettling at times, and raises the anxiety and the pressure Andrew has to go through in order to achieve his goals. There is a moment when Andrew is drumming until his hands are bloodied. Even during a scene, Andrew was running late and rushes to the competition and getting in a car accident. He runs out of a totaled car and rush to the event. \n\nMiles Teller gave a great performance, and so far one of his best roles. J.K. Simmons also gave a highlight to his role as Fletcher. Simmons played a great abusive instructor and is by far sinister with his character.  Whiplash is a good drama film that is gripping, intense, and shining through the two main talents.",

Though it was a necessary plot device to really heighten the stakes, its repercussions were just a little bit softened (physical effects only). It's the only gimme in the film, so as an audience member I will do my part and give it to ya (especially because the other 95% of the film is virtually and technically perfect).",

The portrayal of the musicians in a music school is quite good, not showing a music collage in the way a lot of films do. There are egos in this film, there are insecurities, and there are people who are taking music so seriously, that they're no longer really enjoying it. \nWhilst some of the movie is a little over the top, it does represent the seriousness of obsession and phycological abuse. However, whilst the film sets up a clear hero and villain, the film also develops these characters well, showing flaws in both but redeeming features in both, even some respect between the two. \nMiles Teller is great as the young, determined and often very egocentric drummer who aims to be the best, at all cost. Here, he shows much more range than many of his other roles, as this film has depth that others such as Divergence does not. \nAcademy award winner J.K Simmons is clearly deserving of his statue, electrifying every scene he's in. He doesn't over play the role, despite the violent nature of it, avoiding the pitfalls of becoming a one note yelling machine. His scene in a bar towards the end of the film, where his character discusses his motives, shows great experience and adds further depth to his character.\nThe music is fantastic. The title song is really funky and features great melodic lines. And if you're not humming Caravan for hours after the film, well, J.K Simmons should come and yell at you!",

Dark. Uncomfortable. Nauseating. Thrilling. Heart-breaking. Triumphant. And lastly, perhaps most importantly, ambiguous as all hell.\nThe film raises the not-so-comforting point that some greatness, despite its ability to bring joy and inspiration to its beholders, spawns from some place of darkness, unjustness, and suffering. While motherly figures the world over will understandably be turned off by the movie's focus on an abused youth in his quest for existential fulfillment, its technical craftsmanship has reminded me why I love music, cinema, and the gorgeous offspring that is their collaboration. \nThe vibrant visuals and kinetic editing fetishize the world of artistic commitment, showcasing the beauty of the instruments and their wielders' discipline while unleashing a music student's most deep-seeded nightmares on screen.\nI am still buzzed off this picture, which has itself reinvigorated me as an artist, and can't wait to watch it again.\n*NOTE TO TEACHERS: this movie will either rub you the wrong way or line up entirely with your own artistic beliefs. in any case, I will use this post as a platform to represent the demographic I have just recently left, and relay the following message:\nthere's a difference between pushing your pupils and being a dick. so please, in the name of all things educational, no matter how far you feel you have to push those who are learning the ways of the universe from your unique perspective,\nDON'T BE A DICK.",

            "content": "Whiplash is the story Andrew Neiman an aspiring Jazz drummer who studies at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in new York who dream to become one of the greatest jazz players to the likes of Buddy Rich. During his experiences at the conservatory Andrew faces the harsh and abusive behavior of Conductor Terrence Fletcher a perfectionist in his craft who expects nothing but the best from his students. It\u00e2??s a story that\u00e2??s filled with so much tension, inspiration and harsh realities of life. This has to be JK. Simmons best performance in his career as he dives deep into the psychological mindset of this peculiar character. Terrence is what would be considered the main villain of the film dressed in all black from top to bottom who brings an uncomfortable demeanor presence into the room when he comes in. He\u00e2??s a like a vampire rather disappearing and reappearing wherever he goes and it always manages to catch you off guard. Terrence craves perfection, he needs it. But the way he goes about on obtain it from his students can start off as a simple correction by saying \u00e2??That\u00e2??s not my tempo\u00e2??. But after the 2nd and 3rd mistake he does not hesitate to verbally insult your race and gender orientation. He does not hesitate in physical harm by throwing a chair at Andrew or slapping him in front of the whole class humiliating him for not telling the difference of whether he was \u00e2??rushing or dragging\u00e2?? in his performance. The way these scenes are performed makes them disturbing and almost unwatchable. Clearly a man capable of such things is nothing short of an asshole right? But yet I can\u00e2??t really say I hate Fletcher. \n\n\nThere is a philosophical truth behind his beliefs. Like the great filmmakers of history such as Stanley Kubrick and Charlie Chaplin they were perfectionist in their crafts. These were artist who believe that every shot, every frame and every movement on set and camera needed to convey their vision in the most authentic way possible. These men were so caught up in their work that the way they went about it was almost inhuman. Whether if it was the extensive amounts of retakes, performing their own stunts, ideas that were thought unfilmable at the time or something as simple as \u00e2??holding a flower\u00e2??. In the end though it\u00e2??s evident that all their hard work did pay off. Their achievements had earn them a spot on the history of filmmaking and how we see it today. When I see fletcher I don\u00e2??t see much of an abusive deluded man trashing on his students (granted there\u00e2??s no denying that his attitude is still atrocious) but instead I see the same spark and initiative that drove these men to what no other person wanted to achieve, to break the boundaries, to reach the peak of their abilities. And in Andrew we see that undying determination to gain the respect of this superior to which would be the biggest honor he could have. It\u00e2??s really a true source of inspiration. Let me clarify however that I do believe that at some point there is a limit to how your work can consume you, maybe to even the brink of insanity. But that strive for perfection is really worthy of admiration. Personally I would consider myself a bit of a perfectionist so it was easy to hear how this film spoke to me in that regard. Because of this I appreciated how the film smartly strays itself apart from musical underdog clich\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2??s and give us a more realistic view of the harsh reality of hard work and perseverance. \n\nRegarding the cinematography and editing the film handles each of its shots in a fast and brisk pacing following the tempo of the Jazz sequences. They illuminate the screen with such careful artistry to the songs that contrast the dark and tension filled moments with Fletcher and Andrew. The music soars and it feels exhilarating. It\u00e2??s one of those rare times in film that such directing makes you feel that you\u00e2??re there with the characters in every step of the way. Even in the quite moments with Andrew practicing and studying you question whether he\u00e2??s enjoying the moment or is desperately breaking himself emotionally by drumming so much to the point that his hands bleed. \n\nThis is a great film with its profound love for its characters and music.  Filled with bravado, emotion and great direction. Sometimes I feel that we could all use a Terrence Fletcher of our own in our lives.",

I agree with his ideas: you want to excel in something, work harder and harder, until you bleed. Cry, if you care, cry out loud, but do not give up. The lesson of this film is outstanding: genius can't be coward and a coward can't be genius.\n\n A child with great talent in music was discovered by Fletcher, trained by him and, after graduation he was recruited by the best Conservatory of USA. After a while he commits suicide. \nWell, Fletcher is devastated and remembers that boy as being a genius and being discovered by him. Now, who can tell that that boy was mentally ill because of Fletcher? Maybe it was a parental situation, a family problem, or genetics to lead him to suicide. But, because the teacher had a reputation, it was easy to put the guilt on him.\n\nFletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. But this fear is felt by the weak and the ones who don't really truly want to sacrifice everything for Art.\n\nAndrew, the 19 years old drummer seems to be as strong and ruthless as Fletcher. He understands his mentor better than anybody else. Events of life set them in motion to fight and part.\nThey meet again, by serendipity, both out from the Music school. Fletcher knows that Andrew witnessed against him, and wants revenge. That shows that for him Andrew is not a child: he perceives Andrew as a fellow Artist who \"screwed him over\".\nThey are on stage when Fletcher tells Andrew: \"-I know it was you!\" and opens the concert with another piece, a piece whose sheet Andrew does not have. Well, Fletcher sees him failing and says: \" After all, you don't have it in you!\". What did he not have? The power of improvising.\n\nMany times Fletcher told his players the story of Charlie Parker and Jo Jones. Without Jones throwing a chair to the head of Parker there would not be THE BIRD.\n\nAlso he confessed to Andrew that, actually, he never had a \"Parker\" to discover and guide.\n\nThen, on stage, all those memories come back to Andrew, and after such humiliation, what does he do? He returns to his kit and interrupts Fletcher's speech, starting to play \"Caravan\".\nOrchestra is watching him, questioning, and he says: \"I'll cue you!\". Fletcher goes from surprise, to madness, to another amazement ending up CONDUCTING Andrew...He found his Parker! He becomes one with his drummer boy! Everything and everyone is forgotten: \"Andrew, what are you doing Man?\" asks him with total admiration...and the boy, between sweat and blood: \" I'll cue you!\"\nAnd he plays, with all his heart, and Fletcher takes off his coat and follows his dream: the eye contact teacher-student speaks volumes. Andrew is waiting for his approval and Fletcher SMILED after ten seconds eye to eye with the young Artist. Then Andrew smiled back and let himself led by the Master to the end...\n\nFletcher is not a teacher. He is a musician. A real one, not a restaurant entertainer. His ear is born with the 6th sense of perfect music: either he hears it played by a student or not. They are not average students: they are Artists. They should excel, not become Doctors with a  hobby to play an instrument.\nArt has not half measure: either you are a genius or a nobody. In music most of all. This film is an wonderful lesson about Art and Kitsch: what's the difference these days?\n\nAn Artist should be merciless when it comes to Art. No compromising, no caressing, no sugar-coating wannabes or has-beens. \nIt should be zero tolerance for mediocrity. That's why I love this film: it is true!\nSo, I disagree with bad reviews regarding \"Whiplash and its subject\", and I admire the very young director Damien Chazelle and both actors: J.K.Simmons and MiIles Teller...And, by the way, the dad of Andrew plays a major role being very supportive, whatever his son decides to do. His love gives his son POWER to fight and this is amazing. Best film about Art I have ever seen...",

His past film \"Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench\" revolved around the romance between two musicians in the form of a musical. While his last film looked at the ardor of the thirties musical scene, this film looks at its raw underbelly. Looking at the abusive, often violent influences of musical instructors at top tier universities and schools, Chazelle has tapped into a reserve of pain and talent that so often isn't seen. The pressure of striving to be the best often ruins people's lives, and yet renders them living legends. \n\nRead more at http://www.bluefairyblog.com/blog/2015/3/19/whiplash",

Simmons is the fire that molds the steel into an instrument of perfection.  His abusive teaching techniques melts away the impWHIPLASH+onesheeturities of the weaker students while forges the determination of the best of the best, but at a cost.  This film makes me ask,  \"If it wasn't for the abusive, sadistic role models pushing for greatness, would we be a society of mediocrity? What greats would we have lost if they were told as young students, \"Good Job\". Am I willing to make the sacrifices to achieve my goals?   What is the price of greatness?\"  I thoroughly enjoyed the film and Simmons portrayal of the abusive teacher. Miles does a fantastic job in taking me to the depths of his passion as a drummer.  Definitely see this movie and let me know if you think they did a \"Good Job\"",

            "content": "\"The truth is, Andrew\nI never really had a Charlie Parker.\nBut I tried.\nI actually fucking tried.\"\n\n\"Whiplash\". You could think that this film tells the story of a drummer (the movie poster is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to this) who has suffered this injury by violently playing his instrument. Or he lost control of his car while drumming rhythmically on the steering wheel and crashed into the car driving in front of him. You could link the movie title to these assumptions, because the arrangements that Andrew (Miles Teller) has to play in this masterful and highly rhythmic film may result in a neck injury. And when it comes to losing that control ... well ... then you should go and watch the movie to find out yourself. Anyway, the film title refers to a song written by the American jazz composer Hank Levy. The central theme of the film is about the influence you can have on someone and drive that person to exceed certain inhuman limits of his own ability. Now, for me you're already a top musician when you know the complete arrangement of \"Whiplash\" and \"Caravan\" (written by Duke Ellington) by heart. Even if there's a little mistake here and there or you are little bit offbeat, eventually I will have a boundless admiration for the musician after completing such a superhuman performance.\n\nI've never had such a desire to pull someone through the screen and then smack a huge cymbal against his face as now with the presumably extremely talented music teacher Fletcher, brilliantly played by JK Simmons. A man who lives for his music and has a huge passion for it. It's a bit exaggerated that passion though. Exaggerated to such extent that it exceeds the limit of human dignity and by his passion for creating a perfect musician, his way of teaching tends to be sadomasochistic. A kind of militaristic attitude towards his traumatized and frightened students who are wary of any unexpected outburst. A disrespectful howler, suitable as \"drill sergeant\" in the US Army, and first-class bully, who suddenly swings around music stands, slaps his students in the face and throws out a member of his orchestra, just because he plays a bit out of tune . Afterwards, the accused doesn't appear to be the culprit, but he's just thrown out of the classroom because he didn't know he wasn't the one playing out of tune. A worse stain on the reputation of a professional musician, according to Fletcher.\n\nThat's also what Andrew, an ordinary American teenager who studies at the Shaffer conservatory and whose only envisioned aim is to be the best jazz drummer ever, undergoes. The moment he's being asked to join Fletcher's school orchestra, which only consists of a select group of musicians, it becomes the best day of his life. His confidence gets such a boost that he even overcomes his shyness and dares to ask a girl, who works at the cinema, on a date. That it's subsequently leading to a veritable psychological warfare, goes beyond his wildest dream. Gradually the terror policy of Fletcher drives him to the utmost to meet Fletcher's expectations. Even his relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist) is terminated abruptly by him. The love for music is displaced by a bloody battle for a wanted spot in the orchestra. The obsessional takes the upper hand, tending towards self-destruction.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert myself when it's about jazz. And I've read reviews where it's suggested that the essence of jazz is completely misrepresented here : \"The idea about jazz in this movie is brought in a grotesque way and looks like a ridiculous caricature\". The whole history about Charlie Parker and the anecdote Fletcher tells everytime, apparently isn't exactly true at all. Could be, but for me the jazz section wasn't of essence in the story. It's the emotional and physical brutality that Fletcher uses to bring students to a higher level. In this way Fletcher tries to create \"HIS Charlie Parker\". The whole movie does follow the rhythm of the used music: uplifting, rhythmic and intense. Only the end was predictable and presented us of course the well known rule that the oppressed kicks the oppressor's ass again. Actually I hoped Andrew would put his drumsticks there where the sun doesn't shine at Fletcher.\n\nThe performances of Teller and Simmons are obviously extremely stunning. It took me a while before I realized that I've seen Teller in \"That awkward moment\". A movie I wanted to forget about as soon as possible. Here, however, I thought he was brilliant. And apparently he's an avid drummer and he did all the drumming himself. Hats off and respect ! But the most brilliant achievement was undoubtedly that of Simmons. What a great character sketch with lots of charisma. A character that scares you. Someone you start to hate thoroughly after a while. But in the end I understood a bit what drove him to this behavior. He won an Oscar for this role and in my opinion well deserved. An energetic musical thriller, with a fairly predictable outcome and which is so extremely rhythmic you can't sit still. Highly recommended!\n\nMore reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

He yells racist epithets (hymie) as well as expletives and insults, psychological tricks (good guy, bad guy in one), hits the young drummer Neyman repeatedly in the face while screaming at him, tricks him, insults him and finally humiliates him, to which the orchestra of young musicians say nothing, do nothing and no one records the revolting behavior on their smart phones or puts it on the internet, as they most certainly would. All in an attempt to make a  tense drama that fails because I don't believe it, I do not believe Neyman would lose the music folder, I do not believe he would crawl out from under a car accident and run to the music competition bleeding and limping, he would not fall for Fletcher's trick the second time when he befriends him. I saw it all coming as I am sure many others also do. It looks great, the music sounds great even if the jazz is somewhat dated ( hear Harry Connick Jr. band from the early 90s for modern big band jazz), so I think the audience has been mesmerized by cinematic pyrotechnics that would be better placed in a more grounded story. And Fletcher means \"arrow maker\" while Neyman ( pronounced as the German \"niemand\") means \"nobody\". So disappointed after all the hype.",

The final scene overplays the conclusion and is too neat in some ways.  Despite this, it missed having a final word on one or two of the themes, leaving these as secondary considerations in favour of a more Hollywoodesque ending.\n\nDecent performance by Miles Teller in the lead role.

            "content": "\"Whiplash\"  on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I HATED IT. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about.  It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would still say that this movie does not reflect the beauty of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that \"Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty\". I believe in Truth and truth can not be an opinion. \"Whiplash\" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that \"great art/artist\" are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these \"negative\" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough.(How many great artist has history ignored only later to discover their beauty?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth is dependent upon the reception of their art by an audience or someone outside themselves.  \"Enter the EVIL music/art instructor\" who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is some great NOBILITY inherent in not depriving the world of a great artist no matter what the cost. GAG!! What overblown melodramatic tripe.  I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential,or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and doggedly bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There IS a line. This movie even mentions this \"LINE\" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss.  At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through.  I had a glimmer of hope that the movie\"s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be.  The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then  one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes  during Andrew's  fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew there is a nod of acknowledgement from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world. UUNNGHHH!!! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as a triumph of art and truth. As if there being squeezed torturously from a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. AS AN ARTIST IT OFFENDS ME WITH ITS CLICHES, I feel it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be dark. It is both and it is neither. Art is truth and that is all I would ever ask of any form of expression. In \"Whiplash\" I got pandering, \"Top Gun\"-esque melodrama  and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist.  (2 stars for the undeniably fine craftsmanship and performances, but on those alone does not a good movie make.)  -SIZER",

My heart was pounding at points where I simply didn't want Andrew to fail or stumble. That would translate into the bombardment of criticisms from his cruel instructor. This movie tells an incredible story of what people do to push themselves beyond others. How they push themselves to be the very best and what that does to their social life. Miles Teller's character is one wonderful to watch. Although at times, he can come off as a dick, watching this film you grow to care and hope for the character to achieve his dreams. What this movie also does a nice job of is showing how the profession and hobby of musicians are looked at and treated compared to those who focus on sports. Andrew's family does not seem nearly as concerned with his success in the music department than as they do with his cousin who finds success with football. They don't respect the pain Andrew feels and the blood he sheds literally. There are scenes where his hands bleed onto the drum set while he continues to play and even made my hands begin to sting. I'm also glad toward the end they decide to flesh out J.K. Simmons character Terrence Fletcher (the cruel instructor) and let him explain his reasons for insulting and constantly demeaning his players. The end result is most certainly satisfying. This movie ends exactly how it should leaving the audience in awe.",

Andrew, played by the talented Miles Teller, is a young drumming prodigy, or is he? Is he the next Buddy Rich or Max Roach? \n\nAndrew admires his mentor, Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Simmons won an Oscar for the playing the megalomaniacal band leader who thinks he has the power to beat greatness into his students through abuse, name-calling, manipulation, lies, whatever it takes to be great. One big question left standing at the end of the movie is whether abusive teaching works for the most talented of artists, if it can make them that much greater?\n\nWhiplash is a more dramatic and less smarmy look at the entertainment industry than Birdman. Whiplash doesn't beg for us to notice how clever it is at every turn, it's not predictable, and while we are not clear where the protagonists will go at the end of the film, it doesn't need to invoke magical realism and mysticism to be a mystery. Other than both being compound nouns with eight letters and about the entertainment industry, the two films are world's apart.\n\nWhiplash is not your typical film about an artist climbing to the top. Few films give so much time to the importance of mentorship in the artists' lives. Few films explore the obsession of the the art itself that leads one to desire to be \"one of the greats.\" And the film isn't talking about the obsession of drugs and alcohol or some abusive family that leads artists to greatness. Like many artist we consider great, his obsession stems from his inner demons of not knowing what else he would do with his life without it and his insecurities in a world where the next guy on drums might be better. If he can't play like Elvin Jones, than what's the point???Unlike most of us who either aren't willing to do what it takes to be great or are content with what talent we do have, artists (athletes, scientists, writers...) who become the best have a different mindset. Whiplash lays that out for us to see in an entertaining form. \n\nAnd when you think you caught the beat of Whiplash, it turns on us like modern jazz and ups the tempo. But it never plays down to us. Whiplash surprises with the plot twists and just when you think it goes to far, that it has played out, the key changes and leaves us wondering.\n\n??Rating: Pay full Price\n\nPeace, \nTex Shelters",

I suppose some people will believe this, but what is the point of putting this on the screen unless your ultimate purpose is to come back to reality and show that it actually does NOT work.  This movie never gets to that destination.  An occasional challenge, an isolated blow up in the workplace or in the creative sphere between colleagues can be cathartic and even positive.  But it cannot work as a day-in-day-out, 24-7, psychological warfare strategy to build anything of value let alone run a school or keep and organization intact. It is such a ridiculous premise that is lacks internal consistency (why would anyone who is a teacher of anything constantly undermine their students' and their own personal success) and unbelievable situational circumstances (the car wreck scene).  We don't even get a glimpse into the extreme personality of Terrence Fletcher to help explain why this person exhibits sociopathic or psychotic behavior.  Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.

Both these actors taught us a valuable lesson to us all about how we should fulfill our goals in life.",

Neyman knows that Fletcher would see a thousand mediocre lives destroyed to produce one great, and Neyman yearns to be one of the greats, no matter the cost to himself or others. Will Neyman live up to Fletcher's expectations or die trying?\n\nThe film is driven by great performances and good music. However, it succeeds a little too well in making the audience feel the protagonist's anxiety, and Fletcher's bigoted obscenity is quite repellent. For me, both of these things at times detracted from my enjoyment of the film. Moreover, one can object that the film's ending actually affirms Fletcher's perverse value system. But a film that can make you entertain questions of ultimate values is necessarily a good one.",

Their characters, and the story itself, may have been a bit over the top for Hollywood, but it still gives you great insight into how a musician's greatness is cultivated over time.  Sure it takes a special kind of natural talent and luck of the draw in the gene pool, but even with this resembling the most extreme sides of the business, there feels to be a hint of truth in it.\n\nIt's clear why JK Simmons won best supporting actor for his performance.  Method to the madness might be the best way to describe how he walks through life while training these kids.  For Miles Teller, I'm super impressed with his ability to pick up the drums and train the way he did over a couple of months to at least get the jist of those songs down.  While great editing and breaking the songs into chunks to make it appear as if Teller was really tearing it up in one fluid play-through, he still gets a standing ovation.\n\nYou can actually see the lightbulb switch on in the final ten minutes when they start Caravan.  Not just for Teller's character finally hitting his full potential, but for Simmons' character coming to terms with his teaching techniques proving him right.  They hit the high hat with this one.",

He deserves every bit of the Oscar he won for this performance. He was truly spectacular.  I have seen Miles Teller in other films, and usually he is pretty funny guy, but seeing him here as this obsessed addicted and vulnerable kid is very different, but nothing short of a great performance.  It just flowed so well together, you could see his need to become great and strive for more and more until his drum kit was covered in blood, and like every truly great film, he shines like a bright light at the end, which is what we all want. I only have one question, was Teller a UFC fighter at some point, because I couldnt stop staring at the cuts and scars he has on his face and neck. All of that aside, because it doesnt matter, he was fantastic in this film.  Now, add all the stuff that I said to take out in the beginning, and it concludes to, even though I just had the chance to watch it, this was my favorite film of 2014. Rock on JK.",

            "content": "Here's something for those of you interested in watching this movie, but are not as into watching \"good\" movies like me to keep in mind as I write this review. Starting with Whiplash, I'm going to write movie reviews that take into consideration the art behind movies and I'll judge the movies accordingly. But I am just like anyone else and I will judge this movie based in how entertained I was and how much I genuinely liked the movie. That is what I plan on doing for my movie reviews for the rest of my days of reviewing movies. 1 star or lower is garbage to me and had few or no good qualities. 2 stars is bad but had some good qualities to it. 2 1/2 is half-baked. 3 stars is just mediocre. 3 1/2 is good but could definitely have taken a little more time developing itself. 4 is quite entertaining but not the best that it could have been. 4 1/2 it's pretty good but it's not the best it could have been 5 is the absolute best it could have been. And I will try my best not to deviate from this. This movie has an arbitrary yet free flowing pacing to it. Rhythm and timing were the most CRUCIALLY important parts in a movie such as this. At moments it fails. The editing was perfect, yet the character driven parts of the story which involved Andrew getting to spend time with his dad or his girlfriend those parts felt ignored for most of the movie and were only put in when they needed to add a little something something to spice things up and to make us feel bad for Andrew more than we already did. As I watched I started off feeling bad for Andrew and then I grew to dislike Andrew, but then I started to cheer for him. Because this movie starts off showing us that his dad is an unsuccessful writer who  teaches high school english and actually babies his kid too much for my taste. Then we see Andrew getting chewed up and spit out by his jazz teacher on his first day in the elite jazz team. And Andrew takes some of that anger with him and takes it out on a girl that HE JUST STARTED SEEING and on his own family. That was the moment I saw that he was trying to do the same thing that his teacher was doing and that was to tear apart the people around them. But unlike his teacher he was doing it to motivate them Andrew just did so to be mean. And that makes you dislike Andrew, but then he attacks his teacher and gets kicked out of school and in a way I felt bad, but at the same time I was glad. And at the movies climax, his teacher does one more thing to intentionally discourage him in order to get him off the stage, but then Andrew realizes this is just another one of his tricks and in order to be the best I have to ignore every discouragement he throws at me and start drumming on my own tempo. One of the most memorable parts is while he does this and his teacher tries to discourage him with another threat and as his teacher does so he hits one of the crash cymbals in retaliation to his teachers intimidation. I loved that. One thing I absolutely loved about this movie is how well defined as a character Fletcher was and how well J.K. Simmons played the role. He won an oscar and he earned it. One thing I have to mention is something about this movie that I totally agree with. The the two most dangerous words in the english language are GOOD JOB. I read these words in a book titled I Am Better Than Your Kids by MADDOX. He actually said the exact same thing in his book. And this movie takes what MADDOX said to a different and significantly more intense extreme. And I'm starting to think that ALOT of the inspiration for Terrence Fletchers Character comes from the aforementioned book I am Better Than Your Kids. And as for the rest of the movie I felt this was a very hard movie to sit through. It starts with Andrew playing pretty good. At least better than me that's for sure, but to this teacher even though he's good if he's not the best he can be he's not good enough. And at the final moments of the movie when Andrew is much more sure of himself he realized in that moment his teacher was finally acknowledging that he had skill because you're either out to be the best or you're not worth my time. All in all a very well done movie. Whiplash is very well written, streamline and on time editing, great acting, and just a really good movie.",

            "content": "Talk about hard to sit through! It shows you how amazing this film is when the big jazz band performances in front of everyone felt more intense than most action scenes. Miles Teller, whom I always saw as that \"meh\" actor from Divergent, blew me out of the water with his performance as the drummer who's blessed yet also cursed by the talented beats of his drums. But the crown of performances has to go to J.K. Simmons, who quips funny sergeant Hartman-esque jabs but in a way that felt more real like any rude, dominative perfectionist that anyone has had to dealt with in their lives but able to spread incredible amounts of terror and psychological tension. You can just see the misery he inflicts upon his students and even see his attitudes rub off on his students (whom end up paying consequences for that like when Teller's friends, the seldom joys of his character's life, start to take notice and call him out on it). There's also layers to Simmons's character, whom is shown to fake a gentler persona while with friends, debates the cons of not testing one's limits, and sadly is the possibility of a previous cycle of psychological abuse and perfection that got him to where he is today. \"Whiplash\" not only portrays the depth of passion(the one thing most people feel safe with), but in a way where the thing that the protagonist loves the most is turned against him. It asks if it's worth it to put yourself through living Hell when you should be enjoying what you do in order to achieve perfection. But it also leaves the door open wide enough to interpret the pros of becoming the very best as well, so one could still answer the movie's jarring question (one which is rarely given in movies) with a quite different answer. Finally, this movie has one of the most tense yet meaningful climaxes that I've watched in a long time. Whether you identify yourself with Miles Tellers' character or end up feeling more grateful for your own path of career pursuit, I think many can agree that that they may never be able to listen to drums the same way again. This may not be the \"fun\" popcorn flick that many look forward to, but it's for sure that in all of the right ways.",

            "content": "One of the best movies I've seen in some time. I'd much rather watch a dark and gritty, yet truthful drama like this than any \"inspirational\" musician story Hollywood normally hawks our way.    \n\nWhen critics throw out words like \"electrifying\" or \"exhilarating\" to describe a film, they're often accused of hyperbolizing. In this case, however, such words do indeed fit this emotionally pulse-pounding drama. The climax of the film is particularly well-crafted -- one of the most thrilling and crowd-pleasing in recent memory. \n\nPlenty has been made of J.K. Simmons' performance in this film. Naturally the notices are all accurate and he more than deserves his Oscar. This truly is one of the most pleasantly surprising portrayals of the year. Saying his music teacher character is intense may be an understatement. He's a very complicated, emotional character -- unapologetically hurling a chair at a student one minute, and breaking down in tears in the next. Tour-de-force doesn't begin to describe it.\n\nMiles Teller also does tremendous work here. He's certainly an up-and-comer whose craftsmanship stands out more and more with each performance. I sincerely hope Simmons' brilliant turn hasn't over-shadowed Teller's strong, emotionally vulnerable work here.\n\nThe cinematography is terrific. Sharone Meir's work here reminds me a lot of Jeff Cronenweth's work in David Fincher's films. It's beautiful stuff. For a relatively simple, personal character story, he pulls out all the stops visually -- providing a rhythm that compliments the jazz performances and a color pallet that compliments the brassy instruments.\n\nThe story of Whiplash is relatable to anyone who struggles to measure up, faces failure, yearns for greatness, or compares themselves to their parents. No matter the craft or career, most people can see themselves in Teller's drummer character. It just so happens that centering this film around the drums (elements of the movie are autobiographical for the director) highlights the almost percussive intensity with which we fight for attention and approval -- through repeated failures and triumphs.\n\nGreat film. See it. Brace yourself for the Whiplash.",

            "content": "Like some dark cousin of bring-your-daughter-to-work day for would-be over-achievers, \"Whiplash\" invites the viewer to witness the dark underbelly of exceptional performance.  In the process, and process is what's in focus here-the following questions are broached: How can one motivate another person beyond all rational bounds and constrainsts? Can intermittent fits of passion be leveraged into consistently exceptional performance?  And most importantly, can this be accomplished using conventional means, or must lines be crossed and taboos scorned?  This movie is about steering exceptional ambition, from the inside and out. \n\nThe plot itself doesn't diverge much from the standard hero's journey, but the emphasis does.  The camera directs its focus much less on eventual glory than excruciating process.  Instead of watching a likeable Rocky Balboa's quest for fame and fortune, his already adonic physique attaining ever greater levels of perfection over the course of a 4-minute montage set to inspiring music, we watch probably coddled, definitely socially awkward and painfully self-absorbed Neyman work sores into his hands, hammering at a cymbal in an isolated, sound-proof room.  A cheering crowd, a concept probably too discomfittingly intimate for our hero anyways, is a faraway thought.  He already dismissed the girl to be got without ceremony or any hint of empathy and his interdependent goals -to increase the speed of his 400th notes imperceptably and earn the right to play the song for the next competition- are incremental victories at best; it is difficult to imagine that whatever difference the conductor portends to hear belongs just as much to the world of make believe as actually securing a starting role in the darwinist world of Studio Band.  What percentage of the audience can even identify with the goal of being a background musician in a genre far past its prime?  All interpretation aside, the juice is surely not worth the squeeze in the individual mental calculations of many viewers. \n\nYet the whole thing is exhilarating.  In spite of the parade of unflattering qualities exhibited by both, I found myself viscerally pulling not just for the unlikely hero, but also his anti-mentor.  In a billiant illustration of Hegel's thesis-antithesis-synthesis dialectic, beauty was not ultimately achieved by the triumph of one ego over another, but rather as the culmination of the grinding interplay between them; they do eventually harmonize to produce something unique and memorable, but only because they failed to kill each other first. \n\nThat his father was abscent probably helped too.",

            "content": "There is such a myriad of blood, sweat, tears, anxiety, screaming, and terror in \"Whiplash\" that an outsider might mistake it for a horror show instead of a cursory, superiorly breathtaking thriller of sorts.  I'm not the kind of critic that uses tired phrases like \"kept me at the edge of my seat\" or \"made me sweat bullets\" as devices to trickily describe my heart-rate, but during \"Whiplash,\" I experienced both sensations.  Not in the same way I did when Ghostface was chasing around Drew Barrymore with psychotic fascination in \"Scream\" and not in the same way I did when Marion Crane was getting shower-knifed in \"Psycho\"; \"Whiplash\" invents an entirely new kind of thrill, one where an aggressive insult is as excruciating as a punch to the face and a drum solo quivers with the same acrimony of a fist fight where no one wins.\n\tMiles Teller (who is already becoming one of Hollywood's many underrated young talents) portrays Andrew Neyman, an aspiring drummer who has found a place within the halls of a respected music conservatory on the East Coast.  Though slightly cocky, his talent is undeniable; he aspires to be the next Buddy Rich, and it doesn't seem like all too much of an exaggeration.  Little does he know that he is about to become the punching bag of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a sadistic conductor who isn't afraid to hurl verbal and physical assaults on his students in order to achieve a sickened sort of perfection.\n\tFamously, the American Film Institute compiled a series of Top 100 lists, its subjects being stars, laughs, passions, quotes, and more.  If they were to start again from scratch in the next decade or so, Terence Fletcher would, in no doubt, find his place as one of the Top 50 Villains.  Simmons has made himself a kind presence before (\"Juno,\" all those insurance commercials), but never again will I be able to look at him without a cautious, passing fear.  As terrifying as Darth Vader or Nurse Ratched, Fletcher seems to enjoy inflicting pain onto his students; even scarier is the fact that the film never offers any explanation as to why he feels the need to traumatize the impressionable youths around him.  Most movies would use a dying wife or an abusive childhood as excuses, but not with Fletcher.  He is evil, and he probably doesn't even realize it.  Simmons snarls his way through screaming matches with unbridled ferocity, but more disconcerting is his ability to radiate cruelty even when his manners are at their very best.\n\tIn \"Whiplash,\" we're never quite sure if Fletcher's alarming teaching methods will ultimately guide Andrew in the direction of the greatest drummer alive, or if they will send him over the edge.  Teller, a brilliant and intuitive actor, is aware that Andrew isn't always likable but makes up for it with fierce determination.  As he practices unbelievable amounts of time to polish a certain section of a particular piece of music, blood rips through his hands like a geyser, sweat pours down his face like a waterfall.  But will he give up? The lethal rapport between Teller and Simmons is morbid enough to keep us guessing.\n\tMention must also be made for Tom Cross' magnificent editing.  The way he pieces together Fletcher's attacks on Andrew are inflamed in peril, flickering with rough movement that matches Fletcher's unpredictable mood changes; most impressive is the climax (which is basically a long, extremely intense drum solo), which captures every single detail imaginable, ensnaring any drip of sweat or instrumental spasm of the performance.\n\tWhen the closing credits finally popped up, I noticed that, in all my leg-shaking and shortages of breath, I was drenched in sweat.  \"Whiplash\" doesn't allow for a smoke break or a second to get your bearings straight - the continuance of high tension makes it the most thrilling film of 2014.",

This isn't even a dramatic representation of what school for jazz musicians is like, ESPECIALLY in high school. It's farfetched, and has put yet another nail in the genre's coffin. If all people know about jazz is from this movie, we are all doomed. None of the stuff in this movie has ever happened or will ever happen, and any teacher of music that hinted at intense irrational behavior like this would be fired immediately. Also, the tasks that the \"all star drummer\" has to accomplish are extremely novice, and most average high school musicians could play at this level very easily. On top of this, it promotes the idea that jazz is about competition, which is a sad diminishing of music and makes it look like evil glee.",

Simmons' role seems specifically tailor-made for him, and he delivers it with the perfect amount of sadism and humanity. He really is an extraordinary character actor, and his performance here is equally extraordinary. Miles Teller is not talked about as much, but he definitely holds his own against Simmons in these engrossing sequences. Ultimately, Chazelle's brilliant screenplay presents a morally ambiguous tale of dedication versus obsession, and concludes the film with just enough opacity to allow for multiple interpretations.

The actors gave thrilling, admirable performances and all scenes with musical performances were engaging and intense - this is a film about sacrifice, ambition and the power of single-minded, all-consuming passion, and when it came to illustrating these themes, the movie excelled with flying colours. However, I am not sure how the audience is supposed to be left feeling after the movie. Personally, I felt uneasy, dismayed, even somewhat sickened.

The chemistry shared between actors Miles Teller, as an aspiring drummer, and his teacher, J.K. Simmons as his teacher, is an extremely rare treat. It's the kind of chemistry that is volatile, and hazardous; yet gripping, electrifying, and ultimately rewarding. Both actors turn in performances that will not be forgotten in the near future, if ever. Fletcher (Simmons) abuses Andrew Neyman (Teller) in every way imaginable, and the product is something that needs to be seen in order to be heard.

While the majority of his screen time is spent hurling abuses and musical instruments at poor Andrew, there is one vital moment that humanizes Simmons's character, and it is for that moment more than anything else that his performance is Oscar-worthy.  \nThe film's story is problematic for two reasons, both involving the film's conclusion.  The central conflict is man vs. man, Andrew vs. Fletcher, and while this conflict does resolve in the film's final moments, it still seems unrealistic that Fletcher would accept even the climactic drum solo as proper resolution.  Also, what plagues Andrew throughout the film is not limited to Fletcher.  Andrew's own blind ambition, seen in his relationship with Nicole, is more to blame for his troubles than Fletcher, yet the film's conclusion doesn't encounter the man vs. self conflict in any satisfactory way.\nOverall, the performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are excellent, and there are some very compelling sequences, but the story, while strong, is \"not my tempo.\"",

        {
            "content": "This film has take the inspirational teacher/student formula and absolutely turned it on its goddamn face.  There's no touchy-feely story about a teacher who's tough but lovable who inspires his students to strive to be the best person they can.  Not saying there's anything wrong with that type of movie, but this, from now on and for a long fucking time, will be the benchmark of what an 'inspiring' teacher/student movie should be.  Look, I think Miles Teller is a natural talent.  He's charismatic, he's funny, and he can be charming if he wants to be.  I do not mean to say that he didn't work hard on this film, because he clearly fucking did, he gave it his absolute all to a role that must have been intensely demanding.  Both physically and emotionally, as I'm sure it must not have been pleasant to be verbally berated by JK Simmons all day long.  Miles Teller brings a certain physicality to the role of drummer, once that is essentially needed for a type of drumming that jazz demands, a much more complicated and complex form of drumming than what you normally see.  Thanks to some really damn good editing, particularly the film's excellent third act, it really looks like Miles is playing the drums during the fantastic, and climactic, drum solo.  With that out of the way, it's obvious and expected, that the show absolutely belongs to JK Simmons here with his absolutely incredible performance in this movie.  He perfectly portrays this man whose methods are verging on physical abuse, throwing a chair at Andrew during the first scene Andrew plays the drums.  After this chair throwing, he proceeds to tear Andrew a new asshole with the verbal berating he gives the poor guy.  This scene is like 20 minutes, or so, into the movie and with that scene I decided that the Oscar Simmons got for his performance here was more than deserved.  He added muscle for the role, which gave him a more impressive presence as he does not seem like the kind of guy you would fuck with, at least when it comes to his Jazz band.  The film, as much as it is about Fletcher pushing Andrews past the boundaries of what others would think possible, it's also pretty much a psychological thriller about the effect Fletcher's methods have on Andrew.  He becomes insanely obsessed with drumming, to the point that he pushes away a great woman in order to achieve 'greatness' for fear that she'd hold him back.  He starts getting a little cocky as he improves and starts to begrudgingly earn Fletcher's mistake little by little.  It gets to the point that, during a very important performance, Andrew gets into a car accident with a fucking truck, he proceeds to get out of the car and run to the venue in order to play the drums.  The guy clearly got fucked up in the car accident, with blood dripping from his head and his hands all fucked up.  The performance, as expected, goes to shit as Andrew is unable to play the drums due to the pain.  Fletcher, looking for any excuse to kick Andrew out of the band, uses this as reason to remove him.  So you can see how Fletcher's methods have affected the way Andrew looks at the world and how he views his drumming as more important than anything else in his life.  This is a movie about obsession, and it pretty much plays out like a thriller to be honest.  The music in the film is absolutely excellent and, while I'm not a big jazz aficionado myself, I certainly appreciate the musicianship and complexity of the genre itself.  Jazz is probably one of the most difficult genres of music to play, especially if you're a drummer.  So I'm very appreciative of the talent it takes to perform this type of music.  The music chosen for this film is excellent and it only helps to enhance the story.  I don't think I've given enough praise to JK Simmons, so let's get back to that for a moment.  This guy believes that the worst two words in  our vocabulary are 'good job'.  He believes that this makes people complacent, whereas with his monstrous methods, some would say, he hopes that he push people towards true greatness.  Regardless of whether his methods leave them in an emotionally fragile state, as proven with the subplot of his previous student who killed himself.  This man is pretty much a gargoyle, as described by Damien Chazelle, who brilliantly wrote and directed the film.  JK Simmons is so goddamn convincing that you honestly buy that he's changed when Andrew meets up with him at the jazz club where he invited Andrew to play drums for him for one last time.  It was really just a ruse to get revenge on Andrew as he changed up the sheets and played a different song than what Andrew was expecting.  Andrew, anonymously, testified against Fletcher's methods, which got him fired.  Fletcher, being an intelligent man, clear knew it was Andrew and he set him up.  But, the way the last act plays out, you're unclear as to whether this was one of Fletcher's methods to motivate Andrew to strive for greatness, or whether it truly took him by surprise when Andrew, after being humiliated during the first performance, took over the show and went into Caravan, the song that has the fantastic drum solo at the end.  That's how good JK Simmons is, you're not exactly sure what the motive was behind this.  This movie is incredible, as you've no doubt noticed.  Fabulous acting and writing.  The story is top-notch and the film grabs your attention from the moment it starts and it never lets go.  It would rank very highly among my favorite films of last year and it definitely needs to be seen.  I would highly recommend this.",

I soon realized I was the only one laughing and this was by no means a comedy! I still found many things to be hilarious but I subdued my laughter so not to disturb the other movie goers. Later I caught on to the scope of this movie and realized that I am a bad person, and I thank God I don't have kids! I was really blown away by the music and the plot hooks were so awesome. It has really opened my mind up to jazz music, I LOVE and admire the drums although my tastes are more or less heavy metal. Jazz drumming blows metal away (accept maybe for Tool and Rush, because they have very jazz sounding drummers). I would totally see this movie again, I'm curious to find out if I would still find Fletcher funny the second time around! Go see it, (it's not FUNNY!) Ok yeah it was. In the Jim Jeffries kind of brutally funny.",

This applies more so to some of the management techniques (or lack of) that I have observed. The creation of a bullying culture and the misguided notion that putting someone under pressure brings out the best in them. Although I accept that there are rare instances where this approach works I firmly believe this is a poor, even lazy tactic. Motivating someone with the carrot instead of a stick takes more smarts and guile and will more often than not achieve more. \nFor anyone that has seen the trailers or the recent awards coverage for Whiplash its probably clear which method music teacher Fletcher (J K Simmons) prefers. And this is what drives the story. A succession of aspiring music pupils falling over and treading on each other to be the core musician in a reputable college band. Each of them fighting to be a part of an over bearing, oppressively fearful environment. And throughout this, Fletchers justification is that geniuses such as Charlie Parker thrived in such circumstances and that the students would either sink or swim. If they fail, then it just wasn't meant to be and the ends justify the means.\nWhiplash is an interesting and intense film. This is mainly down to Simmons who is magnificent throughout. Brash, aggressive and over bearing yet at times, shows enough empathy to suggest that there might be a good guy deep inside fighting to get out. His presence dominates every scene that he is in and even some scenes that he isnt. The music is not bad either and fans of jazz in particular will warm to this element of the film.\nI saw this story a little bit like a reflection of our day to day lives. We are encouraged to work hard, to be determined, to be focused and to succeed often at the expense of others. This is not something I like about the world I live in and Whiplash reminded me of this.",

Is this how \"jazz\" is really being taught in music conservatories today?  If so, I now know why jazz is dead or dying.\n\nI fear this is exactly the case though.  How many of the jazz greats from the last 100 years came from a music conservatory?  There's a reason for this:  Jazz is only half about technical skill.  The other half is about conveying emotion through music and improvisation.\n\nPerhaps this is what this movie really shows us at the end when Andrew Neyman finally lets loose with a completely improvised and emotional drum solo.\n\nWhatever the actual statement about jazz as an art form,  the tension and energy of this movie makes the plot work.",

            "content": "The film you can't stop thinking about afterwards. It has a multitude of levels of meanings and concealed statements. They are easily overshadowed by the mordbidly sparking 'abusive teacher - obsessed pupil' relationships brilliantly performed by the leading duo, but there's so much more below and beside it, that you can't stop coming back and thinking over and over what you have seen on the screen. There's just a great deal of ambiguity there, and that what it makes the film great, even though the story may appear quite simple at first.\n\nFletcher. A professor in a prestigious conservatory, seeking for a new Charlie Parker (so far, in vain); his tutelage appears cruel, on the brink of clear sadism, and he governs his orchestra as a bunch of bootcamp rookies, even addressing (nearly) all-male lineup \"ladies\". Andrew receives all kinds of hazing and humiliation, which he can barely handle. Later on Fletcher confesses that he does what he does in order to push the musicians beyond their self-perceived limits, towards greatness. And he alone seem to know where this greatness starts: apparently being a professor for years and directing countless orchestras aside, he still cannot find his \"new Parker\".\n\nAt a glance, his methods are shown as clearly unacceptable in the modern society: how many lives has he broken beside the poor Sean Casey's one? How many potentially brilliant musicians failed to stand his pressure, threw their instruments away, and turned clerks and repairmen? On the other hand, Fletchers orchestra(s) harvest awards (those he takes as  pretty mundane commodities). And ultimately he has found his new Parker in Andrew, who, despite being set up almost fatally, doesn't give up. Instead he revolts, and prove himself and earns the much-meaningful smile from his brutal tutor. \n\nIn other words, Fletcher ultimately succeeds, and his methods prove to be, despite their exceeding cruelty, efficient. Doesn't it look like the film's central message? A direct attack on widely-accepted today, overly indulging methods of teaching when even the mediocre and even hopelessly bad students may count on hearing \"well done\", and they know it?\n\nBut then again, there's a question of how much these bootcamp practices are applicable in music classes? What does Fletcher do? - He seems to be turning Andrew into an \"insensitive technical whiz\", as The New Yorker's film critic Richard Brody called the famous Buddy Rich, whom Miles Teller's character in \"Whiplash\" heavily aspires to. Fletcher pushes Andrew beyond his limits to what? - a petty mastery? Play fast. Then faster. Faster! This part is yours, Andrew. Is it what make a truly great (jazz) musician? I guess, there can't be a versatile answer on how justified, how plain right or wrong is what Fletcher does with his student. The truth is, there are lots of heavy-handed music tutors and orchestra directors who behave like dictators and tyrants, and still their much-thrashed students and orchestras prove to be very successful and professional after all.  \n\nNow, Andrew. It's easy to perceive him to be an innocent victim of Fletcher's 'assembly of evils', and see him as a hero in the end. Is he either? The character Miles Teller plays (and does so brilliantly and captivatingly) is, again, ambiguous, to say the least. Drumming becomes an obsession to him - for a couple of times we hear how the sounds of his drums get blurred into a solid drone, the obvious moments of (at least partial) insanity. Still, Andrew is so persevering that it leaves a viewer almost ashamed: you can't help recalling your own failures and screw-ups that you have allowed to happen simply because you haven't been committed enough to your then-current goal. \n\nBut there's yet another clearly-pronounced obsession Andrew has: the one with his own self. He's so egocentric that just doesn't feel people around him - mr. Teller's character perpetually hazed, inward sight is extremely indicative here. Andrew has no friends and don't feel wrong about it. He is complacent enough to dump his girlfriend on his quest for greatness, while she is probably the only person beside his over-protective father Andrew got along with. No remorse when he \"displaces\" Carl's sheet music folder, effectively setting him up. Although reluctantly, he does testify against Fletcher. And later when they meet at the bar, Andrew feels awkward (but not remorseful), and proves to be stupid and self-complacent enough to miss the major red flag above the Fletcher's head and trust him. The boy just doesn't feel who is truthworthy, and who is dangerous.  \n\nIn a climax scene, upon seeing Andrew's happy smile in return to Fletcher's much-coveted nod of approval, one may think that getting teacher's smile was a more important goal of Andrew's than achieving the ultimate mastery. He achieves both, but what is next? And what is this \"mastery\" of his, after all? - an art or an insensitive technique?\n\nBut then you watch the climax scene again, hear Andrew insanely skillful playing, and feel like every hair on your head goes a-sparking with electricity that emanates from screen. And you go and promote the film to your fellow musicians with '100% recommended' remarks, and tells them upon watching it 'that's what the real drill is', and they nod, even if reluctantly.\n\nA grand movie that deserves more Academy Awards than it received (at least rewarding JK Simmons is a bullseye), the one that leaves you heavily impressed, electrified, and - profoundly puzzled with ambiguity of its characters and messages.",

            "content": "Review by Jesse Burleson of VIEWS ON FILM\n\n\nI probably waited too long to see 2014's Whiplash. In fact, I have already comprised my list of top ten picks for said year. Regardless, if I had to revise things (which is something I don't normally do), this small yet loud Sony Pictures release would be right up at the top. I mean what a tantalizing title for a flick and even a cooler title for one about jazz drumming. One minute you're tapping your feet to its infectious groove. The next minute you are wincing and cringing at its mean spiritedness. Ultimately, Whiplash is powerful and heartbreaking. It's a cold sweat of movie, a real rat-a-tat-tat.\n\nThe storytelling starts out a little slow only to pick up mega speed. Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller) is a 19-year old student at the prestigious Shaffer conservatory (in New York City). He plays the drums and is ambitious as anyone who has ever walked through its doors. He wants to be one of the great musicians of the 21st century with Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker being his full blown idols. He's also fixated on just playing percussion and nothing else. Finally, he doesn't need friends, a girlfriend, or any type of support system in his life to get the job done. In his way however, is conductor Terrence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons, who riffs on a sort of bi-polar version of Lee Emery). He has a boot camp approach to getting his orchestra to play the type of perfected tempo he wants. A moody perfectionist, Fletcher berates everyone physically and mentally. He messes with their heads while pounding their fragile psyches into complete submission (there's a scene where he calls someone a worthless pansy ass, that's a new one). Basically, you fear him every time he enters a room. He is the main antagonist but I'd like to think of him more as a bandshell's version of Bill \"The Butcher\".\n\nThat brings me to the ending of Whiplash which is one that I can't quite describe. It's high tail and it's completely exhausting. Just think of the band Led Zeppelin and its late drummer John Bonham doing the solo to \"Moby Dick\". That might just give you a clue.\n\nAnyway, kudos to the performances featured here. This is a total triumph for actors Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. It's in an arena like you've never seen them before. J.K.'s persona as a loving dad in Juno plus the softy who does those Farmers Insurance commercials, gone! Teller's dopey characterizations from his plethora of forgotten romcoms, gone! J.K.'s Fletcher is a total hard ass, a real Nazi. Teller's Neiman is cut off from the outside world but in the end, he's a mad cymbal junkie incarnate, a real godsend. Together they make beautiful magic as actors and musical czars. Listen, I know this is a vehicle about excelling in an East Coast conservatory, but both of these characters are seen more as sergeants and privates than anything else. This isn't your normal drama, it's Full Metal Drum Kit.\n\nKudos also goes to the rousing level of film making for \"Whip's\" one hour and forty-seven minute running time. Director Damien Chazelle deals in a frenzy of close-ups whether it be the actor's faces, their bloodied hands, or just objects in general. He also provides Whiplash with a couple of whip/swish pans accompanied by the constant sounds of Jazz music (one of the oldest forms of popular music known to man). The film has a shadowy look, it's sullen. Watching every scene feels like you're in a wine bar or a darkly lit restaurant. And the editing which won a coveted Academy Award, is designed to put Neiman's character's romantic life and his relationship with his father (Jim Neiman played by Paul Reiser) off to the side. It then becomes strictly a two person character study, a mishmash of nurse Ratched and convict Randle McMurphy or Andy Dufresne and Warden Norton if you will. Whiplash's themed morality: Sometimes you need to go through hell to find success in what you do. It takes sweat and guts, hits and bruises to achieve greatness. The little people who lack ambition, are nice, and coddle you, matter very minimally in the grand scheme of things (yes I'm talking about Andrew's weak-minded father). Dare I say that this is the best movie of 2014. Whiplash has real \"whip\" appeal.",

Teller keeps proving he is a rising star and one of the best young actors in the business, with his physical and mental performance here making each scene more stressful than the last.  J.K. Simmons performance is something out of scripture.  He unleashes a performance that rightly won him an Oscar, and is a role that he was clearly born to play.  He reaches a perfect blend of hilarious and terrifying.  Each scene he enters actually has me fearing for my own life, and it made me crave for Teller's character to reach perfection all the more.  Its rare that a performance could actually give me goosebumps, but Simmons accomplished it and then some.  The writing was flawless.  The characters felt real and the dynamic between Teller and Simmons characters was fascinating.  That sort of student-teacher relationship creates a brilliant story, as instead of some inspirational \"Karate Kid\" similar tale we instead get a dark and brutal look at the lengths someone will go to impress their mentor and become the best at what they do.  The dialogue was exciting and was perfect for Simmons personality.  The film also touches on pushing people beyond what they can do and what it takes to be remembered for your achievements.  Damien Chazelle's second film has proven he has a strong career ahead of him.  He has created a masterpiece of art, enough said.  People will remember Whiplash for J.K. Simmons unforgettable performance, rightfully so, but his performance would be nothing with the perfect script and direction that it took to bring this great story to life.",

Miles Teller makes you really root for him in this because of everything he endures to be the best at his craft. Before I saw this movie JK Simmons was just J Jonah Jameson but no longer. I really wanted to hate his character but I just couldn't because, he and Teller's character ultimately want the same thing, to be the best. This movie is really intense as well. This is the most tense I have ever been in a movie that never fires a shot. I LOVE this ending too. This is a great ending to a great movie.

The best part though is how it displays that even the most brutal if people are still people. Fletcher (Simmons) isn't just some asshole, the film displays how his goal is to push his students to reach their potential.

            "content": "Whiplash, as the name suggests, packs a serious punch. There hasn't been a musical movie, or any movie for that matter, that gives such intense human relationship. The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors, it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm. Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well, audience can't help to be drawn to its excellent tension.\n\nAndrew Nieman (Milles Teller) is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools. He's recruited by Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a well-known teacher who's searching for a new musician to join his band. Nieman is a very dedicated young man, he strives to win Fletcher's approval but little did he know that Fletcher's method of teaching is rather unorthodox. The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities, overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior. Lots of stick with barely any carrot.\n\nThe two are embroiled in an odd relationship, and both leads perform magnificently. Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise. Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic, he's a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy. From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing, it could be unnerving at times, in the best possible way. If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider-Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor, they would have been truly amazing.\n\nCamerawork captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close-up, it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene, allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting. However, when the music hits, it goes into high gears. Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum, characters' subtle expressions or winces, down to the blood and sweat. The film's editing is wonderfully fitting, each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments. It's powerful, inevitably engrossingly.\n\nWhiplash is a monster of a movie, never skipping a beat. Rude, brash but stylishly captivating.",

His monologue near the end of the film could hold its own, even against the legendary Glengarry Glen Ross \"always be closing\" speech delivered by Alec Baldwin in '92. All else aside, this film is a glimpse into the life of a student who just wants the be \"one of the greats\" and a teacher who doesn't settle for anything less than perfect. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.\n\nAndrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.\n\n\nI had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, \"run the table now,\" he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.\n\nI lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.\n\nMy expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.\n\nRecommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.\n\nRe-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.\n\nMemorable: I am still thinking about this film.",

The score of the movie was fantastic and kept me into it the whole time.\n\nMiles Teller (Andrew) really showed his acting chops. The kid was amazing when it came to the drumming and his expressions truly demonstrated his desire and struggles of becoming the best. Bad news for Miles was that the best actor category was so crowed this year, he really didn't have a shot of getting nominated.\n\nOn the other hand, J.K. Simmons (Fletcher)  probably delivers one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen in film. Every time he was on the screen the audience was in the movie. I wanted more of this character since he was so interesting, you really never understand him, not even after the ending. Anytime where it was just Miles and others, the film was strong, but with J.K. Simmons, the film was incredible.\n\nThe ending of this film is probably one of the best endings I have seen in awhile. I don't want to ruin anything so you'll have to see it for yourself.\n\nThe script was funny, intense, and so over the top. From the first 5 minutes I was already sold that this film was going to bed good. Whiplash is worth the money to watch it on the big screen and then some.\n\n4.8 / 5 stars",

The movie spends a full 3/4 of the time rushing and dragging between conflict fueled classes to movie dates with dad. We do find consistency in J.K. Simmons - unfortunately it's in his monotone performance, cantankerously pounding us over our collective moviegoer heads with his curmudgeonly confrontational verbal beatings. Simmons plays the part of asshole really well. Just look at him as Peter Parker's boss J. Jonah Jameson. This is basically the same character, minus the cartoonish moustache and cigar. Unfortunately, the similarity between those two films doesn't stop there. As our protagonist sits in a cafe telling his girlfriend they need to break up so he can dedicate his life to his calling, did nobody see that they were re-filming Spiderman 2 and Peter Parker breaking up with M.J.? The only thing missing was Doc Ock throwing a sedan through the window. The shining moment of this film is the last 30 minutes when it really finds its timing, as does our protagonist. Unfortunately it's not enough to redeem the first 80 minutes. In the end, a good movie, but one I feel is out of its league as a Best Picture nominee, as is Simmons' nod for Best Supporting Actor.",

Originally a 4/5 during the first act, then a 4.5/5 during the second and third act and a perfect 5/5 in the final 10 minutes of the movie before the credits starts rolling.\n\nI am unfamiliar with classical music but I like how this movie does not isolate the audience who have no idea about the genre. In fact, I have learned a little bit more about classical music thanks to this movie. I like movies that make me learn and open-minded about certain things.\n\nWhiplash has some of the greatest performances. We all know that J.K. Simmons is talented as hell. He became a different person in this movie, not as an actor in a movie. He isn't some guy who voiced Tenzin in The Legend of Korra. In this movie, he is a psychopathic selfish scary douchebag and he owned that role like he was born to play him! Miles Teller is also a great actor in this movie. He manages to pull off the emotions and thoughts of his character very well that he is invested to his own character and ended up being the character in the movie and not some actor in a movie. That goes the same with J.K. Simmons. Both of them are brilliant actors!\n\nWhiplash's plot pace is slow but not dragging at all. Mainly because there is almost no subplot. This movie is straightforward with its main plot. Sure, you can consider the romance between Miles Teller's character and the love interest played by Melissa Benoist (another great actress) a subplot. That's why I said almost earlier in this paragraph.\n\nIn the technical work in this movie, it's brilliantly perfect. The screenplay is of course excellent. The camerawork was on cue without any hint of error. The editing elevates the camerawork brilliantly. The cinematography is excellent and of course, the directing is perfect.\n\nWhiplash is a brilliant psychological drama thanks to its brilliant performances from J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller, on point plot and on time pace and excellent production values. Does this movie deserve an Oscar nomination? Yes absolutely.",

Anyway, back to Whiplash, i imagine, storytellers haven't had enough of romanticising pseudo-intense, military-style, mercurial old bats whose penchant for physically hurting and mentally flogging their team members into shape really should qualify them as psychos, or at the very least, sadistic jerks, but oh wait, they have a tiny speck of gold in their hearts and in their genius brains, and that's worth all the pain, right? \nWell, that's Whiplash in those many words for you. \n\nFor those who tend to be discerning about the technical aspects of music theory/performance, this is bound to come across as somewhat coarse and disappointing as well.\n\nAlthough the storyline and the pace weren't problematic per se, very little was done convincingly enough to convey the actual motivations, or the histories, behind the characters' actions and behaviours. And wherever such attempts were made, they were either awkwardly written, poorly staged, or featured some uneasy camera work, or all of the above.\n\nThe performances saved quite a few instances of such clumsiness, but ultimately left me with a feeling of 'quoi?!'",

A film that truly pushes the envelope, constantly having you gasping with how far it goes without ever feeling unnatural or forced.

            "content": "Intensely absorbing and energetic with two great performances\n\nWhiplash is only the second movie of 2014 that overly exceeded my expectations (first one being Nightcrawler). Being neither a fan of jazz music nor finding a much stellar cast in this one I must say I was highly impressed. Whiplash is a tightly wound experience that puts forth the intense relationship of a student with his literally brutal mentor. Whiplash provides ample scope for deep study of its characters and their psychology.\n\nMiles Tellers plays Andrew Nieman an aspiring Jazz drummer who is confident and talented. One day at his music school the iconic main school band teacher Terrence Fletcher (memorably performed by J.K. Simmons) observers Andrew practicing. He sees some spark in Andrew but isn't fully convinced of what he is capable of. Fortunately for Andrew on another fine day Fletcher storms into their class asking each student to play what he wants and Andrew impresses playing something which he is very good at. Flecther brings in Andrew into the main school band as an alternative drummer. In order to become the main drummer Andrew has to face the seriously exhaustive and physically draining teaching methodology of Fletcher. Fletcher's motive behind all this is to find the next big jazz star in his students for which believes one should defy the limits. While Andrew is highly motivated and inspired climbing the ladder of success slowly but is unknowingly degrading his personal life. He is unable to keep up with his girlfriend and also ends up with family issues. Whiplash tries to portray what we mind end up with trying to achieve perfection in our field. The ultimate successful moment is very rewarding but many of the earlier hardships and sacrifices get overshadowed.\n\nBreaking down the various aspects of the film, the thing that stands out is the performances by the two leads. Miles Teller driving the enthusiasm and energy into the character of highly motivated drummer is really inspiring. While J.K. Simmon's pitch perfect portrayal of the furiously scary mentor was raw and brutal. Even if the character was unforgettable one thing I would like point out is that it would have been better if more light was shed on Flethcer personal life which would have made his character slightly more believable. After the acting, the terrific music and soundtrack absolutely sucked me into the jazz atmosphere.The track 'Whiplash' over which Flecther throws a chair at Miller for not reaching the perfection is mesmerizing. Whiplash has made me a fan of jazz music out of nowhere. The editing and cinematography is splendid which we can see that in the intense and energetic drumming sequences which will keep you glued to the screen. The final drumming sequence in the climax was so exhilarating, it gave me goosebumps. Director Damien Chazelle who wrote the script himself keeps the screenplay focused on the two main characters. The story is quite unpredictable and you can expect some twists here and there. I found it hard to believe when I read somewhere that the whole film was shot in 19 days. Nothing more to say. Excellent.\n\nTo sum it up, Whiplash is one movie of 2014 not to be missed. 2014 has been really outstanding with films like 'Boyhood', 'Birdman', 'Nightcrawler', etc. and now another gem called 'Whiplash'. I am thankful for witnessing such quality film-making. Excellent performances with absorbing story and direction plus the jazz music on top of it made Whiplash a memorable experience which stayed with me for hours after finishing it. It is energetically inspiring and heartfelt. Don't miss it.\n\nRATING: [4.5/5]",

            "content": "Holy shit, just give J.K. Simmons his Oscar. This film. Is about an eager music student played by Miles Teller, who gets the opportunity to play in Schafer university's most revered jazz group under the direction of T. Fletcher played wonderfully by Simmons. The film features some great jazz ensembles, fun drum solos, wonderful cinematography and acting.\nOne does not have to be a music major in order to appreciate this film. Similar to \"Black Swan\" where the focus is not on actual art (like ballet) it's more focused on the profile of these characters, how hard they will push to attain their goals, or how tempted will they be to gain approval. I thought I'd never say it but the annoying kid from Projext X also needs a nomination. Teller does a great job of presenting to the audience of a character that is striving really hard to be something. His character eliminates any support from the outside world to perfect his talent. He isolates himself from his family and girlfriend. He outright disrespects others in the jazz ensemble in order to maintain his role in the group. Teller's character is so desperate that he will avoid any physical signs of hurt or pain in order to play in the ensemble. This film depicts a good example of anxiety, depression and obsession. Teller's character becomes a prick to others in order to perfect his craft, however I don't think this would be considered to be a character arc. Why, because I feel that his character has always been like that. Being in a class with a ruthless band leader only enabled him to become so obsessed that he blocks out any outside support. Being part of the best jazz ensemble in New York only fed into his ego. Teller has a borderline personality disorder. From the beginning we can tell that he is somewhat of an introvert, he doesn't socialize with anyone at his old music class and his social network really consist of his father. Besides his girlfriend that he he attained after finally mustering up confidence after being accepted in the band of his dream; Neiman has no friends, however he has an inflated view of self. Friends are in intricate part of anyone's life because they act as a support network for confidence, and it helps us realize how others view us. Which, let's be honest, we view ourselves differently than others view us. It doesn't matter how others perceive you, we will always view ourselves to the highest regard. Neiman has always had an inflated view of himself as a special drummer. Evident in the dinner scene where he shuns his siblings goals. Neiman realizes that he's the black sheep in the family. This role has made him highly competitive with his siblings in order to gain acceptance and respect amongst his family. Also, in the beginning Andrew doesn't seem happy to be with the band he started out with prior to joining Fletcher's ensemble. Probably because he feels as if that band was not on his level of talent. There are so many examples that feed into the disorder of the character. Also teller does a great job on the drums.\nNow to the performance that everyone is talking about, J.K. Simmons. Not only is his character a great villain but also what i may consider to be one of the greatest movie villains of all time. If AFI updated there list of villains I would not be surprised to see him on that list. This is the type of villian that makes you (the viewer) cringe when someone in the band screws up. Teller's character is about perfection but it ain't shit compared to how maniacal Simmons character is portrayed. A great quote about \"The worst thing to hear is Good job\" and his story about Charlie Parker, sums up this character. We can tell that his character wants to get the best potential out of his students but he will go through blood, sweat and tears to get it. J.K. Simmons present this character as unpredictable, you don't know when he will throw a chair or just start yelling. He pulls off a great stoic performance, which is why it creeps us out when he is pissed. We the audience understands that he is angry however we don't know what action he will take next to express it. Simmons character is both physically and emotionally abusive. However he played the character just right, he could've easily went into r. Lee emery territory with Full Metal Jacket. But Simmons plays the role just right, some of the stuff he says is somewhat funny (if you have a dark sense of humor) but is still disturbing. \nThe cinematography adds to the disturbing atmosphere of this film. The colors are very warm, it has a nice late-night jazz club look to it. The colors or dark and light is dimmed. The dark atmosphere inside the band room really heightens the intensity of the performances (preferably J.K. Simmons). This is an excellent use of camera work and direction to enhance the film.\nOverall, Simmons has done a memorable performance. A role so great that I may be frightened if I see him in another one of those Farmer's insurance commercials. He deserves whatever award  is granted to him. Mr. Fletcher will be one of the best villians in film history.",

It was really a great story in how it was down to earth about a profession like music and how it is a cut throat industry and the time and effort put into success!

Just to start off the cast in Whiplash was great, Miles Teller truly lead this cast but the one that came out on top was J.K. Simmons. The second he walks into the room you feel the authority of his character just making you nervous in your seat. I truly loved this film and felt the whole soundtrack was great, even though I don't listen to much jazz it was awesome. A great story about a drummer that gets the opportunity of a lifetime and just won't give up no matter what tries to get in his way. The film even feels more real if you know going in that Miles actually learned how to play drums for this role. Every time he just played was fantastic to watch and always put a smile on my face, I couldn't look away. The pain and stride his character goes through really makes you feel for him and stay by his side. I feel this is a huge runner up for best picture, right behind Birdman. J.K. Simmons deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor as his performance was just so gripping. No matter if you like Jazz or not Whiplash is a fantastic film to enjoy.",

He was perfect for the role, and speaking of perfect for the role J.K. Simmons was the perfect size for this shoe. His raw emotion, anger, pushing ability is relentless, and that is what makes it so damn good. The storyline is pretty basic, a great motivational plot that is definitely inspiring. The directing and cinematography is top notch, the music is beautiful, I could go on and on with praises for this film.

            "content": "Totalitarian discipline and chaotic jazz meet in Danmien Chazelle's \"Whiplash,\" the former drummer's second full-length feature based on his 2013 short film of the same name. \n\nMiles Teller plays dedicated music student Andrew who is determined to be not only a great but legendary drummer. He has already made it into a respected conservatory, but that's not enough. He needs to be noticed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the most notorious and infamous jazz teacher in the school. He is, and soon gets to play second fiddle to Fletcher's main drums student. It becomes immediately apparent that all bets are off within Fletcher's classroom, no method of teaching too brutal.\n\n\"Whiplash\" can basically be reviewed with one sentence: a largely useless script directed with exceptional vision. The dialogue is weak, the themes unfocused, the plot predictable yet implausible, but it's all told through such a wonderful jazzy cacophony that the film ends up being much more captivating than it earns to be.\n\nThere's been a lot of praise for the main acting duo, and they do fortunately make most of their roles. Simmons redoes his Schillinger from prison series \"Oz\" and Teller portrays an arrogant and ultimately obsessed student with conviction. This is fortunate, as the characters are both scripted in a frustratingly calculating manner; Fletcher an authoritarian despot with underscored moments of softness or what tries very hard to be character depth, Andrew a driven and largely unsympathetic victim slash worshipper of his teacher. \n\nBoth men are engulfed by mania, spiraling into a power dynamic of sadomasochistic dimensions. Fletcher eats at Andrew's humanity and Andrew is willing to let it all be eaten in the altar of success. Family and love become meaningless as a singular goal fills his whole existence.\n\nWhat \"Whiplash\" might be at its best is a psychological examination of sinister social phenomena. The dynamic it presents begs to be taken as a human-scale depiction of totalitarian seduction or descent into extremism. Chazelle doesn't force feed the interpretation, though. On the contrary, the film makes a strong case for Fletcher's methods philosophically while condemning them psychologically. Totalitarian regimes sometimes are truly efficient. It's usually a smart move to leave a piece of fiction open to differing interpretations, but here it seems a bit like an incongruous cheat that reduces the overall plausibility even further.\n\nThe jazz is amazing. Sharone Meir's cinematography and Tom Cross's editing complement the killer soundtrack perfectly. Every drum solo is almost unbearably dramatic. Watching Fletcher and Andrew and listening to the music makes you feel keenly the way Fletcher's methods are tarnishing the beauty of what is being created with them. The manic drive for perfection seems especially obscene as the music enchants through its freedom of creativity.",

I'm giving this one two stars, both for Teller's great performance.",

Whiplash is an energetic film complimented with a great script and an outstanding performance from its star J.K. Simmons. This film is the 'Rocky' of the music genre film in more ways than one and J.K. Simmons has a Rocky story of his own. An actor whose stunning performance is destined to take him from a career of supporting cast obscurity into the limelight at 60. Whiplash though owes its success in a larger part to the great pacing of the film. The film doesn't lag at any moment which is felicitous as it's a film in which the jazz class at the school rehearse the emphatic jazz melody 'Whiplash'. Importantly you don't have to be a fan of Jazz or even music to enjoy this film of sturm und drang.",

Simmons, the former finally proving he can be taken seriously as an actor and the latter giving a career, Oscar-level performance that hopefully leads to bigger and better opportunities for him.

I understand that to become the best at something you have to be pushed to the limit, but it was very unpleasant to watch in Whiplash. Our lead, Andrew, was given almost no introduction or development, apart from that he likes playing drums. Then we meet the teacher, and boy is a psycho. JK Simmons probably does portray him well, but again there is no real justification for this type of extreme character. The completely linear story line, and lack of character development left me disappointed with 'Whiplash'. One thing's for sure though, there will never be a drum kit under the Christmas tree for me.",

You will either  love or hate or at times go through both emotions with Simmons character, but that doesn't diminish the performance nonetheless.  Miles Teller is very good as the student who is singular in focus, but suffers through being a teenager trying to make it as well.  Even if you don't like jazz music  of which I'm no huge  fan, the music is great but not overpowering in the film until it needs to take front and center.  Certainly on of my great movie surprises of 2014 and deserving of the award attention it is getting.",

            "content": "When I first considered viewing the phenomena that is the 5-time Oscar nominated 'Whiplash' it was with a small amount of trepidation believing that this was a Rudy character study of overcoming tremendous odds in the world of contemporary Jazz.  I was, however, revitalized during the film to learn how wrong my assumptions were, this film was about overcoming odds, but on a much grander scale... at least that's what the film would have you believe.  And it did, the film was successful in it's endeavor to make me believe that the goal of prestigious Jazz instructor (J.K. Simmons) to find and mentor a legend on par with Charlie Parker and the methods he employs to achieve this goal.\n\n     All the performances given in this move were on point with the depth and complexity that was certainly on the page.  Miles Teller is always engaging and keeps the audience on the side of his character Andrew which at times is a difficult gambit with his single minded focus and drive.  Personally I find him representative of a younger set of interesting actors who are more Dustin Hoffman than Brad Pitt, not that he is necessarily an everyman, but you aren't likely to see him on a Calvin Klein billboard anytime soon.  J.K. Simmons is more or less playing the same character as Teller, just from a different point of life, career, and potential; his Oscar nomination is well deserved and if you're familiar with his work dating back to Oz through parts on several Coen Brothers films and of course in the Spiderman franchise, this won't be a total shock.  Watch also for Paul Reiser, who makes hay with the small amount of screen time he does have, especially the understated performance his gives in the closing scene.\n\n     The real surprise of this move for me is how much I enjoyed the music; not being a particular fan of Jazz I found the selections engaging and also exceptionally listenable as this is a real music movie considering the fact that we are mostly following one character and his obsessive practicing of the same pieces.   On that note it's important to notice how claustrophobic the cinematography is and how effective it is in conveying the personal nature of the film but also demonstrating the cramped spaces that I'm certain the best musicians in New York must suffer considering the premium on real estate that they endure.  \n\n\tIn closing 'Whiplash' has my highest recommendation, it set out to demonstrate how and what costs are involved with developing a legend, but doesn't overstep it's bounds and become fantastical.  Balanced and nuanced, great music and performances, in the age where the zeitgeist seems to be screaming for an original story that doesn't rely on special effects to wow an audience this is one that needs your support to ensure more of its ilk have an opportunity to see the celluloid of day.",

But he will also fight for a position in a band that he feels is deservedly his. The film is one that will make audiences uncomfortable. \"Whiplash\" is unlike any other film before it about a student and teacher. It challenges the norm and takes that unconventional path leading to its third and final act. It is a complex study of two minds and Chazelle manages to tell the story in a riveting fashion.\n\nPsychologically and emotionally powerful, it is an uncompromising look and deep study of a descent into madness inasmuch as it is a triumphant journey of an ascent to greatness.

He delves so far into the character that it becomes hard to forget he's not like that in real life. His character is very well developed and every time he is on screen, he steals the scene. Miles Teller has a lot to do and while he isn't as strong as JK Simmons, he pulls his weight and he's equally compelling. The story is well told and the ending is just superb. It was my favourite ending of 2014, you literally want to stand up and cheer at the end. I remember thinking, \"I hope it ends right here it would be so awesome!\" And it did! Definitely check this one out when you can!",

This is without question one of the best films I have seen, thanks mainly to the riveting turns from both Simmons (who gives a legendary turn that will not be forgotten) and Teller (matching his co-star every step of the way), but also how director Damien Chazelle develops his story and introduces shocking twists and turns along the way. This movie is a masterpiece, and every sequence, especially the grand finale, is masterfully handled.",

I think this is really unfair. He tries to break him down from who he is, to make him work hard. He works so hard that he sweats and bleeds for the position. He makes it, but then everything goes down hill. He gets in a wreck and doesn't play well, making him cut from the position. Afterwards he does a case, but privately so Fletcher won't know it's him. Later when he plays for Fletcher again, he knew it was him and he does the same abuse to him that he did before. Neyman finally gets tired by it and tries to show him how good this is,  but this still gives Fletcher the power to control how long he does.\n\nThe movie all and all is good, but the relationship they have makes me resent Fletcher more and makes me happy that Neyman finally proves to him how good he is.",

But what Whiplash have in store is a great acting by Miles Teller and JK Simmons combined that dragged you into this film. JK Simmons gave the best performance that only gifted actors have. His character is one of the best characters I've ever seen in movies from this decade. JK Simmons is the antagonist in this film that dragged and pushed Miles Teller beyond his limits to the point where his passion becomes obsession. I'll talk about spoilers now. Miles Teller became a great drummer and probably the best drummer in the world base on the movie, and JK Simmons is the one who made him that. That's what I like the best. Simmons is a villain that is also significant in the hero's life itself. That's what made Whiplash and the character Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) gave me, an exceptional film that would leave you in awe. Overall, I am not surprised if Whiplash will win the best picture of this year's Academy Awards and JK Simmons for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role.",

He plays the perfection obsessed conductor/teacher of a Jazz school orchestra who accepts nothing less than perfection of his students.  \n\nI liked the movie because of my experience as a 16 year veteran of the San Francisco Opera. The obsession for perfection is real. I see it in every singer, musician, actor, director, conductor, manager, stage hand and everyone else. The truth of this movie is real, anything less than perfection will not be tolerated.\n\nThis movie should be liked by anyone who was ever in a band, in the music industry, interested in the music industry or just wants to see amazing acting.

When the villain of a movie does his evil deeds and it makes me want to jump into the movie and punch him in the face, that's the sign that the movie has a great antagonist. I've never hated a \"bad guy\" in a movie since Ivan Drago in Rocky IV.

He is accepted into an exclusive jazz group by an extremely tough (and that's an understatement) director who pushes his students using very extreme measures. The story is literally that simple, there isn't some intricate plot with deep motives and complicated twists and turns, it's simply a battle between one instructor who demands perfection and one student who wants to attain it. Yet I cannot express to you how much I loved this movie. The easy thing for them to do would have been to write J.K. Simmons' character as just a pure evil presence who does nothing but scream and seethe for an hour and a half. Yet Damien Chazelle wrote the character with emotional depth and Simmons pulled off an out-of-this-world performance that nailed everything from rage to sorrow to joy. Miles Teller matches Simmons by showing amazing passion and drive which is essential for this role. What was really remarkable was how Teller still managed to make Andrew a likable character that we were rooting for despite the way he put drumming before the people in his life.\n\nIt's hard for me to explain why I'm so passionate about Whiplash. All I know is that my wife and I literally talked about it non-stop for about 2 hours after we left the theater and I was extremely anxious to tell others about the experience. I became so invested in the story of this movie that I tensed up repeatedly, despite the fact that all they were showing was a kid drumming. Not since Gravity have I left a movie theater feeling like I'd been through something so intense and dramatic. I swear I almost wasn't breathing for the last 10 minutes of the movie. The writing is so solid, and they cut together the scenes just right to keep the story moving. So many scenes stuck with me, and I almost wanted to go right back and watch the movie again that same day. The cinematographer used some great camera moves that added something to a number of scenes and just accentuated the emotions the audience was feeling. I even loved the music that they played in the film, and how the ending allows the audience to draw their own conclusions. I was close to holding back my rating for this film because it's hard for me to give a perfect rating to a movie I just saw for the first time but considering how much I have raved about Whiplash, and how I can't get it out of my mind, I honestly can't think of what it could have done better. This is a great film that I cannot recommend more!",

Teller is a determined percussionist that wants to succeed by all means. Simmons is an abusive authoritative music instructor that has no limits. In the end he breaks the young percussionist. The film sheds light on an area of art that many people overlook. It also shows us that success comes with many sacrifices. Sometimes that sacrifice can be your own well being. It also shows the power of an authoritative figure and explores the gray area of abuse to our someone harder. There's just so much greatness in Whiplash. Well worth of its Oscar noms.",

His biggest obstacle appears to be his tutor and leader of the band he aspires to play with: one Terence Fletcher, superbly played by J.K. Simmons. On more than one occasion we suspect that Fletcher is imbued with a touch of sadism. And it almost feels as if - rather like the son forever trying to please an impervious father -  Neyman, wittingly or unwittingly, becomes the perfect submissive victim. Perhaps there is a clue in the title after all! But, risky as it may have been, I would have preferred it to have been pursued if that was the intention. I certainly feel there was further room for manoeuvre as far as the development of the two central characters was concerned.   \nEven so, at times this is as taut as the drum-skin that Neyman pounds.

            "content": "One simple word springs to mind when I think of Whiplash. Just one word... \"Oz\". \nThose are that familiar with the HBO series that ran from 1997 to 2003 will no doubt remember the brutal intensity of the white supremacist character Vern Schillinger. It was one of my first experiences of actor J.K. Simmons and ever since then I've been a big fan. Now I'm not suggesting that Simmons is the only thing about this film that strikes you but he'll mostly be the thing that leaves you continually thinking about it. \n\nAt a highly prestigious music school, 19 year old Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is determined to prove his worth as a drumming student. However, in order to prove himself he has to go through the exacting conductor Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is a man who accepts nothing but the best and to impress him becomes an arduous ordeal for young Neiman.\n\nInspirational teachers are often depicted in film with great respect and admiration. They often touch the hearts of their pupils and bring out the best in them. In Oscar nominated turns, Richard Dreyfuss' played music teacher Glenn Holland in the little-seen Mr. Holland's Opus and as the passionate English professor John Keating, the late Robin Williams achieved the same in Dead Poets Society. Two thoroughly heartwarming characters that inspired their students to want to learn and grow. Whiplash, however, takes an altogether different path; J.K. Simmons' Terence Fletcher certainly inspires his students but it's not through admiration or respect, it's through spite and a determination to prove his vehement criticism wrong. As a result, the film becomes a highly charged, back and forth, exchange between teacher and pupil. \n\nThe back and forth tension between the two characters almost reflect the instrument at the centre of the film itself; caught in the snare or Fletcher's marching bass, Neiman is like the clashing symbol trying to break out. There's a constant beat between them that director Damien Chazelle captures wonderfully. He has complete control over his scenes and when the moment is called upon to hold tight and build the tension, he does so with the ability of a director with twice his experience. Added to which, he manages to maintain this approach until the very end making Whiplash a great achievement in only his second film (after the Jazz musical Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench in 2009 he originally delivered Whiplash as a short film which won the Short Film Jury prize at Sundance Film Festival before being funded for a feature length film).\n\nIn order for Chazelle to realise his vision, though, he must have the actors to pull it off and he does; Young Miles Teller breaks free from his earlier romantic comedy roles to deliver a work of real maturity while Simmons is simply electrifying. As mentioned earlier, though, if you've seen Oz then this will be of no surprise to you. He's an absolutely ferocious and towering presence that dominates every scene he's involved in. Having already won numerous critical and festival awards including the Golden Globe - as well as being hotly tipped to take the Best Supporting Actor Oscar - it finally looks like Simmons has caught people's attention. I can only say... it's about fucking time. Simmons has been doing outstanding work for over 20 years now. No matter how big or small or how dramatic or comedic, he always delivers and no one, at this time, is more deserving of praise for their efforts than this man. Welcome Mr. Simmons! There's certainly no need for introductions. It's always a pleasure having you.\n\nAn intensely powerful and personal film that turns, what could be a generic and dull drama, into one that's gripping and absorbing from the offset. It's masterfully directed and outstandingly performed and when films of this nature creep up on the 'bigger' films of the year it not only demands your attention, it's deserving of it.\n\nMark Walker",

To become brilliant at something you have to be obsessive and driven otherwise it is not going to happen. Yes the characters do not seem to have many dimensions. That is because the single-minded obsession to be a brilliant musician leaves little room for anything else. However, even that is not true as is alluded to by the stilted attempt at dating which is quickly jettisoned if there is a hint it might what is required to become brilliant. This obviously portends the inevitable relationship difficulties a musician will face. I know. Been there. Obsessed myself to death. Practised all night and all day. Chastised myself to death. I know loads of musicians in the same tram lines of thought and behaviour, and indeed artists and sportsmen/women.

            "content": "A first-year music student out of his depths. A brilliant, yet terrifying music conductor blissfully ignorant to the repercussions of his actions. A battleground of music sheets, slapping, blood, sweat and tears. Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is a simple movie, with a simple premise, a spectrum of colorful language and two of the best performances of 2014. With one of the tightest scripts, and a highly personal, vivid style of cinematography and unforgiving editing in recent years, Chazelle's virtuoso in directing the elements in his movie barely gives his audience any breathing room as he progressively turns the movie into a chaotic and paradoxically symphonic battleground by pitting Neimann and Fletcher against each other.\n\nGoing so far as to drop the possibility of a personal life, Neimann's inherent urge to prove his family wrong by being one of the best drummers of the 21st century has him entering the crosshairs of Fletcher, the master of puppets masquerading as a macho conductor that instils fear into the souls of his students in an attempt to push those under him to succeed. As Fletcher's latest target and a greenhorn of the band, Neimann bears the brunt of the torture while his classmates look away in fear. Just when the movie appears to lose steam and turn predictable, Fletcher throws a steel chair at the viewer's head as he violently steers the movie into a different, unexpected direction, as both Neimann and him continue their struggle for dominance and respect over the other.\n\nWhiplash works due to how simple it sounds on paper, but instead reveals a deep, introspective character study of two very different individuals for those who dig deep enough, and how the core story only ever lies on the varying forms of interaction between Neimann and Fletcher, along with their personal, perfectionist obsessions to give them the fuel, fire and that which they desire. As their relationship and characterization were something that Chazelle progressively developed, the script was also aided by the performance of both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons' outstanding show of manic dedication and gravitas respectively towards bringing their characters to life.\n\nSimmons transforms the very act of verbally berating and physically abusing a music student into a hypnotic, disturbing art form with a physical performance that oozes nothing but grim, pitch black Lovecraftian terror, while Miles Teller puts up an act as a perfectionist turned victim of abuse that finally snaps into one deserving of riotous acclaim. Neither should be praised over the other as their performance and characters are symbiotically reliant on bouncing and leeching off each other, as both deliver an outstanding performance in their own unique and twisted way.",

            "content": "\"Whiplash\" is an intense look at the competitive nature of conservatory training and the old-school teachers that fuel the fire.  The tone is set from the slow snare accelerando that opens the film over a blank screen.  While the language was brutal, this film tears down the glamorous image of show business and demonstrates what it really takes to be a professional musician.   Any person who plays jazz or loves to listen to it will enjoy the stories, the attitude, and the music.  I don't understand how Justin Hurwitz didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this incredible jazz-based score.  The complexity of the title song that begins in 7/8 and continually changes meters is accompanied by the tamer incidental music that keeps our minds on jazz from start to finish.  But the main reason to see this film is J.K. Simmons, who taps into a dark place that I have never seen from him.  He has forever been known as a character actor (my favorite role being Mr. Pancake in \"The Ladykillers\"), but this will slingshot his late career and probably win him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The character, based off of the director's real life high school jazz band conductor, is a little overdramatic at times but embodies the old-school mentality of motivating through a demand for perfection.  The story has a few surprises, none of M. Night Shyamalan proportions, but its energy and intensity is enough to drive it from start to finish.  One of the most important aspects of the film is that the music is genuine.  Most of the cast is comprised of professional musicians and Miles Teller is actually playing these charts.  The combination of Teller's own rock drumming experience and two months of \"jazz drumming bootcamp\" (ironically provided by Nate Lang, his rival in the movie), we see Teller's real drumming chops every time that he is seated at the set.  But what about that incredible Caravan drum solo?  Editor Tom Cross \"created\" this drum solo by splicing together pieces of drum solos played by Teller over the course of TWO DAYS!  The solo itself gives this film a shot at an Oscar for Best Editing.  Even if Teller cannot play any of these pieces straight through, I am so thankful that director Damien Chazelle chose to cast legitimate musicians and add an extra layer of realism to the film.  The final product is stunning and will keep you on the edge of your seat as much as any action movie or sports drama out there.  It won't win the Oscar for Best Picture, but it actually has a shot at Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing, even against \"Interstellar.\"  \"Whiplash\" tells a gripping story through great acting, intense dialogue, the intimidation that many of us have felt in a heated band rehearsal, and a truly awesome ending - Damien Chazelle has composed a masterpiece.",

Nevertheless, this is quite a surprising film and ramps up to be a true testament to what one student will go through, to what lengths he will endure; both physical and emotional tests to match up to the impossible expectations of JK Simmons' overbearing and abusive teacher at an elite jazz music school. Simmons is amazing in this, both funny and terrible at the same time,and the whip smart editing is also a huge help.",

            "content": "Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons star in one of the most surprising films in recent years Whiplash; a film that is so powerful and emotionally driven it will literally leave you speechless when the credits roll. This movie has an insane amount of hype following it and it is very rare that a film follows through. Whiplash is this weird exception because it follows through on the hype and the delivers even more. This is a very fast paced, very intense, and exceeding rewarding film that will inspire you as well as leaving a lasting impression. The story here revolves around a young man named Andrew who has a passion for playing drums in a jazz band at his school. When Terrance Fletcher, the most acclaimed maestro on campus, notices him and invites him to play for him; Andrew is pushed to every limit imaginable and thus we have our movie. This film is both written and directed by Damien Chazelle and he delivers one of the most well written films that I have seen in recent years. His script flushes out his characters perfectly, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and it actually leaves a lasting impression on you. His directing skills are also top notch here. This was filmed in 19 days and you would think they spent months on this film. Every shot is masterfully done and the ending scene in particular is nothing short of a masterpiece. The film stars up and coming actor Miles Teller as Andrew and Teller really shines here. His delivery is both charming and heartbreaking and he just proves even more that he is going to be a big name actor very soon. As great as Teller is, the performance of the film however goes to J.K. Simmons as Terrance Fletcher. Simmons is simply mesmerizing here as Fletcher. Simmons brings this air of comedy and fear that really hasn't been seen in a movie of this caliber since R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket. When Simmons screams you can't help but tremble and the whole time he is on screen there is always a feeling of intimidation that is accomplished by sheer screen presence. Simply, Simmons has delivered a performance to remember here. I honestly have no complaints what so ever about this movie. Everything here fires on all cylinders and never lets up. Whiplash is a intense and deep psychological thriller that will leave you in amazement by the time the credits roll. See Whiplash as soon as you can, this is one you simply shouldn't miss.",

Miles Turner continues his streak of great lead performances, this time playing someone so driven to be the best he punishes himself more than anyone, and he knows it.  He also looks quite believable playing the drums.  He is matched brilliantly by J.K. Simmons in a long deserved Oscar winning performance, who straddles the line of both a sadist & a teacher who wants to bring out the best in his students (you're never sure which till the very end), and you will find yourself laughing & cringing at each verbal barb he delivers.  Behind the camera, Chazelle keeps the story lean & focused on the two main characters (the only subplot is a romantic one that is cut short at the right time), while delivering some gorgeous music sequences (you will be wanting the soundtrack after watching this).  Plus, he shows that Andrew is just as hard on himself as Fletcher is, if not harder, and is probably a lot like him (a revealing dinner scene demonstrates).  Overall, one of the best films of 2014 and still Chazell's best film.",

He pours in his sweat and blood, literally, to get where he wants. And pushing him beyond his limits is the unrelenting teacher, played by J K Simmons, who believes it's an absolute necessity to push people beyond what's expected, and he won't accept anything short of perfection. \n\nThings turn sour and you may think Simmons might end up being nothing but an angry vicious vindictive teacher, but he is a lot more than that, so is Teller who shows you just can't beat him down so easily. It's the journey of these two that keeps you hooked. From the opening \"Whiplash\" to the final end-game with \"Caravan\". \n\nThis movie captures more than the art of story-telling. It captures the art of music as well, with brilliant Jazz set pieces and drumming solos. Simmons certainly leads the running for best supporting actor, but Miles Teller is the one underrated here. His best performance till date.\n\nP.S. - Yes he is actually playing those drums, though not in one go, it has been excellently edited and pieced together. Also, this is the director's second film!!!",

Without a single doubt, this is the most intense movie-going experience I've had in a long time. Captivating from start to finish, \"Whiplash\" is the kind of film that captures your attention and refuses to let go. Perhaps, the best way to describe this film is that it's a 'heart-pounding' roller-coaster ride which moves at the speed of lightning. Not a single moment is wasted, as director Damien Chazelle takes a relatively simple concept of Jazz drumming and by a miracle turns it into a universal story of ambition, determination and the triumph of the human spirit. The direction is highly impressive, the performances are incredible and the writing is insightful. To begin, each and every performer brings their A-game to the table. In the leading role, Miles Teller delivers a career-defining performance which surpasses set expectations. Known for his charm and charisma, he steps out of his usual comfort zone to take on an extremely challenging role. Mentally, physically and emotionally, it's not an easy character to play for any actor particularly a young star whose career is on the line. Yet, Teller rises up to the challenge to prove himself as a talent to be reckoned with. Likewise, J.K. Simmons is equally powerful as one of the most detestable movie-characters in recent history. Owning every scene he is in, the star is completely deserving of the awards-recognition he has earned for the role. It's not an overstatement to say that the film would be nothing without him. The undeniable charisma of these actors, combined with the razor-sharp writing and a beautiful soundtrack, make \"Whiplash\" one hell of a film. Despite an unrealistic ending, it's a motion picture that will definitely be remembered, talked about and celebrated in years to come.",

The film splays out like a constant sonic sound-wave, increasing in intensity before exploding into a sensational climax like the best drum solo you've ever heard. Miles Teller is superb at the centre of the film, and with it being shot in 19 days, there is every sense that the mass intensity is very much real in his journey. J. K. Simmons is terrific as Terence Fletcher, an instructor whose methods personify as brutal and breathless, but under the granite skin there appears to be a worthy cause of the brutality. You will come out of it reeling after being strained of all your stress and tension - and yet you'll jump right back in demanding an encore. Wow.",

Miles Teller also does a very good job reflecting the treatment he receives from Simmons in his personal life and even the band showing what stress can do to a person. The dedication Teller portrays in his character Andrew is unlike any of a character I have seen with a complete lack of rationalization. The movie will have you questioning J.K.

Teller has proved that he can be funny, charming, passionate, and powerful and I believ\ne that he will only continue to grow as time goes by. \n\nThe fact that this movie is one of the lowest grossing films of all time to be nominated for Best Picture is a testment to how beautiful of a film it is, (its also finally playing in a lot of smaller markets such as the QC.)

A Sundance darling when it was first seen-the story of a jazz drummer prodigy and his enigmatic, larger-than-life teacher-Whiplash is as honest a film you will see. People bleed, they sweat, and they tear in what is one concerto that never lets up. A story about undying ambition, talent and the fine margins that divide the \"doers\" from the rest, Whiplash is the embodiment of a satisfying, weighty film going experience. It is even more impressive that Chazelle (who also wrote it) has had no prior directing credits to his name for a project of this size. The performances-executed with the swagger of the highest of standards-are exceptional across the band (even the minor characters are great), but it is J.K. Simmons who will be standing in front for all to see. His norm-defying antics as a teacher are scary, brutal and just shocking to witness-keeping you on the edge of your seat, as you don't know if he will snap or laugh. This creates an equally anxious and amusing tone that beats to the drums to the end. Chazelle's directing is complimented by terrific cinematography by Sharone Mier, frenetic and detail-crazed editing by Tom Cross and all tied together by the jazz score from Justin Hurwitz. Like any award-winning band out there, Damien Chazelle conducts his ensemble of filmmakers to create a unified and exemplary experience that will never be forgotten.",

The pacing hits all the right beats (boom boom!) and the script is practically note perfect (boom tish!), this is truly refreshing piece of cinema. It really is like two heavyweights exchanging punches, metaphorically (and literally in some cases). A knockout winner for me, I can't recommend it highly enough.",

Soon he manages to become the youngest member of the school greatest orchestra and student of prestige teacher Terrence Fletcher. With his acceptance, Neiman believes that he\u00b4s on the path to greatness but eventually discovers that having Fletcher as a teacher may instead be the path towards madness. \nWith a plot revolving around a troublesome musician I expected the clich\u00e9 inspirational drama where they use every cheap trick to move your heartstrings but \"Whiplash\" astonished me by being exactly the opposite. \"Whiplash\" is a film that has almost no flaws whatsoever; it counts with mesmerizing and jaw dropping acting by both Teller and Simons but Simons manages to steal the film with an Academy Award winning performance that reminds me of R.Lee Ermey in \"Full Metal Jacket\" and is enhanced by the support provided by his costar, memorable characters, the editing is synchronized with the jazz played in the film, the music is of course beautiful,  gorgeous cinematography, an appropriate directing that manages to handle the film\u00b4s madness, sound mixing that will blow you away, the writing is at the same level as the performances, hilarious lines in the middle of the intense scenarios, an intense story revolving the protagonist psychology, a perfect pacing, a greatly executed atmosphere where you can smell the characters stress, incredibly intense scenes that just keep escalating until the films conclusion, there is not a single clich\u00e9 used in this film, a finale that will keep you on the edge of your seat and despite all the intensity this films offers it will still make you feel inspire and cheerful. The only issue that I had thought the film is that despite the intriguing relationship between mentor and student, both characters weren't as complex, I expected some ambiguity to their motives but the writing made this pair pretty straightforward. \n\"Whiplash\" is a phenomenal and intense film with two splendid performances by both lead actors. I will name it my runner-up for my favorite 2014 film (With \"Birdman\" remaining in my number one spot).",

Perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that 1974 masterpiece House of Whipcord.  \n\nThe movie called Whiplash that I saw stars J.K. Simmons as Terence, a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make General Patton wince. The film also stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a student of Terence's who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums. Andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face.\n\nI won't say that Damien Chazelle's direction is heavy-handed, but I would probably prefer to stick my head in Andrew's bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again.\n\nA word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film; go to YouTube instead and do a search for Buddy Rich. You will see the greatest drummer ever, and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over-the-top, trite, clich\u00e9d, eye-roll inducing effort. Your eyes and your ears will thank you for it.",

In this outing Miles Teller plays the role of the student on jazz drums, and Simmons plays the teacher.  The story arc is completely predictable, but I think that the moral conclusions expected of us at the end are a bit nebulous. The production values are OK visually, mostly limited by the abundance of practice room venue material.  The sound as can be expected is flawless.  This one hangs on the performances, and the screenplay. And they are strong. \n\nNot really relevant, this one rounds out my viewings of 2015 nominees for Academy Awards Best Picture.

No twists, no turns; it goes from A to B and it kind of left me wanting a bit more depth - we learn next to nothing about these two characters outside of how they interact with one another.

Simmons is brilliant as the terrifyingly ferocious, foul mouthed teacher, who everyone wants to impress but is impossible to please. Chazelle directs the film with a fitting pace and precision, the edits are on beat.\n\nWhiplash says a lot about teacher-pupil relationship and the psychological minds employed in the pursuit of greatness, raising questions of how much you need to bully someone to get the best out of them.\n\nIt's Rocky with snare drums.

JK Simmons and Miles Teller as the her and student play out a deeply twisted relationship as Teller's ambitious young drummer takes all kinds of abuse, physical and verbal, from leader of the jazz orchestra at a prestigious NY music school. \nHowever, the film has some really unusual and subversive things to say about what is acceptable in the pursuit of musical perfection. Simmons pours scorn on encouragement and praise, believing only by refusing to accept anything less than excellence can a musician improve. His methods are intense and brutal - more Joe Pesci in Goodfellas than Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting.\nOn the other hand, Teller takes it all! Ever ditching drippy girlfriend so she won't distract him and proving himself a pretty obnoxious ass himself when lording it over sports playing relatives,\nWhat I especially liked was the uncompromising lack of syrup. This is no feel good, uplifting tale. It is blackly comic and one of the most tense films I've seen in a while. It really keeps you guessing about whether Simmons actually had a heart or really,is just a mean bastard! \nGreat performances, fabulously gripping and involving. Ignore the unpromising premise.

JK Simmons won't be doing side character shit after this, he's gonna be leading it up and rightly so. You both admire and fear his reckless perfectionist composer, he may literally rip your heart out but it may just spur you into perfection. As a testament to relentless drive, dedication and focus, it's hard to think of many other films that convey the message. It's not just a montage here and there to show Andrews evolution, no we literally see his blood, sweat, and tears while his soul gets destroyed. \n\nElsewhere  I like the way the plot steers away from predictable territory, especially in the final acts and goddam if this isn't a beautifully shot picture that actually makes you think about lighting in a film. Overall it's a must watch and if you disagree, in true JK Simmons style, expect a chair to come flying your way.",

Miles Teller is a compelling young actor who doesn't look much like a movie star, but that's what made him watchable as a gifted but incredibly entitled drummer with dreams of glory and shares in Band-Aid.  The major problem is not so much the cliches in the writing, its mostly how the film is directed.  I can imagine the director talking to his editor about how he shot the film like it was a jazz piece...zig here, zag there, do some of those quick closeup montages that Paul Thomas Anderson is famous for, whip the camera back and forth between the drummer and the conductor (whiplash, get it!), cut away from the emotional finale to show Paul Reiser finally getting it, man!

Simmons and Miles Teller. We get a side to each of these actors that we haven't seen before, and this is easily Simmons' greatest performance. The film moves pretty briskly, only dragging during the unnecessary relationship drama scenes. And as was previously mentioned, the intensity of the film is certainly a high point for the film. Many scenes that show our actors being tested to their limits tend to test ours, but in a way that pays off. These scenes have slow building tension that creeps over the viewer and starts to make them feel uneasy. All of this comes together for a finale that will keep you on edge.

I think it is Simmons as the teacher Fletcher who is the star of the film. \nPart psycho? His put downs of some of his failing musical students are classic.\nJ.K.

The film is light on humour and action: the entire film is the conflict between Simmons and Teller.\nThe dark and brooding cinematography was both beautiful and atmospheric, but it became overwhelming and a little claustrophobic by the end. I was bored of watching Teller bang the drums until his hands bled and really wanted out of the practice room/darkened theatre/dorm room practice area. It didn't feel as though the characters progressed a great deal although there was some triumph.\nThe excuses for physical abuse and expletive-ridden homophobic tirades were flimsy at best but are somehow justified within the film's conclusion.

His new Jazz teacher, Terence Fletcher, is volatile and unpredictable, but dedicated to push the boundaries of what his students can achieve. Fletcher sees potential in Neiman, and pushes him to a whole new level. Let the sparks fly.\n\nThe narrative is very much a cliche of the same story we've seen many times before. However, this is unique. The relationship between Teller and Simmons is electrifying, dangerous, and in an odd way, full of love. There is a sweet respect for each other underneath the layers of both characters. Explosive drama, which leaves you on the edge of your seat. And there's a reason for that. \n\nWhiplash is heart pounding, exhilarating and tense enough to rocket you to you out of your seat, shouting with aggressive glee. It takes you over. It's astounding to watch. The stage finale will leave you in jaw dropping awe. Every smash, clash and bang that hits the drum set will send chills through your body. The glistening of sweat and blood pouring over the instrument symbolises the film perfectly.

It also amazed me to see that it was a debut for te director who also wrote the script making this a whole of a lot better. The script is snappy as well as the direction. Lots of grit with the shots with close ups and tracking shots leading the way of most of the film. It never looses form and throughout the whole film your always kept on the edge of your seat looking for the next thing that will happen. Overall whiplash is a gritty well performed, award worthy, well written and directed film that turned out to be one of the more better movies of 2014.",

The only weak part of the movie is an under-developed love story, which is all-and-all not important to the plot and could have been excluded. The cinematography in this movie is awe-striking, reflecting the drum beats with unique, unseen close-ups. Miles Teller did 75% of his own drumming for this movie, and the blood dripping from his hands onto the drum set is real. The pain and intensity he shows is real, and both he and the ever-impressive J.K. Simmons have redefined acting. This movie was robbed of a Best Picture nomination, as was Miles Teller for Best Male Lead. Damien Chazelle, a new director bursting into the industry with this film, has not only made a name for himself, but has set the bar for cinematic art.",

Miles Teller is better in this film than anything else I have seen him in, and J.K. Simmons delivers an incredible performance; he was certainly deserving of his \"Best Supporting Actor\" Oscar earlier this year.

Miles Teller is perfect as the gifted student, you really do believe every step of the way that the guy can achieve something if pushed, but you never truly know for sure if he is being pushed too far. This has all the bases covered in terms of acting, writing, and direction, with J.K Simmons brilliant performance just about nosing it above all else as the best asset. There's also some white-knuckle plot twists, a huge amount of politically incorrect insults thrown around, and a brilliant (and somewhat deafening) ending. A fondness for jazz isn't required to get something from this in the same sense that you don't need to like boxing to really enjoy Rocky, and as such this is deserving of a look for almost anyone looking for something well made, interesting, and memorable.",

What a gem!! \"Whiplash\" stars Miles Teller as first year music student Andrew Neiman. Andrew is a student drummer who is more than just a little drummer boy in his pursuit to excel at his beat craft. However, he has to prove his skills to the extremely rigid music school instructor/conductor Terrence Fletcher. Let's just say that Fletcher is trying to make a newman out of Neiman. As Andrew tries to excel in the battery, Fletcher's own authoritarian battery charge is always on full in pushing Andrew to the edge. Damien Chazzelle orchestrates \"Whiplash\" with a magnetic flow that hits all the right beats in his direction of the picture; and his screenplay also hit all the write verbal notes. Miles Teller delivers yet another stellar performance in his rising career; here as Neiman. J.K. Simmons was terrible as Fletcher! Wait, wait! I was J.K. (just kidding!) Simmons' work as Fletcher might just be the best delivered by any actor or actress this year. Paul Reiser also delivered an impressive supporting performance as Andrew's supporting dad; but I was not as mad about his performance as I was in Simmons' classic masterpiece thespian conduction. So here is my final drum roll of this picture.......... \"Whiplash\" is one of the best movies of 2014! \n***** Excellent",

Damien Chazelle's polished modern direction is a sight to see as we delve into the life of music student \"Andrew Neiman\" as he sheds blood, sweat and tears to become one of the great Jazz drummers of all time. Miles Teller is phenomenal in the central role as Andrew whose determination and grit is a marvel to watch unfold and evolve as the picture progresses. J. K. Simmons similarly is utterly phenomenal as the monster that is \"Terrence Fletcher\" who pushes Andrew to the limit of his musical ability and psyche through verbal and psychological torment akin to \"Sgt. Hartman\" from Full Metal Jacket. Both actors have the most remarkable chemistry and play off each other like the finest of musical partnerships. Filled with sequences of unbridled tension that kept me on the edge of my seat, scenes of bittersweet emotional depth between Andrew and his dad or his love interest Nicole; it must be said that the finale of Whiplash is by far one of the best i've seen on screen for some time. It would be a sin for me to not mention how incredible the wall of sound is that is created from the drums at the climax of this feature - the euphoric chills were unreal. Lastly, the attention to detail to the mindset, aesthetic and idiosyncratic nature of music within an educational environment is simply top notch. From the sneaky peaks in practice room windows, the deep seated competition to be the best among fellow peers to the constant practicing over and over again until your technique is just right - Whiplash delivers an authentic look into the life of a student of music. Certainly my favourite of the year so far and quite rightly nominated for Best Picture, Whiplash is a joy from the first hit of the snare to the last crash of the cymbals. I left the cinema in awe.",

I am not big on Jazz music but this film actually made me care about a subject that I have absolutely no knowledge about. What made this film great was the performance by Miles Teller and a superb performance by JK Simmons (he will take the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for sure). Another aspect I loved about the film was how real the situations felt... When Andrew and Fletcher bumped heads I felt like I was in the classroom with them feeling awkward, which to me is the best feeling when watching a film because if you can make the audience feel like they are there for the ride then you have done your job as a filmmaker. Andrew is a character I can relate to because I am only a year older than him and he wants to do something in his life that he will be remembered for forever. He wants to feel important and that is something I believe every young man is hungry for at that age. Not to sound corny but its a movie about pursuing your dreams and conquering them. I believe this will be a strong contender for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar as well. This is a true masterpiece and I will be buying it on blue ray in a heartbeat. \n\nA+",

One one end, we have Morpheus from The Matrix, and on the other end, we have Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada. Both push their apprentices past breaking points, but the loyalty those mentors receive comes from different places. The loyalty given to Miranda is borne from a place of fear and abuse, and the same is said for Andrew Neyman's quest for approval from Terence Fletcher. \n\nThis is certainly one of the most intense film experiences that I've ever endured, and I am pretty sure I don't need to see it again. The harshness of the tone of the constant drumming isn't for me, but I can certainly appreciate the reason for it. Miles Teller does a capable job of the young drummer, but it is J.K. Simmons whose intensity brings the film into focus. While Fletcher's reasons for pushing may be admirable, it makes him no less a monster, and I wish that the movie focused more on the futility of searching for the next Buddy Rich or Charlie Parker. The fact of the matter is that there are Buddy Riches and Charlie Parkers everywhere in the world. The reason that no one knows about them is because not only are these people NOT trailblazers, but that fewer people care. People will always remember an athlete who goes above and beyond, because records are meant to be broken; musicians who don't show the world anything new will always be forgotten. It's important to remember that before more people die at a young age of a heroin overdose.",

            "content": "WHIPLASH!!!!\n\nWhiplash is an independent movie brought to you by writer/director Damien Chazelle. Chazelle entered a short story into the Sundance film festival in 2013. The clip was so high praised he gained funding to adapt it into a full movie. When it was shown in last years Sundance Festival on the 16th of January. It was given such high praise It won the Dramatic Audience Award and has been consistently talked about ever since.\n\nDo not fear greatness: Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. And boy, did this movie achieve it.\n\nAndrew Nieman (Miles Teller - The Spectacular now), is a 19 year old drummer at the fictional Shaffer Music Conservatory in New York City. Plagued by his farther's failure to become a prestigious writer, he will stop at nothing to reach his goal of becoming one of the greatest jazz drummer of all time. One day while he is practicing he catches the eye of the great Terrence Fletcher. (J.K. Simmons - Spider-Man Trilogy) Who leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. After impressing him, he thinks he has got the sweet deal he had always dreamed of. But instead of being the knight in shining armour that Andrew thinks is. He will soon discover Fletcher's frightening and brutal methods that will forever change his life. Andrew's passion to achieve greatness quickly spirals into an obsession. eventually pushing him to the brink of both his ability and sanity.\n\nEditing isn't really something I pay attention to, or even notice while watching movies, but the editing in this movie is fantastic. It is filled with swift transactions between the character to drum set. How it moves perfectly over to each drum or symbol in perfect timing to the music. The back and forth switching from character to character is outstanding, especially in the confronting, and emotional scenes.\n\nThe most liberating thing in this movie, for me, is the acting. Oh man, the acting is incredible. J.K.Simmons really does give the performance of his life in this movie. He's so viscous and mean but he plays it to a T. You may say \"well, it doesn't take a great actor to be able to scream and shout\", but to give the emotion and brutality that he put into his scenes I feel absolutely no one could do better. Picture J. Jonah Jameson mixed with Sergeant Hartman from FMJ, but 10 times worse, and that's Simmons in this movie. Also let us not forget, Miles Teller. He really poured his heart and soul into this movie, a ground breaking performance from him. He catches the emotion of Andrew to perfection, and I couldn't imagine anyone fitting that role more than him.\n\nThe most difficult thing while making a story has to be the ending. No matter how good a movie is, it will make or break depending on the quality of the ending. Luckily for us the ending to this movie is PHENOMINAL. So powerful, So unique, so intense it absolutely blew me away. One of the best endings to a movie I've seen since 'Se7en'. You become so emotionally invested in Teller's character while watching the ending. It's just. WOW!!\n\nThis movie is near perfection, the only real flaw I have with this movie is Andrew's girlfriend, Nicole (Melissa Benoist - Glee) I don't really thing she was necessary to this movie, maybe if they would have added just a few more scenes, maybe an extra 5 minutes, just so we could get a real feel for her character and care how she ends up. That is the only thing stopping me from giving this a 10/10. A 9.8/10 will suffice. But it is definitely in the run for some Oscar nominations and I believe it definitely deserves a few wins as well.",

Neyman is so desperate to shine, that he ends up embroiling himself in a situation where he blows it, and Fletcher tosses him out. Neyman takes it badly, but from here on in we get a wonderful game of cat and mouse - can Neyman prove his old teacher wrong, will Fletcher let him - you really feel the tension between the pair in the 'Jazz off' showdown at the end.

            "content": "As Mark Kermode said, \"It's Full Metal Hi-Hat\": but just how paralleled are the two? Probably much more than you might think. For starters, the ironic bond between Terrence Fletcher and Andrew Neyman. The former is an abusive, swearing, angry motherfucker; the latter, an enthusiastic drum student who endures inconceivable amounts of abuse - to the point at which he becomes a masochist, forcing himself, rather than merely submitting himself to, the horrifying mutilation he incurs. Now, another comparison? Take the parallels of suicide. One wonders at the pressing thought of whether Neyman will end up taking his own life in exasperation. But the one whom it is discovered of (i.e. of taking his own life) is revealed to be an ex-student of Fletcher's, Sean Casey. But of course, just as much as Full Metal Jacket appears to parallel this narrative, what one forgets is that R. Lee Ermey's tormenting ends after the first half of the film; in this case, it is ongoing, right through to the end.\nNow, FMJ mirroring aside, this is an important film. It can be labeled a drama or a thriller or a \"musical drama or thriller\" (ew) but the label which I had ascribed after an hour and 3/4 of screentime (rather short in terms of common film screentimes - which can extend to 3hrs+), was \"epic\". This film is an epic. It doesn't have to be long to be an epic. It doesn't have to be authored by a Milton or a Kubrick to be an epic: this-film-is-epic. There is one single protagonist - and, of course, one single antagonist - who is made to endure, absurdly, horrible abasement and physical abuse. And despite all of this, he constantly rises to the challenge. We think his downfall arrives right at the end (I won't spoil it) when it *appears* that all hope is lost. But this guy doesn't give up!\nAnd now, genre discrepancies aside... man, this is a good film. It's preciously directed, it's taut, it's wonderfully cut and edited, especially during the Jazz sequences, as we get thrown into trombones, as we get pulled directly into coupling closeups of Fletcher's and Neyman's faces. I think it's deserving of an A+. It's a brilliant start to 2015 for us movie-goers, that's for sure.",

Not only is it a story about their relationship, but it is also one about pure and blind desire to succeed. Two actor plots are hard to execute, but it soars in Whiplash. It could not have been shot more perfectly, with scenes cutting back and forth as fast as his drum solos. Miles Teller's transformation from sheepish first year to aggressive and ravaging is overlooked but cannot be undersold. As an intense music fan, it inspired me, and as an intense movie fan,  it astounded me. Not for the faint of heart with slightly excessive cursing, not to mention the incredible one on one scenes between the two leads, but Andrew has you loving him early on so everyone has him to root for. 5/5 stars, a film that I'll never forget, Whiplash threw me from side to side and somehow managed to leave me smiling.",

Enter Terence Fletcher a terrifying and hard-nosed instructor who is known for his teaching prowess as well as his unforgiving methods of teaching. As the two meet, Neyman is treated to the harsh tactics of Fletcher and the film progresses from that point onward. \n\nDirected and Written by Damien Chazelle, the film is extraordinarily great at pacing itself from lull moments to exciting and breathtaking moments which makes the experience that much more compelling and all the credit for the said effect has to go to the director for the masterful pacing he applied on the film. \n\nAnother thing that made this film one of the best films in 2014 is it's great script and how the actors played along to said script. J.K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher deserves all the awards he has received so far and it's definitely a lock for him to win that Oscar award come February. His brash and devilish performance as Fletcher makes this film all the much more compelling and intense, and from the said performance he might've just stole the whole movie for me. Miles Teller does an amazing job as Neyman, the straight-edge and focused individual who will stop at nothing to become great at his craft, even though he'll have to step on other people to get there, really great drum work from Teller the whole film and his acting is top-notch as well. \n\nCinematography in this film is fairly simple and straight-forward, good artistry and effects all throughout(especially close up scenes). Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and the WHOLE ENTIRE SOUNDTRACK has to be one of the greatest ensemble sound wise i've heard from a film. Edited almost to perfection as well, what else is there to say about this film.. It's a masterpiece and oh before I forget,  the grand finale of the film itself is already worth the price of admission \n\nGo watch this film\n\n5/5",

While Fletcher comes off first as a nice guy Andrew soon realizes how crazy things can get and how big of a perfectionist Fletcher is. Fletcher pushes Andrew, so far that soon Andrew has no more social life and everything in his life revolves around drumming and getting better and better. Andrew comes to the conclusion he needs to ask himself, what really matters in life? Overall, fantastic film. J.K. Simmons is insanely good in this one! He is so crazy that its just intriguing my eyes were glued to every scene. I highly recommend giving this one a look if you can watch it!",

Shot impeccably with lots of off kilter peeking angles that drive the drama, driven by a mostly diegetic score Whiplash is incredibly intense and it has one of the best edge of your seat finales in this year's Oscar crop. And did i mention how good JK Simmons is? Because he's really good. It's as if he channeled 6 seasons worth of Schillinger into an hour and a half of demented bandleader.\n\nHighly Recommended.

            "content": "Wow.\n\nThat's all my inferior lips could whimper after witnessing the magisterial beauty of this awe-inspiringly good movie. Shot in a dizzying 19 days by newbie Damien Chazelle, Whiplash charts the progression of drummer Andrew Neyman through a savage musical conservatoire and his relentless drive to touch the edges of musical greatness.\n\nIn his way (or helping him along, depending on how you take this movie), is the savage mentor Terrence Fletcher, played with an unrivalled brutality without ever edging towards a stock character by the impeccable J.K Simmons, the shining star in this galaxy of brilliance.\n\nWhilst striving for greatness is hardly an original general conceit for a movie, Chazelle directs with such dazzling verve that one can view this in all of its unmistakable glory and see an ingenious and truly inventive piece of cinema. Anchored by two extremely strong lead performances, Whiplash whizzes by like visual jazz, leaving you bereft of breath and unable to scrape your jaw from the ground. I\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3,\u00c3,(TM)m not speaking hyperbolically here. This movie unflinchingly conveys its message that success requires hard work and encouragement should often be shunned in favour of some good 'ol tough love. As Simmons' chilling mentor says, \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'.\" Whilst some of his Tucker-esque profanities are borderline comedic, such is the fear that Simmons instills in all who dare to witness him that nobody has enough courage to even consider a chuckle; this character is the stuff of nightmares, relentlessly hurling vicious abuse (as well as some furniture) at the unsatisfactory musicians lucky enough to grace the presence of this scathing musical genius.\n\nChazelle leaves it us to decide how we perceive Fletcher, a character with the obvious persona of a repugnant bully intimidating the poor musicians for the sake of it to allow viewers to latch onto the idea that he is simply an irredeemable villain, yet providing complexity and touches of humanity in the character to leave others to decide whether they believe the explanation of his undeniably atrocious actions he gives in the film's final quarter rings truthful and he is more of an unconventional hero, the kind of aggressor rarely celebrated in a mainstream movie. I tend to fall into the latter category, with the view that Chazelle's ability to perhaps side with this seemingly brutal creature with his beyond acidic tongue and thus side with Fletcher's unpopular ideas.\n\nMost of all, though, this film is edited and packaged with such musical precision that one can only sit in awe and watch the cruel yet ever-compelling story unfold at breakneck speed. This exhilarating experience shows no sign of waning as the film enters its final, glorious sequence. With one seemingly final twist of the knife from Fletcher as both Neyman and the audience realise that he's been set up to be humiliated in front of the industry experts - or did he? Cinematic perfection comes as Teller's Neyman finally ascends to greatness and the ever-terrifying Fletcher, now a more traditional mentor figure, finally gets the classic musician he always wanted to give birth to as Chazelle showcases his superlative directorial talents. This truly electrifying final act is as memorable as they come, topping off this supremely effective masterpiece of a film and blessing every single audience member with its message and its sheer, unabashed brilliance.",

(fireworks, fanfare, random Disney character takes a turn...)\nFocused, interesting, provoking, a breath of invigorating fresh air.\nIt deals artfully with how we bring the best/worst out of people and asks the question again \"Does the end justify the means?\"\nRazor-sharp acting and direction. Hardly a wasted moment in the film.\nAndrew Neyman is an ambitious young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory.When he is not practising, he is listening to drumming by the Jazz Greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. When he is not screaming at and hummiliating pupils, he is wearing a sickly sweet deceitful smile \nSo....;  you won't like like Fletcher. He's the foul-mouthed, abusive teacher who uses his authority to  humiliate the pupils. He gets all cosy to start with and finds out sensitive stuff in order to use it against them later....in public. He is a dinosaur, a freak leftover from the Age of Corporal Punishment, before enlightenment washed over the teaching profession like a velvet gloved hand., .....except that they all revere him, and crucially all volunteer and want to be in his 'studio band' . Maybe they all want his methods to drive them to highs they cannot achieve themselves. Maybe they need his discipline, harsh and wincing as it is. But you still feel he's got it wrong, at least you want to feel that, but it's not soooo simple really, is it?\nThe film gives you subtle nuance amongst the head-banging and this is no mean feat. It also examines the relationship between student and mentor/teacher. It's always been a tricky one, hasn't it?  I mean, to say that this or that is HOW it should be. For all types of pupil? In all situations? In all disciplines?\nCrucially, the film has more layers still, not so much the thrown off girlfriend who would \" stand in his way\" ( for which read \" I fancy you something rotten and cannot control myself to remain disciplined AND have a worthwhile relationship with you) ; more so the father. There is a lot of screentime given to Andrew's father, Jim,  and their relationship. \nJim is the \"nice cop\" and the film shows  how much a crucial part this is in Andrew's life, enabling  and supporting him, without ever straying into preachy or gushy territory. Maybe that is the point of the film -  that actually we need both voices/ personae in our lives to be effective and to be our \"best\" selves.\n\nGo see the film!",

            "content": "Young director Damien Chazelle's second feature, about a talented and ambitious young jazz drummer, takes us into the cutthroat, struggling and hardworking world of top-notch jazz musicians. The story is linear and simple, but offers so much insight into that world. The two actors selected to portray the main characters, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, are perfect; they were meant for the roles. They get into the shoes of the characters with such ease. Even the few scenes with side characters, like Andrew's dad, girlfriend and fellow drummers, are quite interesting.\n\nThe story is mainly about passion, ambition, and desperation to achieve one's goal. It also sheds light on the things one decide to sacrifice in order to achieve their goal.\n\nPositive reinforcement vs negative criticism, which is more effective? This is a debate that has been going on for ages. The former might work for some, while the latter might work for others. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and his/her upbringing; everyone responds to different things.\n\nThe story is packed with humour and inspiring moments. Simmons' dialogues are just fantastic; it might seem vulgar to some, but they're just hilarious. Other than the actual instruments being played, no background score is used at all; this works quite well for the movie. Nothing seems staged, everything takes place with such natural ease.\n\nAnd all this leads up to a foottappingly mesmerising climax. The open-ended approach was good. And the film's topics beg to be discussed and debated among groups.",

Anyone who has had an abusive and overbearing teacher/coach with a borderline personality disorder can surely relate.  I was enthralled from the very jump.

The anecdote they keep mentioning about Charlie Parker is fabricated and more importantly the protagonist, Andrew, takes the wrong lessons about how to achieve artistic greatness. Charlie Parker did not become great by sitting in a room by himself trying to make his hands move as fast as possible.

The focus is on the character of Andrew Neyman and his coming-of-age problems which are appropriate for an upper-middle class boy his age but nothing nearly as hefty as to justify a whole movie.  The chemistry between the two characters seems to have been denied on purpose, which is understandable in context of the plot but makes it hard to connect nevertheless. Now this means Whiplash falls short on it's premise exactly where it matters, trying to be an underdog movie without a real underdog or a real teacher or real stakes. While it's a nice try, unlike it's protagonist, it's just not quite good enough to do what it wants to do.\n\nThat being said, this is not a bad movie either and fortunately there is a lot of emphasis on the musical scenes which are nothing short of amazing, making me recommend this movie for fans of complex music after all.\n\n6/10",

It is, however Simmons ability to switch between personalities that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats in the brilliantly directed drum sequences that help up the anti of an already full-throttle film.\n\nAndrews (Miles Teller) dedication to his art-form of drumming upsets, infuriates and sympathetically relates the audience to his turmoil as he desperately tries to reach not just perfection, but the admiration of Terrence Fletcher. Without Tellers human responses and performance as well as his character growth the film would not of been the same, if the main character didn't have the side and support of the audience.\n\nFortunately everything about the film, screenplay, directing, acting and all apsects come together to make a powerhouse of cinema, that needs to be watched by more people",

Considering director's Damien Chazelles greatest work before this is writing the screenplay for The Last Exorcism Part II, it's rather impressive how well this movie is doing. In all technical aspects this film is great. Credited for film editing, Tom Cross did phenomenal in this department. Cinematography by Sharon Meir, flashy when it needs to be (musical scenes) while elegant during the simpler scenes (Dates, dinners). In all the production departments this film is exactly where it needs to be. My issue really lies with the characters of the movie. While this is strongly against the narrative, I find both the student (Andrew) and professor (Fletcher) predictable and one dimensional. While Chazelle tries to portray them as insane and impulsive, I find everything they do over the course of the film match what I'd expect from the character from the first impression. And I do understand what Chazzelle shows about Andrew and Fletcher in the intense finale scene, I just felt both their motives were always obvious. And this is to no fault of Miles Teller or J.K. Simmons who acted their hearts out. This film makes drumming more intense than I ever imagined, it also has some strong dramatic scenes. But, I see a strong craving for depth in this film, I just don't see the depth.\n\n3 stars-",

            "content": "\"Whiplash\" is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great, and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great. Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing Terence Fletcher) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in \"Birdman\" and they fit perfectly, as \"Birdman\"'s cast did with that films respective themes, with what \"Whiplash\" is all about. \nGreatness, as I mentioned earlier, is what \"Whiplash\" is all about. Teller's and Simmons' drive reflect this, and it comes through in their characters. Andrew wants to be \"one of the greats\" and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them. Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it. This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film, and \"Whiplash\" has several twists and turns in it before it finishes. Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive. Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways, to relate to. We've all wanted to be better and get great at something. But what takes \"Whiplash\" in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher. He pushes Andrew beyond \"what is expected of him\". Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing, slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much, but it's all for a reason. \nBut is it necessary? Fletcher believes so, calling it \"an absolute necessity\" in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain, right beneath our noses this whole time. \"Whiplash\" asks these questions and it's almost as if the film sprouted from them, not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot. Andrew and Fletcher's relationship is an attempt at answering them, leaving it up to you whether the answers \"Whiplash\" puts forward are right or wrong. Are Fletchers methods the way forward? Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher? Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing? Is talent even a realistic construct? \"Whiplash\" asks all of these questions, and puts forward its answers here.\nOf course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting. Simmons character is particularly well developed (and funny too) and again it is a joy to witness Teller's development. Neither character can be described really. Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn't figure out and in one scene we see that he isn't quite as tough as he seems to be. What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not. For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in \"Whiplash\" you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals, and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness. \nWhat's also worth mentioning is the films score. It's brilliant. It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz.  Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as \"Birdman\"s, again heavily featuring drums, the reason it is not is because the score in \"Whiplash\" is external and in \"Birdman\", it's internal, inside the cast's heads. It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in \"Whiplash\" it's almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great. It's another eternal concept of sorts. \n\"Whiplash\" is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn't quite call it the film of the year, it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film. Most should come out saying \"Whiplash\" was a good film. It's tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions, and talks about, greatness. It's visually tense as well, helped along by slow-motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand. Because of this, it was an utter relief, and felt hard-earned in some respects, to see the films ending.",

The story is excellent throughout the film as we see a dream, that dream being crushed, and then rise from the ashes in the most fantastic of ways.  \n\nThe music, editing and sound are all equally top notch.  The script is whip smart and fantastically performed - the film as a whole could have done with half the the amount of strong language for myself personally, and would've been much more effective overall.  I couldn't recommend Whiplash for the faint of heart.  \n\nComplete with great themes, excellent writing, and absolutely amazing performances (especially from Miles Teller) Whiplash is stupendous.  \n\nAnd also, the last scene is totally incredible.

You get to know who Andrew & Terrence Fletcher (Simmons) are along the way, but Music is front and center stage. Of course, the actors are important because their characters give life to the music. The drums are once again a noble instrument in the film. Having the camera focused on the drummer's perspective is what gives intensity. Drumming looks, how it should, difficult to master. It requires motivation, dedication, and passion. Andrew Neiman (Teller) works really hard to try to achieve greatness. The investment, the sweat and pain needed for this instrument is tangible. Andrew lives and breathes drumming, it's in is blood.\n\nDamien Chazelle achieved greatness, delivering a powerful movie, in which the drums and music transpire. He got the best out of his actors and not only showed but made us feel ?Whiplash. ?The film depicts this complex, thrilling and emotional S&M relationship between mentor and student. It shows how far it can go when sacrifices are made and limits are not set.\n\nThe cast is beyond brilliant, the eager Miles Teller and the impressive J.K.

            "content": "There are films that can only dream to reach the levels of tension that this reaches. Whiplash is an outstanding drama with a pair of perfect performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.\n\nI was drawn into this film moments after it started, the way this film is put together is impeccable and I really had no idea where this film was going next. Damien Chazelle- who clearly looks to have found a type of film he is interested in making- has done an excellent job crafting a very powerful, authentic and intense story about a psychological battle between 2 people. This has to be one of the most intense films that I have ever seen. For his second film this is unbelievably good. \n\nThe acting in this is brilliant and Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons had me glued to the screen, I never checked my watch once, I was so invested in the story and the film really had sucked me in, it was quite incredible. Sure, there were other characters but the film belongs to them. J.K. Simmons has always been a powerful character actor and this is some of his best work, Jason Reitman was one of the many producers for this and Simmons is always in his films somewhere, just a funny little coincidence. Some of the things that J.K. Simmons says, even when he's trying to be nice had me on edge, he starts off by saying, 'just have fun', and that just worried me. He then goes on to get progressively angry and seeing him like that and what he could do to people really just set the mood from that point on. Especially when he starts to insult Miles Teller's character with things that he told him in presumable confidence, this is JJ Jameson x1000, Miles Teller can look at Tobey Maguire and say you didn't have the most intense version of J.K. Simmons, I did! Saying that, some of the things he says are very witty and darkly humorous, and in his quieter moments I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he was saying. Miles Teller put so much effort into this and it really shows, seeing him on the drums and what he could do and just his determination in general was really something to root for. It's also another performance in the awards season that is being ignored, much like in Foxcatcher but that's usually how it goes with a lot of things. Seeing someone that passionate for something they want was inspiring to watch but after awhile it did provide some questions. What's the point in pursuing a hobby if you're not enjoying it anymore and just push yourself to the point of exhaustion? The film has many underlying themes to it and besides having your heart in your mouth whilst you watch it, you'll reflect on the situation and think about something similar in your own life. \n\nI can relate to the film quite directly to be honest, I play drums and I have been in competitions before but certainly not to the extremity displayed here but seeing some of what Miles Teller's character went through certainly brought back a few memories. Besides that, this film will just remind you of something you went through hell for just because you wanted it so badly, it's a very powerful and exhausting experience. J.K. Simmons' character also talks about pushing people to their limit and beyond what's expected of them and that's how I feel sometimes with writing these, they've just become so involving now.\n\nThe cinematography in this is very clever, the longer the film goes on the more frantic it becomes and by the end in the amazing solo act, it is just at really creative angles with quick cuts and it's very well done. The soundtrack is also clever as I think the band actually plays the soundtrack as I can't think of any other use of music outside these moments which is a great decision and a nice touch, for obvious reasons. \n\nIf I have any complaint at all its that I think the family and girlfriend subplot are a bit forced. Miles Teller's character already has enough problems to deal with in his day to day life that the addition of an unsupportive family and girlfriend don't seem necessary, especially because of how little they're on screen. While it does provide more character development and more things to relate to, I felt like it was a little forced, again, it gives more meat to the character and saying that, it does make his struggle all the more compelling which is always good but I just felt like it didn't need to be there, is all. He was already struggling enough and we already rooted for him. I also feel like J.K. Simmons' character got a bit extreme at points, which I know was the idea and maybe I'm missing the point but I don't know about you but if a teacher, no matter how brilliant they are or whatever they are trying to accomplish, threw a chair at a student, I don't think they'd last long or rather, last as long as they had done.\n\nI had a headache after the film finished and I'm not sure if that's just coincidence or if it was because of how intense this was, accompanied with the awesome 9 minute final drum solo, probably just coincidence but it's fun to think it was the film, but after all was said and done I just felt inspired and really good, seeing that final smile from J.K. Simmons really meant a lot and the shocking ending of the film is great as is everything else about it. Whiplash is fantastic, gripping and ultimately rewarding drama with perfect performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. It's excellent and one of the best films of 2014. I'd like the check out the original short that got the funds for this masterpiece, now. It certainly would be interesting to watch.",

I'll be rooting for it to get the Oscar in Best Picture and Director!  \n\nI like jazz a lot, so fair play to note my bias, but I don't think it matters.  The storytelling here is sharp and fast and invites viewers to think along with the film rather than telling them how to feel.  This opens us up to be surprised at turn after turn.  Just when we think we've got this story pegged, it deflects into an exciting new story-line it's not afraid to explore. \n\nJK Simmons is getting all the credit so far, and any praise he gets from this performance is deserved, but I think some of that is because this film is shockingly good, and it's easier to lump that on Simmons than a 29-year-old Director (Damien Chazelle) known mostly for winning at Cannes in 2013 with a short film (also called \"Whiplash\" based on the same Simmons character, Terence Fletcher.) But the magic in this film happens in the editing and writing/adapting rooms, I think.  Zero shots are wasted.  Everything adds up.  The pace is perfect.  Simmons and Teller become their characters, Paul Reiser works great as a dad doing his best, and even the drummers against whom Teller is pitted improve the film with their efforts.",

All I can say is I was completely blown from its first frame to its closing act where an aspiring drummer plays his solo and the mean teacher listens to him and teach him more lessons about music and life in a very strict and cruel way that other viewers might find it abusive and personal. This is Simmons show here, I'm glad that he won a Golden Globe recently for his character, I'm pretty sure Oscar is now ahead. Fletcher is among now one of the most recognizable movie characters to date. He has a mean spirit of pushing other students to be a great legend and later on in the film where he tells to Andrew about why he acts so brutal and aggressive. Teller whom we saw last in The Spectacular Now, now he's more spectacular here. Never in a movie that I've seen in my entire life where a character sweats, play drums continuously, and bleeding hands to death by non stop playing drums, what a performance is that. Fletcher might be consider a character that we've seen before in many films still show us why he's so special and the way he treats his students, look at it, throwing a drum set, and many more that I dare not to forget ever. Oh, and also it's the ending that you shouldn't miss, could this be the born of a great legend?",

            "content": "Music is a subject that has been extensively covered by film, almost to the point of diminishing returns. The same way sports movies became a series of dots to join to reach the picture that everyone knew was coming eventually, the way that action movies hit every beat that you just know they're going to hit before you walk in and watch them. But there are exceptions. Raging Bull knocked sports movies on their asses, along with inclusions like The Fighter and Warrior, by looking at the people, not just the sport. Films like Pulp Fiction slammed a shot of adrenaline straight into the heart of action films, blowing up our expectations along the way. This year, the same has been accomplished with music in movies with Whiplash. While I don't necessarily put it in the same rarefied air as Raging Bull or Pulp Fiction (there's not too much that is), in terms of what it does for the subject, it is an absolute gut punch to the medium, and will serve as a standard for films years down the line that attempt to tackle similar topics.\n\nThe plot is relatively simple: a young, talented, ambitious musician, in this case jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), attempts to stand out in one of the most prestigious music schools in the world. His progress is only held up by one teacher, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who will accept nothing less than perfection.\n\nLike I said, we've seen this plot before. Newborns have seen this premise. But what we haven't seen is Terence Fletcher. I'm not talking about the bluster and the storm that J.K. Simmons summons as the film's generator of conflict. It's incredible viewing, to be sure, and Simmons absolutely brings the thunder, spitting fury and hellfire at his students if they dare to make a mistake. I'm talking about what this character represents. The core conceit, after all of the quick cuts and insults have worn off, is this idea that Terence Fletcher embodies: that greatness, true greatness, can never be achieved without being beaten down first. That purity is only formed through fire. And he is definitely that fire. In his many, many rants and explosions, he lays down a ferocious gauntlet for his performers; taunting them and roaring at them until they either break or get it right. He goes further than instruction, insulting them, their ability, who they are as a person, belittling them in verbal assault after verbal assault. And if that was all that the film had to bring, it would be a hell of a showcase for Simmons, but the result would be hollow. It's when we see a scene like the one between Andrew and Fletcher in a bar that the movie makes its higher intentions known. \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job,\" Fletcher tells Andrew. And in some ways, it's true. Fletcher laments this generation and the idea that parents and teachers don't push their children to be the best, that they don't make them strive for true greatness, because by not doing so, they could be depriving the world of the next great individual. The film references musicians like Buddy Rich, but the sentiment carries through to any context. Without being pushed, without being challenged, people can't improve, they can't discover their true potential. It's a fascinating subject to tackle, and it's handled with such precision and intelligence by writer and director Damien Chazelle. The script explores every aspect of this idea, and it's telling that the finale maintains an ambiguous nature in terms of which side it takes on the issue. There's no simple answer to the question, but the way that it's explored here is bold and smart and completely absorbing.\n\nChazelle's double duty as writer and director could have meant a certain apathy in one of those fields. But after writing a great script, Chazelle shows off some serious chops as a director as well. A lot of the frantic speed throughout the musical pieces could be attributed to the editing room rather than the shoot, but look at the way Chazelle brings the pace up within the scene, the way each move of the camera elevates the heart rate of the film. It's more than just slick work on Final Cut here, Chazelle shoots these scenes like they're life or death and as a result, we feel like it is. Each scene where Andrew sits down at the drums is a white-knuckle sprint to the finish and it gives the film an energy that I don't think I've seen in a film about musicians before. Chazelle focusses on the details rather than the big picture here, flashing from close-up to close-up as Andrew fights every moment with sweat and blood. On the less frantic end of things, Chazelle shoots the more human sides of the film with a well-balanced restraint, keep the depth of field shallow and the framing tight, insulating us from the world outside. Andrew only sees the drums and the dream, so that's all we see as well. Any distractions or inclusions along the way are brought in as intrusions for the most part.\n\nAndrew is our point of view for the film and Miles Teller brings him to life with yet another outstanding performance. A lot of people are heralding his performance as a breakout role, but those people obviously didn't see The Spectacular Now (shame on them). It's less of a breakout performance and more of a confirmation of the depth of talent he's exhibited in his roles so far. Andrew is a complex individual, at war with himself and those around him in his quest for true greatness, and it's scary to see just how far he pushes himself to get there. Teller plays these moments with absolute commitment, but his restraint is what really sells it. In his normality, his day-to-day existence, he sells us on the fact that this is a person, not a superhero, and what he's going through, putting himself through, is made all the more harrowing for that fact. And then of course there's J.K. Simmons. I've already talked about his role earlier on, and a little about his performance, but it's worth mentioning again. He is drop-dead brilliant in the role, an absolute hurricane of a human who is able to dominate a room just by standing there. He is funny and terrifying and smart and intriguing all at the same time and Simmons completely inhabits him, all the way down to the light in his eyes when he feels those all too infrequent moments of greatness happening nearby. For all the verbal fire he spews, the moments when you can see the excitement in his eyes or the absolute pleasure he finds in revenge, those are the ones that really stayed with me. And as good as they are apart, these two are amazing together. They feed off their individual intensity and you can see each man sizing the other up as they go.\n\nFor all the moments of greatness there are a few missteps along the way. A car crash, a lawsuit and a girlfriend are all well-intentioned but they don't land quite as well as they could. Their message is clear and their purposes represent interesting aspects that film explores, but they're less of a breather than a roadblock when Chazelle takes the foot off the gas throughout the film. But when Fletcher and Andrew are in the same room and we get to see them firing on all cylinders, it truly is magic.\n\nDefining Scene:\nThe final scene of the film is stand-up, jaw-drop, cheer-if-you-want-to level good, so I'll pick that over the possible choice of the conversation in the bar. But not by much.",

So Whiplash, this ode to jazz will have you at the edge of your seat with your heart going a yard a minute. Miles Teller plays a 19-year old drummer Andrew Neyman, who wants to be the best there ever was. The only thing stopping this ambitious student is his equally-ambitious instructor Terence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. \n\nWhile watching this movie, your mind, body, and ears will be thrilled by the two main leads, their co-stars, and the spectacular jazz score.\nThis film builds tension and suspense better than any thriller in my recent memory. The complexity of choices made in shooting the performance scenes were astoundingly good and truly set a visual tone that matched the jazz pieces.\n\nAt its core, this is a film about the types of choices necessary to take an honest shot at greatness. It seems that too often in films characters in similar positions make compromises and opt for relationships that are billed as higher values than greatness and mastery. This protagonist makes no such compromises and the payoff is an argument for being driven by such purpose. It has been a long time since I have left a movie theater feeling this emotionally rewarded.\n\nAs the performances go Miles Teller is solid in the lead, but J.K Simmons is absolutely riveting. As a side note, I think the film raises some interesting questions for those in the field of performing arts pedagogy. What is the proper role/purpose/tactic of an advanced arts teacher?",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's Whiplash follows the story of a young and talented drummer studying at Schaffer academy in New York. The film expertly observes the pressures and stresses of working under such a manipulative director.\n\nAndrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is a 19 year-old student, gifted with the sticks in his hand. The film opens with him practising his drumming and is a clear indication of how ambitious and determined he is. After impressing Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), the director of the leading ensemble in the school, Neyman is promoted into the band. Here is where he discovers the strict conditions of working under the perfectionist Fletcher. Insults regarding his mother who ran away when he was young and having chairs thrown at him isn't what Neyman expected.\n\nHowever, he remains strong and as determined as ever to prove that he can be a great, continuing to practice at every opportunity, literally playing until his hands are blistering and bleeding.\n\nWhiplash ultimately becomes a clash of two musical geniuses striving for perfection, illustrating the pressures and tensions to the extent where the audience are expecting either one to crack at any stage. Chazelle keeps the film strongly in the shadow of Neyman, tracking every single strain and emotion with the camera spending a lot of the time behind the shoulder of Neyman. Tempo is a major theme throughout the film in relation to the jazz numbers on the soundtrack which all make for an enthralling watch.\n\nTeller and Simmons both deliver perfect performances. Teller, who is certainly coming of age, manages to truly reflect the development of Neyman, not only as a drummer, but also as a person. Teller spends the majority of the film in all kinds of pain; either sweating, bleeding or crying and he delivers every possible emotion his character endures.\n\nSimmons standing in the opposite corner also perfects the role of the cynical, terrifying director, constantly pushing his band for perfection in the most intimidating approach possible. His quips and insults leave the audience wondering whether to laugh or sit in a state shock.\n\nWhiplash is a dark and pulsating watch, which deservedly left Sundance with two awards under its arm. With the Oscar nominations just around the corner, it would be no surprise to see a number of honours coming the way of Chazelle's creation.",

This character will stick out in everyone's mind just as we remember the Frankenstein monster. Miles Teller as the student is perfect in his portrayal of the young man and definitely matches the intense performance that J.K.Simmons delivers. Terence Fletcher is beyond John Houseman's Professor Kingsfield in The Paper Chase. Kingsfield was Grandpa Walton compared to Fletcher. I do not want to set off spoilers, but  I felt I had seen this movie before. In many ways this is similar to Black Swan, Gone Girl, and perhaps to some degree Officer and a Gentleman and Fatal Attraction. There were monsters in all these films. Today's horror is the person who goes to far to effect another person and the repercussions. Usually the hero desires the most in life and wishes to attain his ideal goal. How far is too far? American filmmakers seem to latch on to this, because it is what is reflected in the desire of the American dream.Yet to attain the American Dream is a nightmare at times. To say that I was not shaken by this movie would be a lie. It viscerally cut through me and at times I hyperventilated. What disappoints me is that there is not another vision to look forward to in future films. The last positive teacher movie was perhaps Dead Poet's Society or Dangerous Minds. Yet most film makers see these films as part of a cliche'. Does this disappoint me? Yes--in many ways because we do not celebrate the true heroes in our lives any more. We tear them down or look for their demise. Do we need to be hit over the head with this and be bludgeoned until we bleed.",

Simmons), a notorious hard-ass, handpicks him to be in his highly competitive jazz band.  Though Andrew is thrilled about being selected, his joy is short-lived as Fletcher seemingly singles him out for abuse.  There's nothing constructive about this criticism; Fletcher's tactics include berating, face-slapping, and chair-throwing.  \n\nMost normal kids would quit under these circumstances, but Andrew is no normal kid. He's single-mindedly obsessed with becoming the world's next Buddy Rich and is willing to forego everything else - girls, friends, sleep, his dignity - in order to achieve it.  \n\n\"Whiplash\" is about tense as movies come. It features a surprising amount of blood, gallons of sweat, and even a few tears. Though the title refers to the name of a song the band regularly rehearses, it can also refer to Fletcher's habit of alternating tiny bits of encouragement with lengthy, vein-popping tirades. This isn't a pleasant movie, but it's impossible to look away and Simmons is phenomenal.\n\nAs an aside, this show marked my introduction to \"reserved seating\", something I didn't even know existed until the ticket guy showed me a chart of available seats and told me to pick one. Though I can see this feature being a boon to the Saturday night date crowd who buy their tickets in advance, my primary goal in picking both show times and seats is to avoid being bothered by other people. How on earth am I supposed to gauge the relative obtrusiveness of my potential neighbors - an algorithm I've been refining for years - by seeing only a seating chart? How can I tell if a seat is the proper distance from the screen or the sightlines right or the floor is sticky? What if a pair of Chatty Cathys shows up and I want to move? Are all seats fair game once the movie begins? If you arrive to find someone sitting in your seat, who would you even complain to? It's not like there are ushers. \n\nFortunately, the seat I chose for \"Whiplash\" turned out to be just perfect, though I couldn't actually find any seat numbers so I just sat in the one I liked best and hoped it was mine. Seems like a pretty good strategy to me.",

Simmons) \"hammers\" his students to what Fletcher considers \"perfection.\"  WHIPLASH directed by Damien Chazelle is part psychodrama, horror story, case study in manipulation, naked ambition and teaching techniques - do results justify brutal means? OR as I have found to be true does it do the opposite - discourage students to such a degree that they drop out or break down.\n\nWe first meet Andrew (Miles Teller) in a movie theater sharing popcorn with a companion - who happens to be his father. Andrew, though socially awkward, is a young  man who single-mindedly knows what he wants from life - to be as great a drummer as the legendary American jazz drummer Buddy Rich and in an almost Faustian bargain willingly succumbs to the spell of an abusive teacher who he believes can deliver him his goal. Fletcher's modus operandi is one of debasement coupled with an occasional affirmation all in the name of precision and superiority; a frighteningly dictatorial approach to the evolution of creativity.\n\nThe exchange between student/teacher can be a tender one - growth develops out of sensitive and genuine respect for a pupil's intelligence and capacity, or one that is fraught with anxiety and sadistic motivational techniques. In WHIPLASH - the apt title comes from a Hank Levy (American jazz composer and saxophonist) tune that the school band is rehearsing  over and over again; blood is psychologically and  literally spilled under the \"master's\" pummeling - the repetitive practice drilling into one's psyche - the audience becomes as tense as the pounding  sounds emanating from the tautly stretched membranes which are struck with sticks know as \"beaters.\"  \n\n\nPersonalities and events are not always anticipated which made the movie compelling. Characterizations are slowly revealed through frenzied musical performances; audacious hunger for success taking precedence over one's personal life and human contact. Between the two lead characters, there are shifts in domination like a wire which coils and uncoils pulling their mentor/disciple relationship together and apart, spawning a tarnished creative union.",

            "content": "Whiplash is a story told in broad strokes and is, as implied by the title, a jarring allegory. In the first scene we meet the two main characters, Andrew Neyman; an obsessed young drum student (Miles Teller) at a fictitious prestigious New York music academy, and Terence Fletcher; a brutal drill sergeant of a teacher/band leader (J.K. Simmons). Most of the film focuses on the battle of egos in which these two allegorical figures engage. We find out that drum prodigy Neyman is too obsessed with becoming \"one of the greats\" to sustain a superficial relationship with girlfriend Nicole (Melissa Benoist) whom he unceremoniously dumps, but we never really get the sense that this is anything more than a plot device. There never seemed to be much passion in the relationship. Andrew Neyman is never able to open up about how he really feels about her or why he wanted to go out with her in the first place. I got the sense that writer/director Damien Chazelle simply decided that the protagonist had to have a girlfriend he could dump just to show how truly obsessed he is. \n\nLikewise, it's made quite clear that Terence Fletcher is also obsessed. In Fletcher's case the obsession seems to be finding the perfect drummer for his school's jazz band. The attention Fletcher gives to pitting several aspirants against each other while the rest of the band sits and watches in stunned silence becomes somewhat absurd as the story progresses. We never really find out why he has so much trouble with drummers and not other band members. If he was as brutal with everyone in his his band as he is with his drummers, how would he ever get through any rehearsals at all? Maybe if we could hear Fletcher say \"It's all about the drums in jazz\" or something similar, it would make sense. \n\nThe films most troubling aspect is its rationalization of Fletcher's brutality toward his students. He is on a mission to produce \"another Charlie Parker,\" albeit reincarnated as a drummer. He tells and retells a story about how Parker was driven to be great after having a cymbal thrown at his head. However this story is more fiction than fact - deliberately exaggerated for dramatic effect. So it is with most of Whiplash. The exaggerations are deliberate and calculated to tell a story that is not so much about music than about a certain aspect of male psychology which is wrapped up with success and greatness at any cost. It can't be accidental that are no females in Fletcher's band. There are several scenes of Neyman with his dad, but his mother is a non-entity. Taken this way, Whiplash makes a some sense and rings true enough, but I felt a little disappointed that I wasn't really watching a movie about music at all, in spite of the spectacular musicianship on display throughout.\n\nCertainly a film worth watching, but also a troubling vindication of bullying as the path to greatness.",

Therefore, Simmons gave an extraordinarily killer performance as one of the worst performances I've seen onscreen, being one of the best performances of the year and of his career. While Miles also is on his A-game getting under our skin with everything he goes through. Moreover, at first when I finished watching the movie I wasn't sure if I had truly understood the movie because I totally felt like I was witnessing human torture, but after reading some more about it, I did understand his \"intentions\", and even if do not agree 100% with the character Fletcher ideals, because I think there is a limit to everything and more when it involves someone else's life, nonetheless it was still a very fun and terrific ride that not every director and movie is able to portray as powerful and raw. \n~January 10, 2015~",

Although it was obvious the movie was excellent, I was afraid it would take a turn for the boring, like so many movies of this genre. Surprisingly, I was completely wrong. Somehow, someway, Chazelle turns a movie that really only has four cast members into a taunt thriller that exist solely as an edge of your seat type of movie. Whiplash has a biting soundtrack that is simply an extension of the movie's events and this serves its purpose perfectly, setting the mood again and again and communicating the anxiety and the desperation of the main character. The acting is superb, with the minimalist set allowing each actor to completely take over the scene. J.K. Simmons really does give the performance of his life here and his brutal scenes repeatedly caused strong reactions from those viewing the movie with me. Teller really is the unsung hero here though, delivering an equally moving performance as the anxious, overfocused and repetitive Neyman. I really am surprised he didn't make it on the Best Actor list at the Oscars. Overall, Whiplash is only the second technically perfect film of the year after Birdman, a lovely blending of blackened sets, fantastic jazz and the gripping interactions between Teller and Simmons, who certainly achieved best on screen combo this year.

            "content": "\"I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success.\"\n\nDamien Chazelle's Whiplash is one of the best films of 2014. It doesn't matter if you aren't much of a music fan (I'm not), because there is much more going on here than the simple premise of a young drummer trying to achieve perfection. I don't know much about jazz or music, but somehow Chazelle managed to make one of the most intense films of the year. Who would've thought that a film focusing on a relationship between a young drummer and his mentor could be so intense and have you at the edge of your seat during the final ten minutes of the film? It was quite a memorable experience. This is Chazelle's sophomore film (his debut film was Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) and you can already conclude he's a brilliant director and one to look forward to. He's as determined as the main protagonist of the film. When he wasn't able to come up with the funding for this film he decided to make a 20 minute short which debuted at Sundance in 2013 and after garnering attention from critics he was able to finance this film. Perfection comes at a great cost and it requires discipline and practice. Chazelle makes sure we understand that this pursuit of perfection comes at a great cost and he lets the audience decide wether it's worth the price or not. Whiplash is one of those rare films that leaves you with many different things to think about. It raises so many questions: Does the end justify the means? Is the pursuit of perfection possible? Is it really worth all the sacrifice? and the most important question in my opinion; what is our definition of success? The young drummer in this film played brilliantly by Miles Teller (who had a breakout year in 2013) seems to have his mind made up of what success really means, but is he right? The director avoids taking sides and lets the audience come up with their own conclusions. There is a brilliant scene where Teller's character is courting a girl and telling her about his goals in life, and his reaction is brilliant when the girl (played by Melissa Benoist) doesn't really know what she wants to do with her life. He is so determined and focused that he finds it confusing that someone could live without this sort of ambition. These small scenes are what makes this movie so great because it allows us to learn new things about each character through these interactions.  \n\nThe core of this film is without a doubt the relationship between this aspiring young drummer and his abusive mentor. It is very different from most other mentor-student relationships explored in movies in the past and it avoids falling into similar formulas and cliches found in other films. This isn't the cool teacher, this is someone whose personal philosophy is about pushing his students to sacrifice everything in their lives to pursue greatness and the only way to do so in his opinion is by pushing and bullying his students to the point of breaking them. It is the opposite of what a mentor like Professor Keating in Dead Poets Society is like towards his students (and most films take a similar approach having an inspirational and caring mentor). But in Whiplash J.K. Simmons' Fletcher is the complete opposite and he psychologically terrorizes his students. You can feel the fear he installs in the students and his presence alone every time he enters a room is felt. Simmons' performance is the best I've seen all year and he delivers in every scene he's in. He is the main reason why the film is as intense as it is because every time Teller's Andrew gets in front of the drums we feel that anxiety and tension. We want him to succeed, but at times the cost seems too high. Simmons' presence is terrifying  and even when he seems to be cooled down we know that he can burst in any moment with a missed note. The way he verbally assaults and demolishes his students is also a troubling part of the film because as an audience we know that it is wrong but we can't help but chuckle at some of the things he's saying. His character is almost cartoonish at times, but it is part of his persona because he thinks it is the only way to push his students to become the best. As good as Simmons is in this film, Miles Teller doesn't allow him to steal the spotlight. Teller is the lead character in this film and even when Simmons isn't on screen we are engaged with the story. The moments he is interacting with Nicole, the girl he is dating, and with his father (played by Paul Reiser) are also incredibly well constructed and they say a lot about who each character is. These relationships give us a glimpse of who Andrew really is and what drives him. Teller's performance is solid and even his drum skills are amazing in this film. The entire cast is fantastic, but of course Simmons receives most of the recognition because his presence on screen is just amazing here. \n\nWhiplash shows us that fine line between perfection and obsession. Andrew sacrifices so much and is always pushed to the limits by Fletcher and it leaves us wondering if it really is worth it. It's such a powerful film and I'm sure jazz fans will love it even more because the music here is great. The film has a breathtaking ten minute finale as well that will leave your heart pounding. There are so many other aspects of the film that work so well, like the rapid editing that goes along with the jazz beats. The cinematography is also gorgeous. Everything about this film is great and the performances simply elevate it all. The only reason why I'm not calling it a masterpiece is because it does have some issues during the midsection of the film with some rather implausible scenes, but other than that this is a perfect film. I may be demanding too much out of this film like Fletcher is with his students, so it barely misses the perfect note but it is one of the best films of the year. The more you think about it the more you take out of it. I even found an interesting metaphor out of this pursuit for greatness comparing it to with how the American military works trying to build the perfect army because in a way Fletcher's techniques are similar to those that generals use (therefor the comparisons of Simmons performance to that of Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket).",

These small scenes are what makes this movie so great because it allows us to learn new things about each character through these interactions.  \n\nThe core of this film is without a doubt the relationship between this aspiring young drummer and his abusive mentor. It is very different from most other mentor-student relationships explored in movies in the past and it avoids falling into similar formulas and cliches found in other films. This isn't the cool teacher, this is someone whose personal philosophy is about pushing his students to sacrifice everything in their lives to pursue greatness and the only way to do so in his opinion is by pushing and bullying his students to the point of breaking them. It is the opposite of what a mentor like Professor Keating in Dead Poets Society is like towards his students (and most films take a similar approach having an inspirational and caring mentor). But in Whiplash J.K. Simmons' Fletcher is the complete opposite and he psychologically terrorizes his students. You can feel the fear he installs in the students and his presence alone every time he enters a room is felt. Simmons' performance is the best I've seen all year and he delivers in every scene he's in. He is the main reason why the film is as intense as it is because every time Teller's Andrew gets in front of the drums we feel that anxiety and tension. We want him to succeed, but at times the cost seems too high. Simmons' presence is terrifying  and even when he seems to be cooled down we know that he can burst in any moment with a missed note. The way he verbally assaults and demolishes his students is also a troubling part of the film because as an audience we know that it is wrong but we can't help but chuckle at some of the things he's saying. His character is almost cartoonish at times, but it is part of his persona because he thinks it is the only way to push his students to become the best. As good as Simmons is in this film, Miles Teller doesn't allow him to steal the spotlight. Teller is the lead character in this film and even when Simmons isn't on screen we are engaged with the story. The moments he is interacting with Nicole, the girl he is dating, and with his father (played by Paul Reiser) are also incredibly well constructed and they say a lot about who each character is. These relationships give us a glimpse of who Andrew really is and what drives him. Teller's performance is solid and even his drum skills are amazing in this film. The entire cast is fantastic, but of course Simmons receives most of the recognition because his presence on screen is just amazing here. \n\nWhiplash shows us that fine line between perfection and obsession. Andrew sacrifices so much and is always pushed to the limits by Fletcher and it leaves us wondering if it really is worth it. It's such a powerful film and I'm sure jazz fans will love it even more because the music here is great. The film has a breathtaking ten minute finale as well that will leave your heart pounding. There are so many other aspects of the film that work so well, like the rapid editing that goes along with the jazz beats. The cinematography is also gorgeous. Everything about this film is great and the performances simply elevate it all. The only reason why I'm not calling it a masterpiece is because it does have some issues during the midsection of the film with some rather implausible scenes, but other than that this is a perfect film. I may be demanding too much out of this film like Fletcher is with his students, so it barely misses the perfect note but it is one of the best films of the year. The more you think about it the more you take out of it. I even found an interesting metaphor out of this pursuit for greatness comparing it to with how the American military works trying to build the perfect army because in a way Fletcher's techniques are similar to those that generals use (therefor the comparisons of Simmons performance to that of Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket).",

Simmons) with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity. Terence has a reputation for being the best, but mentoring under him comes at a price.  He is ruthless with his verbal abuse & taunts that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve. Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can't find Terence's tempo, , \"Were you rushing or were you dragging? If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig. Oh my dear God - are you one of those single tear people? You are a worthless pancy-ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl!\" There is no \"Wash-on, Wash-off\" PG-ness here. Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity, not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists - those who make art and those who creat them. Being mean is in Terence's nature. And his assault on his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s is sometimes hard to watch. The best part of the film its keeps you so engrossed, you will always be unsure of where it is headed. The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the Miles Teller knew nothing about drumming before this film & the film was shot in only 19 days & for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew's defiance while gasping at his situation. Writer-director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur. We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play. We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew's goal. Miles Teller is on a crazy streak; doing some decent movies and putting in even better performances, but Whiplash definitely taps his greatest effort thus far in his incredibly young career. JK Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability. Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic! Director Damien Chazelle has given us a cinematic gem! He seems like a filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. He has given us one of the best scripts of 2014 & without doubt the BEST climax I have seen in a long while. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. Expect some awards going in the way of \"Whiplash\" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it. On the whole Whiplash is not just film or a character study of two people, but an art & an education in itself. Holy Must watch!!",

Another act of sheer brilliance is the soundtrack, the soundtrack is orchestrated perfectly and is equally utilised perfectly to create tension and an awesome atmosphere.

True to their single-word title, these films focuse on developing an in-depth, and intense, look at their protagonists on a framework of simple plot structure (mostly linear, straightforward, almost no twist-and-turn, and short running time - no film among these three is longer than 2 hours, \"Nightcrawler\" being the longest - 116 min.), minimized and urban setting (\"Locke\" and \"Whiplash\" are for the most parts enclosed in the claustrophopic setting of a car/recording studio, while \"Nightcrawler\" is fixated in LA's urban area), and a small supporting cast of character actors. With such choice, those films, although perfectly executed and often interesting (and entertaining) to watch, have an inherent weakness, which is the unavoidable feeling of artificiality due to the unnaturally squeezed plot and character treatment, which lead to either a sense of over-dramatization (in \"Locke\"), frustration (in \"Nightcrawler\"), and unevenness (in \"Whiplash\"). \"Whiplash\" has an excellent premise of \"how people would react in difficulties to achieve greatness?\", which was carried out smoothly through the depiction of the \"face-off\" between the novice yet passionate Neyman (Miles Teller of \"Spectacular Now\") against the experienced, brutal and (seemingly) equally passionate Mr. Fletcher (J.K Simmons, who looks exactly like Alan Arkin of \"Little Miss Sunshine\", and also has a great chance to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor with this excellent role). The thing that I love most about this film is the ambiguity of several sequences, which leaves the audience with plenty of space to think, and speculate about what really happened in those sequences, and who the characters really are until the very end, such freedom can hardly happen in big budget Hollywood films, when the producers and directors often presume that the audience is stupid and they need to be stuffed with every details of the story and character. On the other hand, the thing that I was disappointed most about this film is the last part (except for the \"final performance\", which is astounding by any measure), when it seemed that the director tried (too hard) to \"conclude\" his story in a satisfactory way, which, in my opinion, actually damages the marvellous inconclusiveness and ambiguity of the fate of the characters, which were already pushed to the climax by the end of the electrifying \"second act\" (the \"car accident\" sequence is one of the best shots I have watched this year). Next time, maybe a longer running time or a less ambitious and more focus storyline will help the director to achieve a great film, because this film is already a treat to the audience, especially with the wonderful soundtrack.",

We're the ones who are being caught for every mistake, we're the accused and only a special film, is able to do that.\n   We follow the life of Andrew (Miles Teller), a budding jazz drummer who wants nothing more than to be the best there is and to accomplish such a feet, he has to impress the best there is... Mr. Fletcher (J. K Simmons). Fletcher is the best music teacher around and through perfectionism and guidance he wants, ultimately, to find the perfect student... but not everything is as easy as that. He pushes students to the edge of their mental and physical strength with his calamitous tactics of verbal and physical abuse driven by passion. Simmons' delivery of every insulting line is that of elegance, you don't know whether to laugh or pity.\n   There are a couple of moments in the movie where a student has made a mistake. We, the audience, know before Fletcher does and when he finds out, it almost feels like we're in trouble because Simmons' portrayal of a horribly passionate teacher is so incredibly realistic. \n   Miles Teller plays his part perfectly. His journey of finding the path to greatness is something we can all relate to. We've all been beaten down and leant how to pick ourselves back up again. Teller and Simmons bounce off of each other beautifully and the journey has Tellers character grow into a strong young man who can, by the last sequence, hold his own against Simmons which makes for an exceptional final 15 minutes. \n   With amazing aggressive chemistry from Simmons and Teller, a story we can all identify with and great music whether you're a jazz fan or not. This phenomenal piece of cinema will leave you with goose bumps all over, completely blown away and without a doubt wanting so much more.",

A movie in which the strive for perfection is brought to the audience in a hand-to-the-throat storytelling this delivery is a combination of dazzling music score, outstanding performances and flawless directing efforts. \n\nAndrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is a talented and very ambitious jazz drummer who is in his first year in an elite east coast music conservatory. One day his talent got spotted by the legend of jazz teaching Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) and he gets invited to join as a second drummer the elite jazz band of Fletcher. Driven by his ambition, Andrew is ready to give his best in order to succeed within Mr. Fletcher's band. Unfortunately (for Andrew and many others), Fletcher is not only a multiple-awards winning teacher, but also a terribly ruthless band leader whose methods to reach perfection are highly controversial. Quickly Whiplash becomes a movie in which the characters are pushed way beyond their psychological and physical limits with no hope of reaching Fletcher's desired perfection. \n\nAn intense story, a mind-blowing sound editing and mixing, Whiplash is detailed to the smallest perfection. Listening to the same music segment, over and over and over and over again simply because it is as Fletcher says: \"not quite my tempo\" will provoke you to a nail-biting level of tension. The ambitiously nerdy Andrew and the restless perfectionist Fletcher are heading for a music and personal clash that is going to blow your mind up. Speaking of Fletcher and J.K.Simmons, could only say that in very rare cases a supporting actor has been such a driving force of a movie. Mesmerizing, scandalizing and ruthlessly sharp, J.K.Simmons delivers the performance that defines his whole acting career. The Oscar that he received for Best Supporting Actor was totally deserved and his performance will long scary you in your music dreams\n.\nIt is hard to mention all the wonderful ingredients that make Whiplash one of the most gripping dramas of recent years. Extremely competitive, dark and at some points furious, Whiplash is not only a cinematographic, but also a music experience that must be seen! Absolutely a must see !",

            "content": "Terence Fletcher: \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job\".\n\nWhiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.\n\nOkay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.\n\nJ.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher. \n\nNow let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say \"You did a good job\", and yes I did use the words \"you did a great job\", n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.\n\nMiles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.\n\nThe directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it. \n\nThis movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like \"You will clap at the end\", but you don't, or \"You will feel inspired after the film\", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie.     \n\nFor problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really.\n\nWhiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.",

This movie did not slow down a single bit as it told the gripping and mesmerising story of a boy striving to be the best jazz drummer in the world with the assistance of one of the most hilarious and memorable characters of the year. J. K. Simmons put in the best performance of his career and the most exciting and exhilarating performance of the year as this very talented and at time frightening jazz instructor. As a supporting actor whenever he was on screen i was in awe at just how compelling his character was, sometimes you are afraid of him and other times you can't take your eyes off how spectacular he is at what he does. Miles Teller also killed it in his performance as the boy who had a single goal in life and blew me away with the level of his talent. The back and forth chemistry between these two fantastic actors made for the best highlights of the movie. There were hilarious moments, scary moments and even emotional moments as the movie explores how their relationship evolves over time in ways that you would not have initially expected. This film does a lot to surprise you and gave some of the most memorable moments of the year. And just as it starts off strong it finishes even stronger with one of the most intense and inspiring finales in recent years. This movie was such a great experience that it is one of the best films of the year, with some of the best performances seen in 2014. - 9.7",

Even the acting feels like a masterwork in execution, though neither role demands a ton of range.  It is bleak and unwavering in it's relentless pursuit of excellence, or at least the extremely rigid view of excellence that the film presents.  The film presents the nearly fascist views of perfection and sacrifice that the subject raises in an unglorified, ugly manner; seemingly inviting critique throughout it's running time.  The ending manages to subvert the Black Swan esque character arc, with an \"uplifting\" finale that reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty in it's \"sometimes fascism is necessary\" statement.  Ultimately, despite being somewhat shallow, it's hard not to enjoy Whiplash's intensity, incredible editing and music.",

It was bound to happen and it surely did, I saw the best movie of 2014 and it wasn't Birdman. The film Whiplash (2014 film) rocked my world. I saw masterful performances and have now became an instant fan of Miles Teller. He was nothing short of phenomenal! This movie brings an intensity I have rarely if ever felt in a film. All leading up to a crescendo of an ending so intense and so powerful that I felt like I needed a cigarette and I have not smoked for 10 years. Not only do I find this movie the best movie of 2014 this movie earned a spot in my overall top best made and most favorite movies have ever seen. Music has always had the power to move me and when I see real legit, incredible musical talent performing right in front of me and that is not even counting the acting of a character whilst playing said instrument it is an incredible and overwhelming feeling. This movie is truly astounding. When you watch this movie you are literally witnessing greatness, and I haven't even got to J.K. Simmons yet who turns in one of the most intense and memorable onscreen performances I have seen in years. \n\nI am still a champion for Michael Keaton for his work in Birdman but these performances were right up there. This movie felt real to me, my emotions were raised and connected with the main character more so than any movie I have seen in a long, long time. Perhaps it's because I played the drums for so long that it connected with me like it did, and if you're a drummer this movie is an absolute must watch, but for lots of reasons this movie just hit with me, hard. IT blew me away and left me with my jaw on the floor and it took me a couple minutes to collect myself at its end. It is seriously one of the most exhilarating movie endings I have ever experienced and it hammers home the point of the film itself like few I have ever seen in my entire lengthy history of watching movies. This is a movie that is not a blockbuster, it's not meant to break monetary and attendance records, it is just a film allowed to portray its art and its love for Jazz music and the intensity of trying to make it perfect or to become one of the all-time greats at what we do. It takes intensity and ratchets it up to 11. I was hooked within 35 seconds and watched with bated breath the entire last act of the film. \n There is a reason that this one is certified fresh at 95% with a 96% audience approval rate. Expect to see many award nominations handed out for this film and for the first time in years it's going to be a really hard thing to figure out which is really worthy of holding best picture, I can make a case for Birdman and I have, I can make a case for Boyhood in which the most recent podcast episode has, but for me and my money I can make a case for this being not only my favorite movie I saw in 2014, replacing the longstanding Guardians of the Galaxy, but it also replaces Birdman for what I believe to be the best made picture of the year. I cannot say if you will feel the same way about being better than your choice for best picture of the year but what I can guarantee is that you will certainly have to think about this in the same way once you see it. You cannot watch this movie and not feel something, it is impossible. What you feel is powerful too. I could gush for days on this so I am just going to rate it, champion it as my pick for the best picture of 2014 and I am going to recommend the shit out of this to anyone and everyone because it is a movie that serves to have everyone's attention. Teller's and Simmons performances deserve to be talked about and this movie deserves to be seen by everyone who likes movies to turn things up a bit. Especially if you are a musician or if you love Jazz music or if you are a performer in any way but its not just limited to that, this is a film all can love. This movie, hot damn, I rate it an unrealistic 6 out of 5 stars, and I give it 110 percent and give it just about the highest recommendation I can possibly give as this is one of the best movies of the past decade and a new entry in an damn near impenetrable wall of my top 10 favorite films I have ever seen and also the most impactful due to my emotional investment to the characters. Wow just wow.......Bravo to all involved, Bravo.",

            "content": "One of 2014's most passionate and vibrant films, WHIPLASH is an extraordinary portrait of a fascinating relationship.  The movie works beautifully on multiple levels: on one, it's a spiritual heir to the PAPER CHASE throne, a story about young people working very hard under the guidance (and/or abuse) of a mentor figure; on another level, it's a love letter to jazz music itself (which I maintain is an under-represented art form in cinema); and on yet another level, it's an examination of the dedication required when chasing excellence, feeding on universal feelings (the desire to be great, the fear of humiliation, the fear of not being good enough, etc.) to create a compelling, captivating ride.  Writer/director Damien Chazelle displays an incredibly strong vision, with dynamic camerawork and whip-fast editing, both of which highlight the intense dramatic moments and musical performances (though those tend to be one-and-the-same in this movie); indeed, the film is - at times - as tense as any of 2014's best proper thrillers (including one, GRAND PIANO, which was written by none other than Chazelle himself!).  While Miles Teller is great in the movie (he nails the very difficult physical requirements necessary to convince the audience he's a talented drummer, and he also captures a kind of introverted vulnerability which gradually changes over the course of the story), it really is J.K. Simmons' performance that people will leave the film thinking about; \"career best\" is a phrase that doesn't really capture the kind of work Simmons pulls off here.  He's enormously imposing, towering, terrifying, and many more \"ing\"s, but he's never one-dimensional, which is a huge feat when playing what could have so easily been an ultra-arch taskmaster.  The entire movie is terrific, but it's the final 20 minutes - which I dare not even hint at - that truly push the film up to another level.  I feel like I've somehow undersold how good a film this really is; it satisfies on so many levels (narratively, emotionally, and even thematically) that it's hard to do full justice to it.  But let it be known that WHIPLASH is thrilling, energetic, exhilarating cinema, pure and simple, and it is among the very best films of 2014.",

It is one of those films that is beautifully written, has wonderful performances, and sometimes it is a nail biter when tension heats up. Every musical performance, every live performance, the sound of those jazz music, it is just dazzling to watch. J.K Simmons as Terence Fletcher, I mean, my God, how good this guy is. He performs as a musical instructor and he is such a bad ass with it. I mean he reminds me of my teacher before with that kind of attitude. He is such a perfectionist that he wants his tempo and sound satisfying. And dude, Miles Teller as Neyman, this guy nails every performance. Like he feels for his character, the need and the sacrifice of being a great musician. I saw him act and to tell you honestly, he was good in that film \"The Spectacular Now\" thus he is great in this film. This film surprised a lot of critics.

Simmons was incredible but don't overlook Teller, he gave a truly depressing performance that made you want to root for him until the end.

Take your passion and anything that you've ever worked hard for, anything that you've ever wanted and this film is for you. But be careful this movie is about love and simultaneously it is not about love. Not the Hollywood version of love as in every movie you've seen with a beautiful hot and sexy love interest that serves as nothing but to feed the commercial breast that is advertisement for sex in the vein of capitalism that so controls everything in America. Director Damien Chazelle, takes on a subject that everyone can relate to, takes characters everyone can recognize and gives you a story like we've never seen this year.  Ideas of good and evil are explored so intelligently, in the end, nothing is remembered but the positive outcome. When this film was over, I was speechless, it brought a reaction out of me I wasn't sure was possible, but please believe the Hype! Miles Teller and J.K Simmons give outstanding performances! This film is a masterpiece when it comes to story telling and character development as well as character study, absolutely one of the best cinema can offer this year.",

I have to say that the excitement made my expectations elevate, which wasn't necessarily a good thing.\n \nIf you don't know the plot of The Interview you should be ashamed for your lack of keeping up with current events. Just to refresh your minds, The Interview tells the story of a talk show host Dave Skylark (James Franco) who along with his producer Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) are able to get an interview with North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jung-un (Randall Park). The CIA however tasks Dave and Aaron with the mission to kill Kim Jung-un. As you can expect, not everything goes according to plan.\n \nThe film actually was surprisingly light for my expectations. I found that they portrayed Kim Jung-un in a surprisingly humane way. I came off it actually feeling bad for the guy. The actions taken by North Korea against this film were extremely exaggerated, I can predict most of you will come off watching the movie saying: \"That's it?\" The fact that it's also a Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg directed comedy is another reason to think that North Korea's actions were ridiculous. Rogen and Goldberg were the people that \"killed off\" Rihanna, Kevin Hart, Emma Watson, and thousands of other celebrities in This Is The End. Hell, even in the Spanish comedy Torrente 3, they 'accidently' kill President George W. Bush when he was in office. With North Korea's actions we can learn the difference between an educated country and an enslaved country. I think that the real Kim Jung-un has been flattering so much that when a slight pebble is pegged at him he declares war.  \n \nAs for the film, it was alright; it was the typical Rogen-Franco film. The jokes are mostly about sex and drugs, and the humor is extremely repetitive. I was expecting to laugh out loud in a couple of moments, but the actual trailer for the film showed every joke that the film had. I'm serious, there wasn't a single other type of joke. I was disappointed. On the other hand, James Franco surprised me again with his passionate acting. He deals with the subject in the properly exaggerated way so that we all know he's joking; something that North Korea clearly didn't see.\n \nIn the end we are left wanting a little more. The lack of a diversity of jokes and the cyber explosion that the film caused has led for the whole world to expect more from the film, but sadly it didn't deliver. \nC\nWhiplash\nWhipped Up Genius: An Incredible Film that Looks into the Tough World of an Artist\nYoung Critic\n12/30/2014\nIt's hard to make a movie about art. It's even harder to make a movie about an artist's struggle. However, Whiplash goes to face the ultimate challenge of showing the formation of an artist. It would have been easy to make a biopic of a famous musician or painter, but director Damien Chazelle chooses to form his own fictional character in a fictional school. The artistry in the movie is in how immersed and knowledgeable one is of the music world when watching it, and of course the much praised J.K. Simmons is even better than expected in his abusive teacher role.\n \nWhiplash is the story of a young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller) who attends the most elite school of music of New York and of the world. Andrew struggles at an amateur music class as the second drummer. However, during one practice session the conductor of the rigorous and elite music class, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) walks into Andrew's rehearsal. Fletcher only sees Andrew play for mere seconds before he picks him up to be his second drummer. During his first rehearsal Andrew learns that Fletcher abuses his students until they play with hair-thin precision, either that or they are kicked out. Andrew, nervous and young, suffers from Fletcher's abuse to the point that Fletcher throws a chair at Andrew. However, the abuse is much more psychological and scarring than physical, and therein lies the genius of the movie.\n \nJust like Begin Again earlier this year, Whiplash looks at the music world with realistic and raw eyes. However, unlike Begin Again, Whiplash doesn't filter the cruelty of an artist's world to its audience, it throws at you with shocking and appalling honesty. The film isn't sweetened in any way, Andrew's love interest is handled in a realistic way, the outcome of decisive scenes is believable, and best of all, the final scene is intense and explosive.\n \nWhiplash's intensity builds up from the moment one sits down. This tesnion is built into staggering heights so that when Chazelle wants to wrap it up one fears that all his hard work could come tumbling down. In fact Whiplash's last quarter seems to be completely lost, one begins to shiver a cheesy ending is set up, where all loose ends are tied. But thankfully an incredible last scene is able to it wrap up expertly. It was the cherry on top that this film's beginning sequence deserved.\n \nThe acting is very demanding. Miles Teller is pushed to the limits of his acting capabilities. We had seen him bursting from the screen in The Spectacular Now and now he has been given a role that challenges him a lot more. Mr. Simmons, on the other hand, is indomitable. He plays his character with such an angry passion that you barely breathe in fear that he'll snap at you from the screen.\n \nAn incredibly powerful film, whose mounting tension is perfectly concluded with its final scene. J.K. Simmons' charisma is worth every penny.. \nA",

The lively music goes from gut wrenching to heart soaring in a few bars as the film asks, how far it is too far to push someone when creating the next artistic genius? \n\nFar beyond what most are willing to do, according to band instructor Fletcher, who yells screams and throws things, sending his students into depressions laced with anxiety to draw out the inner brilliance he believes is there. Positive reinforcement to him is the anathema to effective teaching, and In order to get at the genius he knows his students are selfishly harboring, he will sacrifice much. Not only the mental stability of his students, but his entire career to be able to take credit for creating the next great jazz musician. \n\nSee this movie for the music, or see it if you're an artist who's ever wanted to give up, or see it because you had a teacher you didn't understand, or because you're a teacher filled with frustration, or see it because you're a parent who's afraid their child will become lost in a force you can barely understand, or see it because at one point you've lost your way and are too prideful to look at a map - but do see this film. \n\n97% wakefulness - Yeah, I have no idea why you'd close your eyes during this one either (Maybe it was those three slices of pizza he'd had for lunch?).

Where did you come from? just wow enough said. I was dying to see him in Fantastic Four after seeing this, this kid is good, this kid can be great. how he was not nominated for an Oscar boggles my mind,  I'm not saying he would have won but he should definitely have been nominated. mind you they didn't nominate Jake Gyllenhaal  either and he killed everyones performance that was nominated. #biggestoscarsnuboftheyear \nanyways I'm getting off topic this film had Great direction great production great sound mixing and a lot of heart and emotion\nand let's not forget my boy J.K. Simmons who friggin blew me away with his acting skills that I didn't even Know he had. i mean i knew he was good but this role was great. the best supporting actor was all his for the taking(i think his only competition was Edward Norton in Birdman).\nany way this movie is a must watch for any movie lover its one of the best if not The best music based movie i have ever seen, maybe even one of the better movies i have ever seen as well\n8 / 10",

Terence Fletcher is abhorrently vicious and vile to his students, spouting hateful verbal abuses with every breath he can muster -- not to mention lying to his pupils, yelling at them, and even physically abusing them in order to get whatever desired reaction he wants. He remains an enigma throughout the film and even til it's end, but despite this, he's not at all an underdeveloped character. His raging verbal taunts directed towards the the lead immediately remind one of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman -- the character from \"Full Metal Jacket\".\n\nFull review here:\nhttp://www.emfaust.com/?p=1815",

The music, the emotions, the story were all fantastic.\n\nI had seen a few previews before watching this movie so I had a general idea what this movie was going to be like. I can honestly say this movie turned out to be a lot better then what I thought. The acting was superb. There were times where I caught myself being sucked into the movie by the characters. Especially J.K. Simmons. He was so tough on his band that he became borderline crazy. But he had a reason for it. Then when he would show his softer side, which I was stunned to see that his character character had this side. I know J.K. Simmons can act but he had me believing so much in his character that I was stunned to see his character \"Terrance Flethcher\" had a soft side. Miles Teller did an outstanding job and I found out after seeing the film that he was the one who actually played the drums in the movie. He really nailed the character. He showed that his character had passion, desire and talent. There were times in the theater where I wanted to say \"Come on man, you can do it\". Most films can not get me to move my mouth to form those words inside the theater. The highly intense jazz music that makes up the soundtrack drove this movie home. After it was over, I was surprised that 1 hour and 46 minutes had gone by. This is a must see for any musician or music fan.",

This really is one of those times where the hype really pays off and where a film impresses the hell out of me and meets and transcends all of my expectations. Every quote that you see on the main poster for this film all perfectly describe the movie in every way. The acting, directing, and editing are all masterful in this film and this one of the most intense movies I have seen in recent memory. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons both give the best performances of their careers and they did flawless jobs playing their characters. J.K. Simmons is an absolute revelation in this film. He has played one of the best antagonists I have ever seen in this century. He plays a music teacher who strives to get the very best out of his students and to do that he will use lots of verbal abuse. J.K. Simmons manages to be scary, charismatic, and funny all at the same time when playing Terence Fletcher. Some of the things that he said had me laughing out loud and feeling frightened by him and he also presented a soft side of him which I didn't see coming and it only made the film even better. There is nothing else I can say about his performance other than that it was brilliant and J.K. Simmons is a lock to win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards this year. Another fantastic performance in this movie comes from Miles Teller. He truly impresses here and this is a big step forward from every other character he has ever played. With this and The Spectacular Now, he shows he can actually act and not just play disposable characters like he did before starring in The Spectacular Now. His character's obsession to be the best at jazz drumming drives the motion picture and shows the road to succeed can be a really hard one. The editing in certain scenes really impressed me and the camera movements and quick cuts were used really well. The soundtrack in the movie is full of great jazz music and it also felt like a character on its own. The ending of this film had me gripping my hands and had me on the edge of my seat and it was one of the most tension-filled endings I have seen in a long time. Damien Chazelle who wrote and directed this film did a masterful job in both fields and he has a bright future ahead of him in Hollywood. The dialogue he wrote was fantastic and it is one of the best scripts of 2014 in my opinion. Overall, this is one hell of a must see for anybody who works hard in their field of work, who loves great acting, and who loves movies in general. Whiplash and Birdman make my top favorite films of 2014.",

            "content": "Whiplash is easliy the best movie of 2014. A statement that I don't think would change if the date were January 2015, rather than December 2014. This movie is phenomenal. The cinematography, the performances, the story telling, the soundtrack, are all done perfectly. Everything is in synch here, running like a well oiled machine.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the Premise, Whiplash is the story of a young man, played by Miles Teller, who is enrolled in school at Shaffer Conservatory, the best music performing college in the United States. He quickly finds himself being the alternative drummer for the Shaffer jazz band, where the director, played by J.K Simmons, is the mentor from hell. His insults and degradation are in a league few antagonists have ever achieved on screen. This is Simmons best performance, and I would be shocked if he were not nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe performances are not the only thing in this film worth drooling over. Director Damien Chazelle is also fantastic, and he knows how to make a small idea feel big. Some of the most exciting shots are of the band members setting up their equipment or emptying their spit catchers. That's not because the other scenes are boring-there aren't any boring scenes in this movie-it's because Chazelle knows how to capture interest with quick cuts, and he knows when to hold a shot and when to do a slow pan.\n\nIf you have a theater in your town that's playing Whiplash, you are doing yourself a diservice if you're not seeing it. The movie is funny, it's moving, and it's ultimately inspiring. It's the best movie of 2014. Do not miss it.",

            "content": "A syncopated rhythm, a fervent tempo; a war of egos and a thirst for greatness. Whiplash - directed by Damien Chazelle - is a film centering on young jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), as he tries to win over ruthless studio band teacher Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) in the most prestigious music conservatory in the country, Shaffer University.\nFletcher puts his entire jazz ensemble on strings, playing the role of a sadistic puppet master. Fletcher especially abuses Neyman and his two alternate drummers by humiliating, jabbing, dismantling their confidence, giving them mixed messages, and toying with their emotions. In pursuit of crafting the next \"Charlie Parker,\" Fletcher slowly deteriorates Neyman's sanity and replaces it with an unrelenting perfectionism. Fletcher digs and gnaws into his student's mind; Neyman soon becomes solely obsessed with becoming the best drummer ever and neglects his other hobbies, his family, and even his girlfriend. From a brutal yet compelling car crash to the motif of bleeding hands, Whiplash arcs a story of perseverance and obsession laced with aggression, entitlement, and the absolute refusal to be just \"good enough.\"\nWhile the plot, directing, and cinematography are all dynamic, what truly brings this story to life is the remarkable acting of J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller. Simmons grows from a jack-ass, hard-nosed, manipulative character to a more subtle, down-to-earth, but equally manipulative version of himself. Simmons is electrifying in both presence and tone. Meanwhile, Teller convincingly plays a young teen whose passion for Jazz becomes an addiction when Simmons pushes him past the brink of possibility. Having to wrestle with his dad's failed writing career to pressures from his underachieving family to trying to impress his teacher in vain, Miles Teller's inability to cope leads him to breaking down and getting expelled from Shaffer. Teller plays a good-natured kid who becomes increasingly entitled, snarky, and arrogant throughout the film; however, the negative progression of his personality does not overshadow his radical transformation into one of the world's most tenacious musicians.\nWhiplash is not without flaws. Fletcher's freedom to physically torture any student at will and use obscene insults without getting fired is definitely hard to believe. The constant blood you would normally associate with an action film is unnaturally used here as a tool to dramatize more than provide a sense of reality. The main - if only - actual issue with the film is the seemingly important but flat characters who only exist to provide perspective into Neyman's life and show the audience everything he had to sacrifice to achieve his dream; for instance, Neyman's girlfriend doesn't possess enough qualities to even be considered a fully functioning character and exists merely to serve a purpose.\nOne of the main compositions played in the movie, \"Whiplash\" by Hank Levy, perfectly mirrors the groove of the film and the meaning of the word itself: this funk-infused, driving, big-band song sets the mood while the lashing of a whip exemplifies the pain Fletcher inflicted upon Neyman and the unbelievable circumstances his student had to endure. Whiplash is one of the most riveting movies of recent years and a definite must see - you'll be gripping onto your seat until the very last clang.",

However, I think this film presents a powerful metaphor for the immense, seemingly insurmountable challenges that stand in the way of realizing full potential and greatness, in music/art or any other endeavor. Instead of viewing the professor as an abhorrent, offensive, unsympathetic jerk, look at him as the devil figure in Crossroads (biopic of Robert Johnson) or as that force inside each of us that tells us we're not good enough. For me, this was a highly successful film, inspiring and motivating me to keep pursuing greatness in my life and career.

It seems that too often in films characters in similar positions make compromises and opt for relationships that are billed as higher values than greatness and mastery.  This protagonist makes no such compromises and the payoff is an argument for being driven by such purpose.  It has been a long time since I have left a movie theater feeling this emotionally rewarded.\n\nAs the performances go Miles Teller is solid in the lead, but J.K Simmons is absolutely riveting.\n\nAs a side note, I think the film raises some interesting questions for those in the field of performing arts pedagogy.

It has Oscar Material written all over it.\n\nIt tells the story of a young jazz student (Miles Teller), with dreams of becoming the next great drummer. He gets into the best music school in the country, but finds out that his instructor (Simmons) is incredibly strict (read:the biggest d**k in the world.) He's a perfectionist, verbally abusive, and yells often. So the drummer sacrifices a lot to please him, and the film highlights the highs and lows of their relationship.\n\nThis movie was pretty intense. You start to feel for the drummer, as he struggles to become the best, practicing until his hands bleed, and being constantly rejected. You start to care whether he fails or succeeds.  The story is very moving and even disturbing at times. The movies plot is unpredictable, and it even got the audience to gasp at one point near the climax.\n\nThe movie's also worth seeing for it's acting. JK Simmons' nominated performance as the instructor was very good. Having previously played J Jonah Jameson in the original Spider-man trilogy, he does a good job of playing an unpleasant person, spraying vulgar insults and criticisms at his students. But he also seems human at times when you can see his motives. There's also some great acting from Miles Teller as the drummer. He is a very sympathetic and believable character.\n\nIn summary, Whiplash is an amazing movie. Even though it hasn't gotten the attention from audience that it deserves, it is worth your time. If you like intense drama, emotionally charged performances, or jazz music, I would recommend this movie. I don't want to over-hype this movie, but I think it is actually worth 5 stars.",

It's brilliantly edited, building tension out of nothing but the playing of the drums until you're wound so tight tou reach a breaking point. It is more exciting and enthralling than most blockbuster action flicks, but it gives the same rush. The performances from leads Miles Teller and J.K.

Whiplash was one of them and now having seen the film I can honestly say I get the hype. This film is one of the most intense movies of the year I would even go and say this is one of the best of the decade. Whiplash is a film that does brilliantly on just about everything. The performances are just amazing. Miles Teller is so good, he's so like able and just really sells his character. He's a fantastic actor who's great in everything but this is his stand out role. However even though Miles Teller is brilliant he's outshined by J.K. Simmons. Except for Spider-Man I honestly haven't seen him in much, he was so brilliant in this movie. He was scary, funny and felt more like an angry drill instructor than a teacher. He plays the character of fletcher so well and he 100% deserves his Oscar. The character of Fletcher is one of the best characters ever put to film. We really see how seriously this guy takes his job by the way he berates and then kicks out one of his students for thinking he is out of tune. Or the way he walks into the classroom and we see the looks of fear on the students faces. The character of Terrence Fletcher is one of the most intense and down right terrifying characters put to film and so much of that comes from Simmons outstanding performance. Whiplash is also amazingly directed, I don't think I have seen anything else from Damian Chazelle but he's directed this film fantastically and I can't wait to see what he does next. One of Whiplash's strongest aspects is the amazing writing. The script for this film is brilliant, all of the lines feel very natural and some of the lines Simmons has are so creative. The editing is amazing. Every transition or cut feels flawless. The way the drumming scenes are edited are too amazing to describe. The cinematography is also fantastic there is this one dizzying shot when Miles Teller is drumming that is just brilliant. This film is also ridiculously tense, whenever we get scenes of Teller drumming with the band and Simmons watching it's very intense as you get the feeling he could snap at any minute. The scenes where Teller practices on his own are so intense as we see that he is pushing himself so much, covering the drum in blood and sweat it can be very hard to watch but I couldn't stop watching. This film also has an amazing ending, it is ridiculously intense and Teller shines in this portion. If I had any complaints there was a 5-10 minute but in the film where it's just Teller and there is no Simmons or drumming. It slows down what is a very fast paced film. However the scenes are good they just aren't as great as the rest of the film. Whiplash is a ridiculously tense movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. It has amazing acting, directing, editing, cinematography, sound mixing, music it's just a fantastic film and I'm so glad that I saw it. It's one of the best movies of 2015 and a film we will still be talking about years later. A",

He thinks he can make it, and his new teacher Fletcher (Simmons) thinks he has some potential too, their interesting roller coaster of a relationship makes the journey to find out if he has what it takes quite interesting.  False confidence, ridicule, verbal abuse, physical abuse are all tools Fletcher uses to try and instill greatness in his students. Some students don\u00e2??t handle this well. Most it seems. Andrew\u00e2??s talent and willingness to fight back make him different. Performances from Teller and Simmons, along with some innately crafted musical scenes and some sharp dialogue make this drama intriguing.

The story of becoming successful is nothing new but the way Whiplash shows this drummers' mental, physical, and emotional struggle is very intense. After about 20 minutes in you always got chills when J.K Simmons enters a scene because he makes ferocity his specialty even when he wasn't actually yelling. There were several moments on screen where I just couldn't imagine myself trying to own up to this brutal teacher because he frightens me even as a viewer. I felt like there was a lot of developing character throughout the movie with Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons character which was very well done. The ending of film is a bit against itself because it ends with one of those cut to black after one final moment type of things when I felt like there was gonna be one more piece of dialogue left between it's two main characters. Nether the less it was pretty much my favorite movie that came out this year because of it's two characters so definitely watch it when you can.",

            "content": "Intense. There is really no better word to describe Whiplash. Writer-director Damien Chazelle's fast-paced musical drama about the complex relationship between an aspiring first-year jazz student and a sadistic conductor is intense for numerous reasons: firstly, drums are the most physically demanding of all instruments, and the film discloses this by having the main character, Andrew Neimann, hammering his hands bloody and sweating like a pig. Secondly, J.K. Simmons delivers one of the most frantic, vociferous performances of the year as the abusive Terence Fletcher, and is on par with R. Lee Ermey's iconic performance in Full Metal Jacket. And thirdly, the film is looks incredibly alive through Tom Cross' fierce editing. Whiplash has the audience primarily exhausted, but in a good way, yet there is too much nuance and ambiguity in it to call it merely an emotional experience. It challenges us to question what it takes to be truly great at something; Fletcher takes pleasure in embarrassing his students and hurting them both mentally and physically, but his formidable methods also inspire them to excel. He never encourages them with cheap praises, and even when Andrew thinks he has earned his respect, Fletcher tantalizes him again. Andrew could obviously go from where the fence is lowest, let his affectionate father tell him he did a \"good job\" (two words which Fletcher considers as the most dangerous in the English language), live an unambitious life and be just another run-of-the-mill slacker, but his persistence and ambition ultimately triumph. There are a couple problems with the film; Miles Teller's drumming is very authentic, but as an actor he should be more expressive, and cinematographer Sharone Meir's constant use of extreme close-ups gets often irritating. But thanks to Chazelle's potent direction, smart screenplay and Simmons' unforgettable performance, Whiplash lives up to its title.",

Did you have that one teacher that stood out above all the rest, the one that realized potential in you and gave you the push that you needed to do something great? Maybe that teacher or professor was beloved by many, and other students always only had the greatest things to say about that instructor. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe they were notorious. Maybe there were widely referred to as the \"hard ass\" teacher that nobody liked, except for a small, devoted group of disciples that hung on their every word, where the smallest hint of approval was gobbled up like mana from heaven, and if you ever got that approval, by god, you EARNED it. I had a teacher sort of like that. He wasn't universally hated, but he wasn't necessarily loved by everyone either. He was the best teacher I have ever had, and he pushed me to succeed. He didn't dole out hugs and candy canes. When I did well on an assignment, he said things like \"it's an improvement. Keep pushing.\" I have nothing but the utmost respect for that man.\n\nIn Whiplash, a young man named Andrew (Miles Teller) is enrolled at a prestigious music conservatory to pursue a career as a drummer. An infamous instructor, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), takes notice of the freshman drummer, and invites him to his exclusive jazz band, where Andrew will be put to the test and his limits pushed beyond his bounds in a quest for glory.\n\nFletcher is the instructor from hell. He's like a swearing, screaming Mr. Holland from \"Mr. Holland's Opus.\" His goal is absolute perfection, and anything less than that means utter failure. This is a movie about a battle of wits and wills. If you're not bleeding on your instrument, you don't have a right to play it. Andrew does not want to stop until he becomes the thing of legends, and Fletcher will settle for nothing less than absolute greatness.\n\nWhen folks watch the trailer for this movie, they might think \"Oh look, a jazz movie! Neato.\" I assure you, this is as much a suspenseful thriller as it is an exploration of the intricacies of jazz music. It is very intense, and I didn't think that could be possible in a movie about a jazz ensemble. \n\nIf you're a musician, it's easy to appreciate that aspect of this film. Its rhythmic and propulsive, explosive and exhilarating. If you've ever sat down and practiced your craft for hours, trying to get that ONE THING right that just escapes your grasp, you'll understand this movie. \n\nJ.K. Simmons as Fletcher is the most outstanding part of this film, and I hope he gets some award recognition. He is monolithic and intimidating, and delivers some of the most creative put-downs I've ever heard. Some of his insults are so intense that they made me laugh out of shock. It's often crass, yes, but wowzers is it effective. \n\nAlso impressive is Miles Teller's ability on the drums, which was not performed by a double. He's been playing the instrument since his teens, and he is pretty fantastic at it. \n\nThis is a simple movie, but incredibly satisfying. It didn't have a large budget, it went largely unnoticed by the majority of movie-goers, and was filmed in like, three weeks. But this is absolutely one of the best films of 2014, and I enjoyed every single minute of it. The last 15 minutes are absolutely explosive, and you'll want to stand up and cheer. I always love it when your first reaction to the end of a film is simply \"...wow.\"",

The Jazz is the sort of large ensemble Lincoln Center thing that I don't care for all that much. At one point  J.K. Simmons (who is wonderful) laments that Jazz is dying in America and I sort of blame the Lincoln Center folks and the emphasis on exactitude for that. Jazz should, in my opinion, retain the loose mixing of talent that were it's origins. But there I go giving a Jazz lecture instead of a movie review. All the movie is the interaction of Miles Teller as a young Jazz drummer and J.K. Simmons as the nearly psychotic music teacher. The young man's desire to be a great drummer becomes an obsession and the teacher takes advantage of that for his own twisted purposes. This is  well interspersed with great drum solos albeit in the style of Buddy Rich and that school of machine gun drumming. The supporting cast have very small roles, but Paul Reiser and Milissa Benoist hold up their ends nicely. All in all a good movie if you like music or just good acting.",

            "content": "As a lifelong musician who went on to receive his bachelor's degree in music, this film hit home with me. Not only was it a really well done movie, but I found myself laughing at every little nuance of our world that was, for the first time, revealed on screen. It acts as a long-deserved glorification of the musician and the hours of practice that we spend at home practicing our craft. It also touches upon so many ideas and struggles that we have to constantly deal with. The belittling comparison to athletics in this film is one that I have always had an issue with. So much attention and money is shelled towards sports--something that people are less likely to become successful through than music. When music is a tool that is more useful, people scoff at it and give it no attention. Those of us in that world know its importance, but getting the \"normal people\" to understand that is almost useless. If someone gets to be starting quarterback they are worshipped and bragged about, but when someone earns first chair saxophone it usually just warrants us a simple pat on the back as if we were just getting an A- on an algebra test. Luckily I had parents that were extremely enthusiastic and supportive of my music endeavors--always bragging about what I have accomplished. That's why the only thing in this movie that I can criticize is Andrew's dad's negativity towards his son's music career. It doesn't make sense that his dad would pay for and support Andrew in music academy, but then go on to tell him that he would never play at the Lincoln Center. It was the only thing random and out of place in this film. It caused unnecessary tension between the two characters. But that scene doesn't warrant dismissal altogether. It may also be one of the most true and honest parts of this movie. People are praised when they are said to be going to college to play football, but when I tell others that I am a music major, most people's response is \"Why?\" or \"So, what are you going to do with that?\" When in reality, I am unbelievably more likely to get a job in my industry than an athlete is in his or hers. But because sports are deemed as cooler, nobody cares. Whiplash touches upon and pokes fun at these typical ideals, which makes the film all the more great. But perhaps the one thing in this movie that I can relate to the most is having an instructor eerily similar to that of J.K. Simmons' character, Terence Fletcher.\n\nIn high school I was in jazz band that started every morning at 7am. And if I wasn't tuned up and ready to go by 7:00 exactly, my teacher would start the rest of the band while glaring at me the entire time as I was frantically trying to get everything setup. This was me almost everyday. I felt like he hated me because he thought that I didn't care enough to get there on time and that I was ruining his valued rehearsal time. Little did he know, I did everything to make it to rehearsals and performances on time. I sped through lights, rolled through stop signs, and probably almost hit several pedestrians at times. But honestly, it had nothing to do with caring about not wasting his time--I just didn't want to get yelled at. Honestly, I didn't care as much as everyone else. I should have, but I didn't. That's where Miles Teller's character and I differ. I had other things on my mind--girlfriends, my social life, sleeping. Throughout high school we had a weird relationship. He would always scold me about things while the rest of the band would sit there in an awkward silence thanking the Lord that it was me and not them. Much like when we, much like in this movie, would sit there for 10 minutes while our teacher would yell at the drummer for not being at his tempo. The scenes in this film almost exactly replicated what happened in our rehearsals. It was almost funny, but you wouldn't dare laugh. There was a genuine fear that he placed in all of us. He and Fletcher shared the philosophy that belittling and humiliation helped to motivate. In a way, they're right. It's just not for everybody.\n\nI practiced my parts at home for bare minimum--an hour every couple of days. I was 2nd chair tenor saxophone the entire time. One time we had a jazz competition and I forgot all of my music. To this day it was the most nervous I have ever been. There I am, in the front row, 6 feet from my teacher, and I was pretending to play an entire folder of music. Some I could bare through off the top of my head, but most I had to improvise. It was a real test of how well I knew the music. A test that I failed. I'm not sure if he knew what was up with me. To this day I'm convinced that he did, but just let me suffer through the agony rather than saving me the humiliation by making me sit backstage. If I had practiced, I wouldn't have needed the music to begin with.\n\nHe had lost his voice a few years before I got there, but I'm not sure how. We always speculated it was because of his yelling, but we never really knew. He was a stickler for everything and none of us understood it. We feared him, but also respected him at a high rate because he did what no other teacher had, or will, ever do--go to extremes to make sure that we never satisfied for mediocre. Doing music in college was the last thing I ever thought that I would do. I have him to thank. He put me one step ahead of the game and taught me that music was just as meaningful as sports--if not more. He hated playing at the football games because he thought that such a beautiful thing as music shouldn't pander to a silly thing such as high school football. He had his ideals set. We didn't understand at the time, but his passion for the art transcend to me all these years later.\n\nMy teacher wasn't as extreme as Terence Fletcher in Whiplash, but he was definitely on my mind the entire time I watched this movie.\n\nAs for the film, it was fantastic. It features great jazz, and equally as good acting, and the story never drags. It's a must watch for anyone who was ever in an ensemble.\n\nTwizard Rating: 99",

The need for man to overpower one another is abundant in society today.   I personally have struggled with those who take to the harsher side of mentoring others.   \nThis is the story of a young college student whom has aspirations of becoming one of the greatest drummers of all time.   He is enlisted into a prestigious jazz orchestra and has to endure the unethical teachings of the one who put him in position to become all he can be. \nThe story would like to conclude that people will not give something there very best and work until their hands bleed unless they are driven by someone else to get there.   This could be true,  but the drive is where they lose me.  Too many people believe in order to get the best out of someone,  you have to put them in a place that makes them feel they cannot do anything right.   Most people react to this approach by giving up.   The point is made that this teacher will accept that as someone who doesn't have the will to be great. \nI couldn't disagree more. I believe that people can be mentored without these ridiculous methods.  Holding someone accountable without making them want to commit suicide should not be so difficult to comprehend. \nSo,  did I enjoy the movie?   Yes,  I did.   In that the story shows the reality of who we think we are.   And how we think we need to treat one another. Yet,  I also hated the movie at the same time because it conveyed this mistreatment as something that eventually turns into greatness. As if the best leaders can only see greatness through destroying one's soul. \nThis movie will have a hold on me for a while and I hope that many can see it as a representation of how this way of life destroys lives.  \nSome of the best acting I have seen for a 2014 movie.   I really hated J. K. Simmons' character in this movie,  so credit goes to him for that.   I will never look at him the same way.   \n3.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "\"They are no two words more harmful in the English language than good job.\" -Terrance Fletcher \n\tDamien Chazelle has not done a good job with Whiplash. He has done an OUTSTANDING job with this film. With a watertight screenplay, amazing performances from the leads, and a keen eye for direction Chazelle created a visceral experience centered around a drum set. Whiplash is the story of Andew Neiman, a jazz drummer who finds himself in a award winning studio jazz band that is run by a man named Terrance Fletcher, a brilliant and ruthless instructor who only cares about getting the best performance from his students. Chazelle, has crafted a film so fine tuned that nothing fell flat. I'll start with the talent in front of the camera for Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are perfect. Teller, who actually plays the drums in real life, captured the hardship of a young musician. That strive to become better than you were the day before was always present in Andrew's character. I am a musician myself and I know this look very well. Teller really shows his acting talents and I hope to see more of his work in the future. On the other side of this coin is Simmons who plays the most intimidating characters I have seen in 2014. Seeing the no holds bar Fletcher just grill Andrew was intense and cruel. Yet, Fletcher's intentions are not in spite but in for the favor of his students so it is hard to totally hate the man, especially since Simmons brings a strong likability to the character in brief moments. (Simmons will probably take home the Oscar this year) The screenplay provides some of the best dialogue i have seen in 2014. Conversations fill honest and are never just filler. I could never tell where the film was going, which is good in this case as I was always engaged in the story hoping that Neiman would succeed. The soundtrack is amazing, especially if you love jazz like me. The direction is superb as I felt apart of the band in Whiplash. The way Chazelle showed the sheer brutality of being a jazz drummer though Neiman's excessive practicing was very unnerving. This film also has the best finale I have seen in 2014. I could think of a million other reasons why I loved Whiplash but I rather give you the opportunity to see it. If Whiplash is playing anywhere near you in a 50 mile radius than I encourage you to see it for it is definitely my favorite film of 2014.",

It is taut and assured; no wasted scenes slow the movie's brisk pace, the plot twists are at times over-the-top but compelling, and the characters smartly written and well-defined. \n\nMany people will characterize this movie as a study of great talent and the extreme lengths one must go to tap into it. But for me the movie's true brilliance lies in the questions it raises, not the answers it provides. By the end of the movie I found myself wondering if Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) was really a demanding hard-ass who just yearned to maximize the talent of his promising young student, or a bully who merely took satisfaction from grinding him down. The fact that the movie left me wondering about this is the key to its genius. It is a movie about talent. But more than that, it is a movie about obsession. Obsession for music, obsession for greatness, obsession for towering above the rest--by any means necessary. A movie that acknowledges we must take risks and make great sacrifices to reach great heights would be at best a pedestrian film. Whiplash poses the better question: by taking great risks, by making great sacrifices, are we paying the price of greatness, or are we selling our souls?",

The music is great but the drama is so overdone and negative that it throws a wet blanket over the feel, spontaneity and creative vitality of the jazz - so much so, that I no longer cared what happened to Neyman, Fletcher or the music.

            "content": "As a lifelong musician who went on to receive his bachelor's degree in music, this film hit home with me. Not only was it a really well done movie, but I found myself laughing at every little nuance of our world that was, for the first time, revealed on screen. It acts as a long-deserved glorification of the musician and the hours of practice that we spend at home practicing our craft. It also touches upon so many ideas and struggles that we have to constantly deal with. The belittling comparison to athletics in this film is one that I have always had an issue with. So much attention and money is shelled towards sports--something that people are less likely to become successful through than music. When music is a tool that is more useful, people scoff at it and give it no attention. Those of us in that world know its importance, but getting the \"normal people\" to understand that is almost useless. If someone gets to be starting quarterback they are worshipped and bragged about, but when someone earns first chair saxophone it usually just warrants us a simple pat on the back as if we were just getting an A- on an algebra test. Luckily I had parents that were extremely enthusiastic and supportive of my music endeavors--always bragging about what I have accomplished. That's why the only thing in this movie that I can criticize is Andrew's dad's negativity towards his son's music career. It doesn't make sense that his dad would pay for and support Andrew in music academy, but then go on to tell him that he would never play at the Lincoln Center. It was the only thing random and out of place in this film. It caused unnecessary tension between the two characters. But that scene doesn't warrant dismissal altogether. It may also be one of the most true and honest parts of this movie. People are praised when they are said to be going to college to play football, but when I tell others that I am a music major, most people's response is \"Why?\" or \"So, what are you going to do with that?\" When in reality, I am unbelievably more likely to get a job in my industry than an athlete is in his or hers. But because sports are deemed as cooler, nobody cares. Whiplash touches upon and pokes fun at these typical ideals, which makes the film all the more great. But perhaps the one thing in this movie that I can relate to the most is having an instructor eerily similar to that of J.K. Simmons' character, Terence Fletcher.\n\nIn high school I was in jazz band that started every morning at 7am. And if I wasn't tuned up and ready to go by 7:00 exactly, my teacher would start the rest of the band while glaring at me the entire time as I was frantically trying to get everything setup. This was me almost everyday. I felt like he hated me because he thought that I didn't care enough to get there on time and that I was ruining his valued rehearsal time. Little did he know, I did everything to make it to rehearsals and performances on time. I sped through lights, rolled through stop signs, and probably almost hit several pedestrians at times. But honestly, it had nothing to do with caring about not wasting his time--I just didn't want to get yelled at. Honestly, I didn't care as much as everyone else. I should have, but I didn't. That's where Miles Teller's character and I differ. I had other things on my mind--girlfriends, my social life, sleeping. Throughout high school we had a weird relationship. He would always scold me about things while the rest of the band would sit there in an awkward silence thanking the Lord that it was me and not them. Much like when we, much like in this movie, would sit there for 10 minutes while our teacher would yell at the drummer for not being at his tempo. The scenes in this film almost exactly replicated what happened in our rehearsals. It was almost funny, but you wouldn't dare laugh. There was a genuine fear that he placed in all of us. He and Fletcher shared the philosophy that belittling and humiliation helped to motivate. In a way, they're right. It's just not for everybody.\n\nI practiced my parts at home for bare minimum--an hour every couple of days. I was 2nd chair tenor saxophone the entire time. One time we had a jazz competition and I forgot all of my music. To this day it was the most nervous I have ever been. There I am, in the front row, 6 feet from my teacher, and I was pretending to play an entire folder of music. Some I could bare through off the top of my head, but most I had to improvise. It was a real test of how well I knew the music. A test that I failed. I'm not sure if he knew what was up with me. To this day I'm convinced that he did, but just let me suffer through the agony rather than saving me the humiliation by making me sit backstage. If I had practiced, I wouldn't have needed the music to begin with.\n\nHe had lost his voice a few years before I got there, but I'm not sure how. We always speculated it was because of his yelling, but we never really knew. He was a stickler for everything and none of us understood it. We feared him, but also respected him at a high rate because he did what no other teacher had, or will, ever do--go to extremes to make sure that we never satisfied for mediocre. Doing music in college was the last thing I ever thought that I would do. I have him to thank. He put me one step ahead of the game and taught me that music was just as meaningful as sports--if not more. He hated playing at the football games because he thought that such a beautiful thing as music shouldn't pander to a silly thing such as high school football. He had his ideals set. We didn't understand at the time, but his passion for the art transcend to me all these years later. \n\nMy teacher wasn't as extreme as Terence Fletcher in Whiplash, but he was definitely on my mind the entire time I watched this movie. \n\nAs for the film, it was fantastic. It features great jazz, and equally as good acting, and the story never drags. It's a must watch for anyone who was ever in an ensemble.\n\nTwizard Rating: 99",

There isn't much depth to these two, and opportunities to find other colors in these characters is often eschewed for pace and style, but this is more than made up for by the film's radiant love for the art forms of both jazz and movies - evident in every frame... blood, sweat, and all.

Miles Teller is perfect as his pupil whose atypical coming of age puts at risk either lifelong success or absolute failure.\n\n'Whiplash' has the intensity of a horror-thriller and the adrenaline of a war movie. Considering that it primarily consists of its two leads playing off each other, that's an incredible accomplishment. If your heart isn't racing when the credits roll, you're probably dead.",

            "content": "There's really only one word to describe \"Whiplash\": Intense. That's not a word I'd expect to use when describing a film about a 19 year old jazz drummer who dreams of becoming the next Charlie Parker. Actually, to be more specific, he dreams of being better than the next Charlie Parker. Folks, this is one of the great films of 2014.\nMiles Teller stars as Andrew Neyman. His only focus in life is the drums. In fact, he sacrifices the chance to be in a relationship with a girl he really likes because he knows he'll neglect her in the future in favor of the drums. (It's curious to wonder why he even asked her out in the first place.) Note how often directer Damien Chazelle frames Andrew and the drums together - they're one in the same. \nAt the start of the movie, we find ourselves in a deserted corridor; the only thing filling the hallways is the sound of someone drumming. The camera slowly tracks down the hallway and approaches where the drumming is coming from. There we see Andrew. He looks as if he's just finished training for a marathon. He notices he's not alone, and we then meet Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a highly respected instructor at the\nfictional Schaefer Conservatory (the best jazz school in the country). This is Andrew's big shot to impress Fletcher. He doesn't. And this sets up the rest of the film, really: Andrew will continue to do whatever it takes - whatever it takes! - to win the adulation of Fletcher. For Andrew, receiving praise from his supportive father (Paul Reiser - in an incredibly sweet role) isn't enough. Even his father questions why it's so important\nfor Andrew to win praise from Fletcher. I'm not sure Andrew understands himself. He teeters between insecurity and confidence - he never quite finds a common ground. Hearing the words, \"Good job\" isn't enough for Andrew. He wants to be the best - even if he dies young and penniless, as long as people remember him for his drumming he regards that as success. But how far can you push yourself to get to that level? And how far will you allow someone else to push you to that level? \"Whiplash\" posits this,\nand the intensity I mentioned earlier comes from Andrew's actions and Fletcher's teaching \"methods.\" Does Fletcher cross the line when pushing Andrew? (Had his intense - or insane? - teaching methods pushed another student to suicide?) Fletcher raises an interesting point of view: If he fills each student with praise, will they ever\npush themselves to achieve their greatest potential, or will they just coast through life believing they've already achieved greatness?\nThe film, directed by first-timer Damien Chazelle, was directed in an astounding 19 days. The whole rhythm of the film feels like a jazz performance - jazz is all about the ensemble and improvisation, and that's exactly what makes \"Whiplash\" feel so fresh. The film never follows the conventional route.\nJ.K. Simmons will certainly score an Oscar nomination and, to be honest, I think he's the one to beat. (I also learned that he holds a degree in music, and knew how to conduct prior to filming.) Even when he's not speaking, we can see how intimidating he is.\nThere are, however, a few moments that feel a bit unbelievable in the movie. At one point, Andrew is in a pretty bad car accident, yet in the scenes that follow he has no apparent cuts/scars/bruises... was this an oversight in post-production? It's a tiny piece of criticism that certainly doesn't harm the film's power. This is a movie carried by its performers. And Simmons and Miles Teller are electric.",

Andrew is conveniently anti-social, leaving little room for us to see his character in contexts other than the practice room.

In order to succeed in one of the most prestigious jazz music Academies, Andrew must not only tackle the abuse of Fletcher but the hardships and lengths involved in becoming truly great. \n\nThis was probably one of the least surprising results I've received from a film this year but in no stretch whatsoever is that a critique. I knew ever since I saw the remarkable trailer earlier this year for the film that it was something to keep an eye on and it did not disappoint. This is a fine example of a film that is just utterly perfect at what it sets out to do and your gauge of likeability is centralized around the movies core theme and message. In the cases of \"Whiplash\", it sets out to tell a tale of artistic sacrifice, abuse and reaching the very limits of the human condition; all wrapped up neatly in the trappings of a drama with jazz at the centre. The best part is, you don't have to be a fan of jazz to enjoy this movie because it's just so damn entertaining, tense and clear-cut that you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn't leave the theatre with a big smile on their face.\n\nA lot of thanks to the films execution is in large part delegated to the immaculate direction by Damien Chazelle. No single frame, edit or lingering shot was wasted in the picture; it just flows so viscerally and naturally that you lose yourself in your seat. I never once checked my watch, in fact, I could have kept watching this movie. Well, now let's talk about the elephant in the room... Or in this case, two elephants. As I said, the direction was vital in this movie's success but I think it's crowning achievement is in the two lead performances at its central core. Both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are OSCAR worthy in this movie... There's really nothing else that needs to be said. They're just incredible! So much so that despite the solid direction, I don't think this movie would have worked as well as it did without them. There's a veracity and determination in Teller's eyes that from the opening shot make you immediately route for him. This is only amplified when you learn that Teller translated his rock drummer background to the film's more technical jazz drumming which makes a fire light-up inside you every time he picks up the sticks. On the opposing end, you have yourself a tour-de force performance from Simmons. He's filled with pent up rage, manipulation and yet he's so passionate about the art of jazz that you just can't help but find him endearing. The two characters and their \"locked-horn\" relationship is what truly makes this film knock it out of the park and will have everyone on the edge of their seats.\n\nI cannot recommend you see this movie enough. It's a fine example of acting, film-making and art. It's inspiring, engaging, thrilling and might have the best ending/cut to black of any film of 2014. If you appreciate movies and want more quality entertainment from this near limitless art-form, you should make an honest effort in seeing one of the year's very best films.\n\nGRADE: A",

Written and directed by Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline On a Park Bench), from his own experience as a drum student, Whiplash is a heady battle to the death, and a potent provocation: just how much of ourselves should we sacrifice to be excellent.\n\nWhen Andrew Neyman (Teller) goes head to head with bullying instructor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), there's blood on the drums, on the walls, on Andrew's very psyche. Terence runs his band like a drill sargeant, with barbs that would make R. Lee Ermey biush. Heaven help you if you're not on his tempo. Chazelle, 29, stages these drum duels with startling skill, and the two lead actors are more than outstanding. Teller (The Spectacular Now), a drummer himself, is a young actor of brilliant nuance and grit. And Simmons, who can play pure evil (see him in HBO's Oz), sweet (Juno), hilarious (the Spider-Man trilogy) and everything in between, is superb. Simmons is an acting beast, here's hoping there's finally some award recognition in his future. Together, he and Teller make Whiplash the electrifying music that it is.",

The focus on drummer  Andrew (Miles Teller) gives some indication to the ferocious energy that is about to come your way; this is made abundantly clear within the opening minutes. When it really strikes home that this film is going to pin you to the wall and not let go is the introduction of Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons in a career high performance. \n\nThe frightening, disarming and at times outright evil of Fletcher is wonderfully brought to life by Simmons in a way that you'll be unlikely to forget him for a long while. Scene after standout scene we're provoked by this character, loving to hate him throughout.\n\nDamien Chazelle's direction is just as furious, barely allowing us to catch our breath between shouting, drum solos, bleeding hands and grown men brought to tears.  His screenplay is a gift to both Simmons and Teller, their powerful performances coming naturally from the snappy screenplay.\n\nIt does have it's flaws. Neither central characters are particularly likeable, one of which we can understand but the other stops us from every fully investing in the protagonist's plight. This also leads to Simmon's character in particular to seem veer a little into caricature and over the top at times - like a cartoon bad guy.\n\nThe film lacks any clear resolution, in my opinion, and seems to stop at the climax. I can, in some respects, understand why it ended where it did - I just wanted five more minutes to clear everything up.\n\nAll in all, this comes highly recommended. A film unlike any other you'll see this year, or any year to be honest. Sit down, strap in, grab your sticks and prepare for a white-knuckle ride!",

It is also cut together very, very well, especially in the scenes when Teller's character, Andrew Neyman, is drumming. JK Simmons is the star of this movie, however, and his performance NEEDS to be discussed. His was one of the best performances by an actor, not just in a supporting role, but even in a lead role, that I have EVER seen. It would be a pure travesty if he doesn't win the Oscar for best supporting actor. I loved Ethan Hawke and Ed Norton in Boyhood and Birdman, but JK Simmons was FLAWLESS in this performance, and he should be recognized as such.",

The story is somewhat predictable, but the performances really make it worth watching.  J.K. Simmons should get an Oscar nomination and Miles teller is excellent in a serious role, I find him hilarious in comedies so nice to know he has acting chops.  This one will make my Top 10 films list for sure.  This is a must watch!",

            "content": "With a rush of adrenaline and a wave of support for the young protagonist, Andrew, Whiplash ends with one of the best climaxes of film in recent years. This is not the typical \"rising-star drama\" of an underdog who transgresses from zero to hero and spend hours of screen time practicing and struggling through physical and mental barriers in order to culminate in a final moment of greatness. One, because  Andrew is already a great drummer but with the aspiration of becoming THE GREATEST drummer. There are many moments within the film to prove of his present talent. It further refuses to fall on the clich\u00e9 of giving Andrew everything he wants in the end beyond his moment of validation.  On his path, he has left his romantic and personal life behind, and although he leaves us with a high note, this may or may not be the be the best for him in the end.\n\nOpposing Andrew, J.K Simmons arrives as his instructor, Fletcher, with a blend of menace and a natural comedic flare, familiar to his roles in Juno, Spiderman, and the brief cameo in Burn After Reading. From the very opening shot, he is seen as a snake spying on Andrew down the hall and tempting him with greatness and prestige. When he is in a scene, he is the only character in the scene. \n\nOn an artistic level, the cinematography strikes impressions of Wes Anderson to develop ideas of uniformity both in the practice and theory of Jazz. It also confirms that this is a story about Andrew rather than a love letter to Jazz or the drums. In close-ups, Andrew is the focus. Not once does a shot includes the drum kit without the presence of the performer. The blood that drips onto the snare and the sweat that shatters off the cymbal belong to our protagonist and remind us what this film is truly expressing. \n\nAs a character piece, expect strong nominations for Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. Considering the Academy's track record of Best Pictures, I wouldn't expect it to find its way to the stage, although it may prove worthy for a Golden Globe.",

            "content": "Drumming up an exhilarating and emotional rollercoaster of a drama, writer-director Damien Chazelle's blistering music-story plays so fast and furiously with the audiences sympathies that whiplash nearly occurs. If the Great Santini taught at Fame, it might look a lot like this. What price, greatness? That's a question that Whiplash nails down violently and profanely. On one hand, the teacher goes too far. On the other hand, the student gives a better performance. Anybody pushed by a mentor or who strives under their own worst critic  themselves - surely relates. Its the authenticity of the acting and, by proxy to the performance, instrument playing that really makes you consider this price, however.\n\nIn this R-rated musical drama, a promising young drummer (Teller) enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where a driven instructor (Simmons) stops at nothing to realize the student's potential. \n\nIn an intentionally polarizing role that makes Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket come off like Pooh Bear, J.K. Simmons gives the greatest performance of his already great career and one of the best dramatic turns of the year. As a filmgoer, you bristle at his maniacal slave-driving. When hot-headed, blister-handed Miles Teller drums himself into a seemingly possessed absolute frenzy at the climax, however, you practically sweat and bleed along with him. Due every bit of recognition surely coming his way this awards season, this actor plays every note of Tim Simonec's amazing, original jazz songbook. Yes, what results from their hard work truly makes you think, but you'll be tapping your knee to keep time while the brain toils all the same. With such frenetic performances and an improvisational jazz influence, filmgoers might suspect that writer-director Damien Chazelle would mostly take a handheld approach. They'd be wrong. Smartly using stead-cam to capture the on-screen madness only keeps the explosive goings-on that much MORE in focus.\n\nBottom line: Ringo of Fire",

            "content": "Every adjective they use to describe this in the trailer is accurate.  So this is about an ambitious young drummer (Miles Teller), wanting to be the next great musician.  To get there, you need to get the appropriate training, and at Shaffer Conservatory, there is an instructor (J.K. Simmons), who is renowned for pushing students to realize their full potential.  I don't even want to pussyfoot around this: if there is a movie from this year that thoroughly exceeded my already high expectations, this is the one.  I walked out of the theater floored, and I did not realize how much I was holding my breath until the end credits were rolling.  My interest for this first sparked when Korey Coleman of doubletoasted.com gave this the honorary rating of \"your movie is so good, it made my life look like shit.\"  I have to say that I share the same sentiment.  This is tightly written, emotionally charged and scary good at every single turn.  This is roughly 100 minutes, but it only feels like 60 because it is so incredibly engaging.  All the credit in the world goes to the two actors, Teller and Simmons; the performances that the director was able to get out of them are nothing short of astonishing.  They play off each other so well that they deserve accolades on top of accolades.  Before I gush about Simmons like everybody else, let me first send some praise Miles Teller's way.  Simmons wouldn't be as good as he is if he didn't have somebody to reciprocate; acting is reacting, and Teller dishes it right back to him.  You can tell how much of himself he put into this, and you can feel every ounce of this character's frustration behind all the literal blood, sweat and tears.  In addition, there is a love subplot that makes total sense, given the direction this goes, and it perfectly highlights just how obsessive you have to be if you want to reach for greatness.  Because of the commitment of his performance, you realize just how competitive this field is, and just how high the stakes are.  Now on to what everybody is talking about: J.K. Goddamn Simmons.  I am not exaggerating when I compare this to Full Metal Jacket; remember how every line R. Lee Ermey barked at the recruits is so offensively off kilter that you have no choice but to awkwardly laugh?  Yeah, it's the same effect here.  He is so fierce, harsh and severe, you get chills every time he opens his mouth, and you genuinely pity anybody who is foolhardy enough to get in his way.  His performance is mesmerizing, and you can only describe it by using lofty words like commanding and dominating.  If he doesn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, it would be criminal.  On top of all that, the music in this is foot-tappingly infectious, and I have never wanted to listen to jazz music more than I did when I was walking to the car after watching this.  And I know this is just music, but there is palpable tension through every single plot development.  Because I was so engaged by this, I did not realize the passage of time, so when it gets to the pitch-perfect moment at the sublime crescendo to end the story, right when I thought, \"they should end it here, but there's still 30 minutes left,\" it cut to black.  I cannot praise this movie enough, and there should be a picture of the poster of this movie in the dictionary, right next to the word \"exhilarating.\"",

Such a teacher would have been fired immediately for slapping a student hard in the face while demonstrating tempo. This film is a travesty and a bad message to young people in the arts. The film itself has excellent technical highlights, but the story is utter evil bullshit. Anyone endorsing it cannot be a serious musician, as this absurd garbage cannot be taken seriously. Amazing how many audience members love this. It means they know nothing about real music and art. Never in my entire life have I known or heard of any teacher behaving this way. Another damaging aspect of this garbage is that not ONCE did it speak of the MUSIC as being paramount. It was just about becoming \"a legend.\" Newsflash: it's 2014. There are no legends in jazz anymore. You're lucky if you simply make a decent living performing, at best.  Worst story in a long time. I did find it entertaining though, in as much as I laughed a lot over the absurdity of it all.\n\nNow for a more serious comment. The most disturbing part of this film is that NOWHERE does it even remotely illustrate the fact that music is much more than playing fast and loud until your hands bleed. Any real musician knows that technical proficiency can only come about through relaxation and control, not FORCE. Where was the essence of art in this film? Where was the beauty of music? Where was the joy of learning how to honor the composers instead of one's ego. THIS FILM IS A ANTI-ART FILM. IT IS EVIL AND MUST BE AVOIDED BY ALL SERIOUS MUSICIANS. I'd like to end by saying to Mr Damien Chazelle or whatever his name is: Go fuck yourself. Seriously. Shame on your sorry ass, selling your soul like this. But I'm not even sure you have a soul. You certainly have not one once of musicianship if this is the best you could up with as a film about music. And a double fuck you for the homophobic insults in the film. How long do you think a professor of a NYC arts school would keep his or her job while slinging anti-gay insults to students? THIS WAS THE MOST ATROCIOUSLY UNREALISTIC FILM OF ALL TIME.",

Miles Teller is fantastic here and the fact that he didn't know how to play the drums until this movie makes it even better. J.K.

The story revolves around Miles Teller being pushed to the limit to be the best drummer he can be and no matter how bad J.K. Simmons brings him down or even hits him he still gets back up and works harder and harder causing him to go a little crazy in ways. If you're looking for a good drama that'll keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie look no further, this movie will have you biting your nails and the nervousness you'll get when he's drumming. There is one scene I found really cheesy though it involves a concert but besides that and a few slow moments the movie is great. One of my 2014 favorites",

            "content": "Whiplash is quite possibly the most gruesome, intense, enthralling, punishing, brutal and downright brilliant film of 2014. It is a testament to exceptional writing; to brilliant direction; to astounding performances; to stylish cinematography. It is an exercise in dedication, commitment and diligence that is less reminiscent of a story of accomplishment than one of failure. This is, if anything, debut director Damian Chazelle's masterpiece; the film that people in years to come will remember him by, and the film that has put this Oscar contender on the map.\n\nWhiplash is centered around a drummer named Andrew (Teller), a first year music student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, who is one night, whilst practicing his drumming skills, approached by the immensely respected jazz conductor Terence Fletcher (Simmons), who later offers him a place in his jazz band; the most respected band in all of the college. Andrew and Fletcher's personalities collide as Fletcher reveals a volatile and destructive nature upon Andrew's first rehearsal with the band. From here on out, Andrew attempts to earn the respect and admiration of a man who seeks only to push and demand perfection from his highly talented students.\n\nReleased earlier this year at Sundance to universal praise from critics and audiences alike, Whiplash is one of the most adrenaline filled films of the year, despite not actually being an action or sport film. Infused with an electric quantity of energy, primarily due to the inventive, fast-paced and astounding cinematography and editing, Whiplash dazzles, punishes, challenges and ultimately rivets the audience member to their core. This is first class entertainment; a film which captures the ferocity and vehemence of an action film of the likes of Edge of Tomorrow, whilst combining it with the exploitative tendencies and emotional range of a film like Gone Girl. Strange comparisons, but accurate nevertheless.\n\nWhat makes Whiplash tick though is its unflinching documentation of a man who is so driven to achieve that he resents communication and socialization with those outside his chosen craft. Even as Andrew attempts to connect and discuss with those outside his life of drumming, including his father and a romantic interest in a girl named Nicole, the film always makes these portions of his life insignificant and unimportant in contrast. Andrew, unknowing of how to properly interact with people due to his lack of social skills, seems to be acting himself as he tries to fumble his way through a break-up and through seemingly insignificant conversations. His lack of interest in anything outside of his profession is showcased most prominently towards the end, where many of the characters receive little-to-no resolution whatsoever, apart from Andrew and Fletcher; the people instrumental in developing and challenging his drumming capabilities. Everyone and everything else simply fades into the background, as to Andrew, they're unimportant.\n\nThe film is intensely personal and often riveting in the way it handles the primary protagonist, as the cinematography often reverts to close-ups and still shots, focusing solely on his speed and his efforts. As Andrew drums his way to bloody fingers and immense sweating sessions, the camera seems to block everyone else out of the shot, focusing solely on his exertions alone. The entire atmosphere of the film helps us to focus on our main protagonist, allowing us to get more in-tune with Andrew, his emotions and his drive. This is partially due to the efforts of the lighting technician for the film, Jack M. Guberman, who provides an eerie colour palette for the frame; all the drumming, rehearsal and concert scenes are shot with an orange filter, reflecting a jazz-vibe. So whilst it's at first comforting, the intensity of the lighting continues to build and build as Andrew becomes even more concerned with success and perfection; by the final concert of the film, the camera seems to visibly remark upon the intensity and power of the lighting, taking notice of it at every opportunity.\n\nMiles Teller and JK Simmons bring the characters of Andrew and Fletcher to life, and both are equally as commanding and compelling in their respective roles; Teller is fantastic as Andrew, whilst Simmons is merciless and cold as Fletcher. For neither of them to receive nominations for Best Actor and Supporting Actor come end of year would be a travesty, for these are honestly the most vivid and highly intense performances of 2014. The two men clash at each other with power and fire, but as they slowly come to respect the other as a fantastic musician and a driven individual, their delight and enthusiasm is most evident. Teller's eyes alone tell a story of pain and ambition, his expressions and eyes often moving from saddened to angry with natural precision. His somewhat sympathetic Sutter from The Spectacular Now entirely disappears as he inhabits Andrew, a man who is oft-times morally ambiguous, but commendable and confident nevertheless. Simmons is on a-whole-nother planet, the rest of this year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar contenders coming nowhere near his level of intensity, pain, emotion and brutal honesty. His threats directed at both Andrew and his fellow students are both sublime and ethically questionable, his moments of weakness and sadness raw and desperately genuine, and his encouragement forgiving and welcome. Every single scene these two are in together stun; they bounce off each other with grace, and as their relationship strains to an eventual climax, the tension leaps to new highs.\n\nI've had few experiences at the theatre this year be this effective, engrossing and highly entertaining, whilst also being immensely vigorous and exhausting. Leaving the theatre, I was awash with emotions. As a musician, I was moved and provoked. As a casual viewer, I was stunned and depleted. This is a cinematic experience not to be missed, whether you desire a fantastic plot which takes a number of interesting and unexpected plot twists, a drama which focuses on the desire and desperate strive to become one of the greats, or a high octane burst of energy in a crowd of films that are currently in cinemas which lack such. Damian Chazelle's direction and screenplay is masterful, and fit alongside stunning performances, tempo-driven editing from Tom Cross, stunning cinematography from Sharone Meir and a brilliant score from Justin Hurwitz, Whiplash is undoubtedly one of the year's best films, and one of the best directorial debuts I've ever seen. Watch out for Damian Chazelle, for he has all the talent to go far in this harsh and destructive business.",

It concerns a young aspiring jazz drummer who attends a prestigious music conservatory in the hopes of becoming the next Buddy Rich.  Then he meets the instructor from hell in the form of J. K. Simmons.  Whiplash morphs into the Parris Island scenes from Full Metal Jacket as Simmons channels R. Lee Ermey's Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  To put it bluntly he abuses the ever living shit of our young hero and his unfortunate classmates, both mentally and physically.  There are multiple occasions in which chairs are thrown and people are physically assaulted while four letter words and homophobic slurs fill our ears.  This is the kind of role I wish J. K. Simmons would perform more often, as I feel his incredible range and character acting are often wasted in the movies he finds himself in these days.  Of course, Miles Teller displays uncommon valor and skill in this kind of low key, high intensity atmosphere and may be one of our new up-and-comers.  It is also notable how many scenes successfully use The Social Network's rapid fire dialogue and green hued cinematography to highlight cold emotion behind a cerebral exchange.  (The reach of that film has proven long indeed.)  The musical segments are intense and compliment the emotions of the characters performing them - with literal blood on the drums in several scenes.  I present this conflict-driven drama to you as an excellent example of why we still bother to make Oscar bait in today's cynical age.",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's follow-up to his debut feature 'Grand Piano,' finds him firing on all cylinders as both a writer and a director. 'Whiplash' is many times unsettling, absorbing and singularly meaningful the way that most films hardly scratch the surface to achieve. From casting to execution, the writer-director has constructed a meticulous piece of go-for-broke storytelling that leaves the viewer in gee-whiz awe. Those viewers familiar with Simmons's work on Law & Order and as the megalomaniac General Eiling in the DCAU's fondly remembered \"Justice League\" animated series will find him channeling a bit of both parts with an emphasis on the impassioned and psychotic personality of the latter character. This is a man who risks losing everything for the sake of greatness and throughout the film you realize just how important not just jazz music is to him but to his stature and legacy long after he stops teaching/conducting. Miles Teller, fresh off of last year's hit indie \"The Spectacular Now\" explodes on the screen the minute we meet him. Like Simmons's character Fletcher, he, too, desires perfection in his craft as a jazz drummer but in a completely different way. Watching both actors' interplay is half the fun and the other half is the smooth editing, prolific jazz score and inspiring cinematography. As despicable as Fletcher's methods are, you can't help but root for him even when he seems like he is disparaging everyone in sight. To him, a barrage of insults (and there are many throughout) acts as a motivator to not only Teller's character but to everyone. At the film's climax Fletcher and Andrew have a heart-to-heart in a bar as Fletcher exclaims in all his years of teaching that he's never found his \"Bird\" referring to Charlie Parker. Andrew takes this to heart the rest of the way and his spirit shines higher than any point in the film that not even a brush with death can stop his ascent. Do yourself a favor and see this film. For all those who are dreamers and believers, this one is for you. RECOMMENDED!!!!",

This is still one powerful movie.\n\nThe film tells the story of a young drummer who gets involved with a hardass teacher who makes R Lee Ermey from Full Metal Jacket look like a teddy bear.\n\nJK Simmons is absolutely amazing as the hardass teacher. He commands every scene with such intensity that you can feel the tension permeate off the screen and keep you wondering what he's about to do next. Simmons is given a few humanizing moments that really add to his portratyal, don't feel shoehorned in just so he can have his \"money scene\" (though he certainly does get a few) and make this a fully realized character. He's also our frontrunner for the Supporting Actor Oscar this year. It would be a well deserved win. Kudos to you, Tenzin (or J. Jonah Jameson, take your pick)\n\nThe music is very well orchestrated and truly feels like it's coming alive. The blood (quite literally. Miles Teller's hands are a mess in this film), toil, tears, and sweat feel fully realized and the anguish and struggle of our young drummer are wonderfully realized.\n\nThe film does not have many faults. The biggest one being Miles Teller's transition from nice guy to asshole is handled rather awkwardly, so it doesn't feel natural. Dude feels like he's being a dick just because he's a dick.\n\nStill, it's a great movie and deserves to be seen. The scenes of music being performed are truly exceptional.",

            "content": "Writer/director Damien Chazelle (Grand Piano) made quite a deal of noise at this year's Sundance film Festival with Whiplash. His film won the top honors. Usually, the movies examine the angelic teachers, the ones we all remember fondly that broke through to us and cared enough to make a difference. This is not that movie. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a second-year student at a prestigious New York City music conservatory. He drums and dreams of being plucked from his class to the jazz band of Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a renowned jazz musician with a volatile temper. He verbally berates his students, antagonizes them, belittles them, throws chairs at them, brings them to tears, and harasses them, but all in the guise of pushing their talents, pushing them out of being so easily coddled by their parents and an \"everyone's a winner\" society. Andrew is elated to be asked to be Fletcher's newest drummer but the pressure to perform, and maintain that level of perfection, eats away at him. Andrew eats, sleeps, and obsesses over being the greatest drummer possible, a pupil in Fletcher's image. \n\nI know very little about music beyond a simple \"I like this/I don't like that\" delineation, but I was enthralled from beginning to end with the sheer intensity of Whiplash. Even though the film is something of a cinematic crucible, a hellish musical boot camp, a Full Metal Jacket for Julliard, it's not caught up in the half notes and technical elements; this is a movie about two powerful forces coming into direct conflict. It's a battle of wills, a struggle for dominance, and a character study about the potential drive it takes to be considered one of the living legends. The emphasis is on the characters completely, and the movie never drags (or rushes) with its cleanly arranged plot points as it reaches its thrilling conclusion, a final act that completely takes the experience to another level. It keeps switching gears and defying our expectations in the best way. Chazelle always seems to be one step ahead of his audience. We know that Andrew is going to alienate his girlfriend (Glee's Melissa Benoist), thus causing acrimony and resentment on both sides, leading to a breakup hinging upon some question of priorities. We suspect it's coming and lie patiently in wait, dreading that this predictable subplot will take away the focus of the film. And then Chazelle has Andrew sit down and break up with his girlfriend right then and there, citing the exact same chain of foreseeable cause and effect. Andrew sees where this story will head and wants to prevent further heartbreak. He nips this relationship in the bud, and his girlfriend is simply stunned at his blunt assessment (\"You think I would prevent you from being great?\"). It was at this point I knew Chazelle was going to deliver something not just special but downright masterful. \n\nAt the start it looks like the film is going to be a student-mentor study, and it does become this, though in a fascinating yet psychologically disturbing manner. The fiery and all-consuming passion of Fletcher infects Andrew, as he wants to be great above all else, including meaningful human relationships. He's always been something of a loner who has difficulty keeping friends, made all the more evident by his uncomfortable and snippy Thanksgiving dinner with his family. His ambition is to be the best and he's willing to sacrifice everything else. This paves the way for a character study of obsession, as we watch Andrew become a slave to his ambition, to the drive to always be better. He drums until his hands are calloused and soaked in blood. He gets a mattress in a rehearsal space, spending all of his free time on his obsession. He's also battling for validation from Fletcher, whose approval will make Andrew feel like all those blood, sweat, and tears were worth it. The film raises some very intriguing and open-ended questions over the self-destructive nature of ambition. In one perspective it's a story of perseverance and utilizing every setback, every humbling humiliation to push oneself further then what was possibly known. On the other hand, it's about a young man who struggles for the unforgiving tough love of an abusive father figure who molds him in his image. Chazelle's explosive finale also sticks with the ambiguity. It is no doubt an ascendant moment for Andrew but the implications are left for you to interpret on your own. \n\nPrimarily the story of two forces of nature, both Teller and Simmons, especially, give captivating performances that will blow you away. Simmons (TV's The Closer) has been one of our best character actors for years on TV and film, but man does he just sink his teeth completely into his ferocious character. He's truly terrifying to watch but you can't take your eyes off him. Like the other characters, as soon as he enters a room you're put on edge, wondering what he might say next, what might lead to the next tantrum of frustration and rage. Simmons is remarkable but especially in the way that he imbues his character with traces of sympathy (also thanked by Chazelle's screenplay, naturally). Fletcher subscribes to the (arguably insane) philosophy that he has to constantly push his students or else they will persist on mediocrity. There is a method to his madness; he's desperately looking for the next Charlie Parker, a legend in his midst that he can help mold thanks to his aggressive teaching techniques. He truly believes the ends justify the means and he is doing the world a favor. Likewise, Teller (The Spectacular Now, Divergent) is awestruck by his professor's rep but then desperate to regain that hallowed approval. Their relationship becomes poisonous and antagonistic and Andrew seems to be exhausting himself simply to prove Fletcher wrong. Teller is one of the most exciting young actors in Hollywood and his commitment to the character and his physical endurance is impeccable. It cannot be understated how thrilling it is to watch Teller pound away on those drums, especially during the finale where the energy level might just exhaust the audience as well (you do feel spent afterwards, in a good way). Part of Teller's performance has to be with his style and precision of drumming throughout, and it's amazing that he is able to convey different emotional states through a musical instrument. Teller is an effortlessly intuitive actor and his instincts are rarely wrong. \n\nShot in only 19 days time, Whiplash is a rare film that feels blisteringly vibrant, coursing with an insatiable energy, powered by performances of intense dedication and with a script packed with bubbling conflict. It's a small movie that manages to knock you off your feet, from the caliber of the performances to the caliber of the musicianship. I didn't know if this movie could live up to the hype post-Sundance, and I was a little apprehensive at first, but I fell completely under the sway of Chazelle and his storytelling. The smooth edits, the clean connect-the-dots plot points, the room for ambiguity and nuance, the stellar final act, it's everything a movie lover could ask for while still never forgetting to entertain. This is a powerful movie that packs many a wallop but also raises interesting ethical questions about the drive for accomplishment, whether personal attachments are hindrances, and chiefly whether the ends justify the means, especially if those ends could be considered cruel and abusive. Whatever the ends may be, see this incredible film, which just happens to be one of the finest of the year. \n\nNate's Grade: A",

Simmons who blew me away with his fury and visciousness as a music conductor at an ivy league school who will push students well past their breaking point to get a result. His performance is flawless, but layered and you get to see small glimmers of the type of man he is, but his insults will for sure have you cracking up! This is a musician's wet-dream, and you could say I'm biased towards a movie about drumming, but it's more about self-improvement and the perfectionism behind jazz music, it just so happens to be from the pov of Miles Teller, who really is playing these insanely difficult drum parts. The script was incredible and never once did I know where it was going, and in the final twenty minutes my jaw dropped at least three times.

I also would have liked it if music were as much a part of the language of the film as the dialogue. Birdman is an excellent recent example of the use of music to narrate a film in addition to the use of imagery and dialogue.  A film about music that doesn't have a lot of music for me personally was disappointing. Either way, the film is very, very well done without it.",

Simmons' character in the movie is a big shot in the dying jazz business, and if he puts his stamp of approval on a student of his conservatory, that student will enjoy success in the business for life. Teller vigorously seeks the approval of Simmons throughout the movie while throwing his personal health and emotional well-being to the wayside. He engages in a battle of wills with Simmons and finds out what the ultimate price is to excel at something you love. Simmons plays the part of the overbearing, brutal mentor extremely well, and I can see an Oscar nomination coming his way. Though his censure is over-the-top, it fits the character of a smug, cynical overachiever pretty well. There are many compelling musical arrangements in the film, and I felt the angst that Teller felt. The movie is very suspenseful, and the viewer can sense that all of this will culminate in disaster.

Further imagine a teacher who uses your deepest and darkest secrets  such as the abandonment from your own mother to repeatedly scream at you that she left you and your father because you are worthless pieces of shit. Chazelle seriously subjects the audience to his belief that this deeply scarring rage and abuse \nIs required to create a great musician . This movie is more of a deeply disturbing example of why many men will never begin to heal from the layers of shame , depression , and rage and why the NFL is still so homophobic . I 'd hate to see this movie nominated for anything and suggest it's creater pick up a Brene Brown book  about what really motivates people and recent research into shame , humiliation and the real material of greatness . The ONLY valid point made was that false praise can distort and prevent greatness but the real solution would be accurate feedback from a mentor or teacher .",

WHIPLASH tells the story of just that type of relationship, set to an extreme, ferocious level, and exhibits a psychological battle for the ages between Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) and his jazz instructor, Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Whiplash, when dialed down to its essentials, is a movie about two characters and a jazz soundtrack, but, despite what may sound a bit simplistic, it is undoubtedly the most exhilarating, meticulously layered film of the year. At the risk of sounding a bit conceded, the film appropriately and remarkably follows suit with its own soundtrack. Jazz, more often than not, can prove itself to be an incredibly consuming style of music for all of the listener's senses. It sets itself apart from other musical forms in that it is something you feel, it is something that courses through your veins, working its way from your swelling head down to your toes, and back up once more. Jazz, when played correctly, is completely and totally an electric current of music, permeating itself straight into the soul. Whiplash does just this. From the very start, at the sight of a pitch black screen, we hear the sound of a drum tap, lightly, lightly, until it gradually becomes quicker and louder and manifests itself as a red-hot, pounding frenzy. This opening is almost a musical analogy for the film itself. In many ways, the movie IS its music, and its actors are its instruments, playing off one another perfectly. J.K. Simmons here provides a performance of a career and Teller does just the same. Perhaps, other than Michael Keaton in BIRDMAN, these two deliver the best male performances of the year, and there should be awards awaiting, hopefully. To give it a label, WHIPLASH is the best film of the year, so, for the love of God, go out and witness this tense, feverish, and somewhat inspiring little piece of cinema that beholds not only two great performances, but also an incredible directorial effort from Damien Chezelle. There's nothing else out quite like it. This is perfect filmmaking. \n\nRating: 5/5.",

            "content": "I have absolutely no idea what everyone is raving about. From a musical standpoint, Whiplash commits a number of offenses. Even putting aside the typical Hollywoodized, obviously dubbed, out of sync drumming audio, jazz/drum terminology is thrown about almost at random to make the movie seem authentic from the first scene forward. Fletcher comes across Andrew in the practice room and says \"show me your rudiments\", prompting andrew to play some pattern that is most closely related to a paradiddle. Fletcher does not specify which rudiment but seems to have gotten he wants, so he says to Andrew \"double-time swing\", which is also incorrect. Double time refers to a tempo that is twice as fast as the previous tempo, but with no tempo to refer to you would just say \"uptempo swing\". The same error occurs multiple times throughout the film. When Fletcher walks in to the lower band before he recruits Andrew, he tells the bass player to play \"five bars of donna lee\". The bass player then plays neither five bars nor Donna Lee. There are many nitpicky errors throughout the film but perhaps more grievous an offense are Andrew's ultimate goals. Whenever he sits down in his practice room, he seems to do nothing more than play as fast and loud as he possibly can. Connolly says at one point, \"dude, what have you been practicing?\", which is absolutely spot on. Jazz music is rarely about speed or volume, and to try to paint Andrew as this devoted, driven student by having him constantly push his chops is just blatantly wrong. And every time he sits at the drumset, he bleeds! At first it seems to be because he practices for such long periods, but even in the Carnegie Hall scene, he is bleeding by the second song! The only thing this serves to show is that Andrew has awful technique- there is absolutely no reason why anyone would be bleeding at the kit unless they were to unintentionally whack their hand against a rim or something. The scene in Carnegie Hall is equally ridiculous. Fletcher is intentionally sabotaging his band's performance to get back at Andrew, which is in itself preposterous. But worse than that, Andrew shows absolutely no musical intuition whatsoever. Fletcher calls the tune that Andrew has never played, and all Andrew is able to do is flail wildly and hit random drums out of time. How are we supposed to believe that a top conservatory student is unable to at least improvise a steady beat? However, the most comical moment was the big fancy drum solo. Andrew goes into his typical \"play as fast as I can\" routine, and Fletcher comes over and starts nodding and conducting him! He then begins to flail his arms as if conducting accents and hits that Andrew is playing-but nothing matches up! The result is actually rather hilarious. Just watch the final scene and judge for yourself. I am no film critic so I will not offer my layman's opinion on the errors in plot and development (though I have my gripes, from the throwaway 4-scene romance subplot to the useless injected dinner table scene using the typical \"out-of-touch family\" trope to the short, pathetic attempts to humanize Fletcher), but all in all this was an offensively bad film. I am extremely angry about the perceptions this will no doubt give people about jazz music and jazz drumming.",

            "content": "Whiplash introduces the viewer to the high stakes unforgiving world of the elite Shaffer Conservatory of Music. One of the best music schools in the US. Enter Andrew (Miles Teller), a 19-year-old jazz drummer, looking for nothing less than to be one of the greats. And Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a fearsome jazz maestro pushing his students beyond their breaking points, in search of a truly classic performance.\n\nThese two men seemed destined to collide, and I loved the dynamic between the tough task master Fletcher, and Andrew's passion for Jazz. Both men obsessed by their craft, and the pursuit of perfection. The journey these characters take was never going to be a smooth one, but it would see their desires fulfilled if they pushed and worked hard enough.\n\nThe performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are simply amazing, but not the only reason you need to see this film. Director Damien Chazelle does a great job of immersing the viewer in this world, and you can almost smell the brass polish, spit and sweat! And the music, oh boy, once Fletcher's band starts performing, you'll find that rhythm permeating through your soul as your foot involuntarily taps out the beat, and your heart starts to race. Especially during the epic final performance.\n\nI for one forgot I was in a movie theater as I became more and more transfixed by this musical world. It's the reason I go to the theater and watch so many movies. I know if I see enough films, I'm going to occasionally, maybe only once or twice a year, come across a movie like this. A movie so transformative that it temporarily takes over my whole world, and shows me something new and exciting. That's how much I liked this film, and I hope you have a similar experience if you take the time to see it at your local theater.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nI don't think you need to have a complete understanding of Jazz music to enjoy this film, but an appreciation of the art form wouldn't hurt. Whiplash is rated R for strong language including some sexual references. J.K. Simmons' character Fletcher, doesn't mince words!\n\nBest Format:\n\nSharone Meir's photography, and this movie's epic soundtrack need to be enjoyed in a movie theater. At home, make sure you're watching this movie on a nice big TV over a great sound system. The impact of this movie is going to be greatly diminished if you watch it on a laptop, tablet or phone sized screen.\n\nBest Moment: >\n\nThe epic final performance is fantastic, and closes the film and this story perfectly.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/whiplash-2014/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "Holy shit. One of my new favorite movies, I think. Probably tied for my favorite of the year.\n\nThere's so much to say about this movie, yet at the same time, it's such a cerebral experience that's hard to describe. It's incredibly tense virtually the whole time, and each time I let my guard down and let myself relax, something startled me back into apprehension. It's amazing how tense it made me despite knowing there were certain lengths Fletcher would never go to - obviously this isn't a thriller/horror movie, and Fletcher isn't going to kill Andrew - but it's thanks 1. to Damien Chazelle's amazing direction and, most importantly, 2. J.K. Simmons's phenomenal acting. He downright terrified me, and even now, hours after I watched the film, I'm still thinking about him, from the frightening clenching of his fists to the slapping to the profanity spewing from his lips. Though I adore movies, they rarely leave me thinking a few hours after, but I can feel the movie almost haunting me. Even imagining rewatching it is like thinking about repeating a nightmare I had the night before...but in a good way, if that makes sense. It was a real dread I experienced. It's some of the most intensity I've ever experienced while watching a movie.\n\nAside from that, there are plenty of other wonderful elements of the movie. Miles Teller is a fantastic lead, and his whole character was so compelling that I somehow never felt like I was biding my time until J.K. Simmons came back onscreen. Fletcher was definitely a presence looming over the movie, so that any scene without him had the built-in tension of wondering when he'd come back. But all the scenes with Andrew alone practicing were just as fascinating themselves. It was so painful to watch Andrew's evolution (or devolution, depending on how you think about it), but it was just so...great, you know? When it comes down to it, all I can say is that everything was great. Even the rom-com-esque scenes with Melissa Benoist were great, and I fell for her immediately. Maybe that's just the romantic in me.\n\nAnother thing I loved about the movie: the structure. I'm very picky when it comes to structure occasionally, in that there are certain movies that are objectively structured well but somehow leave me cold after the climax, or at the end. Somehow, though, I loved the structure of this one. Prior to seeing the movie, I thought the movie would consist of a slow build-up to a final scene with Andrew having his mental break, sort of like Black Swan. Instead, though, Andrew's mental break (after being hit by a truck, he plays in the concert anyway) happens at the climax, but there's a ton of falling action that remains equally interesting, followed by, like, a second climax in the last scene of the movie.\n\nLet's take this one step at a time. The scene between Andrew and Fletcher in the bar was one that I really loved, because they were actually able to move past their differences a little. Even though Fletcher made Andrew's life hell, I found it really believable how they developed a friendly dynamic. Even better, Fletcher explained the method to his madness, and it was just as brilliant as I hoped it was. Some of it could've been assumed, I suppose, but the way he explained it to Andrew, it still made him seem a lot saner. He's not just a cruel sadist; he wants to create legends. Noble intentions, in a way.\n\nWhich leads to one more huge strength, which will in turn bring me to my final point: the whole movie was incredibly unpredictable. Like I said, Fletcher is a beautifully created character, but one of the most surprising facets of his character is the times that he gets to be kind. It emphasizes how horrifying some of his other moments are; for example, the scene when he praises Andrew before he plays for the first time, it's automatically scary, because you likely know the reversal's coming in the next scene. Same with when Fletcher was nice to the little girl. And, possibly most prominently, when Fletcher starts crying in class after hearing about his dead student. You KNOW that this is just a temporary lapse between fits of rage, but it's still so shocking and terrifying when he explodes later that scene, with possibly his most cruel tirade yet.\n\nAlso as I said, the climax happened early, and in the following scenes, as Andrew rebuilds his life, I thought the message of the movie was basically this: Sometimes, the price of attaining greatness is too great. Sometimes, family and friends IS all you need, and you can enjoy passions without the necessity of becoming the best (a moral that applies to most people). It'd be a surprising, slightly boring note to end such a tense and thought-provoking movie on, but I had no doubt that it'd be a great ending anyway.\n\nBut what elevated this movie from 4.5 stars to 5 stars for me was the ending scene, which was just...incredible. There's no way to describe it. You think it's a simple case of revenge, with Fletcher creating an elaborate scheme to wipe out any chance of Andrew making it as a jazz drummer (which is still genius on its own). But then Andrew returns and fights back with an insanely psychological move, drumming and drumming and drumming and bleeding and sweating and pouring his heart into the music. And it's such a long scene but such a surreal one, and the room is full of spectators who all are experiencing this together with their own private thoughts, and in the GENIUS reversal as Fletcher recognizes Andrew as one of the greats, they're suddenly on the same side and they're smiling at each other. It's unlike anything I've seen in a movie before. That's Whiplash.",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's \"Whiplash\" is an electrifying film about the lengths someone is willing to be pushed in order to achieve greatness. Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman and J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher drum up their best performances to date, as well as a pair of the best performances of 2014. Teller as Neyman is phenomenal, and the butting of heads between the leads is what drives many scenes of this film. All of the Oscar buzz behind Simmons' performance is valid; Terrence Fletcher is the ruthless music teacher at Schafer college whom Andrew Neyman strives so hard to impress. J.K. Simmons gives such a vulgar, astounding, and unrelenting acting job as Fletcher that even I felt furious with what he was saying while watching this film. The emotional and physical pain Neyman goes through to try and impress Fletcher is absolutely unbelievable, but the acting by Miles Teller, who has come a long way from 21 & Over, allows the pain to be understood. Damien Chazelle's directing is also very smooth, and the score is perfect for a movie about Jazz music. \"Whiplash\" is a fantastic film with magnificent acting, wonderful music, and a final fifteen minutes that will entice and amaze any viewer able to appreciate how far Andrew Neyman has come.",

However, to solely describe this as a movie about music would be unfair, this is really a movie about genius and inspiration, and what it takes to develop that kind of talent. Powered by amazing, award-worthy performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, Whiplash delves into the obsession that creates the kind of talent on screen.\n\nWriter/director Damien Chazelle not only really understands music, but understands the kind of passion they bring to their passion. The music in the film is phenomenal and used in conjunction with brilliant visuals and editing to create some of the most tense sequences I've seen on film this year. Some of them are more tense than the best action movies of the year.\n\nSpeaking of tension, Chazelle balances the tension between Simmons and Teller to create a chemistry which feels like the flipside of the romance coin. These two play off each other so well that it's hard to take your eyes off the screen, even in the most intense moments of the film. Any time I thought things would fall into something conventional, Chazelle flipped the script on me.\n\nI absolutely loved this film, and can't wait to see it again, this time with some of my music friends.",

Simmons mostly\ncaught my eye as it looked intense and these are 2 interesting actors. Teller reminds\nme of a young James Dean with a great look, some interesting facial scars and a\nquiet likability. He looked very familiar and checked his filmography yet didn't\nrecognize any of his films (meaning I didn't see them).\n\nJ.K. Simmons has been in a million films generally in a supportive role at best and\nadored him as a supportive loving Dad in \"Juno\" and more recently \"Men, Women\nand Children\". He too has this great look with a fascinating face and great wrinkles\n(can I say that?).\n\nMiles, plays Andrew, a budding and very, very serious jazz drummer studying at\none of the best music schools in the country. He finally makes into the schools\ntop ensemble and all hell breaks out. Simmons plays the ensembles conductor in\nthe vein of the Robert Duvall in the \"Great Santini\". This guy is vile, driven,\nperfectionist, lunatic...you really have to see to believe. He makes Bobby\nKnight-types look like a choir boys. The language, the abuse, the threats etc.\nnever would survive in todays world but it makes for captivating theatre.\n\nIf you love jazz ensembles, you'll see some amazing performances. Clearly Teller has\nreal life drumming chops as you dub what shows on the screen. The intensity, sweat,\npain, blood, talent and more is simply fantastic.\n\nI really don't want to say more except that the previews in no way giveaway the film.\nBut the battle between the student/teacher, who are both driven perfectionists in their\nown way makes for excellent theatre. This movie was relentless, driving, pounding\nand kept me \"locked in\"....no naps in this one.",
