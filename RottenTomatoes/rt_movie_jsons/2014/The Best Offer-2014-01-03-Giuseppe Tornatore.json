Yep, she participated in a huge scam and Geoffrey Rush was the victim.   So, wow.  In fact, stuff it, i'm going 5 stars because it pisses me off that these critics couldn't properly assess this movie.",

As the characters became more entangled, the audience is searching for fulfillment of their dreams, but also questioning the reality of the dream. I was left with a few questions about the scenario, but overall, the intrigue lasted beyond the final takes.",

You can sum up the whole film with, it's better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all. If you are an art perv, this is your movie. It is a calm thriller.

An English language film, Geoffrey Rush in the lead. It was about an aging art and antique auctioneer, Virgil. The story reveals his final days in his professional field where he meets a young woman who pursued him for her inherited antiques to put on auction. The woman is very mysterious, because of her medical condition and how they both become so close despite their initial meetings were disastrous is the remaining film to tell us with a twist in the final.\n\nIt was an awesome storytelling. The screenplay was the top notch and the matching background score. Especially when the story ends and credits rolls up, all those memories from the film keeps us fresh with that music. The music won several awards for the film. I liked the story, but towards the end, I kind of predicted almost everything. That did not stop me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly. Particularly the theme of the film, which I think a bit fresh, and I liked the conclusion as well, but I feel it should have been different or more to it. The way it ended might disappoint some people, but still it is very smart.\n\nEverybody was good, but it was Geoffrey Rush, who stole the show with his stellar performance. Three years might be a little late, but it's never too late to watch a fine film like this. One of the best suspense films from the recent time, it is a must see, particularly if you are seeking a good entertainment. So I hope you watch it if you're not yet.\n\n8/10",

Oldman does not reveal that some of the paintings he analyzes are masterpieces.  He does this so he, with the aid of his friend Billy (Donald Sutherland) can later buy them at a lower price.  He keeps his masterpieces of womens' faces locked away in a room, where he, during his lonely moments, looks at but doesn't touch. Oldman is filthy rich, but still, he cannot live life in the real world, the same way he is not able to love a real woman. He loves canvas, not flesh.  He can't even TOUCH flesh; he can't touch anything with his bare hands.  He wears gloves and looks at the world alone, through transparent canvas.\n\nThe cast was well-selected, except for Claire.  Sylvia Hoeks was too \"Hollywood.\"  A better choice was to have cast a more seemingly innocent woman, one who was more \"girl-like\" than seductive.\n\nSPOILER ALERT.   Please do not read any further if you do no wish to have the ending revealed and questioned.\n\nThe ending was as open-ended as a drunk's beer can.  At the last scene, why did Oldman visit the NIGHT AND DAY caf\u00e9?   It was the only place Claire felt loved in the past.  Did he go there because he couldn't let his relationship go and hoped to see her again, or was it for revenge?  \n\nOldman recollects Claire saying, \"No matter what happens to us, know that I loved you.\"\nHe also remembers saying that every forgery, every fake, leaves its real mark and can be found.  So when Oldman tells the waiter, \"I'm waiting for someone\" in the last scene, what exactly did he mean?\n\nHow shocking to learn that the creepy savant dwarf was the real Claire!  She rented out her Villa across the street, and Billy, Robert (the young guy who fixed the gears) and the groundskeeper were all in on this master plot to destroy Virgil and to rob him of his fortune.  But by doing so, did they not give him a fortune... the ability to love?  While Billy's motive is apparent, Robert's is not.  Billy was an artist and felt undervalued by Oldman.  Why did Robert cruelly destroy Virgil?  There were easier ways to rob him, if money was all he was after.\n\nOne huge question remains... Was Virgil at the Mental Institution BEFORE or AFTER his visit to the NIGHT AND DAY caf\u00e9 in Prague?  Did he have a mental breakdown right after being conned, and then pull himself together?  Or was the whole story him being in the institution reflecting on past events?",

He runs an exclusive auction house. His world is controlled, regimented, and sterile. He's never made love to a woman. Not since he was a child enjoyed the tactile sensations from touching objects, as he always wears gloves. Only to gentle stroke the brush strokes of a painting does he take them off. His home is part museum, part villa, and as he himself says, 'more like a hotel'. He is also somewhat of a con man. Probably too harsh a word, but at times when he sees a particular painting he wants, he tells patrons their paintings are forgeries. When in fact they are real. He does this to drive the price down so he can acquire them and tuck them into a vault where the portraits of women look down upon him adoringly.\n\nVirgil receives a call from Claire Ibbetson requesting he evaluate the artwork in her villa. Her parents are dead and she needs to sell the items. Virgil does not meet with the public, but there is something in her voice which intrigues him. She doesn't show and he's left standing in a rain storm outside the boarded up villa. When she calls again, he's enraged, but she once again intrigues him. As the story enfolds we learn she never leaves the villa. She's afraid of face-to-face interaction.\n\nOne step at a time, Virgil helps Claire enter the world, and in the process Virgil learns what love is. Unfortunately, all is not how it appears.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. I will say that in the end I think Virgil, at least for a while, truly lived.",

Too bad this character is placed in a weird scenario as a reluctantly lascivious old man (hahah get it). The original premise has a classic fairytale feel, but is squandered on wish fulfillment sequences. The supporting characters are totally one dimensional and exist to push the boring plot, give space for Rush's character to voice his thoughts, or lay down some heavy-handed metaphors. \n\nThe production design is the highlight of this film. There are many scenes that could produce an audible 'wow\". \n\nIf you want something light and pointless but visually engaging, this is a good flick to have on in the background while you get slammed or web surf.",

Claire is a recluse with many high-priced pieces to sell from her late father's estate. As Claire reveals more and more of herself to her unlikely suitor, the successful, yet solitary man, faces complete transformation.\n\n Geoffrey Rush is a fine actor, and he carries much of this film's pulse upon his shoulders. He is especially talented when it comes to submersing himself in a role. For me, he quickly ceased to be Geoffrey Rush and wholly became Mr. Oldman.\n\n The plotline, while at first intriguing, quickly found its way to predictability.

And the womanizing restorer, he clearly has to be suspected although again difficult to be sure. But then building without a manual an 18th century automaton while dating different women maybe even at the same time? No black eyes? I didn't really buy it.\n\nSo where is the signature of the forger? Would another auctioneer/appraiser spot it? And what is love, if a piece of art, that could be forged? And as expected, there is nothing in Prague, so why wasting the audience's time, literally and figuratively speaking, as we did get to see a lots of clocks? A lot of things being planted to the audience like automaton parts, but I couldn't assemble them. I am not a genious restorer.\n\nAnd then, trying to string them together but not wasting any more time, why is the movie titled \"The Best Offer\"?

The story revolves around an elderly and esteemed, but somewhat eccentric, managing director of an auction house Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) who is hired by a reclusive young heiress, Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), to auction off the large collection of art and antiques left to her by her parents. The mystery starts when, for some reason, Claire always refuses to be seen in person. \n\nVirgil Oldman finds some odd old mechanical parts in the house and collects them, and an astute young artificer, Robert (Jim Sturgess), aids him in restoring and reassembling them. He is also giving him advice on how to befriend her, and how to deal with his feelings towards Claire. Oldman's character has poise and prestige which is counterpointed by an ongoing scam whereby his friend Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) helps him to acquire a secret private collection of master paintings.\n\nIt is a smart, precise, romantic, mysterious movie with an outstanding music score composed by Ennio Morricone, and if you have chance to see it - don't miss it!",

It was obvious that there is a plot waiting in the end, since there were too many hints throughout the whole movie that the viewer can make up a conclusion. The finding of even the first mechanical part made me belief that there was a play behind the whole stage, while the behavior of the auctioneer did not match his character, leading to a disbelief in the storyline. Many motifs in the story have these misconceptions. Surprised that people that mark this movie with a high rating do not see this.

            "content": "Virgil Oldman (portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, with whom I can recognise from the role of the Marquis de Sade in Quills, 2000) is a sophisticated and solitary auction dealer. He is highly recognisable and respectable in the auction industry, but he also has his personal issues which he wants to keep private. He doesn't like to be in the newspapers, and he doesn't want to use a mobile phone to avoid being easily reachable by anyone. Besides, one of them can be the ''fear'' of having contact with females (or maybe ''desire'' to some extent as he's never been with any woman and is still a virgin at his 60s until he meets this mysterious female owner to a villa). For a few times, it can be obvious to notice that he doesn't dare to look at girls directly in the eyes. He seems awkward when he's with any woman. For example, he turns around when Robert's (portrayed by Jim Sturgess, this young skilful restorer of mechanical devices Virgil goes to see regularly when he finds something interesting from any of his cases) girlfriend first meets him and talks to him; he starts feeling a bit uneasy immediately. This can probably be one of the reasons why he's been set up by Robert, who wins Virgil's trust little by little. \n\nIn addition to this, Virgil's crave for women can be observed from various female portraits he's been collecting throughout his lifetime. He's never really been with any woman in his real life, but to him, he's had many women. Those portraits appear to help him with his loneliness. Yet, a lonely and ''smart'' person like Virgil can still be overwhelmed by the charm of a mystery. Ever since he receives a phone from a girl named Claire Ibbetson (portrayed by Sylvia Hoeks) whose parents have just died and she wants to sell the antiques from her villa, but she's never showed up in person. Now that really makes Virgil \"curious\" (See, \"Curiosity killed the cat!\") and wants to get to know more about Claire. Day by day, his interests in her grows when they talk about her case. Through the only housekeeper Claire has, Virgil knows her condition. Most men would probably want to \"protect\" a girl if he knows she's this fragile. She's got \"agoraphobia,\" the fear of open space or crowdedness. Virgil is no exception, especially concerning his experiences with women. That alone can already make him even more interested in this girl. \n\nFurthermore, he thinks he's won her trust and is still so curious about how she looks like that he secretly stays outside her room, behind a statue, to simply take a peek at her. He is amazed, or better put it this way, enchanted by her beauty and stories. It seems that she also opens up to him, not feeling afraid of letting him see her. Things have changed little by little between the two. She makes him believe that she's getting better and better, and that he believes that this is because of him and he starts to fall for her, completely. He wants her to move in to his luxury \"hotel\" (yes, his house seems like one, perfectly preserved and decorated). He believes and loves her so much that he even shows her the most secret and precious room where he keeps all his valuable female portraits. When a story is to this stage, it can be easy to put all the clues all together to form another story. Feeling so happy that he finally meets his true love and eager to get home after his last auction in his career, he goes home to this shocking and depressing news. Yes, he's lost ALL of those female portraits simply because of one woman in flesh. And this woman betrays him after he's given his heart to her. However, he's still in love with her. He goes to the Night and Day restaurant where Claire used to tell her that's the only \"outside\" place where she can totally feel relaxed. He waits, and waits. A sad ending it is foresee, she will never appears again. All has been left for Virgil is a broken heart, wishing Hope will fall upon him again to let him meet his love once again. \nOverall, this movie isn't bad. The sex set-up scheme can probably be clich\u00e9, but each actor has done their part well. Rush's acting is just brilliant, and I love Sturgess's British accent (so sexy)! Oh my, but can you imagine how hurtful and painful it is to be betrayed this way by someone you love? And it's so sad to even know that he's in love with her...awwww!",

Together they covet and swipe some very valuable pieces of art.  When a reclusive heiress asks Virgil to price her estate, he becomes slightly obsessed with the young woman who remains hidden and only speaks to him through a locked door.  Feeling more for her than he should -- he barely knows her! -- he asks a young friend of his (Jim Sturgess - Across the Universe) who has helped restore some old pieces to their past glory for some relationship advice.  The story begins to take on too much and it unfolds at an unusual pace as we are introduced to more characters.  The Best Offer might have worked better as a character study of Virgil who is unable to adapt to modern times (he doesn't own a cellphone) instead of attempting to be a heisty-artsy-noir.  The romantic angle doesn't work ... and the supporting players aren't developed enough to warrant their later roles in the film.  The director is better than this film ... although it appears this one got the better of him.  I'd be apt to call this one a Tornatore forgery.",

            "content": "In \"The Best Offer,\" Virgil Oldman(Geoffrey Rush) owns a pretigious auction house with a side business that he runs with his friend Billy(Donald Sutherland) in coveting some of the paintings that come his way.  Virgil's latest commission involves the settling of the estate of Claire(Sylvia Hoeks) whose parents have just died.  While at her decaying mansion, he spots some gears which he brings to his other friend Robert(Jim Sturgess), a mechanic, before discovering a link to a far richer treasure than he could have originally imagined.\r\n\r\nThe best thing you could probably say about \"The Best Offer\" is that it is a near miss.  Well, not really, as it on one hand serves as a fine character portrait of somebody whose aiming for perfection borders on extreme fastidiousness.(To be honest, I have to like any character in this day and age who does not own a cell phone.)  While otherwise confident, he cannot look a woman in the eye, probably caused by being raised by nuns.  All of which is aided by an excellent performance from Geoffrey Rush.\r\n\r\nBut plot and story not so much.  Everything plays out pretty much as expected with few surprises.  And then still manages to make little or no sense, starting with the fact that somebody as busy and important as Virgil would not waste that much of his personal time with such a difficult client as Claire.  That's even before the gears put in an appearance.  That just goes to show you that while we can appreciate the precision of a clock, the same should not hold true for any art form, especially movies.",

I guess this was make in English but by an Italian company and it has that 'European' feel to it. Rush is as always a marvel and the other actors, including Donald Sutherland (magnificent facial hair!), are well cast and convincing. All in all a low key but interesting movie. If you need lots of action you won't like it, but otherwise it's pretty good.",

It's a drama, a love story, a thriller in a very weird combination Geoffrey Rush is always great! and here is no difference...It was a roller coaster with him... at first I didn't like him and in any other movie in any other story I wouldn't have felt sorry for him at the end, but here I was :( and here goes my question why? did he deserve that? and if we get to look from the other point of view as many movies before would I have the same feeling for the guy ? the answer was always no :/ and that's maybe why I liked so much... Sylvia Hoeks was beautiful and played her role very well and I'm glad we didn't see her at the end and left him alone waiting. Jim Sturgess -_- and 'Snow'|| The Hunger Games, I thought he was his friend :/ ...The movie was long +2 hr so closing to the end you get the feeling of something wrong is going to happen, nothing is that good, there is no happy endings :/ and that might take a little from the realization at the end :/ but still I liked it :) and I think the ending is very appropriate for the whole story I'll give it an 8.5/10.",
