Kinda stopped caring about half way through as it tried to be both a kids movie and a serious movie. disappointed with some of the choices. It's unfair to kids who don't have both parents in their lives to expect to find their estranged parent let alone have them be some amazing, best case version. Also, using/abusing animals (sheep) as toys is stupid and not something kids should think is ok. Why couldn't this movie have been made smarter. Amazing costume and design. Oh well.",

I do enjoy the world-building of these movies and find there to be something mystical about the world they live in. I also enjoyed the relationship that we see between a hiccup and his parents. The cast was again fantastic and brought their A-game to this. I also liked to see the improvement of animation between the first and this movie. Some truly beautiful shots made me gasp at what animation can do and for a second made me think it was live-action. The sound design in this movie is perfect and I think fits with the world. The music, maybe not being as iconic as the first, still was beautiful and hit in all the right moments. Once again I found myself cooing over toothless and how adorable he is. They made a truly iconic series and I am excited to see how this ends.",

During the lockdown, however, I wanted to find several animated films that I had not seen, including this saga. When I saw the first one I was amazed by its beauty (you will also find my review). But the second managed, I don't know how, to do much better. This sequel cleverly continues the first film setting it years later when Hiccup and Toothless are now grown up. The tone of this film, generally speaking, is dark, like Toy Story 3. And I really like animated films with dark tones. The relationship between the two protagonists undergoes a notable evolution which becomes very mature. The villain is one of my favorites at Dreamworks: he is very evil. I liked one of his scenes in particular, as well as one of the most moving: when Drago takes control thanks to his Toothless alpha and goes so that he kills Hiccup. The father, however, saves the blow and dies. Moreover, although he had always traveled by ship, on that occasion he rides Toothless to make Hiccup feel even worse. The twists are not lacking and they are unpredictable. The animations are spectacular and gorgeous to look at. The characters are all nice and well developed. The film is simply fantastic: a masterpiece for sure. With a well thought-out storyline and great characters, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is absolutely a movie worth watching.",

The animation has greatly improved and looks stunning, the soundtrack is just as spine-chilling, the first 10 minutes do a great job in establishing how Berk has changed in the last 5 years, Stoick's death was incredibly dark and emotional, especially since he sacrificed himself for Hiccup, I love his interactions with Valka and that song and their reunion are some of the best scenes in the trilogy, the universe gets expanded with the introduction to the Alpha dragon and it takes a darker tone and develops the character and themes pretty well. I have some issues however with the characters. Valka is just forgotten in the 3rd act and I feel like her coming back to Berk should have been impactful, Drago just stands around and yells and is just forgettable, the teenage vikings are so unfunny and annoying, Astrid is kind of out of character with her being reckless and her and the teenage vikings don't receive any consequences for them leading Drago and his army to where Hiccup as it was their fault. Even Toothless is just a side character until the 3rd act. These flaws however don't ruin the movie and is still a great sequel despite being the weakest of this phenomenal trilogy.",

There were some things that they simply couldn’t “fix” in a sequel that I knew were going to bother me again. Sure enough, the exaggerated Scottish accents only from the older generation are still there for no good reason. Jay Baruchel is still a horrible choice for any vocal role, and he continues to make Hiccup sound as ridiculous as his name. There are other things that I find dumb in the films (like the bumbling best friends and the weird versatility of sheep) but the voice work is what always stands out as the worst. Despite the flaws this film inherited from its predecessor, I found How to Train Your Dragon 2 to be a big improvement story-wise. Where the first film felt like a cliché-filled story I’d seen countless times before, this one had something new to offer. I like the idea of this Viking nation that has made peace with dragons struggling to convince other nations that they are harmless creatures. It makes sense that, as they improved their mode of transportation, they would be able to reach out further and influence people all around. I also appreciated that this film introduced a number of different sides on the dragon issue, from those who want them to be entirely free to those who want to use them for their own evil desires. I think they play a little fast and loose when they start to retcon the character history, and it certainly telegraphs the big reveal that comes halfway through, but I didn’t mind because I had little emotional attachment to the world from the first film. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a decent adventure story, and it connected with me on an emotional level that I didn’t expect. I almost cried once, which is much more than I can say about the first chapter in the Hiccup-Toothless story.",

Whether itâ(TM)s a big action scene or just a shot of the landscape, it all looks great. The story is quite good. It doesnâ(TM)t do anything overly surprising, but it hits all the right beats. There is a lot of emotion here between Hiccupâ(TM)s reunion with his mother to the death of his father. It goes further than expected in that aspect. Baruchel (Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III) continues to do a good job in the role. He has a unique voice that actually fits perfectly for the character. The rest of the returning voice cast does very well, but the highlights of the new additions were Cate Blanchett (Valka) and Kit Harrington (Eret). I loved the big battle scene where the good guys ultimately lose. Itâ(TM)s the high point of the movie and features some really cool moments. It makes the villain come across as a true threat.\n\nWeaknesses: Some of the comedy misses the mark. Kristen Wiig (Ruffnut) and TJ Miller (Tuffnut) are both funny actors, but the stuff involving their characters never hit. They arenâ(TM)t big characters, but theyâ(TM)re meant to be funny and it doesnâ(TM)t work. As noted, the big battle is the highlight so the third act that comes after it feels lackluster. It needed to be bigger to follow what we had just witnessed.\n\nOverall: This would be a truly special animated film with a better final 15 minutes. It still does more than enough to be great and is about on par with the first installment.",

How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a fun filled animated action fantasy film with an emotional inspiring story, beautiful animation, and visually exciting action. The film does have another inspiring story to tell while packing an emotional punch with the characters. Hiccup (jay Baruchel) has caused a change in his Viking tribe. Now, they are riding dragons once they learned to train them. They have a sporting event with riders and their dragons using sheep as a ball to toss in a basket. Stoick (Gerard Butler) has wanted to train Hiccup to follow his footsteps in being a leader for their tribe someday. Hiccup is prematurely not wanting to take that responsibility yet. Hiccup is flying to new territory. He discovers another tribe that was demolished by some unknown new dragon which Eret (Kit Harrington) blames any dragon riders to be responsible. Hiccup soon discovers his mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Who is living in an area filled with dragons. Which she is trying to protect them against a warlord Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Who wants to raise a dragon army for his own power. There are new fun characters that you meet. And also a menacing villain Drago. And the dragon he raises which is known as the Alpha is a gigantic monstrous beast that looks kind of scary. The animation in the film is beautifully done. The landscapes, the action sequences are fantastic. I did feel like the movie did have a slower paced plot than the original movie. But it does not the stop film from being good. Overall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a good film. The visuals and animation is beautiful and great. The action is exciting and thrilling. The plot is a little slower but it does travel into new territories with the characters and packs an emotional punch this time.",

And they did but replaced it with a slightly less cringe romance. I wouldn't even call it to romance it was more harassment if anything. I have no idea how the last movie got a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than this one. One minor plot hole or I guess you would rather call it a visual anachronism was at the start of the movie when he was gliding with a wingsuit, it would've been impossible. As the wings are supposed to be fully attached to the body - with no gaps between them - then you can physically start gliding. The opening scene could've been improved. I wish it started with Hiccups because of his first scene because that was excellent and tremendous.\n\nThe twist felt predictable, not in this movie but some sort of movie in the future from the first one. As we had no mention of her in the first one. The only reason I liked it was that they made it so her and Hiccups' father bonded with each other. It gave us a connection to both of them so it could make an attempt to an emotional ending - it would've worked if they made the moment where he died and the ending, shorter. The dragons were way more entertaining. Instead of having fire breathing for every cool looking dragons, they created more abilities. Such as ice breath, telepathy, and turning into a wheel of fire. It made the final fight scene much more exciting and intense. The villain's origin was not good. There was hardly any.\n\nThe cinematography was exceptional. The giant dragon felt the same as number one, but with two fighting each other. Also, that fight between them was so lazy and used death as a plot device. If you look in the background they are just touching each other's tusks. The score felt too loud and I could just make out the characters talking. The guy with the tattooed 'beard' was a very bad character. And was just there for a helping hand to repair the films plot holes. The film is better than the last but still isn't as immeasurable as Toy Story.",

I am getting SUPER anxious for HTTYD 3 next year (I’m actually counting down the days, lol). But as long as it good, it’ll be worth the wait. I have an idea of what’s gonna happen so we’ll see ;) I also LOVED Drago Bludvist as the villain!! He adds so much to this movie for the short 30-35 minutes he’s in it. So hopefully he’ll be in 3 much more!! So yea, if you haven’t seen either of the damn good movies, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?!?!! ",

No relearning the same lessons as the first film, no rehashing of plot lines--the twist was great and the resolution for the separation is very touching. If I had one complaint it might be that Drogo is a bit of a generic villain? But that's not too important, he's a means to an end and everything else in this film is likeable and fun to watch. It answers some of the main questions from the first film and how the whole dragon system works, and each character gets nice little moments to shine. A well crafted film overall.\n\nBut as a nitpick for the trailers: good god Dreamworks, don't spoil such major things! I get that the mother-figure isn't a core plot point and a rather minor reveal all things considered, but still! It would have been nice to see that in the film rather than a trailer straight up telling me it! Please try to be less spoilery for the 3rd installment, eh?",

I don't really have much to say about this sequel. Just that it was a really amazing movie, that's all. Shame I can't be bothered to watch the Cartoon Network and later Netflix series since about 90% of the Netflix/DreamWorks shows look like cash grabs and I stopped watching Nickelodeon 2 years ago. Ah well, at least I've learned to be patient. When the third movie arrives, it'll have arrived. Interesting plot, characters and story make this movie good.

Once again, the film is beautifully animated, and this time around actually surpasses the first film in the amount of detail in the animation. DreamWorks utilizes brand new animation technology for this sequel, and it certainly shows: every strand of hair on each character and even the smallest scales on each dragon are so clear and detailed. The cinematography (in which Roger Deakins was a visual consultant) once again captures all of the adventure, especially the aerial scenes beautifully, and John Powell's score is once again absolutely mesmerizing.\n\nThe one place where it just can't live up to its predecessor, however, is in the story. How to Train Your Dragon was effective in its simplicity, but the sequel amps things up with a more complex story with a lot of darker elements. Not to say that the story doesn't work - it certainly has a lot of hard-hitting moments and isn't afraid to make some very permanent decisions - but a lot of it feels detrimental overall. The new characters don't have a lot of the depth that they should: new allies and villains have their motivations and little else, which is kind of disappointing. It's also paced awkwardly, with some of the aforementioned hard-hitting scenes getting breezed over in order to keep the story rolling. It's a movie largely targeted at children and families, so it sort of necessitates that kind of story structure, but perhaps a good 10-15 minutes would make this story flow a bit better.\n\nIt's definitely an entertaining movie that anyone who enjoyed the first film can enjoy, and the animation is definitely top notch, but it's a bit of a step down in the story department.",

It was actually pretty good. But holy crap was this more fun.\nThis film now has Hiccup traveling to new worlds with his Knight-rider dragon Toothless to find more dragons to keep safe. He is meant to be the new chief but doesn't want the position that badly because he doesn't know what kind of person he is. Among his travels he upsets a Dragon snatcher who is capturing as many as he can for Jargo Bloodfist. Hiccup meets his mother and brings his family back together to stop Jargo from controlling all the dragons.\nThese films in particular are interesting kids films that I'm pretty sure any kid would like to see, if and when the third film does come which I'm pretty sure it will, it will probably be the best of the trilogy because this is actually based on a series of books the first book of the same name.\nThe movie is more engaging and fun then the first, it exceeded my expectations, I wasn't looking forward to this either like I said word of mouth made me change my mind so I had to see what all the fuss was about.\nJay Baruchel is voicing Hiccup once again and delightfully so, I don't any other voice would fit the character. Gerard Butler voices his father and he was the best actor in the first film and he steals the show yet again in this sequel. I can't tell who voiced who when it comes to the rest of the cast but i still found them all to be good as well.\nThe direction is every bit as good as the first film if not even better. I really liked the 3-D animation this film everything is moving so fast that at times the film feels so energized during the flying and fight sequences it's like a jolt.\nAll the elements of a good animated motion picture are present it has good pacing, fun sequences, and a nice cast to top it all off. I give How to Train Your Dragon 2 a four out of five.",

Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.\n\nThe repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.\n\nFinally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...\n\nIn any case, this is a good movie, funny and with an interesting story.

            "content": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a big movie - even epic.\n\nWhere most animated movies these days are mousy and small, this one has a giant canvas with a visual sweep that reminds you of The Lion King and Finding Nemo. It's a fun movie to behold. The animation makes the sky into a living, breathing place without boundaries. The animators have taken the simple idea of flying through the air and made it into a roller coaster of visual delight. That's a relief in the age of TV-style directing where filmmakers think that everything has to be shot in tight close-ups. The skies here are limitless, cloud strewn and dotted with dragons of all sizes and shapes.\n\nThe story picks up five years later as Hiccup (voiced again by Jay Baruchel) and his Viking community of Berk have embraced dragons and turned dragon flying into a sport. They've even taken to racing one another in a Quidditch-style sport involving live sheep. Hiccup is now is a little taller, his face a little longer - though reasonably, in five years he should have started a beard. He loves the sport of flying dragons, but it is clear that his mind is elsewhere. He wants to explore the world beyond Berk to see what's out there. So, he and dragon pal Toothless head off to find unexplored territories. What they find isn't exactly new ground, but a new problem. There are pirates out there whose intentions are deadly, and whose boss is even deadlier. Not to give too much away, but let's just say these guys are building a fearsome dragon army, and not for racing.\n\nThe story is kind of beside the point. It's your standard bad-guy-wants-to-use-his-army-to-rule-the-world plot, the narrative has an heir of predictability but that doesn't mean isn't full of surprises. The best moment comes early in the film when Hiccup is flying home at dusk on the back of Toothless above a landscape of clouds. Off to his right, a wraith-like figure emerges from the clouds wrapped in bandages. It's a ghastly sight, wrapped in warrior garb with spines protruding from its head. Until we learn its identity, it is reasonable to think that it is a visitor from the land of the dead. What makes this moment so breathtaking is how unexpectedly it happens.\n\nThe identity of this being will not be revealed here except to say that it opens up some of Hiccup's familial identity. It's a subplot buried in a very PC story that preaches that the best way to train an animal is to gently understand it. The movie's villain wouldn't agree. His name is Drago (voiced by Djimon Hounsou) and he is rumored to be a fearsome warrior with thousands of dragons at his disposal. There is a very effective build-up to Drago on par with Keyser Soze. He is spoken about long before we see him, hidden in shadows and legend. When we see him though he's a bit of a disappointment. He looks like a caveman and seems made up mostly of scars, sweat, hair and anger management issues. His personality is all grumbles and threats. Does he have a life of his own?\n\nThere are some nice touches in the film involving the relationship between Hiccup and his village chief father Stoick (Gerard Butler) that leads to a development that is really unexpected. Yet, it might be nice to tie up Hiccup's relationship with his girlfriend Astrid. She's kind of in this movie for support - maybe in the second sequel we'll get the romance.\n\nWhat shortcomings this movie has story-wise is overcome by the visual inventiveness. The animators have pulled out all the stops to create dragons of every scope and size. Some dragons are as big a basketball while others are the size of a stadium. Drago has one beast at his disposal called The Alpha that could tussle with Godzilla.\n\nNow the million dollar question - will kids enjoy it? The answer: most definitely yes. There's enough visual delight here to engage their imagination and not insult their intelligent. It's not as creative as The LEGO Movie but they definitely won't be bored by it. This is the kind of movie that is a treat for the eyes as well as the heart.",

Regardless, the movie strikes a nice tone between the dark and comical elements (I mean how many kids movies have the balls to still kill off main characters these days?).  It's much darker than the first, although less focused in meaning.  Call me cynical, but I feel the villain straight forward as a man named Drago seemed kind of generic and predictable (I was possibly hoping maybe the mom attacked in retaliation for not believing her about dragons, not sure why I was expecting something that dark but maybe I'm just thinking the plot twist is too predictable (Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.)).  Still a lot of the CGI fights are fun if sort of generic.  In a way, I'd compare this to Brave but I'm not sure why one has a higher RT score.",

An excellent actress, her voice provided a new emotional level to the film that almost brought me to tears at some points. That's when you know a kids movie is worth watching; when it makes you feel something.\nThis may sound odd, but I loved the action in this movie. There is just something about dragons fighting that is awesome, especially within this film, the variety of dragons they have is mind blowing. Also the little symbol he has is reminiscent of the sigil of House Targaryen- not sure if they did that on purpose.\nThis is one of the best animation movie sequels that I can think of, besides from Toy Story 2/3. Can you think of something better? Maybe you could think of one, but it's pretty rare for a good animated sequel to exist. I mean, think about some examples of the terrible ones, it's not hard e.g. Cars 2. So for this movie to be great, is miraculous. \nLaughs, action, emotions, dragons.

            "content": "I'm rather perplexed by the rave reviews this film received. I enjoyed the first film immensely - very imaginative and fun. The sequel *looks* very impressive - there have obviously been major strides forward in computer animation technology between the two - but as a *film* I found it rather lacking. There are not just one but several stretches where nothing very much happens for several minutes at a time. The plot meanders irritatingly. Characters behave in ways that make no sense whatever once you know who they are and what their agenda is. Some of the \"rules\" about dragons and the way the world works that were established in the first film are ignored; other rules are established early in this film and then suddenly ignored again later on when it suits the demands of the script.\n\nThe most troubling aspect is the theme of peace vs violence. Earlier in the film, the hero, Hiccup, is determined, despite most people telling him he is wrong, to try to make peace with the villain. He sticks to his convictions, in the same way as he did in the first film, but there's a crucial difference: in the first film, he is ultimately proved right - dragons indeed turn out to be essentially friendly creatures rather than vicious killers, and it becomes obvious that both sides (humans and dragons) have been driven by fear rather than malice. In the end the village is almost wiped out because people don't listen to Hiccup's message, but eventually everything works out happily. It's a very positive message: overcome fear and distrust and things will work out well.\n\nBut this time round Hiccup is shown to be entirely wrong, and lives are lost because he is trying to make peace. The message is very clear: if you try to appease foreign aggression, people will die; instead you need to defend yourself as vigorously as possible and attack your enemy pre-emptively. \n\nWhat makes all this excruciatingly uncomfortable is that villain is the only character in the whole film who isn't white. He's voiced by Djimon Honsou, a black actor, and given an accent very different from all the others; and his appearance strongly suggests someone of african or arab origin. By the end of the film I felt as if I had been watching a propaganda piece made by neo-conservatives to justify the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. I really don't want to be told that pre-emptive violence is the best solution, and that attempts to settle things peacefully just get people killed; doubly not in a movie aimed at children.",

            "content": "'How to Train Your Dragon 2' came four years after the first film premiered  in theaters in March 2010 to rave reviews and a surprisingly abundant bag of cash. I admit to you that i loved the first 'How to Train Your Dragon' very much. It was cute, the vocal work and designs were excellent and the animation was beautiful. I looked forward to seeing the sequel to this sleeper hit. \n\nThe story takes a time-jump of five years and follows a 20 year old Hiccup (Voiced again by Jay Baruchal) and his dragon Toothless and the rest of the characters from the past film including Astrid (Now Hiccup's girlfriend) as Hiccup seeks to map out the rest of the land. While out adventuring, Hiccup uncovers a group of dragon trappers led by newcomer Eret, son of Eret (Voiced by 'Game of Thrones' Kit Harrington) who tells Hiccup of his leader; a villianous dragon hunter named Drago Bludvist  who seeks to take over the world with his dragon army. Along the way Hiccup must grasp with the discovery of his mom (Voiced by Cate Blanchett) who was thought to have been long since deceased.  \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is  different from the first film in many aspects, its more mature and defined. The character designs are sharper and fuller as is the story.  The script looks to move away from the cuteness and light nature of the first film and evolve into something along the lines of 'Toy Story 3'. \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2'  losses most of its cuteness to give way to a film that is mroe about growing up and discovery and adventure and loss... The film  features much more emotionl depth then that of the first film. It'll leave you sad at a few moments - that i can say to you. \n\n'How to Train Your Dragon 2' succeeds in becoming something new and different from the first film, but there was something lost between that five year jump. I believe that due to the growth and maturation of the lead characters, the jokes began to transition from the funny antics of Toothless and Hiccup into something else. Now we must rely on the side characters to give us a laugh now and then. The problem with that is the fact that the side characters are not main.  We see way lesser of the side characters then that of Hiccup and Toothless and as such we recieve less oppurtunities for jokes to be expressed.   I must note that these jokes that were presented didn't all work. There is one particular recurring joke that concerns a friend of Hiccup's named Ruffnut, sister to Tuffnut (Voiced by Kristian Wiig and T.J Miller respectively ) who falls for Eret, son of Eret, while two other friends, Fishlegs and Snotloat (Voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill)who both compete for her attention and affection from that of Eret. This was not that funny in my opinion, but i'm sure it will amuse the younger kids. \n\nThe animation in this movie is so jawdroppingly gorgous that i had to pause the film several times just to take it all in. The animation of the characters is so breathtakingly advanced and expressive that i contiually repeated the word 'Wow' at every moment a character spoke. The individual facial features are more detailed in that you can see much more. The skin is less smooth and has more tecture to it, the hair is less clumpy and you can see many individual strands...  i swear i could feel exactly what the characters were feeling just by looking at their eyes! \n\nAll and all, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is superior to the first film in the terms of animation and emotional depth and development but i still can't shake off the general lack of cuteness and abundance of jokes that made the first film so successful. However, in the end i except that with a five year gap between the first and second film, we are bound to lose something and in this case it was that. B   4/25/15",

The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.\n\nThis part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.\n\nLike I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it. \n\n8/10",

It is everything that a sequel should be.\n\nThe heroic Viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his faithful dragon Toothless must protect the peace-- and save the future of men and dragons from the power-hungry Drago (Djimon Hounsou). \n\nThere is nothing to say about the animation except the fact that it is beautiful in every way. With all the bright colors, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a lot of fun. Like it's predecessor, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not like other animated films. Most animated films nowadays are either boring, uninteresting, or rely on cliches. And How to Train Your Dragon 2 does not do that. The voice cast is just as good as the animation. There is Kit Harington, Cate Blanchett, and Djimon Hounsou (who I just mention) who are just as good as the cast in the previous film.\n\nThe film is way more emotional than it's predecessor. Like it's predecessor, I felt the emotional impact unlike most films today. I felt a lot of sympathy for the characters especially when one of the characters die (spoiler!).\n\nWhat makes How to Train Your Dragon 2 more exciting than it's predecessor is the action. It is more thrilling, more intense, and more adventurous than the first movie. Even though I didn't see this in 3D, it is still very exciting.\n\nOverall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a film that kids and adults to see. Not only it was one of the best films of 2014 but it is the best animated film that came out of 2014. And yes, it is better than The Lego Movie but hey it is my opinion. I do recommend that everyone including the kiddies to see this film. Also, see the first one too. It is just as great as this one.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first How to Train Your Dragon film, and was looking forward to this one. It definitely lives up to the first film and delivers just about everything you would want out of it. It maybe a little dark and intense for younger kids, but as an adult I appreciated the fact that the movie had real stakes and consequences in its story.\n\nThe film picks up five years after the first film ended, with the young viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) having successfully taught the people of his village that dragons, despite their fearsome appearance, are actually just like dogs in their behavior and can live harmoniously with people. This new peace and stability is threatened, however, by a mysterious villain bent on enslaving dragons and using them to conquer others. Naturally, it's up to Hiccup and his dragon Toothless to save the day.\n\nAt this point in animated film history, it seems redundant to say that a big-budget CGI movie looks great: the Pixar movies all look terrific, and this one is about on par with them, especially in terms of its environments. Roger Deakins, the famous cinematographer who shoots almost everything for the Coen brothers and many other excellent-looking films besides, is listed as a \"visual consultant\" on both How to Train Your Dragon movies; I would be interested to know what exactly his role entailed, given that he works with live-action usually. In any event, the movie does look terrific, and the action sequences are really well staged. The voice work by Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, and Gerard Butler is excellent, and I appreciated how Djimon Hounsou just made his character scream ferociously to control dragons. My main issue with the film, which tells a fairly conventional story but tells it well, is that its relentlessly fast pace leaves little time for developing supporting characters. I find that as I grow older, I appreciate more and more deliberately-paced films, such as many of Hayao Miyazaki's works, which allow us to just get comfortable in the world of a fantastical story before setting off into adventure. While the fast pace does keep this movie engaging and exciting, I can't help but feel a little more quiet time with the characters early on would have made me like it even more. Still, that's not a major criticism, especially given that the movie's primary audience is kids. For what it is, this is still a totally successful movie.",

Emotion, comedy, and action isn't like other sequels.\n\nThough the comedy isn't really that much as Big Hero 6, it's just as funny. The romantic connection between Hiccup and Astrid is wonderful.\n\nStoick and Valka's song in the film tells the commitment of husband and wife, as they are, despite being separated for 20 years.\n\nI cried when [SPOILERS!!!!!!] Stoick died, and when he was sent off cremated in a wooden ship. I didn't see that coming, and it was very emotional for me that a father dies. This, unlike Mufasa's death in The Lion King, is the 'blink and you miss it' kind of death, but just as emotional. This is a worthy contender to Big Hero 6 and The LEGO Movie.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.0/10",

But considering the amount of people praising the shot out of this movie I got to say that I was really disappointed. To be honest this movie wasn't very good. Honestly I think that it's one of the most overrated movies ever made. I'm not saying that this movie is awful, there's so good qualities but there's also bad ones. The movies animation is great, it's smooth, and great to look at. The parts with the dragons is great. The score is also pretty good, I didn't think it was amazing but solid nonetheless. However that's where my compliments end. My biggest problem with the movie is the characters, I didn't give a shit about any of them. The voice acting wasn't convincing either. That very fact is the movies downfall because it tries to make you care about the characters so badly and I just couldn't. Even with the action and animation, I found the movie to be quite boring. One thing that was also poor about the movie was its villain, the villain was so undeveloped that I didn't find him a threat at all. In all I didn't like this movie, to be honest the movie is really forgettable, the movie isn't horrible but I can't get behind the acclaim that the movie gets. I'll give it a 5/10",

Set 5 years after the events of the first film, the people of the Viking village of Berk have made peace with the dragons, and even using them in sporting events. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) spends a lot of time with his dragon Toothless, and they use their time exploring new territories. Until they and Astrid (America Ferrera) discover dragon trapper Eret (Kit Harington), capturing dragons for his boss Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou), a vicious war lord. Hiccup's father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler) says Drago cannot be reasoned with, but Hiccup and Toothless set out to try anyways, and they come across the reclusive dragon trainer Valka (Cate Blanchett), who is Hiccup's mother. It's very well made, and it looks like DreamWorks Animation have found the perfect franchise to succeed the well worn Shrek films. It has some brilliant visual details throughout, and it has a good sense of humour as well, as well as some serious emotion going on, but the dragons on display is the icing on the cake.",

            "content": "\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is visually inspiring but otherwise flat.  After the success of the first film, a sequel was inevitable.  I will give the writers credit for making some bold decisions involving the fate of a few characters, but the effect is lost due to the uneventful first half of the movie.  My temptation to quit on this overly-family-friendly-story was only tempered by the interesting design of the different dragons.  Disney has mastered the art of creating family-friendly films whose story and character development appeal to all age groups but I couldn't see anybody over the age of ten being thrilled by the first half of the story.  I've always taken issue with the casting of Jay Baruchel as Hiccup (his whiney voice is much better suited as a character voice, not a lead animated character that we have to hear for the entirety of the film) so the film definitely started off on the wrong foot, but it's the lack of direction that just kills it for me.  Creating a dark emotional moment only works with the correct setup, and this film plunged into it without taking the time to make sure it would resonate.  As in the first film, I find Toothless to be the only memorable character.  The story centers on Hiccup and Stoick and I'd be hard pressed to even remember the name of any other character, let alone cite a character transformation or explain their importance to the story.  How many characters can you name from \"The Lion King,\" an animated film that came out 21 years ago?  Now, how many characters can you name from \"How to Train Your Dragon 2,\" a film that I watched two days ago?  For as bad as the story is, the animation is that great.  The sensation of the POV dragon-riding shots, the creativity of the different breeds (?), and that animation of the ice were all stunning.  If \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" wins the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it will be clear that it is for its visual graphics and not the film as a whole.",

That said, I did find the story itself rather predictable, and it it relies on a few too many cliches and expository sequences. That's not to say it's bad -- far from it -- it just lacked that spark that drew me into the original.

The storyline was well put together and the different characters were a joy to watch. Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless, has to fight against some evil doers to save the dragon race. With the help of his close friends and his parents, the battle gets really intense and they manage to lose some close friends along the way. There is definitely something for everyone in this film, and the animation looks impressive. The director also added some emotional scenes, which actually touched me, and you can't help but feel for the sweat dragons who get hypnotised by a evil dragon who is controlled by Drago. Anyway, I personally preferred this to the first movie and I can't wait to see what they do with Hiccup and his travelling companion. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nI'm obviously not alone with thinking that this movie was a great watch because of the box office success. The first movie was more to make but this movie has nearly doubled the first movies profit, which must please the people at Dreamworks. Anyway, the voices used in this movie were well chosen by the director and the action scenes had a lot of attention to detail. The relationships between the characters is what makes you care what happens to the individuals, which is what surprised me about movie, and there are some great twists which keep the movie fresh and interesting. I think you can tell that I enjoyed this film so give it a try, even if your an adult without kids.\n\nBudget: $145million\nWorldwide Gross: $619million (WOW!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/comedy movies about the journey of Hiccup and Toothless who battle to save the dragon race against the evil Drago. 7/10",

            "content": "\"A SOARING ACHIEVEMENT IN ANIMATION & FILM\"\n\nAt the end of the original How To Train Your Dragon I was an emotional mess.  I was so moved by the story of Hiccup and his dragon Toothless. However, I figured that was it.  One beautiful movie and on to something else... NO!  I was so wrong and thank god for that!  But I was cautious going in.  Sequels often drop the ball and even ruin the original.  But I'm happy to tell you that not only does HTTYD2 prove sequels can be good, it also proves they can be better!   This is one superb film in every way and fans of the original won't be disappointed.  \n\nYou can't ignore the magic and wonderment of this movie.  Superb direction, flawless animation, a terrific voice cast, jaw dropping aerial action, and like the first movie there is heart in every moment.  Every character is so detailed, thought out, and expertly crafted to be a meaningful part of the film it makes you wonder how the movie didn't wind up being hours longer?  These filmmakers know what they are doing and they are doing it so well it's almost annoying.  Like, who are they trying to impress?  Oh Me, that's right.  Well consider me impressed!\n\nThe movie has matured with its audience as well.  Several years have passed between the two films and the characters are older so they deal with more grown up drama and that comes through in an all too pleasing dark manner.  They aren't kids anymore and their world is under a real devastating threat.  Lives are lost, others saved, and many changed in the film.  I stopped trying to count the number of times I cried because it was too distracting... so I think I just cried straight through the last half of the movie.  No joke.  I mean yeah I'm a sap, but holy hell was it powerful; powerful, beautiful, and very touching.  Toy Story 3 tore me up, but HTTYD2 left me in pieces.\n\nWhat is also really great about this sequel is that it stands alone as a whole, not as a part one of a two part sequel.  The movie has a clear-cut beginning and end and the ride is beyond engaging and it's downright thrilling!  The movie is clearly aware of its potential and uses the spectacle of flight in a most effective way.  I got dizzy at times as the 3D universe of HTTYD2 became so real I found myself moving and turning in my seat, grabbing for something to hang onto.  \n\nThe movie is pure wonder and will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.  One character even comes out and if you don't already know who it is I won't ruin it for you, but it's a moment that left me speechless.  DreamWorks really proved to the world that they aren't afraid to have a gay character in their kids films and that's really powerful to me.  Dragon 2 has pushed the envelope so far I can't wait to see what they bring to us with the 3rd and final film in the trilogy.  I'm sure they will not disappoint!  \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

            "content": "Hot off the critical and box office success that was How To Train Your Dragon, Dreamworks wasted little time in announcing a trilogy, and that second installment landed among us last summer.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I did not have the best experience leading up to this film. The marketing was inconsistent, starting with a fantastic teaser, which was followed by a terrible trailer. Terrible in the sense that it spoiled what I thought must have been a major plot point. Honestly, it was a crazy decision to include some of the details that they did. I was hoping to be proven wrong by the actual film, and that is was a piece of genius double bluff marketing. Unfortunately not.\n\nThe original How To Train Your Dragon was truly brilliant, and if the sequel even just matched the efforts of 4 years ago they would be doing well. It had a lot to live up to, and had already lost some of my favour in the build up.\n\nAt the end of the day it does fall short of the first film, and also short of the usual standard of animation in the past couple of years (terrifically high). How To Train Your Dragon 2 lacked that surprise spark that makes so many animation films wonderful for adults as well as children. It is not difficult to make an entertaining kids film. The Smurfs series is an example of a production made purely for children with no regard for their guardians. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is miles better than the Smurfs, but the fact of the matter is that I found myself constantly being drawn out of the film by inconsistencies and illogic.\n\nFrom dialogue that purely exists to expose the plot and a few convenient plot twists, one could feel constantly reminded that they were watching a film in dark room rather than inhibiting a world for 2 hours. Harsh maybe, but these are the perils of setting such high standards for yourself. There was a romance plot thread that didn't seem to know what to do with itself. It existed and didn't really justify the time given to it over the course of the film. The stakes were also raised, but the more personal story of last time worked better than the grander scale afforded this time.\n\nBut as far as negatives go, it rather does stop there. The animation is stellar, and the one area in which the first film is surpassed is the sense of scale you get with these dragons. It's very difficult to portray size realistically past a certain level, but the combination of animation and sound really brings these multi-ton dragons to life. The animation is used really well too. When you are given the gift of being able to stretch and morph things in any way you want, you really should use it. The comical dragons showed extent of how animation should be used. It's also funny enough, not as funny as the first film, but still contains a laugh here and there. \n\nThe problem is that all the highlights of the film are the individual jokes and spectacles rather than the complete package. It has most of what is required in animation for the standard level of quality, but is let down by subpar storytelling. The glue which holds everything together is missing, and all the pieces were so beautiful too!\n\nCoda: The promise was there, but this is ultimately a subpar effort from Dreamworks. The battle scenes are worth the entry ticket alone though.\n\nRead more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",

            "content": "Starring: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Cate Blanchett, and America Ferrera\nDirected By: Dean DeBlois\nWritten By: Dean DeBlois\nRated: PG\n\nBased on the book series \"How To Train Your Dragon\" by Cressida Cowell\n5 years after the events of the first film, the viking village of Berk has fully embraced living with dragons and making them a part of their lives. Hiccup is restless and longs to explore the growing world with his dragon Toothless, but his father Stoick thinks it's time for him to take over as chief of Berk. The arrival of the warlord Drago and a mysterious dragon rider, who is sabotaging his dragon catchers put a stop to their plans as war seems to be on the horizon. With the help of his friends and their dragons, Hiccup must try to prevent it and save Berk.\n\nThe first HTTYD was an instant favorite of mine. Fun characters, dragons that felt like they were real animals, and amazing 3D all made for the best family film of 2010. So when I heard of the sequel I was both excited and skeptical. Knowing Dreamworks' history of chugging out cash grabbing sequels made me a little anxious about whether this would turn into one of those. Thankfully, that turned out not to be the case, but it still ended up falling short of the first one.\n\nThere's some good voice work from the cast and I enjoy Jay Baruchel's as Hiccup, even though I know a couple of people who can't stand his voice. He spends most of his time conversing with a character that doesn't talk back but you instantly buy the relationship between him and Toothless.\nGerard Butler, Cate Blanchett, and Craig Ferguson are about the only cast members who actually sound like Vikings and are fun to listen to whenever they get to interact with each other.\nDjimon Hounsou and Kit Harrington were the standouts as the villain Drago and the dragon trapper Eret. They're new characters and are right away, easily memorable.\nJonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller and Kirsten Wiig all return as the other dragon riders, but they are downplayed a lot in this and are mostly just there with little else to do. You could take them out of the movie and it wouldn't make much difference. It's a bit of a disappointment because they were fun amusing characters in the first and were a great contrast to Hiccup. America Ferrara gets to do a little bit more than the others and at least served a purpose.\n\nThe movie goes for a darker tone then the first one and is an admirable idea, but there is never anything really funny to break up the seriousness. There are a couple of cute moments in the background with the dragons but that's about it. Snoutlout and Fishlegs competing over Ruffnut gets old fast and felt like it came out of nowhere, but it does manage to have a somewhat humorous conclusion.\nSPOILER WARNING (unless you saw the trailer that is). The reveal that the mysterious dragon rider is Hiccup's mother shouldn't have been given away in the trailer. If they had left it to be revealed for the first time in the film then that would have been huge and a great moment. Not really film ending, but a disappointing choice on the studio's part, especially since the director was going for an Empire Strikes Back feel for this film. END SPOILER.\nAnother big disappointment I had, was the 3D (I saw both Dragon movies in RealD 3D). While the first one had lots of amazing flight scenes that made you feel like you were flying right alongside Toothless and the other dragons, the 3D here never felt as engrossing. There's a decent scene towards the beginning, but it always cut away just as it was starting to pull me in. If you see this, the 3D is a pass.\nThere are a few good moments, like a song between a pair of characters that are reconnecting and a pretty sweet battle preceding the finale fight. Toothless is still an amazing character and the animators do a fantastic job of bringing him to life despite him never saying a word.\nIt's not as horrendous as say the Madagascar or Shrek sequels and I will still see the third one when it comes out, I will just be less excited for it. Without much humor and the fact that it drags terribly (I was surprised when I got out that is was less than two hours when it felt like three) I'm not sure kids will enjoy this one, much less their parents. I'd say it's a rental if you are a Dragon fan.\n\n6 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"Drago Bludvist is a mad man!\"\n\"I'll bloody HIS fist with my FACE if he tries to take my dragon!\"",

The colors and the characters were very vibrant and visually pleasing throughout the whole movie. I thought the story line was interesting but there were a few instances in the film that I thought were unnecessary. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is very dark. They have a lot more death in it that didn't seem like it was all that necessary for the plot. When someone dies in a film, I believe it should in someway help drive the story. I did not feel that was the case for this. A lot of the darker scenes that had death in them were reconciled within 10-15 minutes of them happening. To me, I just didn't see the point of them dying. At the end I wasn't happy and I wasn't sad. I just felt ok and that is why I gave this a middle score of 3 stars. It is a well written story and the script was done well. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys animated films. Especially if they enjoyed the first one.",

Of course, it still had the humor that both kids and adults will love that will enhance their experience watching this movie.\n\nThe movie's plot was well-written, fast-paced and has no fillers at all which made this movie entertaining to watch. The character development is great in this movie especially on Hiccup and Toothless. After all, they're the stars of the movie.\n\nThe animation style in this movie is great to watch as you can even tell by its smallest details that the people who worked on this movie made sure that the animation in this movie will keep your eyes on the screen.\n\nOverall, this sequel to the How To Train Your Dragon franchise will entertain everyone, both fans of the franchise as well as the general audience with its mature themes, entertaining plot and great character development.",

A little on the long side, but still emotionally powerful with twists in the plot that are equally heartbreaking and surprising; if you were a fan of the first movie you should love this one too.

What I did remember was a boy and a dragon and a bunch of Vikings and that was about it. So when I was asked if I wanted to see the film with a work college and her husband yesterday evening at first I thought to myself\n\"If you're paying sure!\" ( not that they did :P)\nThinking a little more on it and actually remembered a Facebook friend going to a preview screening, saying how much he enjoyed it, I thought again and thought why not. It's animated which I love and its dragons which I love again, what did I have to lose?!?\nHonestly I had no idea what I was in for, wasn't sure if it was going to be a musical, wasn't sure of the new story, wasn't sure of anything.... As the film started a gorgeous animation style filled the screen, big detail, big colours, and the biggest surprise for me was hearing Jonsi from Sigur Ros singing the across the opening credits. Very life like features on the both the human characters and the animal characters as well It actually blew me away, straight off I was very impressed.\nSo the story is set in a Viking era where the world is still being discovered, The Vikings of a little township called Berk have learnt to live with their earlier enemy: Dragon. Dragon and human are now best friends and go everywhere and do everything together. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his pet Dragon Toothless a very rare Night Fury Dragon that shoots lighting balls instead of fire, are the very best of friends, Hiccup and Toothless apparently had some kind of altercation in the first film (I'm guessing, but don't recall) where both were maimed by each other and since then have become inseparable. While out one day mapping the world Hiccup and Toothless discover an unusual ice formation, whilst investigating the ice sculpture the duo find a group of Vikings who are in fact Dragon hunters. Night Furies being so rare is obviously the find of a lifetime and so the Hunters set their sights on capturing Toothless and his rider and return them to their leader Drago Bloodfist who for some unknown reason is capturing Dragons to use in his army. Hiccup flies back to Berk to warn his father the Chief, who instantly closes up the town and attempts to hide the Dragons away from the impending attack. Hiccup disobeys his father and flies off to confront this evil Dragon hunter Drago Bloodfist to get him to change his mind, whilst flying about Hiccup and Toothless are captured by another mysterious being known as Valka, who takes them to a Dragon refuge where the Alpha Dragon resides and protects his fellow species... \nBy this stage I was so enthralled in the film, I had finally figured out who the voice actor was of Hiccup (couldn't get Christian Slater out of my mind even though I knew it wasn't him) was and just sat on the edge of my seat as the story opened up even further. Not going to go any further into the story you'll just have to watch it to find out.\nPretty big cast as well a lot of well-known voice actors: as well as Jay Baruchel there is Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, Cate Blanchett and a multitude of other great actors who make this film work so well. They all work so well together, I loved the banter between the characters it really made the film so much bigger. Make sure you stay for the credits too, some amazing artwork plays behind the credits as Jonsi plays once again.\nSo what I wish they did differently was maybe a little explanation of the previous film, they gave hints throughout of the first film but not enough. Maybe they should have included some flashbacks or something, just something to explain exactly what happened and why the main characters were maimed, why Toothless can only fly with a rider and not on his own. Other than those two things I loved the film, loved the story even though it was about 4 stories being told at once that never really met anywhere it still worked. I loved the drama, I loved the action, I loved the characters but most of all I loved the Dragons, they were so realistic in their behaviors, even when they weren't the main focus on the screen seeing them behaving like actual pets playing in the background, having a chase or play fighting just being a usual household pet made this so wonderful and enjoyable.\nRecommend this one for everyone, only thing I would say is if you can, watch the first film How To Train Your Dragon before seeing the sequel especially if you haven't seen it already. It's not going to be a huge impact if you don't, the film works so well it's not at all necessary. So grab your kids or steal some for 2 hours and make your way to the cinema to see this amazing film.\nHow To Train Your Dragon 2 deserves 4/5 BanShee Screams and does anyone know where I can get me a Dragon? I really want one now.\nX\n#HTTYD2",
