    "summary": "The entire planet is thrown into mayhem when millions of people disappear without a trace -- all that remains are their clothes and belongings. Unmanned vehicles crash and planes fall from the sky, overwhelming emergency forces and causing massive gridlock, riots and chaos. Airline pilot Ray Steele (Nicolas Cage) struggles to save the lives of the passengers who remain on his flight, while his daughter (Cassi Thomson) races to find her brother and mother, both of whom have disappeared.",

A fair amount of mystery and intrigue, but vague allusions to God and it possibly being a biblical event make it somewhat preachy.",

            "content": "I feel a lot of people are super mean about low budget films. Because of critics like these low budget films sometimes don't get made. When the low budget films are the ones that need to be made to spread the good news. In this case\u2026 I though the fact that Nicolas Cage took this portrayal as an actor (whom choose their roles) was pretty cool of him. You rarely see big time actors take on Christian world view roles. For the sake of a community that might not have otherwise watched this type of film. I personally do believe the rapture is going to happen, also any day now for the time and seasons of this age are present and all around us. The Bible is 1/4 prophecy in a whole and most people don't realize that because people don't want to talk about that anymore now days (prophecy fulfilled btw). It is called the blessed hope for a reason it is an escape of the coming wrath of God for an evil and Christ rejecting world. \nIf you did like this movie Kevin Sorbo just made its sequel recently. It really hit home to how the world has changed in the last few years. Which has brought the Christian view of pre-rapture and end times theology to life and \"real\" in the way the world is headed currently!!",

It does have some good tension in the second half of the movie.  But for a Christian movie, it has very little Gospel in it, most of what is there is regulated to the \"nut jobs\".\n\nNot much character here, the movie focusing on the disaster...what there is of it.  You just want the movie to be better than it is.",

Nicholas Cage as usual is totally and enthusiastically committed in the role. Gotta say - other reviews I have seen are tough - seem to mix up their own views on Christianity with a movie about Christianity.",

            "content": "I'm very surprised that I actually liked it. Given the subject matter, I was worried it was either going to be too pro-religion with lots of \"preaching\" or too anti-religion and just a hate fest against religious folks. But instead the movie focused on the characters and how they dealt with the immediate dangers that they faced. There's not much of an arc for anyone as it's played mostly as an action movie. It felt like they might've been setting up for a sequel where some of the characters would find some sort of meaningful change, but sadly that doesn't happen here and there's no sequel I can find. But I did think it was an enjoyable and entertaining way to pass the time. Nicholas Cage is great as usual, Cassi Thomson was very good and believable as his daughter, and I was really surprised at how good Nicky Whelan was as the flight attendant that Nic Cage's character is having an affair with. That character could easily have been a typical clich\u00e9d \"evil other woman\" and \"flight attendant from hell\" who hates her passengers. But Whelan (and the writers) make her very real and interesting. There's some unnecessary, and thankfully brief, subplots on the plane, but overall I found it a pleasant surprise.",

            "content": "First I don't believe the \"rapture\" is ever going to happen.  Two reasons, I don't think all the \"good\" people are going to taken to Heaven body and soul naked so Jesus and the Antichrist to go all \"Mortal Kombat\".  Second, the Rapture is a fantasy of conservative Christianity who thinks Heaven is harder to get into than Harvard.  All the kids get to go like kids can't sin?  I take it director Vic Armstrong has no kids.  Because they sin all the times.  Hell, the Muslim kid is raptured, which makes no sense.  Considering his Muslim dad was \"left behind\".  So what's the sin here?  If it's not being Christian than the Muslim kid should go and it's not being Muslim, what was the dad's sin.  The sins that caused them to be left behind.  The adultry of the pilot I can understand.  But being addicted to drugs is not a sin, they need help.  Also the PG-13 dumbing it down, like a Pureflix was behind it.  One scene a guy goes flying through a window after being shot in the face by a shot gun but the blood was white.  It feels like a Estus Pirkle sermon.  But Estus Pirkle's movie wouldn't dumb it down, that guy wouldn't have a face anymore.  Lastly, the whole Rapture is nothing but people vanishing without seeing their naked bodies floating to Heaven, again thank you PG-13. It's nothing but bullshit conservative hypocrisy.  Read the Bible, not made up things like The Rapture or Dante's Inferno.",
