The characters and their relationships, particularly in the first half, are colored in very realistically; you can genuinely latch onto them and care about the small-scale drama unfolding in their lives. However, the film does stall out toward the end and it tries to manufacture added drama around elements of the story we've already addressed (and as far as the audience is concerned, already resolved). Gabriel's sexuality and Karina's place in the love parallelogram are good examples of this. Had that part been tightened up and the subplot with the exchange program been given a bit more of a meaningful finish, the film would get higher marks. As it is though, it's hard not to enjoy this.",

I love that Leonardo feels like a fully fleshed out character with flaws and faults, strengths and agency, all despite being blind. This could have very easily been very sappy and saccharine, with Leonardo treated as a helpless baby, but there is a wonderfully complex, loving story here.",

In turn, Gabriel falls in love with  Leo despite of never been able to see him.  It's a story where love breaks all barriers, it's true love.  I recomend that teens watch this movie as to learn what real love should be. The  actors specially the one that play Leo were stellar.  I was convinced the actor that played Leo he was a blind actor in real life he's not .  Bravo!",

This Brazilian movie gets all the details in the most subtle and beautiful manner. I can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t stop thinking about it-I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)m literally obsessed with it. Its subtlety and perfection on laying out small details are just exceptional. The love story between Leonardo (a blind since birth) and Gabriel (a newcomer) is so authentic and inspiring. An instant classic for sure.

Ribiero arrives with a well-constructed narrative that speaks of strength, confidence, independence and the unstoppable desire to explore the world and the pleasures of life, facing reality with experiences of all kinds that leave nothing but thoughts, beautiful anecdotes and the learnings about the pursuit of sexuality. The friendship as a theme is great in \"The way he looks\" as well as the feelings we find which are transmitted in a sometimes hard way but full of love and truth. It does not take too many dramas to create an excellent story and here no resource is forced, and while there is tension, this is certainly a charming and heartfeeling tale.",

Along with his best and only friend, Giovana (Tess Amorim), he laments over the general lack of excitement of being in high school. Things begin to look up, however, when he meets a new student named Gabriel (Fabio Audi), someone who is unlike the other boys in his class.\n\n\"The Way He Looks,\" written and directed by Daniel Ribeiro, is an LGBTQ picture that radiates honesty and with that quality it is already lightyears from its contemporaries. It neither relies on overt sexuality to be sexy nor a syrupy romance to get us to invest in the lives of the three Brazilian teenagers. Its approach is simple but effective: it shows the characters' insecurities, how they deal with their problems, and the reconciliation, if any, that occurs when or if they learn to mature a little bit.\n\nThere is an organic feel to the look of the film. It benefits from not one scene being shot in a studio. When we are inside Leo's house, we notice the decorations on the walls, the knickknacks on the side tables, how lived in it all feels. When a scene is set at school, the floors are not shiny, the desks appear as though they have been used for years, certain corridors look like they need a bit of polishing. Because of its realistic look and feel, it establishes a certain tone-that we are looking at real lives being lived in real places.\n\nLeo's arguments with his parents, too, are executed with realism. Watching them felt like I was being intrusive at times. The disagreements come across as genuine, from the tone and pitch of their voices to how close they get to one another physically. The words chosen and how they are delivered are not glossy or hyper-articulate. It makes these scenes very relatable and there were a couple of times when I could not help but think back to certain instances when I was upset with my parents after a long day of school.\n\nThe friendships among the three are sweet. Throughout the course of the picture, we discover how the dynamics of their relationships work. Sometimes they are fragile but surprisingly strong at times. There is a great metaphor introduced in the middle which involves the sun, the moon, and the earth when an eclipse occurs. Furthermore, there is a theme involving fear of losing a strong connection throughout-whether it be of a long-lasting friendship or a potential romance.\n\nI enjoyed that sometimes it isn't clear what a character wants exactly.

The feeling I had as it finished reminded me of a similar sentiment, somewhere along the lines of saying goodbye to a good friend. You know you're not going to see this friend for a long time and so a part of you is sad.

Again, one more movie in the list of 'based on the short film'. It also retained all the prominent cast and their respective roles for this full length feature. A teen romance-drama, a gay theme as well as a love triangle. Very light and softly narrated tricky romance theme and obviously suited well as a complete picture.\n\nThe story was told from the perspective of a blind high school student Leo. He and Gi are the friends since childhood. She's always there for him like a pair of eyes, a companion who walks with him home, only until a new student Gabe arrives. The things are starting to change around them and they begin to realise how much valuable to each other. What comes after is the crux of the story. The same old jealousy story, but from the fresh cast it looked so good.\n\n\"In our eclipse, Gabriel would be the\nEarth and you, the moon.\"\n\nA successful domestic box office, critically acclaimed film and the better ratings in all the online movie database, but to me it was just a good movie. The story had adorable characters and the love tale was told in a cute way, though that was not enough for me to get excited. No offense, but the gay theme was the letdown, that doesn't mean I'm against the gay. I loved 'Love of Siam' and 'Bangkok Love Story'. Maybe because I'm a straight, though I had no problem with the movies like 'Water Lilies', 'Yes or No' and other lesbian movies.\n\nIt's a crazy world, full of crazy people and their crazy romances. Whatever the format is, the love is always sweet. I liked this film's concept, if it was reversed from the gay to the lesbian, probably I would have loved it more. Or the story structure and character development in the first half should have been improved. Because in the end part, looked everything hurried and forced to conclude. Don't listen to me, you might like it, but be cautious, especially don't go after it with a great expectation seeing plenty of praise everywhere.\n\n7/10",

Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\n\nA quote from 'The Little Prince'; not the most auspicious of starts when reviewing a film, I know... But do bear with me.\n\nMuch like 'The Little Prince', you will not find the film 'The Way He Looks' featuring anytime soon in any Top 10 lists of the year or of all time.\n\nIt is not a critics' darling. It doesn't capture the zeitgeist and it certainly does not provide any groundbreaking insight about the times we live in. It is not a 'Catcher in the rye' nor a 'In Search of Lost Time'. But it is a 'The Little Prince', concocted with the same deceptive simplicity and irresistible understated charm. And just as likely a target for the same misanthropic, highbrow bile as the latter is.\n\nIts plot, an age-old story of teenage girl/boy/otherwise meets teenage girl/boy/otherwise. Its magic, telling it with inescapable charm and simplicity.\n\nSeemingly reducing the complexity of the human condition to its most clich\u00e9d, over-simplistic denominator, what in reality this film does is finding the common humanity in all of us and bridging the gap by conveying it in a universally accessible language, that of emotions, sensations and of fewer words as possible; blasphemy for the supposedly more sophisticated masses.\n\nThe film is awkward, silly at times, and it revels in it. It comes to life when depicting with disarming sincerity and earnestness such moments of embarrassing unease.\n\nEmbarrassing unease; that is the ultimate definition of being a teenager, if there has ever been any. Sex hasn't happened yet. Life hasn't happened yet. You are discovering who you are, how your body responds to stimulus, which stimulus it prefers and how. You have never chartered these waters before, you have no clue what to expect and feel completely out of your depth. You are clumsy, all that you do and say is pathetic and all that surrounds and happens to you is silly and painfully awkward. And yet, you have never felt so alive.\n\nA few babyish kisses in a foggy shower mirror. One fully clothed masturbation scene, angle wide focused on the eyes, the lips, the face, the touch and the thrill of discovering fantasy and pleasure. One lips-only hushed kiss. One fleeting glance at your loved one's line of beauty. One climatic final embrace. The thrilling delight of speeding away down your street in your bike, holding the one you love tight, with a joyful abandonment that only youth and inexperience allows.\n\nLet's face it: Disney nowadays manages to squeeze in more action than this. And yet, 'The Way He Looks' stands tall as one of the most sensual pictures ever made. Nothing you see will arouse you. Nothing is overt, crass or vulgar. Its sensuality derives not from what you see but from what you experience. With its disarming sincerity and earnestness, the film pulls you in; you don't observe as much as you experience.\n\nIt is you who is braving a confusing and yet pleasurable and uncharted territory of newly discovered sensations. It is you feeling the thrill of experiencing love and infatuation for the very first time and the absolute dread of not being able to live up to its promise. It is you he/she is holding; you he/she desires. It is you kissing, you being kissed. It is your hair that the wind tosses in that final elating bike ride. It is you being inflicted the cruelty of bullies who taunt you mercilessly for not being able to see, for not being the life and soul of the party, for sticking out like a sore thumb. It is you who holds your beloved hands as a show of defiance to them.\n\nSome films will provide you with the comic relief needed to manage the drudgeries of daily life and prevent you from falling down the perilous pitfalls you find along the way. Other films will provide you with a safe haven to let it all out, anger and sadness alike, by serving as a metaphor and ultimate validation of all the sorrows in your life.\n\nBut then there are films that by virtue of their artistry will fill you with a pervasive sense that irrespective of the reality that you are facing, you will ultimately prevail in some form or the other and will still be able to somehow take a small measure of joy from what surrounds you. Such films will not necessarily give you profound insights about life and your existence, nor will they open your eyes to new ways of being and doing, nor will they invariably make you cry or laugh out loud. Instead, they will fill you with an unbridled, understated elation and an inescapable sensation of being at peace with life passing mercilessly by and you somehow still managing to take some pleasurable bits of it for your enjoyment. They will make it OK to be OK with life as is and its imperfections.\n\nNothing in this film feels false or formulaic, owing much to one of the most naturalistic and sincere pieces of acting to ever grace the screen, curtsy of its 3 main leads, Ghilherme Lobo, Fabio Audi and Tess Amorim. You will find it silly and unsophisticated. You will find it unremarkable and understated. And you also will feel hijacked by expectancy, as you see sincere love unfolding before your eyes. You will end up elated and uplifted. You will want to clap at the end and will be left feeling giddy for weeks to come. You will be a willing prisoner of its charm.\n\nJust don't forget to leave your misanthropic self behind when entering the screening room; you can always get back to it later. Give it a break.\n\nThat fox was on to something after all...\n\nhttps://cinephiliaetc.wordpress.com",

The love story of two high school boys discovering their sexuality is sweet. Mix into this that the one young man Leonardo, played by Ghilherme Lobo, is blind and seeking independence in the world. The teens, parents, and teachers as written are all playing types instead of real, fully developed characters.",

This was Brazil's submission for Oscar consideration and I am disappointed it didn't make it in because as much as I liked Ida and Leviathan, this film trumps them both. It's a wonderful debut performance from Ghilherme Lobo who plays a blind kid, Leo, and I had to research to find out if the actor is blind in real life (he isn't) because he gave on of the better performances as a blind character that I've seen on film. The story is ultimately about friendship between a few different people and how Leo just wants to be a normal teen which sounds like a been there done that concept with teenagers with a crutch but works well here with Leo's interest in an exchange program, going to parties, the movies, just normal teenage life. Fabio Audi is also wonderful as Leo's new friend Gabriel. It has a beautiful screenplay and certain sequences especially a dream sequence that are well crafted. It's a lovely film that joins in the elite club of movies I found myself sad to see end because I feel in love with these characters and the story so much. Definitely check it out on Netflix",
