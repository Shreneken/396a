    "summary": "Convinced that mutants pose a threat to humanity, Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) develops the Sentinels, enormous robotic weapons that can detect a mutant gene and zero in on that person. In the 21st century, the Sentinels have evolved into highly efficient killing machines. With mutants now facing extinction, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) volunteers to go back in time and rally the X-Men of the past to help change a pivotal moment in history and thereby save their future.",

            "content": "Brilliant film, the only one of the X-Men franchise to so far give me goose bumps throughout. Everything is just so satisfying, so cohesive and gosh Magneto is as badass as he has ever been. Despite there being a few innocuous concerns I have with some aspects of the script, it would be nitty picking to the extreme to point them out. The stakes feel as grand as ever yet it comes off as a very rounded film. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "X Men Days of Future Past is my favorite movie in the franchise if not the best of the saga. The premise is not original but the way it is staged is spectacular when dramatic. The film begins with the immediate death of very powerful mutants and then continues with the real beginning of the plot or return (not physically) to the past to prevent the creation of the Sentinel Project. The atmosphere is centered and the photography adapts well to sunny tones in the past and dark tones in the future. As usual the soundtrack takes your breath away and adjusts properly to the tone of the film. The narration and the editing are well structured and realized, with a clear and flowing alternation between the sequences of the past and those of the future. The characters have an incredible characterization: the young Xavier who a man totally different from what we knew because he walks, is no longer hopeful and isolated but thanks to Logan he becomes Professor X again. The young Magneto has the same characterization he had in X Men First Class but more expanded and ultimately makes a spectacular speech. Raven, who is the centerpiece of the story, has an extraordinary evolution. The character of Bolivar Trask is very well written, he is man who, despite having done cruel and brutal actions, just wanted to make the world a better place without knowing that he would have created the villains of the film that is the Sentinells. They are perfect machines that adapt to every mutant they encounter and, having no conscience, they kill their targets without mercy. In fact, there are various tear-jerking scenes where these robots kill many mutants including the ones we love. The ending is something amazing and exciting without adding anything else. So X Men Days of Future Past is a profound, complete film that can also be watched as a film in itself for those who have not followed the saga since in the film they make a good summary of everything.",

Hugh Jackman also is great as Logan the Wolverine, and Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as Raven/Mystique. She was not yet 25 when she filmed this, and that makes her performance all the more remarkable. This was the first time I saw Peter Dinklage performing, and he's also great as Trask.

The story and plot feel unique, the villain(s) are all done very well, and the action sequences are terrific to watch. The acting from some characters is great, however, on the flip side, other characters have very poor and unconvincing acting. The CGI also feels overdone, and it can sometimes feel a bit meh. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the movie and it stands as one of the better X-Men movies in my opinion.",

            "content": "A hopeful and resonant finale to the X-Men story.\n\nDirector Bryan Singer's superhero sci-fi adventure X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) brings Chris Claremont's time travel comic book to life with a resplendent optimism for our future with a moving finale that effectively and emotionally concludes Singer's version of The X-Men on the silver screen. I appreciate the theme of people being able to change and that we choose our own path to walk down in life as nothing is set in stone. Singer completely understands these mutant characters to their heart.\n\nIt's really poignant seeing all these beloved comic book characters fighting for their mutant lives as Days of Future Past speaks for human equality, peace, diplomacy, kindness, patience, progress, tolerance, and acceptance. Writers Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman really write character arcs we can get invested in and think of satisfying conclusions for everyone. We all change and grow in our brief, yet unique lives. I hated Days of Future Past when I first saw it after loving First Class. However, now Days of Future Past finally touched me and was thoroughly enjoyable and thoughtful after revisiting it. Who knows what the future will bring for humanity as all we can do is live our lives appreciating the ones we love around us, choosing to be nicer everyday.\n\nHugh Jackman finds inner peace as Logan once more with several emotionally compelling conversations with Charles Xavier, including Days of Future Past's remarkable final scene. Jackman gives some of his most thoughtful acting here as the ferocious Wolverine and reflective Logan. Hugh Jackman has carried The X-Men franchise into something worth watching and he gives them a purpose and course correction with Days of Future Past's retcons and revisionist history. Patrick Stewart keeps the heart of Charles Xavier pure and driven towards his mission of uniting all mutants through understanding, hope, and patience. I love his tender and kind Professor X. Ian McKellen is again magnificent as Magneto as he conjures up his superpowers to wield metal like bullets and crash ships together. His very presence has real gravitas as the sinister and complex Magneto.\n\nJames McAvoy is gripping as the devastated and deterred Charles Xavier at his low point. It's wonderful seeing Hugh Jackman's Logan encourage and reassure McAvoy's moving Professor X to find and house mutants and form The X-Men as his life is worthwhile. McAvoy is incredibly vulnerable and sensitive here to every little nuance of Xavier's insecurities, failings, and hopes for a safe future for all of humanity and mutants alike. Michael Fassbender is fearsome as Magneto with that uniquely commanding edge and steadfast ideal that he is doing what is best for mutants.\n\nJennifer Lawrence makes you believe in Mystique shapeshifting abilities and her hurt feelings that she is doing what is right in her own way. Lawrence gives a fantastic dramatic performance full of conviction. Nicholas Hoult is cool as Beast, but best as Hank McCoy supporting Charles' endeavors. Halle Berry's storm gets some serious action sequences alongside Magneto of all people. I love Ellen Page's performance as the hurting and focused Kitty Pryde as we get to see her vanish through walls and travel through time. Page should have been given an entire movie about Kitty Pryde. I hope Elliot Page continues to get roles now that he's out and proud. Anna Paquin gets a cute cameo as Rogue that really got me emotional. She was the heart and soul of the first X-Men movie.\n\nPeter Dinklage is fabulous as the crazed and hateful scientist Trask, who wants Mystique's DNA to create mutant killing robots. He's very interesting in each of his scenes. Evan Peters steals his scenes as the hilarious and hyper speed sprinting mutant Quicksilver. Josh Helman is pretty intimidating as William Styker. He lets you see how warped Trask's speeches and ideology made Stryker. Shawn Ashmore is as cool and nice a hero as ever as Bobby Drake or Iceman. Omar Sy is neat as Bishop and Daniel Cudmore is killer as the mighty Colossus. I really loved Fan Bingbing as Blink with her dimension opening mutant superpowers and expressive face.\n\nFamke Janssen, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, and Lucas Till's cameos are appreciated as they're really affecting in their brief appearances. Michael Lerner, Chris Claremont, and Len Wein are fun cameos as the skeptical senators Dinklage must present his robot idea to before Congress.\n\nEditor John Ottman gets you engaged with his sharp and fast cuts for a breezy 132 minutes. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel continues his amazing and touching close-up shots with ambitious wide shots for all the displays of awesome mutant powers. John Myhre's production design is cool for the 1970's Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters and recreates The White House. \n\nThe visual effects artists' CGI for Xavier's mind powers, Magneto's creative lethal uses of metal, Blink's portals, and Kitty Pryde's time travel and wall phasing are excellent. Composer John Ottman's score is melancholic and rousing with splendid melodies again for Days of Future Past. Loved the flamboyant costume changes and believable make-up work.\n\nIn all, Days of Future Past holds up to the passage of time with an emotionally gripping narrative.",

For one, it's still got that uncomfortable Bryan Singer length.  By the 1 \u00bd mark, I was about ready to check out.  For an over 2 hour movie, that's a problem.  It pulled me back in, but pacing has always been an issue for him.  That's probably the films biggest problem because otherwise, it really works.  The action is great, the themes are great, the characters are great, and there are just some stellar moments here.  Seeing McAvoy and Stewart share a scene together still gives me chills.

This film is solid and probably underrated featuring great direction, a great story and a large cast that unites the original x men trilogy cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Hugh Jackman, Halley Berry with the prequel cast of James Mccavoy. Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hault. All the performances are great notably a delightfully funny and witty small appearance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, James McAvoys tortured performance as young xavier, and Michael Fassbenders almost superior interpretation of a young magneto rivaling  the charismatic Mcckellen. The movie sends Jackmans wolverine back to the past to meet with young xavier played Mccavoy to stop a future apocalypse. This movie is fun as it brillianly goes back to the past and present weaving between the two separate casts and trilogies in an epic way. Jackman is great with the prequel cast serving as the bridge between the two franchises. The movie has its weaknesses as the story can be devoid of logic and a lot of plot holes created by previous entries. Yet it features great drama, and lots of action that turn this movie into a superhero epic. Easily one of the best in the franchise.",

Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, \"wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!\" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault.\n\nX-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique.\n\nBolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame.\n\nAnd when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2.\n\nNormally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.",

The talented Vaughan brought together his first-class ensemble, including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence, and created a very successful prequel for the original and beloved trilogy, whose third film and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, After him, many admirers disappointed. This introductory film presented the events that led to the rivalry between Professor X and his old friend Magneto - and he did it in a wonderful and refreshing way. Three years passed, including another film about \"Wolverine\" - and here we came to the sequel to the successful Freeport.\nBut it's really not a regular sequel. \"The Future That Was,\" continues both the old trilogy and the \"beginning,\" and even tries to create continuity to last year's Wolverine. The result - a salad. The film tries to be a continuation of three different films and in a way that ignores the doubt, or does it deliberately - does not attach much importance to the events of one of them. Still, as a film in itself, the plot flows and flows.\n\nAnd time in the film flies. What is Tess? You understand. After a brief opening and an action-packed exposition that will help us understand roughly where we stand right now amid all the chaos created by the various X-Men films, another action comes. And it's enjoyable. So fun, like playing a part ninja if you're Wolverine. The footage of the action in the film is wonderful, very staged and highly varied. Once Wolverine, for a moment Magneto and then portals and in the second Storm and fire bursting out of work and explosions and flying bullets. Sometimes chaotic and sometimes meticulous. Always a feast for the eyes.\n\"Days of the Future Past\" is the first swallow, among many that will come to us in the coming summer months. And it's a beautiful swallow. Her flight is clean and high and her voice is delightful and pleasant to every ear. She's a bit off the road and she does not really know where she's going, but seriously, who cares. The plot of the film as an individual - sweeping and consistent. The action is excellent, the dialogues are intelligent. The film is endlessly enjoyable and captures the viewer tightly - and that is mainly what matters.",

A captivating scene is Quicksilver's dash through the kitchen, with water droplets still floating in the air. They took an interesting take on how a person with super human speed interacts with the world. Let's not forget the dramatic sound cut into music when he puts on the headphones too (truly remarkable). Since this was a story dealing with time travel between the aftermath of classic X-Men and X-Men: Origins, there are very plenty Marvel Easter eggs strewn about. Although the conflict is insurmountable, there are a few story points in the movie that don't add up or highly invested into without much interest in return.

This movie was something I'd been waiting for from the moment I heard about it. It is plucked directly out of my childhood and seems surreal to see onscreen. I have an emotional attachment to this story. However, when I saw the first trailers, I was immensely disappointed. It did NOT look good. Well, considering the Godzilla trailers DID look good and it was a steaming pile of lizard dung, looks can clearly be deceiving. XMen DOFP is a masterpiece. Singer eradicated the ridiculous Ratner movie, cleaned up some loose ends from other films, introduced the most exciting new character, Quicksilver, and even alluded to him being the son of Magneto, as he is in the comics. I was concerned about another Wolverine-focused picture, but it worked. Very well. In fact, it was just as much a Professor X and Magneto movie, which is great considering that Michael Fassbender is a PERFECT Magneto. Cold, emotionless and focused on his mission. He has personified Magneto more than Ian McKellen ever could. I always thought they went way too old for that role and Fassbender fixes that. The complexity of the time traveling is not without its holes (like every time-traveling story), but the portrayal of the Sentinels, Trask, Stryker and Chris Claremont/John Byrne's original dystopian future was modernized as perfectly as can be. Just amazing in every way, especially if you're an XMen fan.",

It's just sad to see that it's Wolverine who is going back in time and not Kitty Pryde. It would've been a perfect opportunity to give her a bigger role here. But it still works. Hugh Jackman has great chemistry with Michael Fassbenders Magneto and James McAvoys Charles Xavier. Also big parts for Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique (here way better than in First Class), Nicholas Hoult as Beast and a small but scene stealing moment for this incarnation of Quicksilver played by Evan Peters (and by Aaron Johnson in The Avengers: Age of Ultron). It's a fun ride. It's a time travel movie well made. It's handling a lot of characters very well. It's entertaining from start to finish.",

Logan (Hugh Jackman) steals every scene he's in, he's just such a memorable character. I love how the movie also hints back to X-Men: First Class and the original X-Men trilogy.

            "content": "\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is a much more grounded, well-balanced installment for Fox.\n\nThe ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The beloved characters from the original \"X-Men\" film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from the past, \"X-Men: First Class,\" in order to change a major historical event and fight in an epic battle that could save our future.\n\nComing off \"X-Men: First Class\", this was certainly an entirely different shift. Having already watched it once and continually watching the brutal fight scenes over and over, I finally got to sit down and re-watch the whole thing again. And while it wasn't as good as I remember it being, it's still a really solid, fun, and dark superhero film that we don't get to see too often these days. \n\nOne thing that's fantastic about this film is just the sheer brutality and darkness of this movie. This, along with the future release of \"Logan\", are both examples of superhero films that are a lot more dark and brutal, but are still really fun. The fight scenes in this film looked beautiful but they were simultaneously so terrifying. The action was absolutely brutal and they didn't hold back on much. I thought that they really took advantage of the time-travel plot here, allowing them to push the limits of character fates and what they could do with them. I thought that was easily one of the best aspects of this film and it stands out from a lot of superhero films. \n\nAnother thing that was good but I'm still conflicted about was the story. I thought the story was really interesting and thought out here but it really throws a kink in the entire universe. What this film essentially does is it makes almost every other X-Men film non-canon. That's pretty crazy and a curious decision if I say so myself. I mean, some things stay relatively the same but for the most part, the story changes things forever. And that's the thing with time travel. Time travel is so interesting but it creates so many different holes and questions. However, for the most part, I actually thought that they did a pretty good with their execution here and the story was still really captivating. \n\nI guess the thing I was mostly questionable on was making Magneto one of the prime villains. I understand based on his character and mindset that he would become a prime antagonist in this film, but it felt like more an annoyance than a benefit for us. When I say benefit, I guess I mean entertaining or sensible. Either way, I thought his portrayal of his character, along with everyone else's portrayal, were all really solid. Everyone, from James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Patrick Stewart, and everyone else, were all fantastic. It was cool to see two different periods of X-Men (Past and Present versions) on the screen at the same time. It was really fun and these are some of the best performances I've seen from some of these people in the entire franchise. \n\nIn the end, this was certainly a fun and dark film. It's one of the better X-Men films in the franchise, if not the second best entirely.",

I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.\n\nIt's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.\n\nYet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters - but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot - and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). \n\nWhat really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations - at least as far as I'm concerned - is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists - what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).\n\nSo my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.\n\nTo be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana - this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.\n\nFlash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known - led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) - are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) - several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class - and get them to change the future before it can happen.\n\nSounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.\n\nWhat's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.\n\nIn Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.\n\nWith such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many - though not all - of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.\n\nBut Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix - particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.\n\nBut, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.\n\nMost remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:\n\nFans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.\n\nThe actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.\n\nIt has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Well, the days are past when we can see X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) I predict that in the immediate future, we ll review this movie. Let s begin.\n\nGREG: Our story begins in the not-too-distant future where robots with amazing morphing capabilities (Sentinels) are hunting the X-Men to extinction. Young Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) is able to send messages into the past by mind-melding with another X-Man. She is visited by Professor X, Magneto, and Wolverine (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman) who want her to send Wolverine s consciousness back in time to 1973 where he must convince young Charles Xavier and Max Eisenhardt (Professor X and Magneto) to team up and change the dystopian future that awaits them if they cannot prevent mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the inventor of the Sentinels, Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage).\n\nSCOTT: Wolverine goes back to 1973 and convinces a young, broken Xavier to stop Mystique from killing Trask. Wolverine enlists the aid of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), whose super-speed enables them to free Magneto from a prison cell beneath the Pentagon in Washington. In Paris, where American and Vietnamese representatives are negotiating the end of the war, Mystique attempts to assassinate Trask but her plan is thwarted. Magneto decides that killing Mystique is the only way to foil her plan, complicating Wolverine and Xavier s mission. When President Nixon approves the Sentinel program, all hell breaks loose as the X-Men try to stop Mystique while battling Trask, the Sentinels, and Magneto himself.\n\nGREG: Scott, Marvel does it again. This is a story full of action, suspense, and thrills. Nobody creates a complete story the way Marvel studios does. There are at least a dozen stars, although the story centers around Wolverine and the young Charles and Magneto. There isn t a wasted moment both in terms of the plot or in the on-screen action. This is a complete win in terms of both story and special effects. There are plenty of heroes to choose from here. In the future, all of the remaining X-Men are battling to save their world. In the past, Charles is the one with the most transforming to undergo. And undergo it he does. We see him start out as a beaten man, taking drugs to make his legs work, which also dulls his mental powers. Wolverine is all action and no growth (which is the mold he filled in last year s The Wolverine). And we look for growth in Max/Magneto but he falls into his old patterns and devolves into a villain again.\n\nSCOTT: You nailed it, Greg. Marvel is on a roll this summer with yet another rich, dense, and ambitious story of super-heroism and super-villainy. Like Spider-Man 2, which we reviewed recently, X-Men: Days of Future Past has many characters, but not too many; it has a complicated plot, but not too complicated; and it conveys messages about life and virtue that resonate with us all. Almost without exception, the characters in this movie attract and maintain our interest. They show depth and nuance, and they behave in surprising ways. They also delight us with their quirky, memorable inner qualities and behavior. We have an ensemble hero cast, with Wolverine and Professor Xavier serving as the main hero duo within the ensemble. In any good story, the hero undergoes a transformation, and as you note, Greg, Wolverine doesn t change much in this movie. But Xavier is radically transformed. During the flashback to 1973, Xavier is a lost soul, bitter about the toll that the Vietnam War has taken on his school and also resentful about having to choose between the loss of his legs or the loss of his mental powers. With help from Wolverine, Xavier grows to see beyond his disability, deciding to sacrifice the use of his legs so that he can access his superior mental abilities which will help defeat Trask and the Sentinels.\n\nGREG: There are villains a-plenty here as well. Mystique walks the line as she stalks Trask with murder on her mind. But she s stopped at the last minute. We get to the end of the story and she appears to turn to the side of good, but it is a bit ambiguous where she goes from there. We see the familiar  brother  pattern that we saw in Spider-Man 2 - two close friends start out with a common cause but are separated by ideology by the end of the story. Xavier and Magneto work together at first, but Magneto ultimately returns to his diabolical ways. He s certain that the only way forward is a war between mutants and humans, and as a result, he becomes the opposition force in the end.  Then there s the overlord villain in the form of Trask. This villain is bent on the destruction of anyone who doesn t fit his idea of  pure  and will do whatever it takes to kill off every mutant. His lack of selflessness and caring make him the typical evil villain.\n\nSCOTT: For me, the primary villain here is Trask. He s an interesting villain in that his motives aren t entirely evil. Trast genuinely wants to protect the world but he overestimates the threat that the mutants pose and cannot entertain the possibility of living in a world where mutants and non-mutants can co-exist. This is a common shortcoming of villains. They see divisions between people, and often exaggerate those divisions, whereas heroes seek cooperative unity between people. One other note about Trask - he is a dwarf, which in a way is an unfortunate choice as it suggests that villainy and physical deviance are somehow connected. But it s also not uncommon in fables and mythic tales for villains to be physically different from the norm. If nothing else, Marvel makes movies that resonate with ancient storytelling. The Sentinels are a formidable foe, showing an invincibility against the X-Men s powers. Again, this movie invokes a common pattern in storytelling by showing us a main villain, Trask, who enlists the aid of a monolithic herd of henchmen, and in this case they are diabolical, technologically sophisticated instruments of evil.\n\nGREG: I thoroughly enjoyed myself at X-Men: Days of Future Past. The story was well-told (although a bit thin in places) and there weren t too many plot holes. The special effects were seamless and abundant, but always in support of the story. The characters were rich and colorful - literally. I really can t find fault with any aspect of the presentation and so I award the film 5 out of 5 Reels. The heroes were many and varied. There were the war-weary heroes of the future and the innocent verging on naive heroes of the past. While Wolverine doesn t grow much, it is Charles Xavier who overcomes his inner demons and shows us a transformation worth the price of admission. I give them all 4 out of 5 Heroes. In classic Marvel fashion, the villains were as potent as the heroes. This gives our heroes something to work against. The powerful Trask and his high-tech Sentinels were an oppressive force to be reckoned with. And Magneto started out as an ally kept true to his wicked self and turned into the villain he needs to be for the X-Men universe to maintain some sense of conflict and tension. I give them 4 out of 5 Villains. Movie: Villains:  Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Once again, Marvel constructs a movie that is deliciously meaty and doesn t insult its audience s intelligence at all. Anyone who enjoys superhero movies should thoroughly enjoy X-Men: Days of Future Past. Besides delighting us with great characters and a juicy plot, the movie gives us several thoughtful take-home messages, the main one focusing on the role of adversity in shaping our destiny and character. This wisdom is far from original but it is used effectively to help young Xavier transform himself. This film is a terrific two-hours spent in the theater, and I award it 4 Reels out of 5. As I ve noted, the hero duo of Wolverine and Xavier truly shines, as we not only witness the transformation of Xavier but also the transformation of their friendship. All of these characters are complex, including those of a couple of the X-Men (Magneto and Mystique) who defy simple categorization of good or evil. This ensemble is impressive and the duo within it shines. I m happy to award them all 4 out of 5 Heroes. You re right on target about the villains, Greg. Trask, the Sentinels, Magneto, and Mystique are all either fully villainous or show streaks of villainy. Another oppositional force that Xavier must contend with is his own inner demons. The Marvel universe works so well on so many levels, including the interpersonal and intrapersonal levels. The villains here are all great fun and make us think, too, which is great praise for any movie. I give them 4 out of 5 Villains. Movie: Villains:  Heroes:",

It hammers home the similarities and differences in their performances. Ditto for Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen (Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto). Time travel plots can be tricky, but this movie handles it well. They never get too confusing with explaining it all and the movie never slows down because of it. It is extremely well paced. The action scenes throughout are exciting and I want to show love to the effects team. Pretty much everything comes across looking very good. Hugh Jackman (Logan/Wolverine) gives one of his best performances in the series, while Jennifer Lawrence (Raven/Mystique) and Peter Dinklage (Bolivar Trask) do well. Evan Peters (Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver) steals the show in his small role. He\u00e2(TM)s clearly having a ton of fun in the role and the character is used to a much better effect than in the MCU. This is one of the stronger superhero movies around and probably the third best in this franchise behind Logan and First Class.\n\nWeaknesses: The movie does get messy in the end. There\u00e2(TM)s a plot point that it ends on involving Wolverine in the 1970s that honestly makes no sense. It leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth when it\u00e2(TM)s all said and done. Considering the scope of the source material, some of this does feel rushed. It could\u00e2(TM)ve honestly covered about two films. \n\nOverall: This movie expertly balances its two timelines by giving more focus to the more important one. It\u00e2(TM)s a simple formula that works to make this a standout superhero movie.",

This movie's so good that it makes X2 and First Class, which were given highly positive reviews more than the first film, look like the Batman movies directed by Joel Schumacher. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit there, but this one is very enjoyable since cast members old and new unite with Hugh Jackman being the link that ties them all together. This fast-paced (I didn't know 2-hour-long films could do that) superhero flick may just perhaps serve as the film that holds the achievement of funniest moment during an action set piece. Anyone who saw the film will have a good chance of knowing who I'm indirectly(?) referring to. You did good, Bryan Singer, you did good.",

Indubitably it will reward multiple viewings, as it is loaded with endless subplots for devotees to flesh out.  It doesn't hurt when the main plot device allows for the perceived deaths of several major characters.  And the introduction of the character Quicksilver culminates in a CGI masterpiece for the ages.....worth the price of admission all alone.  Kudos to the writers & director for accomplishing the rarest of feats........a 5th installment of a series that is actually actually good, and perhaps the best of all.  A stellar cast too, with a particular tip of the hat to James McAvoy's humanist turn as a young Charles Xavier, and Peter Dinklage at his smarmy best.",

It's really because they're tested so much, even beyond the realms of feasable possibility, that you get to see them at their lowest points and understand their arcs seeing them at each end. However, there's no doubting it could have easily felt extremelly bizzare and out of place, but great performances and a comedic edge make for something that just feels so right. The fresh story also allows for the exploration of some new themes for the franchise too, and having Bryan Singer back to direct means the smarter edge is back with the cheesiness and smile it's surface-level meaning requires.\nWHAT I DIDN'T: Much like where First Class is concerned, the actual writing is fairly weak, and whilst the longer run-time makes for a better exploration, I can't help feeling the big-moment to big-moment effect hinders the experience slightly.\nVERDICT: This is a unique, fun and character driven entry to the X-Men series that's right up there with the best. Sequels are needed at all ends of this bizzare scale now, and for once I'm craving them like mad.",

Giant robots were created to hunt down and kill all the perverse people...resulting in the robots killing everyone. In a last-ditch plan, Charles and Eric send Logan (aka Wolverine) back in time to find their younger selves and prevent the assassination of Trask, designer of the robots (and a secretly repressed homosexual)-whose death supposedly set off a huge wave of anti-gay-ism.\n\n...Logan finds the young Charles in a hopelessly emo state; he hasn't gotten over Eric's \"abandonment\" of him in favour of Mystique. His only companion is Hank (aka Beast), who can never truly be a substitute for the much handsomer Eric. Nevertheless, Logan convinces Charles to work with him to prevent a future where gays are not tolerated. Together (with the help of Eric's bastard son, Peter-whose superpowers presumably include accelerating ageing), they break Magneto out of \"the most secure prison on the planet\" (even though its walls are plastic and all the guards use plastic weapons.)\n\nThey then get on a plane to stop Mystique, the would-be assassin. While onboard, Charles and Eric get into a violent tiff-each accusing the other of abandonment-but eventually make up, and enjoy a passionate round of mutual stimulation (via chess.) At this point, Eric decides it's Charles that he loves after all, and he resolves therefore to eliminate Mystique from the picture. He fails and she escapes.\n\n...Eric penetrates the orifices of the robots' bodies with steel bars and somehow-although it's not quite clear how-this enables him to activate and control the robots. He gatecrashes an event where the President of the USA is about to unveil the robots to the world-and drops a stadium around the place because damn, that must look cool. He makes a speech about how people are homophobic, but actually it's right to be so because homos ARE scary. To demonstrate how scary they can be, he will kill the President in front of international TV. Charles, Logan, and Hank try but fail to stop him. Finally, Mystique shoots and defeats him with a plastic gun she must have kept hidden in her ass all this while. Eric emotionally blackmails Charles into letting him go.\n\n...Logan wakes up in the new reality. He sees Jean (aka Phoenix) leaning seductively in a doorway and is about to molest her when Scott (aka Cyclops) jumps out of nowhere and cock-blocks him. The end (more or less.)\n\n--------------\n\nBest char/actor: Jennifer Lawrence (+stunt double) as Mystique. Her acrobatic fighting style is cool; certainly better than Wolverine waving his fists around.\n\nWorst char/actor: James McAvoy as young Charles. I can't stand his British accent...it just seems so out of place.\n\nBest moment: The prison-break scene, where Quicksilver does his thing and steals the entire show.\n\nWorst moment: The bonus scene at the very end of the very long credits (they must have listed every single employee of the 500 VFX companies that worked on this.) It's a very short one and totally not worth your time waiting for it.",

Thankfully, in such a huge cast no one is really overshadowed and everyone plays their part well, something else that Apocalypse really should have done. The razor sharp bleakness of the future corresponds ridiculously well with Singer's dreamy and familiar vision of the past. It follows alot of the same tropes at the same time however, but they are all presented different enough that they are new and exciting but obvious enough that they are surpass a hint and become homage. Magneto's catastrophic display of destruction, themes of segregation and genetic seclusion, politics and a seemingly indestructible enemy.

It showed Stryker taking him away for the adimantium proceedings. Wasn't Wolverine awake that whole time?

Talking about a plot that good there's no way it could be translated onto the big screen as a flop. It is one of the films which makes you sitting on the edge of the seat as things went bleaker and bleaker, and during the course you can't help but ask yourself,\"How is it gonna play off? How can the ending be satisfying while being realistic?\" It did a fantastic job in stirring such a thought in the audience's minds. Besides, Quicksilver's Time in a Bottle scene is cinematic gold. What a highlight!\n\nHey and who can forget magnificent acting of James McAvory and Michael Fassbender? Fassbender is very good as Magneto, but it was Xavier's acting that I love the most. So great in facial expressions and strong in conveying emotions. Along with all the amazing ensemble cast alongside the two, X men might have amassed one of the strongest actors/actress ever for a movie franchise.\n\n10/10? Well there was a problem there. Why so few scenes with Quicksilver?? Those scenes with him on it are so cool, yet his screen time occupied just a small chunk in the first half. Besides there were several mutants Raven rescued during the earlier parts of the film. All of these characters suddenly showed up in the climax and it seemed to remind me of some bit of an imbalance of structure, as if there was still a lot of potential yet to be developed. Since it has no intentions to answer it, and neither will X Men Apocalypse, this remains a barrier between Days Of Future Past and perfection.\n\nI'd love to see more films that displays the same script quality as in X Men DOFP",

            "content": "In the realm of super heroes, Marvel's X-Men have been arguably the most successful with six films to their name so far. It's been a long wait for Days of Future Past but the enticing recipe of the entire ensemble cast led by Bryan Singer has paid off in spades.\n\nBased on the 1981 comic, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand, The Wolverine and X-Men First Class simultaneously and opens in a very grim future. Both mankind and mutants are on the ropes as the deadly and almost indestructible sentinel robots hunt them down at every turn. After some consideration, Kitty Pryde/ShadowCat (Ellen Page) sends Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time in a desperate bid to reverse the construction of the sentinels and ultimately save the future. On his mission, Wolverine comes across the young Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). The film flashes between past and present and with a great deal of consequences on the line, X-Men: Days of Future Past launches into a globe-trotting adventure filled with pulse-pounding action, heartfelt emotion and some mild comedy. From the break-out of Magneto at the Pentagon to the intense final battle outside the White House, every scene is worthwhile, memorable and contributes in its own way to the plot. It's one of the few modern superhero movies in recent memory that gave me chills in its final moments, something which was made even more impactful having watched the older films. My one gripe in an otherwise gripping plot is the future element; it has some real potential for future films, but because the film is set mostly in 1973 this setting can only develop slightly. Yet despite this issue, Days of Future Past offers a plot which manages to juggle healthy doses of action and emotion as well as link in to previous films very well.\n\nWith an enormous ensemble cast present that is even bigger than 2012's The Avengers, it's hard to believe that X-Men: Days of Future Past would be able to handle them all effectively but by placing on focus on 1973, the characters that get the most screen time are thoroughly developed whilst the future setting featuring characters such as Storm (Halle Berry) and newcomers Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Fan Bingbing) plays host to action sequences that provide some eye-popping special effects. Other new characters also make an impression; Peter Dinklage as Bolliver Trask isn't your usual scheming antagonist who hates mutants, rather he admires their abilities and hopes to use them as a catalyst for his sentinel plan and QuickSilver (Evan Peters) is so laid back and casual in his mannerisms that he's instantly likeable for the time he's on-screen. The greatest strength of the cast though is many of the characters have some sort of internal conflict which makes the audience care about their fates. Charles Xavier and Hank Mcoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) actually resent their powers at first, taking medication to suppress their abilities, Magneto swings back and forth between his friendship with Charles and his unending hatred for humanity and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) cannot decide between taking revenge for the death of her friends and carving out a better image for mutants in the eyes of humanity. These struggles make the impending future that much more imperative to prevent and the plot more engrossing throughout.\n\nThe X-Men series has always shown off some brilliant special effects and this entry is no different; the future setting in particular plays host to dazzling lighting, thunderous powers and a gloomy atmosphere that emphasises the bleakness of the dystopian world. This is contrasted with the ordinary world of 1973, which is thrown into disarray with mutant intervention. Where First Class reached its climax with a massive naval battle, Days of Future Past brings on some gargantuan destruction effects on par with Magneto's bending of the Golden Gate Bridge in 2006's The Last Stand. The cinematography reflects this scale, panning out to see the destruction taking place; this also applies to the combat sequences, giving a clear view without devolving into shaky moments. The music is both sombre and emotional, perfectly reflecting the sense of impending doom that threatens the world of man and mutant. X-Men: Days of Future Past pushes the main series forward just as well for technicals as it does for plot and characterisation.\n\nNever before have I seen a superhero movie as meticulously crafted as X-Men Days of Future Past; it seamlessly blends brilliant special effects, emotive and detailed acting performances and an intelligent plot, weaving them all into real world events. It's the best film in the X-Men series and a grand achievement for Bryan Singer and company.",

This might also be seen as Bryan Singer's atonement piece to the franchise after leaving it after the first two films, and reclaiming the franchise's former glory intersecting the timeline of 'First Class'. Then again, the quality of this film surpassed all my expectations, both theatrically and the Director/Rogue Cut, it's probably the best film the franchise has on offer to date. The film ambitious scale is kept intact as are it's incredibly talented cast of incredibly performed actors of well written characters, that have kept this film series very consistent to date. Add to that, the multiple narrative structure and plot threads are a marvel to behold upon the film's story. Whether or not the upcoming, 'Apocalypse' can match up to, if not getting close to surpassing the quality of this film, we'll just have to see for ourselves to find out (for the most part).",

It has Ellen Page's mutant sending Wolverine back in time, which I don't remember her being able to do in the last one, so she must have developed another mutation in addition to the ability to be able to walk through things. What was even more confusing was that it was Magneto and Xavier who set this up. As far as I remember Xavier had a nasty accident a couple of films ago that meant that he shouldn't be in this film but there he was and no explanation was given; perhaps Ellen Page sent someone back to prevent this accident and we just take that as given due to her new talents. So either this is the case, or I missed something, or the makers of these films know full well that, after a while, they all blend into a little dull memory and so there really isn't any risk in making a few continuity errors.",

This film had me emotionally invested with the story and characters and it was awesome!\n\nPositives; Everyone from the previous films are of course awesome especially Wolverine who surprisingly is more subdued in this film than he previously was in the other installments. This film erases the problems of X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Their stories aren't really canon anymore so if you ever plan on binge watching all the X-Men films you can definitely skip them. The story with the sentinels was interesting and the fact they have to use time travel to prevent those events from happening was riveting! \n\nThe action of course is awesome, I was on the edge of my seat during the finale! This film brings back some nostalgia, literally they go back in time and it really handles the timeline well, cause there are scenes where the action is filmed on a crappy 70's type camera and it gives this realism to the film.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention that Quicksilver is absolutely awesome in this film! That scene where he has to move the bullets and take down the baddies was hilarious and awesome! By far one of the best comic book movie moments!\n\nI can't think of a single negative, this film does everything right in my opinion! X-Men: Days of Future Past in my opinion is by far the best X-Men film I've ever seen and you definitely got to check it out if you haven't. It's only competition I can think of is X-Men 2 and this film exceeds it!",

I enjoyed how the film showcases many additional, classic X-Men and how they coordinate their powers as a team to fight their common enemy. This is a dramatic film with serious themes involving betrayal, addiction, grief and genocide but, at its heart, bears a message of hope and seeking the good in others. \n\nWhile still a solid film, several scenes feel artificially dramatic and contrived, causing them to seem forced and unnatural. I also feel that the ending falls a bit flat. I give Days of Future Past a 7/10. \n\nIn case you're interested, Days of Future Past has a post-credits scene.\n\nFor more reviews, SUBSCRIBE to the CinemaCommander YouTube channel here - https://youtu.be/s6SKkRWtTms\n\nFOLLOW US: \n        -Website: http://www.cinemacommander.com/\n        -YouTube Channel: https://youtu.be/s6SKkRWtTms\n        -Facebook: http://ow.ly/XPB6x\n        -Twitter: http://ow.ly/XPBbK",

It captures the darkness of the future AND past perfectly and we feel with the mutants who are almost completely extincted. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine for the seventh time, and this is by far his best performance as the Canadian mutant; he nails it and once again proves why he is the best for the job. It's always a pleasure to see the O.G.'s back in action, while it's more than great to see the new talented youngsters they got to play the past versions of all our favorite characters. Peter Dinklage is perfect as the villain and not once in the entire movie does his size take away from the presence and threatening personality that his character possesses.

This film is viscerally relentless in spectacular fight scenes and moments of pure speculation on our characters which weaves beautifully and brutally into the chaotic future it so holds. However, I do not prefer this one over first class. That is unprecedented in my personal opinion. The main issue being in it's subtlety. There are a few sequences which seem to pile on explanation as 'would you believe I'm from the future?' with a comedic moment. Although in some scenarios, it is well done. A moment that works especially well is the one on one with Xavier and Xavier, and from a conclusive standpoint, it works artfully well. For me, X-men days of future past is not as fantastic as First Class, and in some ways lacks massively. But as a symbolic resolution, this is impressively fun and presents a relevant moral message that we can all follow, and even has the guts to make it conspicuous in it's development whilst proving that there are no true lefts or rights to each character, much like mutants, we are a complex mesh. A minority, and by showing each other the right way and instead of destroying each other, a peaceful end may come.",

McAvoy and Fassbender lead the charge for sure, with Jennifer Lawrence also doing a great job. For a film with an actually pretty complicated time travel plot with lots of characters, it was very well balanced and pushes the characters forward very well (while teasing for what's to come - STAY AFTER THE CREDITS). only thing is for people unfamiliar with ALL THE X-MEN it's tough to keep everything straight and get what's happening and who is who, but that's really the whole thing with comic book films, isn't it? you gon' wanna catch this in the theatahs.",

            "content": "This review is being written in the past. You may end up reading this in 20 years. Hopefully, not because X-Men Days of Future Past is considered a classic but because humor never dies. Where to begin to talk about this movie is the question. Have you seen X-Men before? It's all the same right. (dodges level 5 lightning bolts from hardcore nerd fans). What makes this film different or attempts to be different is the idea that time is just....You've seen Back to The Future right? Combine that with the X-Men universe and you get this film. Minus Doc Brown sadly. \n\nThe movie takes some contractually obligated actors from the prior franchise films and some newcomers that nobody has any interest in and throws them in the middle of this movie. For the first part of it you are trying to catch up. You will be sitting in the theater thinking things like, What happened in Xmen 3? Is that now not real. Who is this white blonde hair kid? Why can the lady throw purple portals? What's up with the gun with the red eyes? And a whole host of other things. \n\nEven the on-screen presence of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Prof. X and Ian McKellen seem to be confused as why they are there. The last two hardly make a motion outside of the initial room they are in at the start of the movie. What a dream for an actor. In what amounts to spending only a few pages of dialog with the best actors. Just feels bland. They even seem sad or maybe they are trying to be in character. It's just sad watching them. They've done their part for king and country let them go make art films or act in theater plays. Maybe Patrick Stewart can re-boot a worthy Star Trek series again. Something that will help humanity more than another slugfest of a comic book movie. Nobody wants to watch these anymore. \n\nAt this point one can't comment on how well or poorly the movie is done. It's simply a matter of comparing it to the prior films. It's certainly more enjoyable and tries to have some heart that many of the other recent films have not. It does not have that sled being pulled of having to be an origin story. But we've come so far as an audience past those origins that this is what we are left with. A tale so generic and predictable that no right minded comic book editor would give it a green light not to mention being made into a film. It's such a bad movie that series hoarder of credits, Stan Lee refused to make a cameo in it. That's a tag line that should be on the poster. \n\nIt's enjoyable for a while. There are parts where you might cheer and other parts where you duck you heard in embarrassment. The high amount of dialog means this pop-corn movie is not very well buttered, so easy off on eating while watching it or you might miss some of the dialog because the action will leave you with a salty feeling in your mouth wanting more. O, so much more. \n\nIts movies like these that make theaters show the warnings not to text during the movie.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nAs I start this discussion, I have to admit that I may be biased - X-Men: Days of Future Past is not only my favorite superhero movie to date, it's probably my favorite movie after all three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (I'm still not convinced that I'll ever see a movie that I like as much as LOTR). There are several reasons for this, which I shall attempt to discuss coherently. I suppose I should first explain that the original X-Men trilogy was as formative a part of my teenage movie experience as the original Star Wars trilogy was for my childhood. Given, the X-Men series was never my #1 favorite like Star Wars was when I was a kid, but that's because LOTR came out around the same time as X-Men, and as I already acknowledged, nothing can ever beat LOTR.\n\nAll of this is to say that my love for this film probably is heavily influenced by nostalgia. In fact, the first bit of nostalgia that struck for me when watching this movie for the first time occurred within minutes of the opening of the movie. After a quick prologue with dark shots of the depressing world of the future narrated by Patrick Stewart (whose narration is in itself a throwback to previous X-Men movies), we dive straight into the opening titles. Nothing particularly special, right? Except for the fact that it is the EXACT SAME OPENING TITLE MUSIC FROM X2. I have (and had at that point as well) been saying for years that the most disappointing aspect of most superhero films today is that they lack a single heroic musical theme. Whether it's compared to John Williams' Superman theme (which is still my favorite superhero theme, and just may be my favorite Williams theme period) or Danny Elfman's iconic Batman and Spider-Man themes, we rarely have modern superhero films that have music that can match, and we certainly don't have superhero movies with opening titles sequences that utilize the theme to get you pumped about the upcoming movie.  And in the rare circumstance when a hero or group of heroes does have a recognizable theme, they are either barely used or not used at all in their subsequent films. X2 had the best music of the original trilogy (each film was scored by a different composer) and here was Days of Future Past bringing it back reinvigorated and in an awesome opening titles sequence. There I was in the theater, having seen hardly any of the movie, and I was already in love with it. To this day, any time I watch this movie, I always turn up my television's volume as loud as I can stand it just for this scene, as it still gets me excited about what I'm about to watch.\n\nThe amazing thing is that the movie maintains this level of excitement throughout the very next scene. I still think that the opening fight with the Sentinels is one of the best super-powered fight scenes in cinematic history. Here you see mostly new characters exhibiting some visually beautiful powers, as well as finally getting to see Iceman use his iconic ice-slide. And then, you one by one see most of them tragically die (can I just say how freaking awesome it is to see Warpath facing what he knows what will be his death armed only with a dagger and charging head-on toward the sentinel anyway?) Forget superhero movies, this is one of my favorite action scenes in any film, period. As in, I'm seriously considering stopping this post right now just so that I can watch it again. I'm not ashamed to admit that I've probably watched just the first 10 minutes of this movie dozens of times.\n\nMoving past the opening of the film, another one of my favorite scenes occurs when McAvoy's Xavier meets Stewart's Xavier. Let's just set aside the fact that we get to see these two phenomenal actors interact for a moment, and focus on the dialogue of the scene. Xavier's speech that includes the line \"just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever ... sometimes, we all need a little hope\" just might be the most, well, hopeful, speech in a movie since Samwise Gamgee reminded us that \"there is still some good left in this world ... and it's worth fighting for.\" I don't know how someone can watch this scene in the context of the film and not feel inspired to not only become a better person, but also to help loved ones who may be struggling. Additionally, John Ottman's score during this scene, while subtle, I also find to be just as memorable and moving as the main theme that he used for the opening titles and end credits. Entitled \"Hope (Xavier's Theme),\" I literally hear the opening notes of this piece of music in my head any time someone says the word \"hope.\" Can we also acknowledge what a throwback this is to one of the early scenes in the original X-Men film? When we see Xavier and Magneto on the screen for the first time in the original film, Magneto feels that Xavier is probing his mind, and he asks \"Whatever are you looking for?\" His response: \"I'm looking for hope.\" Throughout every film in the franchise, Xavier continues to hope, among many things, that Magneto can be redeemed. However, one of the main focuses of DOFP is Xavier's loss and regaining of hope for his future, as well as Raven's. And I feel that it explores both beautifully.\n\nThere is so much more that I could talk about with this film, but for the sake of attempted brevity, I will skip toward the end. Not only does the climactic battle have nearly as much amazing action as the opening scene, it also has a lot more emotional heft. Unlike the opening scene, when each of the characters were fairly confident they would live again via a changed timeline, here, the characters had nothing more than the hope (there's that motif again) that by sacrificing themselves, their friends might be able to save the day. Once again drawing a parallel to LOTR, this scene reminds me of the emotional beat at the battle at the very end of Return of the King. The remains of the army of Gondor and Rohan, led by Aragorn, are willing to sacrifice themselves to a horde of orcs that greatly outnumber them, all in the hopes that it will buy Frodo enough time destroy the Ring.\n\nAnd just like in Return of the King, where we get the joyfully happy endings of various Fellowship members reuniting with each other and the Hobbits returning to the Shire, we end this film seeing the characters that we know and love from the original trilogy not only alive, but also happy. It is of course especially moving to see both Scott and Jean, who both tragically died in The Last Stand, alive and together again. Perhaps this is the reason that I love this movie so much - I am a sucker for happy endings. And while this film may not be the ending of the X-Men franchise, it is the perfect ending to the original trilogy that started some 14 years before the release of this film. In a way, this movie was everything that I really wanted The Force Awakens to be that it wasn't - a reunion of my favorite characters not only being their awesome selves (I'm looking at you, Luke \"I'm only in this movie for 30 seconds\" Skywalker), but also getting the true happy ending they deserve. For most pieces of fiction, the ending is always my favorite entry. Whether it was Deathly Hallows (both the book and the movie), Return of the King, Return of the Jedi, or even Children of the Mind (the conclusion to the original Ender's Game book series), I am often a sucker for the final story that wraps everything up and puts a nice bow on it. And Days of Future Past can really be seen as the true ending to the original X-Men trilogy (while also continuing the new series that starting with First Class). What more could you want?\n\nFor more reviews, please visit mckoo.wordpress.com",

            "content": "The first X-Men was a good, fun, well-made start to the series, though with a yet-to-find-its-feet feel. That was found with X2, which turned out to be bigger, darker and even better. X-Men The Last Stand I didn't find quite as terrible as its reputed to be but it was very disappointing and a big step-down, it had its moments like the visuals, some good performances and the action but suffered from too much going on, a script that was sorely lacking and too many characters that were largely underdeveloped and out of character. X Men Origins: Wolverine was just as disappointing and with very similar pros and cons to The Last Stand. The Wolverine was a definite improvement but still had a fair share of flaws. And First Class was excellent. I was hugely excited for Days of Future Past because the cast is such a good one and the return of Bryan Singer promised much. And Days of Future Past didn't disappoint at all. It is a visually very stylish film that has an even darker and more audacious feel than the rest of the films in the series, the special effects are of great quality and everything looks very slick. The score is the best since the one for X2 in terms of memorability and how it fits and the script is the sharpest since X2 as well and is probably the best and most well-balanced script of all the X-Men films put together. There's a bit of humour that is subtle and genuinely funny, not feeling overly-broad or overkill, while there are plenty of suspenseful and emotional parts. Bryan Singer makes a triumphant come-back, the action sequences really thrill especially the battle between past and future X-Men to stop annihilation while the drama resonates. Great also was the quietly powerful tete-a-tete between the two Xaviers. There is a fair bit going on and there are a lot of characters, but the solid pacing, chemistry between the characters/actors and how well everything's balanced in the writing makes the story thrilling yet with plenty of space to allow you to feel emotion, and for the amount of characters there are here a vast majority of the characters have real personality and soul(plus they're treated with respect), something which Last Stand and Origins did not do. The cast are spot on, Hugh Jackman is grizzled and charismatic while bringing the subdued quality he brought to The Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence is surprisingly good as Mystique(blue is definitely not the warmest colour with her), the transformation sequences are as eye-popping as they were in X2. James McAvoy gives one of his better performances here and Michael Fassbender is suave and calculating. As the older versions of Professor X and Magneto, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen make a welcome return, Stewart is cool and McKellen is menacing yet with a sympathetic quality, Magneto is much more than a one-dimensional villain(a mistake Last Stand made and that the first two films did not). Evan Peters is excellent too as Quicksilver, like how Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler almost stole the show in X2 Peters' Quicksilver almost did here, a definite scene stealer. Nicholas Hoult is fine as Beast and is very well made-up, but Kelsey Grammar for me was a touch better, and Halle Berry gives her, by far, best performance of the series(the only time she really made an impression as Storm, who's also developed best). My only complaint for Days of Future Past is the cop-out ending(outside of the action), other than that it was a brilliant film that was not only the best X-Men film since the second but a big contender for the best of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Far from some of its more explosive and demonstratively louder (recent) predecessors, 'Days of Future Past' guides the franchise as it veers back into narratives akin to the cerebral and the existential.  Without doubt, it is sure to be welcomed by fans of X-Men's darker societal undertones.  Yet, such a commentary is often hard to posit in the superhero genre, and this is where the necessity of Singer's conviction and steadiness never faltering, despite the expository pacing had throughout trying the patience of moviegoers geared for simple \"action\" a-la Michael Bay, must be applauded.  And once more, he (like his subject matter's core principles) brushes aside the xenophobia against merging pseudo-sociological, historical, and philosophical discourses within the borders of the conventionalized fantasy genre.  Albeit contrived and controversial at times, X-Men has always teetered on the struggle for the minority, the clash of ideologies warring for a consensus on how to end persecution, and while the result is not perfect or satisfactory to...anyone*, really...the merit in this attempt is its rather clever incorporation of a universality embedded in these very theme dynamics throughout time.  Appropriately, then, the franchise adds to its canon a film that stays carefully principled, assures us of X-Men cinema's return to refreshing relevancy, continues its run of extraordinarily well-cast titular figures/microcosms, and really just throws us back to Singer's first entry into monotonous superhero cinema...a once-futuristic risk that seems naught but a taken-for-granted innovative success (emulated ever since) marked in the days, months, even years, past.  \n::\n\"We need you to hope again\" pleads the older Professor X (Stewart) to his jaded, younger counterpart (McAvoy).  But I think this quote is more reassuring to us audience members whose hope has effectively been restored.  X-Men is buoyed by a bevy of theatrical, productional, and directional talent; and a once-sinking public trust in X-Men to stay X-Men is seemingly afloat again.\n::\nThe crumbling mettle of mutant sympathizers is morphed by, at the very least, Fassbender's compelling portrayal of Magneto.  And so, (Oh boy), dare I say it: this film is, to me, \"first class\" by virtue of its standards and its shattering of expectations and perhaps, hopefully more than expectations.",

It colorful, it's fun, but don't look too deeply or you'll begin to find cracks in its impressive facade.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's not entertaining.  You definitely get your money's worth, but story-wise it isn't going to rank with the best of the recent flood of comic book movies.  After the great urgency of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the lovely intimate love story of The Amazing Spiderman 2, this new X-Men movie feels a little stiff in the story department.  It is not, however, stiff in it's ambitions.  The X-Men series has always been willing to try something new.  Thus far, they've tried one-offs, and prequels, and now they're throwing time travel into the mix.\n\nThe story a lot more complicated than it needs to be.  It is based on a 1981 X-Men comic book written by Chris Clairmont and John Byrne that begins in the future when the war between the mutants and an army of  Government Sanctioned Shape-changing Giant Killer Robots (say that out loud) has devastated the face of the Earth and driven the few surviving mutant into hiding.\n\nAmong the surviving few are Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his best frenemy Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) who have gathered the surviving few mutants into hiding to figure out what to do about this situation.  Since Kitty Pride (a woefully underused Ellen Page) has the power to mentally sent people through time, Prof gets the brilliant idea to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the 1970s to stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from ever being developed.  *Some spoilers ahead*\n\nLogan has some to-do list:\n1.) Stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from being built by the government.\n2.) Stop Raven Darkh\u00f6lme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the evil Boliver Trask (Peter Dinkledge) who invented the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots.\n3.) Enlist the help of young Charles Xavier, who has apparently tuned in, turned on, and dropped out.\n4.) Locate and retrieve young Magneto who's prison cell is, let's put it this way, not exactly your standard county lock-up.\n\nWith all of these balls in the air, you can imagine that X-Men: Days of Future Past is one busy little bee, and it is.  Director Bryan Singer returns to this series after directing the first two X-Movies (there have now been seven, count 'em, seven), and what he brings with him is a bold spirit of fun.  There are set pieces here, especially Magneto's prison break, that are well executed, as are the references to the world of the 1970s, everything from lava lamps to Robert Flack to \"Sanford and Son\" to Pink Floyd.\n\nYet, what the movie lacks is a tightly-written story.  The third act, which is impressive on a technical scale, is kind of a disappointment story-wise.  Singer's real creativity should be in showing us how past events are effecting the future.  Instead, the third act is given over to one of those crash and bash endings that you could see in any big-budget special effects movie.  The best time travel movies from Back to the Future to Groundhog Day to The Terminator are always a wonderfully dizzy display of the past connecting with the future.\n\nHe's also lacking a timely theme.  This first two X-Men movies - which he directed - very effectively dealt with the current issue of acceptance of those that society deems \"freaks.\"  It was a nice parallel to the current issue of gay rights.  Here he's made a much more standard adventure.  He has indeed made a special effects wedding cake, one that after a while leaves you craving some meat.",

And what was the purpose of going back in time and then jumping forward for the 'final fight'? Diminished the impact of both scenes.\nWell I can go on forever, I'll just sum up and quote the best review I've read. 1 star for the special effects, especially Iceman, Blink and Colossus, 1 star for the casting, 1/2 star for the 70s fashions.\n\nThe Matrix + The Terminator + Back To The Future (with Mutants)\n4/10\nAuthor: fpurify from United States\n25 May 2014\nI won't disparage anyone for what they find enjoyable. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. That being said, here is mine...\n\nThe hallmark of an intellectually insulting film is when, early in the movie, each of the main characters stands around in a single room reciting one-liners that give away the entire plot. That happens about five minutes into Days of Future Past and serves as a staggering reminder that this ultimately is a movie for kids.\n\nAlong the same vein, it would take the film watching experience of a child to not recognize that DOFP is basically an unoriginal mash-up of better films that came before it (the most obvious ripoffs being Back to the Future, Terminator 2, and The Matrix).\n\nIn fact, DOFP is nothing more than a mutant version of Back to the Future, with fewer memorable lines, mediocre acting (save for the always excellent Michael Fassbender), without the classic soundtrack, and with no real villain.\n\n**Spoiler Alert** Plot Synopsis: The Matrix, I mean, DOFP, starts with the all-powerful Sentinels having basically destroyed civilization and terrorizing the mutants who remain in Zion, I mean whatever city they live in. Withing five minutes, we find out that a mutant has the ability to allow others to time travel, but that the farther back in time someone travels, the more difficult it is for Ellen Page to hold it all together. Of course, Wolverine is the only one who is strong enough to make the trip. Why are they time traveling? The Terminator, I mean, Wolverine, has to see to it that Sarah Connor, I mean, Raven/Mystique, doesn't kill The Brother From Another Planet, I mean Joe Morton, I mean the guy who creates Sentinels. What else happens in the movie? Nothing of consequence. A lot of running around, chasing, breaking into stuff, and a melodramatic half love-story involving an apparently alcoholic, depressed and pathetic Professor X and Mystique.\n\nSurely someone out there understands my POV. Again, I respect everyone's opinion, but when I googled DOFP after seeing it and saw a 8.7 rating on IMDb (plus a 91% of RT), my eyes almost fell out of my head.\n\nBackground/Disclaimer: I did not grow up reading comics. I occasionally watched, and enjoyed, the X-Men cartoon of the '90s. I have seen X-Men (really good), X2 (amazing), The Last Stand (disappointingly awful), and portions of First Class (no opinion).",

            "content": "I wouldn't consider myself an avid fan of the X-Men. I know the basics of most of the characters and am familiar with some of the more significant stories, but as a whole they don't really command my respect, especially in regards to their film counterparts. In fact, out of the previous 6 movies, the only key players to leave a particularly good impression are Magneto and Nightcrawler. \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\", however, flies in the face of expectations on multiple levels, and may represent the apex of this rocky film series. \n\nThe \"X-Men\" movies have suffered from 3 common problems, one of which is remedied, one of which is kind of remedied, and one that is only worse. These problems are: an overabundance of characters, Wolverine's portrayal and the action. \n\nConsidering the wide array of superpowers, it's a wonder that none of these movies excel in terms of action. Most of the more impressive abilities are given a limited showcase, and most of the skirmishes are limited to mundane hand-to-hand combat. To date, the best of these remains the infiltration of the White House by Nightcrawler in \"X2\". \"Days of Future Past\" is a definite downgrade in this arena, which is what disappointed me greatly upon the first viewing. The only thrilling/amusing sequence in this respect is the extraction of Magneto with Quicksilver, and the glimpses into the future war seem to tease us with a far more interesting conflict. However, when focusing on the other aspects of the production, this failing becomes almost trivial.\n\nGoing off of the topic of action, Wolverine's portrayal is mostly improved. Sure, he's still a punching bag when fighting other superhumans, but, as with every other major player here, he works better as a realized individual than an action figure. In addition to the usual witticisms, Wolverine's role greatly demonstrates how much he has matured over the course of this film series, largely because it poses a challenge that can't simply be sliced. It centers on his admiration for Xavier and determination to fulfill his mission.\n\n\"Days of Future Past\" doesn't have a huge cast in competition for screen time. The focus is squarely on the 4 key players, with Beast along for the ride. Sure, there are other mutants present, but there is no pretending that their role is anything more than supplementary. It's an approach that allows for the relationships to feel more pertinent and natural. The evolution of the opposing ideologies of Xavier and Magneto is much more poignant than in \"First Class\", where it didn't feel convincing for wanting of time. They're clearly affected by the weight that comes from championing the two sides of a conflict, and, thankfully, it is shown that there indeed were hard feelings over their last encounter. In this respect, the juxtaposition between their interactions in the past and future is kind of striking.     \n\nJennifer Lawrence continues to grow in the role of Mystique, showing rudimentary aspects of the incarnation from the earlier films. Her time on screen is noticeably lesser than that of the other key players, but no scene is wasted; her prowess as an infiltrator and hardy demeanor are on full display. Peter Dinklage, on the other hand, is a waste as Bolivar Trask. He was clearly chosen for the role due to his current popularity, and the character fails to come across as anything more than pompous, as opposed to someone with credible reasons for what he is doing. William Stryker from \"X2\", despite his zealous approach, remains the most convincing mutant loathing human from the films. I'm actually curious if they'll ever dispose of the \"gray area\" approach and include someone who simply has an extreme prejudice of mutants, and is all the more lethal for it. The shadowy Director from the comics would be an ideal candidate for this.  \n\nThanks to an early established objective for these guys, the storyline is more concentrated and better flowing than in the previous installments. Not to mention, it's not an objective that merely allows for a string of skirmishes; it requires crucial developments from those involved and lends a palpable sense of weight, both of which weren't strong suits for the other \"X-Men\" movies. Very little feels out of place or unnecessary, and everything builds to a climax that fails on the visceral level, but is ultimately more fulfilling than that. For the first time in a decade, I can say that I'm interested in the next direction this series will take.",

X-Men: Days of Future Past is quite simply the best X-Men movie and one of best superhero movies of all time. It's a mind blowing epic action time travel movie that combines perfectly the new and old cast members together who co-operate to stop a threat that can cause the extinction of X-Men, the sentinels. The sentinels finally are the villains after they teased in X3 and they are ultimate killing machines with deadly abilities capable of absorbing the powers of other mutants making them unstoppable. This movie is brilliantly executed because it show us the importance of this mission and what the consequences will be if the X-Men failed to change the history of the events that will lead to their extinction. Now the whole history has to be re-written and Logan must change that with the help of past professor in time. The performances are more powerful than ever, Hugh Jackman is fantastic, Patrick Steward & Ian MacKellen are steady perfect, James McAvoy give us a more troubled, more intense, more broken and more wiser Professor X, Michael Fassbender is more deadly as Magneto and Jennifer Lawrence truly stole the show, the story is incredibly interesting, WAY more intresting than the rest X-men movies, the stakes are more high than ever as the actions of the past can change the future in a bad way, the action is mind blowing. the quicksilver scene is EXCELENT, the sentinel scenes are badass, the Paris scene is extremely intense and powerful.  It's a satisfying, thrilling, suspenseful action packed X-Men movie that truly succeeds in every level !!!!",

Time fly's by as the action takes place in the 70's, full of camcorder action, 70's ditties and enough old school fashion to outrival American Hustle, the jaunt back in time really takes X-Men to places we have not yet been and with a fantastic cast, all feels steadily on song to become the quintessential adventure in the series so far but then low and behold like so many before it, this superhero adventure gets lost in its third act.\n\nDays of Future Past seemingly went all out to create a 3rd act not content with one time frame but multiple ones, and it becomes a mess of a million different ideas flying about the screen all at once. There's mutants v humans, sentinels vs mutants (in the future!), President Nixon and Tyrion Lannister verse our hero's and a raft of other subplots and ideas to boot. It's a real shame, but the finale to the film feels like a major step down from what had been building before it and it feels less spectacle and more preaching, which in this genre never seems to completely work. While the ending is a huge anticlimax the acting by the large is fantastic with Fassbender and McAvoy in particular continuing on their fine turns and the direction of Singer is often highly inventive, therefore the film feels frequently fresh.\n\nThis newest entry into the X-Men cannon has been highly regarded by critics and audiences alike and with a large haul at the Box Office the world over it looks likely that many will be waiting Apocalypse's arrival with baited breathe. There is a lot to like in this journey and there are some inspired ideas that sadly culminate in an unsatisfactory and overblown finale. It's hard to agree with all the praise and love given to this film that in the end is nothing more than an enjoyable romp in the universe that is Marvel, but I guess we should all be thankful, it's like those horrible Wolverine movies never happened.\n\n3 and a half floating stadiums out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check into - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "In the future, robots known as Sentinels are exterminating mutants and their human allies. A band of mutants evades the Sentinels with the help of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), who has the ability to send a person's consciousness into the past. Pryde's group convenes with Logan (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) at a monastery in China. Pryde sends Logan's consciousness 50 years back in time to 1973 to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinels. Following the assassination, Mystique was captured, and her DNA was used by Trask's company to improve the Sentinels, whose ability to adapt to any mutant power makes them almost invincible. Xavier and Lehnsherr advise Logan to find both of their younger selves for help. At the X-Mansion in 1973, Logan encounters Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult). Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters has closed after most of the teachers and students were drafted to the Vietnam War. Xavier, a broken man, has been overusing a serum that allows him to walk but suppresses his telepathy. Logan explains his mission and persuades Xavier to help free Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) from a prison cell beneath the Pentagon, where he is being held for allegedly assassinating President John F. Kennedy. They rescue Lehnsherr with the help of Peter Maximoff, a mutant with super speed. In Washington D.C., Trask unsuccessfully tries to sway Congress to gain support for his Sentinel program. Meanwhile, in Saigon, Mystique prevents William Stryker from appropriating a group of mutant G.I.s for Trask's research. Mystique investigates Trask's office and discovers he has been capturing mutants to use for his experiments. Xavier, Lehnsherr, McCoy, and Logan fly to Paris to intercept Mystique, who is impersonating a North Vietnamese general to infiltrate the Paris Peace Accords. There, Trask attempts to sell his Sentinel technology to Communist nations. Xavier's group arrives as Mystique is about to kill Trask. Lehnsherr tries to kill Mystique to ensure her DNA cannot be used for the Sentinels, but she jumps from a window. The fight spills onto the street in view of the public, allowing Erik and Mystique to escape. Trask is saved, but the world is horrified by the existence of mutants. President Richard Nixon approves Trask's Sentinel program and arranges an unveiling ceremony. Trask's scientists recover Mystique's blood from the street. Meanwhile, Lehnsherr-who has recovered his telepathy-blocking helmet-intercepts the prototype Sentinels in transit and laces their polymer-based frames with steel, allowing him to control them. At the mansion, Xavier stops taking his serum and slowly regains his mental powers, while losing the ability to walk. Through Logan, Xavier speaks to his future self and is inspired to work for peace between humans and mutants once again. He uses Cerebro to track Mystique, who is heading to Washington D.C...\n\nWhen Matthew Vaughn was going to direct, he was going to make the film a direct sequel to X-Men: First Class (2011) and have it set in the 1970s. Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The \"Bent Bullet\" Theory (a reference to the real life \"Magic Bullet\" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest (from X-Men: First Class (2011), though in the film Tempest was codenamed Angel) by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost (also from \"First Class\") framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities. However, Matthew Vaughn decided to decline to direct do \"X-Men - Days of Future Past\" and direct \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" instead. Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men films and a producer, was hired to direct. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph rated the film two stars out of five and called the plot \"a curate's egg, thoroughly scrambled\". He concluded, \"The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It seems to have been constructed in a stupor, and you watch in a daze of future past.\" I personally loved \"X-Men: First Class\" and thought that the fresh \"reboot\" of the X-Men series was truly intriguing and in good hands with Matthew Vaughn after Singer had handed over the torch. And great casting in Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. Exit Vaughn and enter Singer again and in my book a way poorer result within the series. The foundation of the storyline of \"X-Men - Days of Future Past\" is good, but there\u00b4s too much deadtime and less exciting X-men scenes. Singer bombs away with action, but fumbles with the story and simply don\u00b4t manage to excite me at least. I don\u00b4t think Jennifer Lawrence is that convincing as Mystique and that bogs down the movie as she has a lot of screen time here. There\u00b4s two great scenes in the film and that is the Lehnsherr escape scene with Quicksilver and the end scene when Lehnsherr has cut off the White House with a football stadium. The rest is just add ons and I don\u00b4t like all the wishy washy scenes in the future with all sorts of new X-Men characters that simply aren\u00b4t of my liking. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are still great as Professor X and Magneto, but they can\u00b4t carry all the weight of the film on their shoulders. \"X-Men - Days of Future Past\" is not what I hoped for and I felt disappointed. Singer will continue with another one for 2016 and I don\u00b4t have high hopes.",

It's a complete action-superhero movie! The film's story starts years after the story of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) where the X-men heroes must teleport back in the past to change an event that would destroy the whole mutant community in the future. Hugh Jackman was the main lead here as his character Wolverine is the lead in the story too. Too bad, Halle Berry's role as Storm was limited due to her pregnancy but nonetheless she exuded a great performance as Storm again and I'm delighted to see her again reprising the role. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart were a sure delight to return to their original roles and meeting their younger self roles James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, both of which delivered great acts again. And Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has her role expanded fully and gave more importance again but nonetheless Lawrence shown her acting prowess in both action and drama. I'm also delighted to see original X-men original actors and actresses reprising their original roles from first X-men movies like Famke Janssen, Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin and James Marsden. Aside from having an all-star casts, what makes this X-Men movie successful is the great story detail put on it and how it put together the past film's story into a good continuity. There's also a good balance in the story and between the characters that's why it didn't suffer over characterization even though it has an ensemble cast. This film is highly recommended not just X-Men fans but to every superhero movie fans.",

Where Mystique a.k.a. Raven's (Jennifer Lawrence) targeted shooting of Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinlkage) is substantiated by defending the mutants, the assassination enables the government to shoot Mystique thus using her DNA to breathe life into the Sentinels.\n\nLet's start with what I didn't like about the movie, since there's only one thing to it.\nQuestion- What's this movie about?\nAnswer- Mutants\nAnalysis- Where were the mutants in this film???\nReport- I mean, yes, it wasn't like there were no mutants. But this film focused more on Professor Xavier(James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). The revolutions sought by the mutants as a team was to an extent missing from this film which was a minor setback.\n\nBut.\n\nNow let's talk about what I loved about this film. First and foremost- the best character in this film was Peter (Evan Peters)- with the power of speediness and swiftness, he brought in something fresh and fun (though his role did not have a long screen presence). It was enthralling to see all the actors from the previous installments again. And the most magnetic actor- Hugh Jackman- he held the entire movie together.\n\nWith amazing visual effects and editing by the veteran (and one of my favorite editors) John Ottman, this movie was bound collectively by a perfectly shared charisma and thrill. It surely had a slight tilt towards exoneration and acceptance which were emotionally more challenging than an actual event of retribution and power thriving endeavors like the previous films. This is what made this movie specifically different from the other ones. \n\nTo sum up- you have to watch this movie if you are a die-hard fan of the X-Men series like I am as this movie is going to change the course of all the futuristic chapters that are yet to be released.",

            "content": "Now this was unexpected. How many franchises do you know of that can make a great first movie, an even better second one, completely plummet with the next two movies, gain some mileage with a reboot, muddle through one more, then suddenly wind up and deliver a Mach-3 fastball like this? \n\nIt's the near-ish future and mutants are encountering a new, overwhelming enemy in Trask Industries' Sentinels. Their only solution they can see is to stop this future from ever happening; going back in time to stop the Sentinels from being created in the first place.\n\nAfter going through directors and mutants like they were going out of style, Days of Future Past returned to the series' roots with Bryan Singer back in the director's chair and it shows. At the start of the series, Singer was coming off the back of his breakthrough feature in The Usual Suspects and a critically acclaimed follow up in Apt Pupil, but with X-Men, Singer showed his blockbuster flair, and hinted at what he could do with a bigger budget and more room to play. And then he did exactly that with X2, easily one of the best of the superhero genre with some fantastic action sequences and a giddy sense of playfulness with the sheer number of mutants and powers he got to throw at the screen. Where Brett Ratner's attempt at the same trick felt bloated and confused, Singer's eye on the story and eye for humour kept X2 light on its feet. After the nonsense of The Last Stand, attempting something like Days of Future past had Singer looking like a glutton for punishment. Days of Future Past is positively stuffed with mutants; alpha personalities, love interests, bad guys, shady guys, good guys, messed up people in general. It's a nightmare realm of characters, speaking from a streamlining perspective, and the story plays with time-travels, multiple timelines and multiple versions of the same characters. It's insane. And yet it never feels messy the way it did in The Last Stand. Singer's confidence with the material, his willingness to just have fun in the moment, to add little touches here and there to make you laugh, makes every plot twist feel understandable rather than overwhelming. From the first fight scene itself, it's just an instantly higher quality of movie. Mutants are thrown at the screen with abandon in such a fun and reckless way, some recognisable, some not, all of them just plain cool. And when the characters we've come to know over a number of movies clash, Singer injects it with the kind of importance that they deserve, but without ever making it feel sombre. Not to mention the 70s found footage intercut with the digital footage, and the damn fine 70s costumes. It's deft, brilliant work that just goes to prove the necessity of a strong directorial voice, especially in a series as unwieldy as this one has proven to be.\n\nMarvel Studios put together Iron Man 1 and 2, a standalone Hulk movie, Thor and Captain America before they finally got up the nerve to put them all together for The Avengers. X-Men started out with more heroes in its first movie off the block. It's been a tough franchise as a result, and there's a reason that Marvel has only put its team together twice on the big screen. There are so many interests at stake, so many balls to keep in the air and so many different stories to follow that it's no wonder Fox has attempted to spin-off a bunch of times. Coming back to the core conceit of the series with First Class was a good step in that direction, and the story there set up a number of the stories within Days of Future Past. But as a result of just existing in general, the rest of the series makes the story for Days of Future Past an incredibly difficult one to sort out. Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Simon Kinberg do an incredible job, however, pulling together two separate timelines, two massive casts, a huge new inclusion with the Sentinels and over a decade of movies. The key points are quickly set up, the main players established, and then it's just on to solving it. This simplicity makes the viewing experience much more enjoyable, especially with the possibility of it all just becoming too much with all of the elements listed above. The story itself is great, but it's the way that the writers have such a comprehensive view of this universe that the films have established. There are a number of small asides and references to tie in to the rest of the franchise, as well as the amount of attention paid to the relationships between each character. It's something that could have easily overwhelmed a writing team but this one pulls it off with words to spare.\n\nCharles Xavier has been played by three people, two of whom appear here. Magneto has been played by three, two of them appearing here. Mystique, Beast and a slew of others have appeared in multiple forms across different decades. So not only is the cast of characters massive, the cast playing them is actually higher than the number of characters they play. That's a tough hazard of the trade to deal with, and it must have seemed daunting at the start of this process. But Days of Future Past turns it into an asset, showing the differences between the cast of now and the cast of then. And what a cast it is. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence are the big names representing the new batch of the cast, and just having them in First Class was amazing. But here they're joined by the icons of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, as well as the sheer star power of Hugh Jackman and the returning talents of Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Nicholas Hoult, Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore and Daniel Cudmore. Adding in the immense talent of Peter Dinklage just seems like overkill, but there he is. It's a massive assembly of characters and it's absolutely insane that they all manage to have their moment, but it's not just a kick to see them all at once, it leads to some of the best scenes of the franchise. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart having a meeting of the minds could be one of my favourite scenes of the film, and there's almost no other franchise that could have pulled off the kind of character moment that this one affords. The secret heart of the film is Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique, and it's great to see her character taken as seriously as she is here; no longer the blue freaky wild-card, nor the confused mess she was in First Class, she's a fully formed character with a purpose which threatens to overwhelm the film. But with a cast this good given the kind of moments to play that they get, it's hard to single just one performance out from the rest.\n\nThere's a scene I've been putting off talking about, and it's because I feel like it's a scene that deserves a paragraph unto itself. Anyone who has seen the film will most likely know which one, because out of every scene in the film, Quicksilver's complete dismantling of a security team in a kitchen is easily the best, and is probably one of the best superhero moments ever committed to the genre. It is a perfect blend of action, VFX, performance, character, humour, even song choice and it's absolutely one of the best things to come out of 2014. Every single second of it is perfectly put together, and it must have been a logistical nightmare to put together. But when this is the result, thank god they went through it all.\n\nIt's easy to build up Days of Future Past by pointing out the improvements between this one and The Last Stand, not to mention a few other in the franchise, but that's missing the point. Even if without having something terrible to give it a good comparison, Days of Future Past stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the genre. Not something anyone would have expected from a franchise that seemed out for the count just a few years ago.\n\nDefining Scene:\nThe Quicksilver scene, by a country mile.",

Hugh Jackman is relegated into a supporting cast, but still shines. The future sequence is a standout, due to various mutant abilities in display bringing impressive action sequences here and there. \n\nThe Not-so-Good:\nThe movie could never escape the glaring continuity issues happening throughout the X-men franchise. It's meant to be apocalyptic, yet feels claustrophobic and small instead. Confusing plot, and various flaws in logic occurs in various parts of the movie, making it hard to digest nor easy to understand. Too much deus ex machina stints happening here and there, the whole time-paradox isn't quite clear either. The over-importance of Mystique to the creation of future Sentinels is highly questionable, considering the nature of her abilities who can never copy another mutant's powerset and just pure cosmetic (unlike Rogue, who unfortunately gets cut off from the movie). The past sequence feels unbalanced compared to the future one, because the story focuses on a cast with smaller size. On the other hand, the future cast are severely underdeveloped and seems to exist for visual eyecatch only. Wonky and unconvincing CG special effects at several sequences, sort of ruins the momentum and never really brings the flow to its supposed climax. Uneven pacing, and the back and forth between era in the final arc doesn't gel together neatly. Audience with zero experience to the X-men franchise will definitely have trouble following who's who and what they can do, especially due to having different actors portraying same characters in different era. This will surely work better for devoted fans of the franchise.",

It's something that serves as both a sequel to his original two X-Men films, and the recent prequel, First Class.  And thanks to the introduction of time travel they're able to clean up a lot of the mess left by the awful X-Men 3.  There are plenty of characters and stories to juggle here, but Singer manages to find a nice balance between past and present.  Some characters are underused and there's a surprising lack of action compared to the previous films.  Still, Singer manages to keep the pace moving, giving us a few good twists along the way and thankfully returning some of the humour to the series.  Of course the highlight is getting to see the original and prequel casts together in the same film.  The performances are all top notch, and it effectively moves the First Class story forward, while wrapping up the original series quite nicely.  After a few bumps in the road it's great to see this franchise back on track.  It may not be perfect, but it's still one of the better, and more original, superhero flicks in recent memory.",

Hits and misses for the past 14 years in the cinemas but this year's newest venture, the mutants surely steal the screen.\n\nBryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) has excelled on re-imagining a familiar territory with such ease, candor and scrupulousness. Twisty as it may seem, the fusion of the old and new world is well-executed as I root for every character's solid mark. New mutants need not to have long introduction of their origins but they have managed to leave an impact (Quicksilver has owned his scenes!). The cast is just incredible while the story proves to be worth telling.\n\nMy friends and I really waited for this film to be seen via 4DX. While there are mixed reviews on the newest technology, I declare that I enjoy the ride. Though the seat simulation's limited to some extent, it's nice to feel the drama and action through its multiple effects. Best advice: get seats on its first three rows smile emoticon\n\nMutants. Trask and the Sentinels. The \"X\" mark. Dystopia. Changing the course of history. J-Law. It's time for the \"Apocalypse\" mania!\n\n4.5/5 folks",

Everything started at a critical level and there was no way to escalate the tension or the stakes, because they were already at level \"if this doesn't work we're dead.\"  I think if they started with lower stakes and escalated them at the same time everything in the past was escalating it would have been a more cohesive story.

The best scene without a doubt is that Quicksilver scene. Hugh Jackman is better than ever as Wolverine, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are still great as Professor X and Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence kills it as Mystique...but the one that got it for me, again, is Evan Peters who smashed it as Quicksilver. \n\nPeter Dinklage is great as the menacing Bollivar Trask who created the Sentinels that attempt to wipe out mutants. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen prove that old age doesn't deteriorate talent, they still are as great in their respective roles as the older Professor X and Magneto. \n\n'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is one of the best summer blockbusters of 2014, it may be overcrowded with so many mutants and often jumps back and fourth between the past and the future. But all of this doesn't feel muddled like the atrocious 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' (2014), it still feels clean and is still coherent. Bryan Singer may be accused of sexual assault, but you can't deny that he can direct an action movie better than Michael Bay. \n\nFun movie, good time, highly satisfied.",

            "content": "The seventh installment in this now long running franchise! who'd of thought it...not me. So as far as I know, the original trilogy got buggered up after number 2 and then there was the X-Men Origins failure, things looked pretty grim. Then we got 'First Class' which was a prequel to all of it and it worked, nuff said. Then we got another stand alone movie in 'The Wolverine' which followed on from 'Last Stand' (the original trilogy) and I think eliminated Origins from the franchise? not too sure there. Now lastly we have yet another X-Men movie which is a sequel to 'First Class', 'Last Stand' (the original trilogy) and 'The Wolverine' (Jesus!).\n\nThe funny thing is (and I'm come out and say it right now) because this movie is a time travelling adventure, what happens effectively erases everything after 'First Class'. Yep the original trilogy, 'The Wolverine' and 'Origins' are all now basically defunct and pointless, all undone, all redundant, complete franchise reset! Gotta be honest...that took balls, big balls, Bryan Singer has super big brass balls. On one hand I think to myself...what a waste! you just eradicated five movies! are the studios happy about that?? Holy shit they only just churned out 'The Wolverine' and you unravelled it Singer!! you literately pissed all over their picnic! Yet on the other hand I gotta give major kudos for having the guts and bowling ball sized cojones to do it!\n\nRight so...its just 'First Class' and this, everything else obsolete...errr thanks? Anyway don't get carried away Hollywood, just because its worked this one time that doesn't give you carte blanche to go ahead and do...oh wait too late.\n\nSo good old Wolverine is back in time (mentally) to try and stop Mystique assassinating this guy called Trask. This dude invented the Sentinels which are huge robots capable of adapting to any mutant power making them unbeatable, a problem for mutants because they are set to destroy all mutants to protect mankind...kinda. The assassination gave the world a reason to use the Sentinels against mutant kind plus Mystique's DNA gave the sentinels the much needed mutant power...power ups. So in short the whole idea has a very Terminator-esque vibe about it. OK its pretty much 'Terminator 2' for Pete's sake...there, you know its true, accept it.\n\nEverything follows on from 'First Class' very well, all the locations, outfits, vehicles, set props etc...all look perfectly 70's, I have been consistently impressed with the dated visuals in both movies. The characters in general all look great and spot on continuity wise, although I have a few comments. Beast...is it me or does this guy look worse in this movie? in 'First Class' he admittedly looked a bit slim and scrawny but that's understandable with his age plus he was more animal-like facially. In this movie he has lost his animalistic facial features and kinda looks like a blue shaggy caveman. This also seems very out of place when we get the neat little cameo surprise at the end because this new Beast look doesn't fit if you ask me, his blue hair is completely different in this, its all curly. The main issue I had though was the fact Beast now 'Hulks out' into his Beast form...just like whatshisname, the big green dude. You can't do that! there is already a character that does that but in green...you know...whatshisname.\n\nIt also annoyed me that throughout this movie Mystique never listens to anyone, including Xavier. I can understand why I guess but come on, if there's one thing most of these characters should have learned by now its always listen to the bald guy (Xavier). OK sure she's conflicted big time but come on, all these people telling you the same thing over and over, maybe its true? Staying with Mystique what the hell was with that end twist? you think its Stryker with Wolverine (you know, taking him off for adamantium surgery), but its really Mystique? So does that mean Wolverine will no longer have metal claws? I don't like knobbly bones claws. I'm sure they will sort it out but wow talk about leaving question marks.\n\nIt was cool to see some more new characters plus a bit more of classic ones, to a degree. The present day scenes gave us some nice battle sequences showing Colossus, Iceman and Storm alongside Sunspot, Warpath, Bishop and Kitty Pryde. I would have liked to see these guys more involved as it does get a tad boring watching the same regular X-Men trio (Xavier, Magneto and Wolverine), but what we get does suffice with some cool trademark mutant power effects. I did also like the new look for Toad, much better than the original Ray Park version. Of course the highlight (for most it seems) was apparently Quicksilver looking very...odd...with his grey hair and natty sparkly outfit. \nHis big sequence where we see how time looks for the character at his breakneck speeds was indeed cleverly done and looked great but somehow I wasn't as thrilled as everyone else it seems. Yeah sure it captured the essence of the character perfectly and the musical track ('Time in a Bottle', Jim Croce) was a nice touch but did it make me wet my pants in awe? no. The scene was a quirky break from the usual type of action and showcased another character very well but I wasn't blown away by it. Personally his very brief cameo-like appearance just felt out of place because he virtually pops up to solve a problem then leaves, it felt a bit cheap really. And I gotta say his attire didn't appeal to me, yes its the 70's but silver sneakers and jacket? and why would his hair be like that seriously? I know his comicbook counterpart looks a bit silly but sheesh! should of made his hair light blonde or ginger maybe.\n\nThe grand finale was indeed grand in every way, how could it not be showing every character getting killed off, but it was still a cliched concept. As the music swelled things slow down to a crawl with both time lines seemingly on the brink of going tits up, in the present/future the X-Men are getting whacked one by one in a very emotional slow motion manner...just like many war movies before it. Whilst at the same time back in the past everyone is trying to stop that stupid blue female mutant from killing the President and at the same time wiping out mutant kind. It is sad to see the main heroes getting killed yet at the same time...kinda cool? or is that just me? The most touching easily being old Xavier and Magneto together with Wolverine's body at the very end, friends again, as it always should of been, going out together. \nAlthough this armageddon sequence did raise a small query. The Sentinels are suppose to be nigh on indestructible yet we see Bishop shooting a few down quite easily plus a few more getting blown up. Don't they adapt to anything thrown at them or do they need time to evaluate the attack or something.\n\nI did really like the final scenes showing all the old cameos which was great continuity on Singer's part, kudos. It wouldn't have been the same if the original cast couldn't have been reconvened. At the same time it also bookended the entire idea nicely going way way back right to square one virtually flawlessly...whilst obliterating all the other movies as already mentioned, still on the shelf over that massive swift move. On the whole the special effects are very good but still not as outstanding as other sci-fi movies I've seen, the Mystique transformation still looking hokey and some characters looking a bit...cosplay-ish (yes I said it). But I can't deny the movie had me from start to finish with its thrilling rollercoaster plot and authentic 70's visuals. Its clearly the best X-Men movie thus far although there isn't too much competition in that field lets be honest.",

Countless choices define our fate: each choice, each moment, a moment in the ripple of time. Enough ripple, and you change the tide... for the future is never truly set.\n\nThe trouble with having a large ensemble is that there isn't enough time to dedicate to explore each character and their subplots and still manage to keep the running time of the film under three hours; thus, the overall plot suffers and character development is pretty much thrown out the window. Then, what you have left is a collection of little snippets of cameos from famous faces in their nifty comic book costumes.....whoop-dee-friggin'-doo!\nWith that said, the film was alright, I guess....okay, maybe more leaning towards disappointing, this would have been a perfect film to split into a Part A and Part B (and this coming from a person who vehemently hates it when studios do that to one book, *coughs* Hobbit). Don't get me wrong, I think the actors did a good job portraying each of their parts, most notably Evan Peters who played a pretty good Peter / Quicksilver and I would have loved to have seen a bit more of Peter Dinklage (Dr. Bolivar Trask) but the rest of the plot felt a bit rushed all because too much time was devoted to the strange \"love-triangle\" between Eric, Charles and Raven-- who cares! This isn't friggin' Twilight!

With Bryan Singer back in the directors chair, he was able to take all the best parts of the first two movies and First Class and give us something awesome. I am not going to get to much into the plot because it deals with time travel and future and past selves, but lets just say that it is handled well enough that you can accept the premise and enjoy the film. The cast it boasts is insane, with returning members and new ones joining in from both the good and the bad sides. There is literally not a bad performance in the movie, but what their is, is a lot of CGI spectacle and some amazing action set pieces, in particular one with a young mutant named Quicksilver who is so great that you feel sad when he does not stay through the whole movie. X-Men Days Of Future Past is a fun thrill ride of a summer movie, from directing, acting, score, special effect and script, it just works on every level, and has thankfully set the franchise on a new and better path then it had been on in the last several years.\n\n4.5 Beards Out Of 5",

It could have been a paradoxical mess, but it isn't. It's actually the best X-Men film of the lot. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is approached in 2023 by Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) to be sent back to 1973 to prevent an action by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) that will wipe out all mutants. Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) uses her powers to project Wolverine back to his body in 1973, where he goes about finding the younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), and convincing him to break out Magneto (Michael Fassbender) from a prison under the Pentagon. Then they have to go to a peace summit in Paris and stop Mystique from her action, which involves killing military scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). With the two separate timelines going simulataneously here, it could have got lost in it's own paradoxes, but it doesn't. It manages to be an enjoyable, exciting and gripping superhero film, with nearly everyone returning for this massive epic. Singer stages some enjoyable and brilliant set pieces, and being away from the X-Men franchise for a decade has revitalised him and the franchise. The stage is set for X-Men: Apocalypse (2016).",

The young Professor Xavier and Magneto are 2 European actors that are fast becoming talented and worthy of Oscars in the eventual future. One of the must see movies of 2014.",

This probably boasts the best effects in any X-Men film, and like \"First Class\" I felt it handled the character balance well. I didn't feel lost like I had with previous X-Men movies as to who everyone was and what their powers were. The plot is easy to follow despite time travel stuff, and the plot feels streamlined and well thought out, in spite of the fact that it deals with characters in the past and in the future. I've always had issues with this franchise...the first film was fun when I first saw it, but it hasn't held up for me. The sequels never did it for me, but I did enjoy \"First Class\"...and this film does a good job of building on from that film while Singer takes the time to try and undo what Brett Ratner had done in taking over for him with the third film...and he manages to unify both the \"First Class\" movie with his own original film, undo a bunch of terrible stuff, and make a really satisfying movie in the process.  I'm really surprised that this film works as well as it did, but it kind of sold me on seeing future \"X-Men\" movies.",

X2 was the best for a long time until First Class hit the scene, but Future Past takes the cake and leaves the rest far behind.  The incredible - albeit complicated - story time travels from future to past and with great form the franchise undoes so many of the wrong doings of the lesser X-Men movies; such as The Last Stand and the Origin films.  Future Past combines the best of the franchise and delivers an action packed, expertly crafted, tour-de-force funny, and all around magnificent film that's arguably the greatest comic book movie of our time.  \n\nAlmost every mutant returns in Future Past, if even for only a moment, to make you just jump out of your seat with excitement.  The cast is superb!  Hugh Jackman is always great (and yes his nude scene is far too short and could have used a second, or third), Jennifer Lawrence is stunning, Michael Fassbender is electric, and even James McAvoy feels right in the movie for a change.  We also get to welcome back Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and the all important Ellen Page who's Kitty Pryde character sends Wolverine back in time to stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask who's company would use her blood to create a weapon to kill mutants everywhere.  \n\nI don't know how X-Men is able to stay so fresh, aside from its vast character pool, but it is possible it achieves this by having one of the most unique villains of all.  You and I.  Rather than an evildoer bent on world domination the X-Men are simply fighting for acceptance.  This fascinating difference sets it apart from other superhero films and also allows it to connect deeply with the viewers.  Can you imagine if we could go back and save our most beloved heroes?  Martin Luther King, Harvey Milk, JFK... imagine the world we'd live in today.  Gays, African Americans, and countless others still struggle against mankind for equality.  That's what the X-Men fight for as well and why these movies resonate so beautifully with the audience.  \n\nThe originality combined with the nostalgia of the series blends so perfectly in Future Past that it leaves us blind to the fact that director Bryan Singer has effectively rebooted the series right under our nose.  It's brilliant.  Taking a note from Star Trek and keeping the past in its place, X-Men can now move confidently into the future and I can't wait to see where it goes from here!  There are so many possibilities it's almost maddening to think how long we have to wait for the next one.  \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a lot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines, but it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often associated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time delivering fan service when it should've been examining character motivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely play a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm still struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third act. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments that I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly pandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First Class. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting face-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new guys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and McKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced efforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made me yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad - the effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the little love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action roars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble shutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so demanding in that department.",

That's not to say that the film wasn't very entertaining and well written, but it just lacked the punch once Magneto travels down the wrong path. Mystique/Raven doesn't know if she's coming or going throughout the whole movie and Professor X takes some convincing to bring the X-Men back together after suffering depression from losing a lot of his old friends. The plot was very well put together and it was great to see some of the old faces again. Wolverine plays a huge part in the storyline because he has to go to the past to save the future, but we don't really get to see him kick butt like we're used to because his claws are made of wood. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I can't wait to see what they're going to do with the 3rd instalment of this reboot. I didn't really understand the extra bit right at the end, but I'm sure that it will all come to light. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nWhy did the X-Men ditch Quicksilver when they were going to look for Mystique? I'm sure they could have used his speedy disappearing skills near the end. Anyway, at first, I wasn't that impressed with Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine but I really can't see him being played by anyone else now. As I'm not familiar with the comics, I don't know how raw Wolverine is supposed to be so I can't really compare him with anything. Apart from that, I loved the relationship between Magneto and Professor X, old and present, and the scene when Quicksilver was taking down the law to save Magneto was absolutely brilliant. The baddie robots looked impressive and Mystique's fighting skills were great but we didn't really get to see what the X-Men are capable of. Maybe that's all to come!\n\nBudget: $200million\nWorldwide Gross: $746million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the X-Men, who have to save the future by going to the past to stop a professor from making robots to kill the mutants. 8/10",

            "content": "Starring: Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Micheal Fassbender, and Peter Dinklage\nDirected By: Bryan Singer\nRated: PG-13\n\nIn the future; Mutantkind has been hunted down, killed and enslaved by super robots called Sentinels. Professor Xavier and Magneto have joined forces with a few remaining free mutants to try to stop them. They discovered a way to send Wolverine back in time to prevent the assassination of (the Sentinel's creator) Bolivar Trask by the mutant Raven, a.k.a. Mystique; the event that started it all. Wolverine must convince the young Magneto and Xavier to put aside their difference and unite in order to stop Mystique and save their future.\n\nThis movie was fantastic! I am so happy that they managed to pull this off. The X-Men movies have been hit or miss for me so this could have gone either way. Days of Future Past is a great story from the comics (I enjoyed the version used in Wolverine and The X-Men too) and the perfect way to combine both the old and new cast-members into one awesome movie. Thankfully they managed to come out with one that is hands down, the best X-Men film yet.\n\nThe cast is great, but there were a couple standouts. James McAvoy shines as the young version of Charles Xavier. The character is broken since we last saw him in X-Men: First Class, and now has more than a few demons. McAvoy plays both the depressed man and the wise leader wonderfully.\nThe other being Evan Peters as the new arrival, Quicksilver. I wasn't a big fan of the look they decided to go with when I first saw it, but they did a great job with the character. He's a funny, fresh face to the cast and the Pentagon break out scene is perhaps the best in the movie. Joss Whedon will be hard pressed to beat this version in Avengers 2: Age of Ultron.\nMystique is far better written this time around and Jennifer Lawrence does a good job playing her. She just wasn't that likable of a character for me in First Class and came off as way to preachy and whiny. This time she's a little older and Magneto has changed her into a harder (honestly more interesting) individual.\nPatrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, and Ellen Page all step back into their roles like they were in an X-Men movie only a couple of years ago and not almost ten. Hugh Jackman also returns and continues to own the role of Wolverine. It's tough seeing anyone in the role but him, but looks like we may have to soon.\n\nOut of the two story lines, we defiantly get to see more of the past characters then the future ones. Some returning members like Storm, almost feel more like glorified cameos. I don't want to say we got too little of them, but I really did want to see more with the old cast. As much as I like the new cast, it's still cool seeing the old members come back. Newcomers to the future timeline Blink and Bishop are awesome additions, while Sunspot and Warpath, not as much. \nIt was also sad to hear about a few mutants that got killed off-screen, some that were pretty major characters. I would like to have seen one or two them in another movie later. Since the continuity in the X-Men films is still messed, we may still see them in future films. Who knows?\nBryan Singer returned to take charge and managed to helm a movie that features great characters and exciting action scenes. It's wonderfully paced, has a great finale, and is easily a must see for X-Men fans.\n\nJust like the last few X-Men movies, stick around after the credits for a short scene. Long time comic fans will get excited, everyone else might be left asking \"huh?\".\n\n9 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"Logan, I was a very different man. Lead me, guide me, be patient with me.\"\n\"Patience isn't my strong suit.\"",

Of course, if you were that type to demand that their time travel storyline make sense, you probably shouldn't be seeing a movie about mutants with superpowers.  I had a couple minor gripes with the continuity, such as how Wolverine would eventually end up in the Weapon X program after we find out that William Stryker was Mystique, but I don't let such things ruin my appreciation for the movie unless they're overwhelming.  But it was a joy to see the two different casts of the X-Men movies come together with a pretty solid story, cool action, and of course, the Quicksilver scene.  Really fun movie and the scene at the end only whets my appetite for the next one.",

However, it is clear that this is more than a stand-alone trilogy.  \"Days of Future Past\" has creatively connected the dots between the old trilogy and the new trilogy, something that I am not sure has ever been done.  Bryan Singer has somehow found a way to meld the young X-Men into a plot with their elder alter-egos, which could technically make this film a fourth installment in the original trilogy rather than a second installment in the prequel trilogy.  More importantly for X-men fans, this could even explain away the highly controversial main character killing spree in \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" (2006).  I couldn't help but walk away from this film thinking about how the connection between trilogies is genius (and how the confusing title is actually a perfect description of the film).  The story itself is really interesting too, using knowledge of future events to help Charles pull his life together and to show the duality of Magneto and Charles being friends and foes.  All of the acting is well executed from James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence to Patrick Stewart and Ellen Page.  I think that everybody will fall in love with Quicksilver's powers as they provide comedy while being integral to the plot and really cool.  His orchestrated escape from the Pentagon is one of the greatest sequences of special effects that I have ever seen.  That will always be the iconic scene of this movie.  I also appreciate that all loose ends were taken care of, particularly the explanation that the altered history's effects on the future aren't applied until Wolverine wakes up, and the fact that Hugh Jackman is the only actor to cross over between trilogies since Wolverine ages at such a slow rate.  \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is basically flawless but will be very confusing if you do not have any knowledge of the original trilogy.",

Cooperating with them helps the human race and they can help us immensely.

But because past experience has told us that crossover films rarely work. Think Star Trek Generations. However this one is like slipping on your favourite jacket and finding a tenner inside that you forgot you had. It blends James McAvoy's Professor Xavier with the legend that is Sir Patrick Stewart so well that you actually believe it's his younger self. Indeed I'd argue that Michael Fassbender's Magneto is better than the original. \n\nPlot wise is this. In the near future the mutant X-men are being hunted by killer robots called Sentinels. And in this war, they're loosing. However they trace the war back to a scientist that was killed by a mutant in 1973. So Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent back through time to bring the two disparate factions together and prevent the war. \n\nYou'll need a working knowledge of the Marvel universe to keep up with it but it's a rollercoaster of a film and well worth two hours of your time.

            "content": "It's kind of amazing to think that the \"X-Men\" film franchise has been going on since 2000.  14 years, seven movies, and it's still going strong.  It hasn't always been a smooth ride (\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" was a definite speed-bump), but overall, this has been a great series, a saga that is on par with other long-running, multi-film franchises such as \"Star Wars.\"  What makes it even more remarkable is that while so many of their comic book brethren keep getting reboots after a few years between films (Spider-Man, the Punisher, the Hulk), the X-Men have somehow managed to refrain from hitting the reset button, even seven films in.  Yes, we've had the occasional prequel (the aforementioned \"Origins\" and the superb \"First Class\"), but never a complete reboot.  There's something encouraging about that.\n\nThe latest film, \"Days of Future Past,\" is another fantastic entry to the series, filled with the action and complexity that have become staples of the franchise.  The X-Men pictures have always been at their best when they're exploring the complicated relationships and prejudices between the average humans and the super-powered mutants.  That gives the action sequences the necessary weight they need to really resound with the audience.  Human and mutant are both capable of atrocities, and it's always interesting when there's no clear-cut \"villain\" on either side (at least not in the traditional sense of the word).\n\nThe film opens in the year 2023 in the midst of an apocalyptic, war-ravaged future.  In a \"Terminator\" and \"Matrix\"-like fashion, highly advanced robots known as Sentinels have basically taken over the world.  They've been rounding up and systematically exterminating all mutants, and now only a few remain.  They include old friends/rivals Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) and what remains of Xavier's X-Men: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page).  Kitty has somehow developed the ability to transport a person's consciousness back in time, and it is from this power that the mutants come up with the idea of altering the past so that this bleak never future never occurs.\n\nI want to take a brief moment here to address my sole complaint with the film, which is what keeps it from reaching the heights established in \"First Class\" and \"X2.\"  It's never explained just how Kitty's mutant ability-which used to be restricted to walking through walls-has evolved to the point that she can manipulate time, and there are a few other things that aren't addressed as well.  (Spoiler alert here, as I'm going to address a few of the earlier films in the series, but you really should see those before seeing this anyway.)  The film takes place after the events of both \"The Last Stand\" and \"The Wolverine,\" and yet Wolverine's claws are somehow back to being made of adamantium, Magneto's mutant powers have fully returned, and Xavier is...well, alive.  Now \"The Last Stand\" deliberately kept the proceedings ambiguous when it came to Xavier's fate and Magneto's stolen abilities, but it's jarring that in this subsequent film there isn't any sort acknowledgment whatsoever as to their current state.  This is a case in which the prior ambiguity needed to be explained; hell, they didn't need to do anything elaborate, just a throwaway statement would have sufficed.  It's a comic book movie, the audience would have been accepting of just about anything.  \n\nAnd Wolverine's claw situation is even more a conundrum, as there was no ambiguity there; his adamantium claws were unmistakably removed during \"The Wolverine.\"  Now I understand that retconning is a big part of comic books in general, but even so, this is irritating.  As I said, a brief, throwaway explanation was all they really needed.\n\nLuckily, \"Days of Future Past\" is such a good ride that these unexplainable occurrences are only minor nuisances.  Anyway, back to the story: the plan involves Kitty sending Wolverine's consciousness back to 1973 (where he would inhabit his body from that time) so that he could prevent the shape-shifting mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the scientist responsible for coming up with the idea of the Sentinels.  It is this act that galvanizes the creation of the killer machines; upon Trask's murder, the human population begins to see the mutants as a threat, and they subsequently begin production of the Sentinels in hopes of containing and controlling them.  Obviously, as we come to see in 2023, things get a bit out of hand for both species.  Aiding Wolverine in his quest are the younger versions of Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).\n\nIt's no secret that I'm a fan of these kind of movies; the \"X-Men\" films have always functioned as a successful fusion between comic book fantasy and science fiction, and never is that more apparent than with \"Days of Future Past.\"  It's a loopy plot, to be sure (as all movies involving time travel tend to be), but it's also quite fun.  Some of the best set pieces involve a prison break from within the depths of a pentagon and a confrontation between Magneto and President Richard Nixon.  Like \"First Class,\" we get to see recreations of important historical events, but they're re-told within the confines of the \"X-Men\" universe, and they're very effective.  I say \"X-Men\" universe, but that's probably not 100% accurate; unlike many other superheroes, the X-Men more-or-less exist in OUR universe (albeit with some tweaks, obviously).  Many of the same events occurred, many of the same presidents held office, etc.  It adds depth to the stories because we recognize the surroundings.  Gotham City and Metropolis don't exist.  But Washington D.C. sure does.\n\nI also liked that, although Wolverine is ostensibly the star, like most of the films in the series, it's an ensemble effort.  Jackman gets to do his thing, growling, fighting and wisecracking, but the movie just further confirms that the X-Men should never just be about one mutant (although I did like \"The Wolverine\").  The best performance of the film probably comes from McAvoy, as his young Xavier is a very different man from both the last time we saw him in \"First Class\" as well as his older incarnation.  He's bitter and wounded, and you can't help but wonder if a part of him isn't considering that maybe, just maybe, Magneto was right all along in his belief on human/mutant relationships.  It takes a conversation with himself, so to speak, to really get himself back on track.  McAvoy and Stewart are masterful here.\n\nI mentioned the shades of gray above in my discussion of the \"villain(s),\" and that's another of the movie's strengths.  Bolivar Trask is ambitious and misguided, but as we come to see in a few key scenes, his motives aren't evil or malicious.  He really believes that the Sentinels can bring peace to the world.  He's basically the human version of Magneto in terms of their ideologies.  And certainly Magneto's methods are beyond extreme, but we have to remember that he's seen the worst that mankind has to offer.\nThen there's Lawrence's Mystique, who believes she's protecting her fellow mutants (although she has her personal reasons as well).  Nobody's completely right, and nobody's completely wrong either.\n\nThis is a profoundly satisfying entry to the \"X-Men\" series.  The next film, entitled \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" is due in 2016, and I'm very interested to see where they go with it.  It's supposedly going to be set during the 1980s, but I hope the filmmakers can find some way of getting this cast back together again...even though some are portraying the same characters.",

I'd mark the lack of competent direction as the main culprit and the weak screenplay that fails to elevate the plot somewhat above the ridiculousness, cliches and absurdities of the basic premise doesn't help either.",

            "content": "DofP is fun, colorful, expansive, evocative, cerebral, and pleasantly complex.  Apocalypse stole the title 'quintessential' for it's sheer magnitude, but I had such a ridiculously synchronistic experience with DoFP that I could never imagine one without the other.  This chapter couldn't be skipped, it had to be told.  Finally, a franchise making use of all it's material, collecting it, uniting it, doing it's best to make sense of and legitimize it.  Perhaps no scene is more pivotal to a franchise and it's reboot than the meeting of old and young Xavier.  And how cleverly it's done, through consciousness.  The whole film is a mind-bender, full of complex ideas, complicated yet smoothed-over plot and scenarios.  Singer does his damndest to make it visually cohesive, giving us a narrative we can follow based on a code of visual cues.  We may not catch all the exposition, but damn, just look at this movie, it's beautiful.  \n\nNewton Thomas Siegel is an amazing cinematographer and deserved an Oscar nod for this effort.  It's a splendid visual joy, styles changing for 70s and future not just photographically, but obviously wardrobe and set design.  One shot amazed me when Wolverine looked out the window to see 70s New York - turned out we were looking at actual 70s film stock!  As a fan of JFK, I appreciated the Zapruder-film effect, though that would be more reflective of the 60s, and slightly unnecessary.  It was a visual harkening to a story told earlier that JFK's assassination was a mutant issue, apparently he was a mutant and Magneto tried to stop the [magic] bullet, only to be accused of the crime itself, then placed in maximum security prison [at the Pentagon nonetheless].  Speaking of Magneto and design, he in his Barbisio hat, Boss jacket, and bell bottoms.  Xavier a drugged wreck, shaggy hair and  beard, unbuttoned pink/red Glanshirt over a messy white beater, Sao Paolo sunglasses.  Wolverine in sleeve-rolled sports shirt tucked into stylish tight jeans with oil-rubbed Lenwood leather belt, wayfarer sunglasses.  Mystique in her white fur coat as she seduces the general.  Big shoutout to costume designer Louise Mingenbach.\n\nI love the feelings and ideas captured, especially Wolverine waking up in the 70s.  A future mind in an old body, it evokes a thousand thoughts at once.  A lava lamp flows, trippy - ever travel back in your consciousness via mushrooms, salvia, acid?  The way it fades from white and spins on that object, it's just right.  What a bold idea - who doesn't wish they could sometimes wakeup in their old body and correct themselves?  I shake sometimes at the thought, trying to send vibrations strong enough to accomplish it.  There's even recent discoveries in particle physics to suggest this is a reality.  Maybe all that vibrating worked for me.\n\nSinger was bold to film native stereo (actual 3D onset), and though some of the depth was impressive, it wasn't entirely used with artistic merit.  I felt the initial meeting of Wolverine with damaged Prof X and young Beast was the best use, capturing an impressive depth of field, one part particularly using three layers of strata between the three subjects. This was the slowest scene, and in regular 2D the dullest, so I imagine the impressive 3D was intentional to spruce it up.  Too bad it was less memorable elsewhere. \n\nProf X is a fascinating character exploration, a deep drama whose subtext speaks loudly to the heroin epidemic and other such drug addictions.  Many of these addicts have powerful minds, like Xavier, and, unable to cope with the responsibility, resort to erasing the feelings that come with it.  We get that sense each time Xavier sticks a needle in his arm.  It makes sense, it's not just there for the sake of it.  One has to imagine Xavier, with his incredible power, is always on the tipping point, especially given his youth.  Here he's lost his best friends, his vision for a school, and seen his whole race scrutinized and bullied, making him an outcast... I'd be a frightened wreck!\n\nOther notes of interest: Sentinels, finally!  And in two radically different forms, the future versions being complex, lithe, agile, and uncomfortably flexible.  Peter Dinklage as Bolivar Trask; the guy plays it straight and has legitimately broken the barrier of perceiving midgets on film.  And most notably, the show-stealer Quicksilver, whose work in breaking out Magneto will imprint most memories forever.  The high-speed bailout is some brilliant filming; kids in film school confused about high-speed slo-mo vs slow-speed fast-mo now have a great reference to make sense of it all - I hope professors will teach it with this. Essentially,  Quicksilver is super fast, so everything around him moves super slow, basic physics principle.\n\nThe action was anticlimactic, but Singer wasn't going to leave us disappointed.  Instead, a greater sense of closure to one era of the franchise supersedes any action scene one could hope to stage.  We drift along the corridors to find a corrected School for Gifted, a hopeful future where the worst has been undone.  There passes Kelsey Grammar's Beast, Storm and Kitty and Colossus all busy teaching, Rogue and Iceman have found a way to make it work.  And finally, the Phoenix returns, Jean Grey alive and well, Cyclops by her side, all conferring with Professor X.  Wolverine will be a history teacher; makes sense for a guy who's not only lived a good portion of civilized history, but who also traversed it's time dimension.\n\nThe Rogue Cut is pointless, contrived.  I felt like they were wasting studio money to shoot scenes that'd obviously never work in the release.  They had to know this was all to sell an extra edition on BluRay.  But it's fun for fans.  Rogue seems more like a comic book character than ever before, and we get more movement out of Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto, parallel cut with young Magneto brilliantly, their actions clashing.  This is a character who obviously went through severe changes in the intervening years.  In the new timeline, that may have already happened quicker given the results of Apocalypse.  We never see where old Magneto ends up in the corrected future, a nice question mark to an always questionable character.",

It actually has a pretty deep message about hope. I don't really care at all about any of the future folk. What's cool is the past people. McAvoy delivers a great Xavier, yet again. and Same for Fassbender as Magneto. That scene of him breaking into the Pentagon is delicous and like a sexy commercial (for sunglasses maybe?). I really liked how this movie set aside the goofy, cheesball-ness and cheapness that First Class had. This felt more like the X-Men I know and love. I still feel like, as much as I LOOOOOVE Jennifer Lawrence, I don't think she makes a good Mystique. She's too girl-next-door for me to buy as the slinky, dark, badass of Raven. It just doesn't work for me. And the new direction they took her blue form (they used a body suit instead of paint this time around) looks really bad. And it looks like they digitally enhanced her eyes, and it's noticeably weird in a bad way. Come on! On the upside. OMG, Quicksilver! He stole the movie. He's, by far, the best part.

The opening scene is incredible, and both the CGI and the actors are all superb.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is the best sci-fi movie of the year (to date), and one important aspect is the awesome soundtrack from John Ottman, truly a wonderful soundtrack! The best thing is of course the story, they are changing the past for a better future, and the result of that is so great, because we don't know how much have changed after the events in DoFP! That's why I can't wait until the next X-Men film! There are some downsides like vague CGI at some places, and it got a bit confusing with the time travel, but it's still an awesome movie!\n\nThis is one of the best films of 2014!\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past get a 9/10",

The film stars the familiar cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hoult, Shawn Ashmore, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart.  Of course, there is not too many movies failing on a budget of US$200 million, and it this British-American co-production used some of the best names in the industry . \n\nSimon Kinberg wrote the screenplay from a story conceived by him, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman, and managed with the director Singer to make a best-reviewed film in the X-Men series. It had fresh visual style, story, and acting, and it was normal that finished as a highest-grossing film in the series, having earned over $746 million worldwide. A sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse, is scheduled for release on May 27, 2016, with Singer returning to direct.\n\nI had some problem with the story at the moments... it seemed going out of control of any logic, but maybe that is normal for something dealing with the time travel and supernatural powers.

            "content": "This is an interesting case where a movie is definitely enjoyed the most by those who have read lots of the comic books or at least have an extensive knowledge of all the previous movies in the franchise, and yet also can appeal to someone like me who has, at best, been a casual X-Men fan, if not, someone who is actually starting to grow tired of the franchise.  Oddly enough, this was one of the riskiest movies of the summer; Fox Studios spent over $250 million on the production budget alone, that doesn't include the millions and millions they spent on marketing the film, making this the second most expensive movie the studio has ever made (behind \"Avatar\"), and they chose to spend so much on the SEVENTH movie in the franchise.  Wouldn't they think audiences might not flock to see Wolverine & Co. a seventh time?  Thankfully for Fox, they were right, \"Days of Future Past\" is the highest grossing X-Men film in the series, but still failed to crack the $1 billion mark, and let's be honest, if you're spending upwards of $500 million on a movie, you'd like to at the very least, double what you spent on it, but it is still a blockbuster success.\n \nX-men needed Bryan Singer, and Bryan Singer definitely needed X-Men.  Singer's career has been one bad move after another since he left the franchise after \"X-2,\" and has been trying desperately to claw his way back to success, just like the X-Men franchise (while still very profitable) took a dip in quality after Singer left, so \"Days\" is a much needed, mutually beneficial reunion for the two of them.  There's no doubt that Singer can still make a movie with all the action thrills that summer audiences want, without sacrificing good storytelling and solid performances.  Interestingly enough, Singer does not really give his original cast much to do in this installment; a bunch of lesser-known X-Men from the first series get a cool fight scene at the beginning, without Stewart, Mckellen, Berry or Jackman, who join in after and then most of the original cast spends the rest of the movie hanging out in a dimly-lit room on top of a mountain.  The only one who gets to participate in the main story is Jackman's Wolverine (obviously, being the audience favorite), who is transported to the 1970's to stop the creation of a bunch of Terminator rip-offs from killing all the mutants.\n \nInstead, the cast of \"X-Men: First Class\" gets most of the screen time, with Jackman still as the lead.  We see the return of Hoult, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence as mutants from their origin movie.  Unfortunately, I am not enamored with any of these actors like most of the general public is; they've proven to all be pretty good but I don't love any of them.  We spend much of the movie watching them bicker with each other about what side they should be on and who's betraying who, which gets tedious after a while; either be friends or be enemies but stop yelling at each other in the middle ground; it wasn't pulled off in a charmingly funny way like in 2012's \"Avengers.\"\n \nNevertheless, when the movie finally clicks together, it is a great thrill ride.  It works best for fans of the comics because you get introduced to a lot of mutants without too much backstory at a pretty quick pace, but if you learn to just go with it, you should be fine.  As a casual X-Men fan, I really only see these movies for Wolverine, which is why I'm often content with his solo movies; I just want to see him pop the claws and attack people.  Wolverine is still a great role for Jackman and he knows exactly how to own it and really dominate a scene, but we don't actually get too many of those classic Wolverine battles (also I hate the bone claws... really wish they could have fudged the story and thrown some metal on those bad boys).\n \nPlacing the mutants in actual historical events works better in this film than it did in \"First Class,\" but there are still some moments that make you groan, (JFK was a mutant too??  Who knew??)  But in the end, \"Days\" is great summer fun.  It is bogged down a little by is long run time, lack of use of McKellen and Stewart, a convoluted story and those pesky bone claws.  But as I said, when all the gears are working together, you end up with incredible sequences that make this great summer fun and an above average popcorn movie that pumps some much-needed gas in a franchise that was starting to run on fumes.",

Finally, the series was going back into the hands of the man who helped start the whole film franchise. I, on the other hand, groaned and wondered why \"First Class\" helmsman Matthew Vaughn couldn't return to push the story further. It was my favorite entry in the series and took the bad taste out of my mouth created by the mess referred to as \"The Last Stand.\"\n\nIn the distant future, robots known as Sentinels have all but wiped out both mutants and humans. Wolverine is sent by the X-Men to prevent an event which will send history down this path to destruction. First he has to find a way to unite Professor X and Magneto in a search for the harbinger of doom - Mystique.\n\nMy worries over Singer's return to steer the franchise were all realized after the first hour or so of \"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\" The first portion of the film moves ahead and sets the viewer up for a powerful and epic thrill ride. Unfortunately, like most of the director's movies, it starts to meander and get tedious right after the halfway mark. The action and excitement gets bogged down in a lot of dramatic narrative which feels as if it was injected into the script to make the movie more analytical than it really needed to be.\n\nOne thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the way the massive amount of cast members and the parts they played in the story were handled. I was concerned when it was announced that the original and new actors who portrayed their respective characters were going to be jammed into one movie. How in the world were filmmakers going to keep the movie from becoming overcrowded and derailing? \n\nDirector Singer and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg handled the whole affair quite well. Instead of trying to cram as much of a pleasurable thing down our throats as they could, they worked towards the greater good of the whole. They didn't play favorites and shove certain popular actors into scenes just to give them more face time.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is rated PG-13for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity, and language. I've seen Hugh Jackman's butt enough now. Does it really have to be showcased in every one of these films?\n\nAlthough I did enjoy \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" to a certain degree, I felt myself getting lethargic as it moved along towards its inevitable climax. By no means is it a bad movie, but I think it could've been better under Matthew Vaughn's direction. I do give it props for fully embracing its science fiction roots. \n\nwww.ersink.com",

And for someone who didn't know much about the X-Men when he first took them on a decade and a half ago, I sincerely don't ever want anyone else telling their stories anymore.  This movie was something I'd been waiting for from the moment I heard about it.  It is plucked directly out of my childhood and seems surreal to see onscreen.  I have an emotional attachment to this story.  However, when I saw the first trailers, I was immensely disappointed.  It did NOT look good.  Well, considering the Godzilla trailers DID look good and it was a steaming pile of lizard dung, looks can clearly be deceiving.  XMen DOFP is a masterpiece.  Singer eradicated the ridiculous Ratner movie, cleaned up some loose ends from other films, introduced the most exciting new character, Quicksilver, and even alluded to him being the son of Magneto, as he is in the comics.  I was concerned about another Wolverine-focused picture, but it worked.  Very well.  In fact, it was just as much a Professor X and Magneto movie, which is great considering that Michael Fassbender is a PERFECT Magneto.  Cold, emotionless and focused on his mission.  He has personified Magneto more than Ian McKellen ever could.  I always thought they went way too old for that role and Fassbender fixes that.  The complexity of the time traveling is not without its holes (like every time-traveling story), but the portrayal of the Sentinels, Trask, Stryker and Chris Claremont/John Byrne's original dystopian future was modernized as perfectly as can be.  Just amazing in every way, especially if you're an XMen fan.",

Not to mention they can literally just add in characters and pretend like they were always there to begin with.Wolverine is of course the main man behind it all and once again the action is sub par. If only they did away with Writer/Director Bryan Singer and replaced him with that of X Men First Class Writer Director Matthew Vaughn. Despite not being able to use the actual character of the actual comic first class he made a strong, compelling story come to life. To date it is the best of Fox's X Men Series.

            "content": "This film was the victim of skepticism and fear for months after announcement. This fear was well grounded, however, after the almost universally hated \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" and \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" in addition to the divisive Wolverine movie released last year. Don't worry, though. It's awesome. Bryan Singer returns to the X-Men franchise after directing the first two X-Men movies but leaving after X2, which is one of the most loved superhero movies ever, to direct Superman Returns ( and that didn't work out too well for him). The announcement of his directing this newest addition to the franchise was met with relief and as soon as you hear the familiar X2 music in the film's opening, you know Singer is back and a good movie is in store. The plot revolves around Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, being sent back in time from an apocalyptic future where mutants have almost been entirely wiped out to find a young Charles Xavier and Eric Lensherr (otherwise known as Professor X and Magneto), played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively, and help him change the past to save the future. This storyline is overly complex at some points, introducing plot points that have not even been raised or questioned in previous movies (how exactly is Professor X alive?) but that is because Singer has not been the only director working on this franchise and the mythology and plot has been mixed up because of this. It is an engaging and interesting story, drawing you in from start to finish. One of the X-Men movies strongest points throughout the series has been its impressive visual effects and it is no different here. The robotic Sentinels look interesting and realistic in the past but intimidating and powerful in the future while the mutant powers look as fantastic as always. One scene, however, is the clear stand-out of the film due to its style and CGI involving Evan Peters new mutant Quicksilver. It had the whole cinema laughing and, while I won't spoil it here, it is a must see. Another thing the X-Men franchise has consistently done right is it's terrific casting. Hugh Jackman is iconic as Wolverine and it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the role at this point while James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are worthy successors to the comic-book accurate characters portrayed by Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. It is very difficult to have any gripes at all with this film if you are a casual moviegoer with entertaining action sequences among all of this. This only problem I can think of which may annoy hardcore X-Men fans only but even then not a lot is the lack of fan favourite character Bishop throughout the film. Even then, this is a film that it loved generally by fans and newcomers to the series alike, boasting impressive action sequences, casting, effects and a great sense of humour which weaves in nicely with the dark sections of the film. This is a return to form for the X-Men franchise and leaves myself personally aching for more and highly anticipating the 2016 follow-up \"X-Men Apocalypse.\"",

I enjoyed X-Men 1 & 2. \n\nPerhaps my expectations for this were too high. I found it excessively muddled and yet banal in simplicity at the same time. Playing with time, as the comic book franchise did much more effectively in the story arc of the same name, is a tricky business. In this case it completely erases any impact that a character's death has. \n\nSome of the iterations were visually appealing, but otherwise there wasn't much to the characters on display. Colossus, Kitty Pryde, Sunfire, Warpath, Blink, and others barely register as anything more than cut-out soldiers with CGI powers. \n\nConsidering the budget and the quality of performers involved here, this has to be considered a failure. Anybody familiar with the best of the comic writing would surely agree.",

I implemented this strategy and\nended up watching the movie on an empty stomach. The point of this exercise? Nothing, just as the senseless time travel shown in the film. This much anticipated installment in an otherwise \nbrilliant series will leave you disappointed. That is, unless you choose not to strain your brain and just accept the events as they are. The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, whom he claimed\nwere a direct threat to the human race. Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine sets out to change the future. In the end, the viewers are left hanging with a dilemma about the fate of the dystopian future world. It seems as if it never existed. However, if it didn't exist, none of the events in the movie would have occurred in the first place. There are plenty of other loopholes and inconsistencies that will constantly bug an observant viewer. The movie also leaves some open questions, which I hope will be resolved in\nthe future. For example, where does a mutant who can walk through walls (Kitty) get the power to transport people back in time? How did Wolverine get his metal claws back in the future, given that he lost them in the fifth installment? How did Xavier survive the violent disintegration previously seen in the series? On the bright side, some well directed action scenes, specially when Quicksilver saves everyone in slow motion, provides the much needed excitement one expects from an X-Men film. Towards the end, all you can hope is for the next installment, X Men: Apocalypse to be much more sensible, thrilling and satisfying than this movie",

            "content": "I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \"old timers\" and the \"new class\" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!",

            "content": "Despite the fact that I saw the latest installment in the X-Men franchise several months ago, it's taken me a while to actually sit down to write this review. The reasoning behind this being that I'm still a little blown away by what I witnessed in this film. I love superheroes-- you wouldn't know this from the ratings I give their movies, but I do. That's why, when I see films like The Dark Knight or Guardians of the Galaxy, I get very annoyed, because I am forced to decide what part of my critical personality to listen to. On the one hand, my geeky self tells me to love these movies unequivocally, which I try my best to do. Invariably though, my other side (the movie buff side) reminds me that pure coolness cannot compensate for bad dialogue, plotting, and acting. However, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a rare beast. It didn't make me choose.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past unites the actors from the original X-Men films and the prequel film First Class in a time travel plot taken from the Uncanny X-Men comics of the 1980s. In the \"not-too distant future,\" machines called Sentinels have taken over the world and are on a mutant killing spree, attempting to eradicate not only mutants, but humans who carry dormant mutant genes that could be passed down into future generations. To stop the Sentinels, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to alter the past and prevent the Sentinels from being created in the first place. But before he is able to do so, he has to win the trust of the two men's younger selves (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, respectively). \n\nThe premise is not only intriguing, but it's original. Marvel's movies lately have been an indistinguishable parade of galaxy-saving heroism, in which some evil device (usually one that glows with an eerie blue light) is in the clutches of a villain who plans on using it to destroy literally everything. Why? Well, we don't know. But Days of Future Past is able to bring the futuristic and sci-fi aspects of the plot into a more grounded, realistic series of situations for the characters that gives the movie real depth and weight. Of course, the fate of the world still hangs in the balance, but at times the audience is allowed to forget that, and they're caught up only in the fate of these few well-crafted characters. \n\nThe acting and dialogue is also far better than in previous X-Men installments. Hugh Jackman is clearly still relishing in his role as Wolverine, inarguably the best character in the franchise and one of the series's better casting choices. He was sorely missed in First Class (part of the reason why that film was such a dud), and so his return to the silver screen here is more than welcome. Meanwhile, the plethora of uninteresting, underdeveloped characters from previous films have all vanished, allowing us to focus in on four very good characters: Wolverine, Magneto, Xavier, and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose ill-fated assassination attempt is the centerpiece of the plot. With Peter Dinklage giving it his all as Bolivar Trask, the diminutive creator of the Sentinel program, we have a total powerhouse of acting behind characters several films in the making.\n\nI've been asked just why I found Days of Future Past to be so much better than other Marvel outings, and I suppose I could go through their other films one by one, detailing where they failed in places that this movie succeeded. However, the short version is simply this: Days of Future Past is the first X-Men movie in which I've enjoyed the storyline as much as the characters. Even at its best points, this franchise has been very weak when it comes to substance and story. The first X-Men film was about a mutant-making ray and a fight to the death at the top of the Statue of Liberty. X-Men: First Class incorporated mutants into the Cuban Missile Crisis. And after all this crazy, haphazard stories and loosely thought-through subplots, this fun little yarn about time travel is comparatively tame.\n\nFinal Score for X-Men: Days of Future Past: 7/10 stars. Sure, there are a good number of quibbles about dialogue and character development in this movie, but it's undeniably well-made, even looking better visually than its predecessors. This is a superhero movie done right-- No cartoony aliens, no space battles for the fate of the universe, no witless, tongue-in-cheek banter-- Just stripped-down, quality entertainment. Hopefully, the X-Men franchise will continue in the direction it's going right now, and not stumble into the pitfalls that the other, less polished films of the series did (ahem, X-Men Origins). And with Bryan Singer returning to direct the next film, it looks as if Marvel is picking things up a bit. It's not perfect in any way, but I'll give it this: This is the best superhero movie made since Iron Man. And although that's not saying much, I think it counts for something.",

        {
            "content": "Though it's been almost a year since I found myself watching all the X-Men films, I can honestly can I'm a very good fan of them, enjoying almost every single film in the franchise (even when it was not enjoying favorable reaction with Wolverine's infamous debut outing). After extremely loving First Class and The Wolverine, I had no doubts that Fox was itching to compete with Marvel's success in a shared universe... but how was Fox going to pull this off? Well, first, you announce that your next movie is based off one of the most well-loved story arcs from the X-Men comics, bring Bryan Singer (who hadn't directed an X-Men film since X2 but was involved in the production of First Class) back to the director's chair, and combine the cast from the original trilogy and prequel for one all-out blockbuster. And X-Men: Days of Future Past not only succeeds in extremely demanding expectations but I also think it's the best film in the entire franchise since X2.\n\nThe film begins in the year 2023, a dark and grim future for mankind and humans combined. Advanced beings called Sentinels are ravaging the world, destroying everything in their path, despite the mutants best intentions. In one last attempt to restore balance, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to his younger self in 1973, to convince both Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to reteam together during the era they hated each other most, to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from triggering the assassination event that triggered mutant extinction in the first place.\n\nWith a film like Days of Future Past, in order to pull this off, Bryan Singer needed to make sure that the concept of time travel pays off, especially when the most criticized thing about the franchise are the so-called \"continuity errors\". Though Singer deliberately ignores the events of Origins (probably cause of the extreme hate from almost everybody; I wouldn't have cared anyway), everything told in Days of Future Past answers common confusions about the X-Men timeline. Singer also does a great job at showcasing the visual aspect between the two timelines; the dark, apocalyptic settings of the future and the colorful, bizarreness of the 1970's.\n\nAlso, in a surprising twist for the franchise, I thought it was great to see that Wolverine wasn't the main focus of the film. Though Wolverine is clearly my favorite character in this franchise, there's always other characters I felt that need to be in the spotlight for once. And Days of Future Past gives very strong character focus on different mutants this time around. Charles Xavier is extremely lone and broken from the events of First Class, with the conflict in Vietnam that forced him to close his school down, even going as far as to sacrificing his great powers in order to walk again. Magneto is trying to decide whether he should repent of his past sins in First Class or continue to go down the path he eventually takes. And finally, the main focus of the film, in my book, Mystique (my second favorite character in the franchise I might add), has to make the ultimate choice; kill the person that leads to mutant extinction or change the course of history and possibly alter some events in the franchise that angered many fans, particularly from The Last Stand.\n\nAnd continuing on from Singer's brilliant styles he used from the original two X-Men films, Singer cleverly makes sure the drama is well-done before bringing the action together. Again, Singer does it again! I would go as far to say that Days of Future Past goes as far as provide the most emotional levels of the franchise, something that The Last Stand lacked. Whenever a mutant dies in this movie (and I will say, the mutant body count is extremely high in this film), no matter which one it is, the amount of emotions that carry out in the scene just flat-out delivers. There's also an extremely brilliant ending that raises many questions like great sci-fi does. When the action does kick in, it's as awesome as that phenomenal raid scene in X2! The opening battle with the Sentinels rocks, a prison breakout scene is delightfully entertaining (with a new character Quicksilver having the most memorable scene in the whole movie), and the climax, with battles taking place between 1973 and the future, is intense and emotionally resound as I mentioned.\n\nCarrying on, Days of Future Past features some of the best acting in the franchise thus far. From the get-go, when seeing actors from the original trilogy like Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, and Shawn Ashmore return on the big-screen just rocked! Though it's the other performances that really bring the best out of this movie. Hugh Jackman continues his awesomeness as Wolverine, even when he's more of a diplomat in this than the antihero we are used to in previous films. The new additions are great to, which includes Peter Dinklage as the creator of the Sentinels, Evan Peters as Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson will have a tough time topping this portrayal in the upcoming Avengers movie), and Mark Camacho doing an awesome imitation of President Richard Nixon. But it's the First Class cast that really make the film stand out most, which includes James McAvoy's emotional trauma, Michael Fassbender's way of causing mass chaos, and Jennifer Lawrence showcasing more grace in every new film she's in (Mystique might be better than Katniss, I don't know, I kind of like the blue makeup).\n\nJohn Ottman does two jobs in Days of Future Past; he provides the score while also doing the final editing. As an editor, he successfully provides the film with a brisk pace that works for these blockbusters. As a composer, boy does he deliver. When his X2 theme is played during the title sequence, that scene alone made me realize that this was going to be a spectacular motion picture. His score does go into Hans Zimmer territory (there's one moment during the closing credits that sounds almost like the extremely talked about track \"Time\" from Inception), but it really adds up the emotional levels delivered in the film.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is simply phenomenal. 100% phenomenal. Bryan Singer's return to directing the franchise clearly paid off, bringing back a powerful story with powerful themes, combined with a strong visual storyline, amazing characterization and action, and one of the best modern endings I've seen in a while. With Singer directing the sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse, and James Mangold returning for the next Wolverine outing, it's safe to say that the X-Men franchise is in extreme competition with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (heck, I even think this tops The Winter Soldier as my favorite superhero film of 2014; sorry Marvel), and that the franchise won't go away anytime soon.\n\n\"So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set? \"",

            "content": "Baby, if you thought that \"X-Men: Last Stand\" hauled in a whole heap of mutants, well, here is an ensemble \"X-Men\" epic that... we can all agree is rewarding. My controversial opinions on the installments in this series aside, it took two critical disappointments, and two reasonably well-received installments that still weren't considered \"X2\" before Bryan Singer decided to finally come home to the director's chair, which I reckon makes this the ultimate fan service to those who are into the \"X-Men\" film franchise. I don't know if it's the definitive \"X-Men\" film, but it is pretty much the definitive follow-up, because it's a sequel to a sequel and a prequel... or something like that. Amazing how this series has been through six installments before getting to this ensemble epic that tries to figure out how to tie all of those installments from multiple time angles, and it's still not as convoluted as \"X-Men: The Last Stand\". Yeah, I liked that film quite a bit, but it was exhausting, and with this film, well, I don't know if its talk of traveling back and forth in time to form a mutant army that could save the world is so much confusing, as much as it's trippy, so it's only fair that this title is a serious rip off an album by The Moody Blues. Look, Marvel nerds, this comic story from the '80s came out long after the classic \"Days of Future Passed\" album from 1967, and as far as I know, no official interpretation of this storyline ever takes place before the 1970s, so we proggers were here first. Well, you Marvel dudes have plenty of cool stuff, too, including this film, which is plenty of fun, though might try a little too hard to be at times.\r\n\r\nTonal unevenness has been a much bigger issue in other Marvel properties which are somewhere in this vein of seriousness, and when there is fluff in this film, it's usually clever enough to not contradict the relative intelligence, but the humor does feel forced when we come to occasions in which either the brow lowers a touch too much, or a height in tension is suddenly broken by lightheartedness. Those moments are rare, but distinct, like moments of focal unevenness in this segmented film, which changes around characters' presence, motivations and roles (Seriously, how many times is Magneto going to go from good to bad?) in a manner that is conceptually organic, but doesn't entirely sell, possibly because the film spends a touch too much time fleshing out individual layers. In a couple ways, this film forces its way to a runtime of almost two hours and a quarter, and in a lot of other ways, the structure of the storytelling is fairly tight, so the fat around the edges is a subtle issue that ends up going a long way, just like the inconsistencies in tone and focus, and, well, the natural shortcomings. When it comes to Marvel film franchises I've always been particularly fond of the \"X-Men\" series, because it's always had a weight and meat to it that makes for strong drama, in addition to sound entertainment value, and yet, at the end of the day, this is still technically blockbuster fluff, and this installment is technically blockbuster fluff, being reliant on sheer momentum and action that limit some degree of depth, which still stands firm, but cannot truly thrive with storytelling this accessible and, well, familiar. Throughout its course, this film suffers from subtle issues that go a long way, but there is a certain issue that is prominent through and through, and that is, of course, familiarity, for this film follows many of the same themes and motifs of its predecessors, arguably a smidge lazily, resulting in a predictability that further loosens this affair's grip. That grip is firm throughout the course of this very rewarding blockbuster, thus making for yet another worthy note in the \"X-Men\" film franchise that, well, still neglects to really flesh out a formula that is rich with potential, but has to dial itself down through tonal unevenness and natural shortcomings, whose restraints are reinforced by structural shortcomings and sheer familiarity. Nevertheless, more of the same is far from a bad thing in this series, and sure enough, this effort consistently entertains as a tight fusion of fluff and depth, complete with intelligence and, of course, quality stylistic proficiency.\r\n\r\nEven musical style is fairly sharp with this film, because even though there aren't a whole lot of delightfully timely tunes in this film which is set largely in the 1970s, the soundtrack consistently entertains, with John Ottman adopting most all the right formulas with modern, pseudo-electronic scoring sensibilities whose range encompasses enchanting softs spots and gripping sweep. Also basic, but in the right way is Newton Thomas Sigel's gorgeous and dynamic cinematography, whose crisp definition and immersive scope make for some solid eye candy, almost as much as the top-notch visual effects, which are convincing and lavishly flashy, growing more and more expansive as the plot grows grander and grander. The technical value of this blockbuster seems to mirror the ambitions of the story, because a lot of the stylistic attributes are somewhat subtle, just as a lot of the story, thematically originated by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, and reinterpreted by Jane Goldman, Simon Kinberg and Matthew Vaughn, is more about action than genuine dramatic depth, yet where the style is always solid, the substance is always solid, whether it be a fun and dynamic, if occasionally uneven adventure through time and other distinguished environments, or a weighty drama that's unafraid to establish high consequences as a portrait on prejudice, warfare and humanity. Kinberg, as writer, may have to tone a lot of things down, but he still does a strong job of exploring the range of this narrative, breaking tension with a generally sharp and memorable sense of humor, whose wit thrives on strong dialogue which never abates, even when Kinberg gets extensive with his exploring the plot's themes and depths, largely through rich and well-motivated and nuanced characterization that goes brought to life by solid performances. From the charismatic, if unevenly used Patrick Stewart and charming, if awkwardly dismissed Evan Peters, to the convincing Peter Dinklage, there are a few minor roles which endear when given the opportunity, and when it comes to the more major cast members, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, commanding Michael Fassbender and charismatic Hugh Jackman are as effective as always, while James McAvoy, in his humanly layered and emotionally charged portrayal of a young Professor Charles Xavier who must face his pains and fears for the good of those he cares most about, and of the human and mutant races alike, steals the show in his stretching boundaries of acting standards in films like these like he usually does, but these are merely the highlights of a consistently engaging cast which helps in bringing life to Kinberg's vision for a high-profile action drama, almost as much as a certain man who \"X-Men\" fans have been waiting for too long to see return to the director's chair. Bryan Singer makes a booming comeback to this franchise and proves to be far from rusty in his trademark tight blend of style and substance, showcasing quality technical proficiency that particularly shines in the context of stellar and sometimes surprisingly brutal action sequences, while keeping up an airtight pace that entertains thoroughly and consistently, until Singer takes on the audacity to take up dramatic thoughtfulness, which captures the tension and weight of the conflicts and themes with anything from an enthralling sense of uncertainty, to piercing resonance. There are moving moments here and there throughout this opus, though the film is never less than compelling, and if all else fails, the fun factor is never lost, firmly securing your attention, while your investment is firmly secured by the typical proficiency in style and substance that has defined this series from beginning, and defines yet another rewarding installment in the \"X-Men\" film saga.\r\n\r\nOnce the nights in white have reached their end (Proggers were here first!), tonal and focal unevenness, a problematic length, and even natural shortcomings to a story concept that is driven by action as much as it is driven by depth are subtle shortcomings which go a long way in rendering this formulaic feature just another installment in a franchise that has rewarded time and again, and continues to reward, because through a grand soundtrack, gorgeous cinematography, stellar visual effects and action, and a story whose tight blend of adventurous fluff and weighty dramatics is done justice by an intelligent script, memorable performances and inspired, consistently well-paced and sometimes resonant direction, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" rewards as a fun and compelling sequel and prequel to a prequel, sequel and spin-off... and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Even though it's based on a series we've all heard and seen a million times it manages to be somehow completely fresh and with ingenious mini displays of their abilities.  There are moments where they reference other X-Men movies in between but they still can stand alone even if you haven't watched them before.  It succeeds both in being the expected action adventure superfluous entertainment but also as a character study that manages to explore the struggles with their own humanity and how they choose to use their abilities (the bit with Quicksilver is brilliant).  The best movies of the genre that I know of along with Dark Knight and Watchmen.",

            "content": "The latest X-Men movie starring Wolverine, and the other apparently less important ones, heads in the right direction with a strong first half but unfortunately finishes with a more formulaic, less impressive finale. \n\n'X-Men: Days of Future Past' opens in a bleak futuristic landscape before leading into an entertaining battle between X-Men and Sentinels, powerful machines created to exterminate mutants. This interestingly sets up the subsequent events which send Wolverine back in time to prevent this dark reality, automatically giving audiences a higher expectation than they would have had with the other X-Men instalments. The humour is initially really good and there is a decent showcase of special abilities, with mutants such as Quicksilver and Blink being used productively. The story, although with its fair share of plot-holes thanks to the always ridiculous time-travel theories, also suffices in connecting members of the First Class with the original cast. Despite the solid start and hints at something a bit different, the climax resorts back to the tiresome 'Professor X v Magneto' dynamic. It appears to me that the original trilogy and First Class covered the conflict between the 'peaceful resolution' methods of Professor X and the 'any means necessary' Magneto philosophy and now it's time for a movie completely new. Furthermore, it is not obvious whether we should disregard the events from the original trilogy. And what about 'Wolverine:Origins'? Sources and Old Professor X's appearance seem to suggest yes but then we have references to Wolverine's torture in 'X2' and the presence of many of the original cast to offer contradictions. The creators got exposed for not thinking about the whole X-Men movie universe thoroughly. \n\n'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is an enjoyable entry thanks to its likeable cast and  enthralling first half but they missed the chance to take it to new heights by retreading on familiar ground. Saying that, depending how you feel about 'X2', it is arguably the best X-Men movie so far.",

The fact that it's more than two hours long and can only feature characters from the X-Men part of the Marvel Universe - it's too bad that movie licensing is denying fans the possibility of a Spider-Man/X-Men team-up, for example. Another downside is the fact that we're introduced to Quicksilver, but there's not enough of him throughout the whole movie. Days of Future Past is just serious enough with its story of a mutant holocaust, offers a very cool twist on time travelling, and respects its comic book origins. Final verdict: fun movie!",

The remaining X-Men send Wolverine back in time to right the wrong of the past that set the course for this destructive terminus.\n\nWhat follows is a suspenseful, powerful and action-packed flick that is sure to please fans. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always been the anchor to the film franchise and it is befitting that he is the hopeful savior in Days of Future Past and a welcoming addition. All other actors, most of them playing roles portrayed by other actors, inhabit their roles successfully. Jennifer Lawrence is the most awkward of all, especially depicting Mystique's cold malice but brought out the humanity of Raven nicely.\n\nThe story that follows is flawless and perfectly incorporated into the X-Men's universe, fitting seamlessly into currently known history of its characters as already presented in film. To that I owe Jane Goldman, the story writer, and Simon Kinberg, the screenplay writer, distinction. At first I was a bit confused whether I was to be concerned and emotionally invested but within fifteen minutes everything became clear. The story is surprisingly uncomplicated despite having time-travel as a core subject and has a well formed grasp on its direction.\n\nWith any X-Men film there are bound to be action sequences and they are particularly spellbinding in X-Men Days of Future Past. They harnessed the mutant characters' abilities to accentuate the battles instead of exploiting them for the typical detracting 'wow' factor effect. I found them especially believable and well choreographed.\n\nAudiences love X-Men films because at their core they are about unjust persecution for being different. We all like to think we are unique and looming is the sense that eventually it could be us on the wrong side of discrimination. The sentiment of X-Men Days of Future Past reflects this theme most evidently of all the films and should be a hit with audiences.",

People need to forget about the previous movies and just enjoy them each as standalone pieces, otherwise this particular story would make zero sense (if you have watched them all you will know why) The cast are great and the addition of some new faces and familiar cameos make up the numbers, albeit for a few minutes each (For the love of god give Colossus some screen time).

From silly things like making Mystique more significant than she should have been considering the plot (but hey, let's cash in on that Hunger Games craze right now) to a young professor X wallowing in self pity and depression for at least half of the film, I cannot say this is anywhere near being the best X-men film.  Honestly, I think it's second to last with First Class getting the bottom spot.  This may not be a popular opinion, but I surely have good reasons to back it up.  The Quicksilver montage bit was one of the best parts of the film, and it did come together towards the end, but that wasn't enough to save it for me.  By that time I was already tired and about ready to leave the theater.  I think it's funny how people rip on X-men 3 but they loved this.  Until this film, that was the most successful X-men movie, and they totally tipped off everything that worked well about that film to get their success with this one.  LOL.  Anyway, no matter what material he's given, Hugh Jackman always brings it as Wolverine, and this film definitely needed more Storm doing some awesome stuff.  Blink was interesting too, but she didn't get much coverage aside from them conveniently using her powers in action shots.  \n\nFinal Analysis:  This is not a movie worth going to the theater for.  Rent it on Redbox.  \n\nGrade: C minus",

            "content": "\"Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever.\" That's a quote from the latest X-Men movie, X-Men: Days of Future Past. Interestingly enough, those words could also apply to the film's director, Bryan Singer. He's a talented guy, but once upon a time, Singer lost his way.\n\nThe comic book movie age of today actually started 14 years ago, and Bryan Singer deserves a lot of the credit. He came out with X-Men in 2000. At the time it was a new take on comic book movies. Prior to X-Men, most (or all) were campy, poorly made, or both. But in X-Men, the tone was darker, the production quality was higher, it was more grounded in reality and the movie took itself seriously. And this was clear from the beginning. The film cast serious talent, and its opening scene was in Nazi-occupied Poland after all. It was well received by critics and audiences alike, and it became the patriarch of the comic book movie age.\n\nA few years after X-Men, Singer came out with its sequel, X2: X-Men United. It was also well received by critics and audiences. Singer started work on a third installment, but then left the film to work on Superman Returns. That decision is where he stumbled and lost his way, because Superman and X-Men both suffered in the process. Superman Returns was not successful enough to reboot that franchise, and X-Men: The Last Stand was viewed as a disappointment by pretty much everyone. It didn't get any better from there either. After The Last Stand came X-Men Origins: Wolverine, also a disappointment.\n\nThe X-Men series didn't die, though, and it didn't reboot itself either. It just started making better movies, starting with X-Men: First Class, and then with The Wolverine. But no X-Men film since X2 has had Singer in the director's chair. Even with First Class turning around the series in a positive way, many have been yearning for Singer to return, believing he has an understanding of the material that others do not. In the latest installment, Days of Future Past, Singer returns to the director's chair in what is billed as the biggest X-Men film yet. There is a ton of hype around this film. As a general rule fanboys (of anything) kind of bother me, but are they right this time around? Does Singer really have 'The Midas Touch' when it comes to the X-Men? Is it worth all the hype?\n\nFull disclosure, I like the X-Men. There are really only two types of guys - those who like comic books and those who lie. Growing up, I never really got into Superman, Spiderman or Batman. It was X-Men for me, thanks to its Saturday morning cartoon, so if there was only one movie I was looking forward to this year, this would be it. I'm not unbiased, but I'll do my best to still be fair.\n\nThat wasn't the shortest prologue of all time, so let's get right to it. Should you see X-Men: Days of Future Past? This is an easy one.. Yes! To the uninitiated, it's good. The production quality is great. Its story is good and interesting, its cast is great, and you needn't have seen the other six films to enjoy it. To fans of X-Men (even those with just a passing interest), it is great. Fanboys were right about Singer, and Days of Future Past more than validates their strong desire for his return. I'm not exactly sure of the best way to articulate this point, but he just makes everything fit together in a way that no one else has in the X-Men universe. This is the seventh film in the franchise, and somehow Singer was able to tie all six prior films together, which is an unbelievable achievement.\n\nSome might scratch their head at what I just said, thinking this is only the fifth X-Men installment, but it really is the seventh because the Wolverine movies count too. With the exception of First Class, Wolverine is the main character of every film. He is the only character to be in all seven films (unless you count the post-credits scene of The Wolverine, in which case Xavier has also been in all seven films). In the X-Men film universe, there are really only three characters that have significant character arcs - Xavier, Magneto and Wolverine. First Class built on the character arcs of the Xavier and Magneto, but every other film was way more about Wolverine than anyone else. In Days of Future Past, Singer combined the arcs of all three in a sensible and satisfying way. And he even threw in a bunch of small stuff that enriches the movie further. For instance, Wolverine had one line in First Class, and Singer was even able to pull that into this story in a way that made sense.\n\nLet's talk about what this movie is actually about. In the X-Men universe, there are people with special powers, and they are not so affectionately known as \"mutants.\" Many \"normal\" people fear mutants, for the simple reason that people fear what they do not understand. One of the staples of the comics are \"Sentinels\" - giant robots that hunt mutants. Sentinels were teased in The Last Stand in two ways - you saw the head of a Sentinel after Wolverine decapitated it in a combat simulation, and Boliver Trask (the creator of the Sentinels) had a small role in the film. Both teases were unsatisfying and didn't give the staple its due justice. Other than that, there have been no Sentinels in the X-Men films. Until Days of Future Past, that is, which is all about Sentinels - Sentinels in the past, Sentinels in the future, they're everywhere.\n\nThe film starts in a post-apocalyptic future where mutants have lost everything. They've either been killed or placed in mutant internment camps. There are still some familiar mutants, but their days are numbered. One of those familiar mutants is Wolverine, who finds a way to transfer his consciousness back in time to his younger self. The plan is to stop the Sentinel program in the past so it never grows to wipe out mutants in the future. Wolverine can't do this alone, though, so once he is in the past he must bring the X-Men together to stop the war from ever starting.\n\nThe best part about this movie is the characters and the relationships between them. The acting is great and they play off of each other very well. As mentioned earlier, the X-Men series didn't do a reboot even after it produced a few duds, and it didn't need to. Even throughout the duds, the character arcs that took place were good enough to keep the series going. Also, it would be quite difficult (or impossible) to find a better Logan/Wolverine that Hugh Jackman and a better Xavier/Professor X than Patrick Stewart. They kind of make the series un-reboot-able for the time being. In Days of Future Past, once again Wolverine is the main character, and Jackman is as good as ever in the role. If you read my review of The Wolverine, you know that I mentioned that one of its strong suits was how likeable Wolverine has become. I know I'm repeating myself here, but he's even more likeable this time around. Jackman has executed the character arc of Wolverine pretty flawlessly. He's always been a good guy, but when we first saw him in X-Men, he preferred being a lone wolf to being part of a team (and being a leader was certainly out of the question). He has grown quite a bit since then, though, to the point in Days of Future Past where he, not Xavier, is leading the X-Men. It's very interesting to see this play out on the big screen, and Jackman deserves a ton of credit here. Even as Logan has grown, he has not lost the essence of what makes him The Wolverine.\n\nThere are literally too many stars in this film to go through one-by-one, so I'll cover most of them with a blanket statement that everyone does a nice job. The other most notable ones are James McAvoy as the young Xavier, Michael Fassbender as the young Magneto and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. McAvoy does a great job and gives us a side of Xavier than we've never seen before. Fassbender is once again great as Magento. As a character, Magneto has always been somewhat likeable and somewhat unlikeable. He is more unlikeable in this one than he was in First Class, but I think he's supposed to be and you still understand his motivations which is key. And the contrast between him and the older Magneto (Ian McKellan) helps to make Magneto pretty likeable in the future. The character of Mystique has a large role in this film, which is great because it means we get to see Jennifer Lawrence wearing nothing but blue body paint for a good portion of the film. But it's also good because she does a nice job in that role and you can feel the chemistry and tension between her and McAvoy.\n\nDays of Future Past hasn't received much criticism and it shouldn't, but one area where there has been a little criticism is with the villain. Some critics seem to think that Boliver Trask is lacking as a villain, but this criticism isn't really fair. Peter Dinklage does a fine job in the role, so he's not the problem, but Trask isn't the problem either. We don't learn too much about Trask and he doesn't have a lot of screen time, but that's because he's not really the villain. He's not a great guy but is he really the villain? The Sentinels are more villainous than him, but they're not really the villain either. The real villain is fear. That may seem strange or abstract, but what our heros are really fighting against is fear and what people and mutants do when they are afraid. The film is about facing fear and rising above it, which is why criticizing Trask doesn't make too much sense.\n\nThe tone of this movie is also very good. It's dark, but not too dark, and takes itself seriously. There is also some pretty good comedy in this movie. It works because it's situational and not slapstick, and it is usually born out of the relationships between characters. It does not detract from the seriousness of the movie. The pacing isn't bad but I wouldn't say it's great. I think Singer is a talented guy, but pacing has never been his strongest suit. He likes to build things up and allow them to develop (which is a good thing), but in comparison to what audiences are used to, it may seem to be a little slow at times. Overall this isn't a bad thing, because it means he's not throwing in action for the sake of action. At the same time, to be fair I must mention that some films do a better job with pacing while still allowing things to develop (Batman Begins and Iron Man come to mind). Fast or slow, there are a lot of nice scenes in this movie. There is powerful dialogue and good use of voice-overs.\n\nOne thing that is abundantly clear upon leaving the theater is that the future of the X-Men film series has never looked brighter. Singer has made a very good movie here, and because he was able to pull together all the prior stories, the duds of the series should be a little more palatable since now we can see that they ultimately lead to something greater. I imagine now the focus will primarily be on what is to come, instead of on things like remembering how much they fucked up Deadpool in X-Men Origins. There have been a few continuity problems in the X-Men film series. In The Last Stand, Boliver Trask was a big black guy. In Days of Future Past, he's a little white guy who Buddy The Elf thinks ran away from the North Pole. But that's small stuff which is forgivable if you get the big stuff right. In fact, this movie totally ignores some of the smaller stuff which is fine. Things like, how is Xavier alive? Watch the post-credits scene of The Last Stand if you really want to know. How does Wolverine have metal claws again? Who cares? He's buddies with Magneto now, so use your imagination. The point is that neither of those things actually matter to this movie. By not wasting time on the small stuff, Singer made sure to keep the main thing the main thing. As a whole, the series has always gotten the big stuff right, which is to say they got Professor X, Magneto and Wolverine right.\n\nAs for Days of Future Past, it gets just about everything right. See this movie! This is quite possibly the best film in the X-Men franchise. I'm having a hard time deciding if it's the best comic book movie of the year. Both it and Captain America: The Winter Soldier are very good, if not great. I'm going to give the nod to X-Men, but like I said earlier, I'm biased.\n\nhttp://critiquem.com/",

I mean, Days of Future past is the most famous X-Men storyline to the best of my knowledge, and it would probably be had to screw up.
