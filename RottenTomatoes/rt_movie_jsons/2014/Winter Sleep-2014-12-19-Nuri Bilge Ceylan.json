            "content": "Arguably Nuri Bilge Ceylan's masterpiece, Winter Sleep is the story of Aydin (Haluk Bilginer), a former actor who has retired to a remote region of Turkey, dedicating time to operating a small hotel, writing a book, and managing properties inherited from his father.  Compassionate by nature, he finds himself troubled by his difficulty relating to his family, friends and tenants, causing him to reevaluate his interpersonal relationships.  While the visuals are often stunning, the film's success rests in its thought-provoking dialogue and the performances of its actors, most notably Bilginer in the lead role.  Clocking in at well over three hours, it does require some patience but will hold the interest of the attentive viewer.",

            "content": "The film tells the cross-sectional story of a group of people who have essentially a deep insight into their own shortcomings and unconscious, but who are nevertheless arrogant enough to point fingers at the unconscious minds of others rather than confront themselves with theirs. Throughout the film, we are constantly bombarded with the hopes of confronting the unconscious, expecting to be awakened from this \"winter sleep\" with each tirade, but ultimately all the characters decide and manage to avoid it and \"keep sleeping\" by taking the way that provides short-term comfort to them. In order to make sense of all this escape, the characters also try to prove the righteousness of their escape and the importance of their existence in a world, which doesn't really care about them. They also do it, by painting it with \"honorable and right behavior\". Necla tries to be visible in the eyes of her ex-husband and even considers turning her other cheek, Nihal creates a community and offers a fortune to help the imam's family, which, by the way, was neither requested nor accepted, and Aydin, unlike other theater actors who sold their dignity, managed to remain loyal to the theater for 25 years, is almost disgustingly humble to be an anonymous contributor in charity donations and also again humble enough to be satisfied by his audience in a small local newspaper -where he also reveals his wish to be someone important by saying that he can easily be \"the king\" there.  Ultimately, this movie shows how we put ourselves and our reality into \"winter sleep\" to avoid discomfort. At its very core, it is a quest for self-fulfillment, separation, and self-affirmation that is doomed to fail.",

How far too often attempts at mature, important discussions become a pissing contest of petty psychological attacks, feigning offense or hurt feelings, bringing up the worst of the past, etc. This is made clear, but then Ceylan rather beats us over the head with it with too many examples of such conversations. \nYes, Aydin is a jerk. Necla is foolish for blaming herself for her ex's weakness and alcoholism. Ismail is a fool, period. Hamdi is too much of a nice guy whipping boy. Nihal is naive, but well-meaning. Still, too talkative for my taste. 3.6 stars",

            "content": "Winter Sleep won the Palme D'or at Cannes Film Festival in 2014. That is an impressive achievement, something that was accomplished by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994.  It is the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival. However, watching the over-3-hour picture proves to be at least somewhat of a chore. If the conversations in the film were not so enticing, Winter Sleep would feel like it is longer than 5 hours.  Winter Sleep is a very simple movie and a great drama at that, but audiences will not take too kindly to its length.\n\nWinter Sleep is comparable to Richard Linklater meeting The Green Mile: there is a lot of philosophical/ethical conversation going on the film which links back to Linklater, but it has the length of a slow drama such as The Green Mile. Though most of the scenes in this movie could be cut down significantly in length yet still have the same effect, every conversational scene in Winter Sleep plays out as if the entire conversation is portrayed.  Most of the conversations in this movie involve the protagonist, Aydin, and the editing style of this movie makes you feel like you are truly a part of each conversation and not just observing each one from afar.  That being said, this movie plays out like a long stage play, so it is definitely not for everyone, especially audience members that go to the movies for a sense of excitement. If you want to connect to characters, then you will probably enjoy this flick, but forget it if you are expecting any action whatsoever.\n\nThe main character Aydin is an interesting character to study.  He is quite unlikable for a few different reasons.  The first thing revealed about him in the movie is that he is a landlord, and like any landlord he butts heads with his tenants. On top of that, he is an arrogant writer who tends to look down on almost everybody around him, and he cannot accept criticism that well, even from his beloved sister.  He can also prove to be quite indifferent to other people: he barely shows any emotion when informing one of his tenants that he owes 100 more liras than he had led him to believe for a replacement window for his friend's car.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the movie is Aydin's failing relationship with his much younger wife, Nihal. One of the best sequences of the film is when Aydin and Nihal have a petty argument about whether Aydin should even be allowed in his house while Nihal is hosting a fundraiser meeting for the organization she is a part of.  This leads to Aydin to verbally attack her several scenes later when he realizes his wife has no idea what she is doing in terms of bookkeeping for the funds raised.  This may not sound too interesting, but the way it plays out in the film makes it intriguing to follow the conversation and see where and what it will lead to.\n\nWinter Sleep is a great character study that could probably shave off at least 20 minutes of its duration and maintain the same effect on audiences. This is a movie to make you think rather than to excite you, and if you like philosophical discussion then you will love Winter Sleep. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate slow dramas and good character development will praise this as a great film.\n\n8/10",

I know that so far I am not giving you too many reasons to watch it, but this is my point: it is not an easy movie, but despite all this, is a very good work.

You have to be in the right mood to watch it, but if after 30' you are involved, keep going because it does pays off.

            "content": "cinegeek.de Nuri Blige Ceylan ist zweifellos ein Weltklasse-Regisseur, aber er steigert sich nicht von Film zu Film, so wie viele behaupten. Ich finde, dass er auch vor über zehn Jahren schon Weltklasse war! Winter Sleep dauert über drei Stunden und man mag etwas Über-Ambitioniertes erwarten - doch, Winter Sleep hats wirklich! Ceylans bisher schönstes und klarstes Werk! Oberflächlich betrachtet, folgt Winter Sleep den typischen europäischen Arthaus Vorbildern mit einem männlichen Protagonisten, der in verschiedenen Stadien der Isolation gezeigt wird. Aydin (Haluk Bilginer), ein ehemaliger Theater Direktor, leitet nun ein Hotel in Kappadokien, Anatolien mit seinen bizarren Felsformationen, die aus der kargen Landschaft heraus ragen. Das Hotel wirkt ebenfalls wie eine Höhle. Hier lebt der Patriarch mit seiner viel jüngeren Frau Nihal (Melisa Sözen) und seiner frisch geschiedenen Schwester Necla (Demet Akbag). Die unangenehmen Aufgaben überlässt er seinen Angestellten, während er sich als alternder Intellektueller im Hintergrund hält (obwohl er aber alles kontrolliert). Seine Zeit widmet er Kolumnen sowie einem Buch-Projekt über das türkische Theater. Aydin wirkt zunächst durch seine joviale Art den Gästen gegenüber sympathisch und interessant. Bald wird aber deutlich, wie er Konflikten ausweicht. Hinter seiner Sanftheit verbergen sich Ignoranz und sogar Tyrannei. Zu Beginn sind wir nur etwas irritiert, etwa, wenn ein Junge die Scheibe von Aydins Auto einwirft, weil sein Vater so hoch bei ihm verschuldet ist. Durch den gesamten Film wird sich nun aber die Entschuldigung des Jungen strecken - und wir reagieren zunehmend verstört. Er sei \"unerträglich, selbstsüchtig, gemein und zynisch\", wirft seine Frau ihm vor. Zunehmend wird Aydins Charakter vor uns entblösst. Das Zentrum des Films bilden zwei unerträglich lebensnahe Streitgespräche: Das eine mit der Frau, das andere mit der Schwester. Brennend diskutiert der Film über Philosophie und das eigene Gefühlsleben! Am Ende bleibt von Aydin nicht viel: Ein vermeintlicher Schöngeist, der alles, auch die sozialen Projekte seiner Gattin in den Schmutz zu zieht. Winter Sleep ist ein Drama, in dem unendlich viel geredet wird. Teilweise auch in äusserst langen Passagen am Stück! Aber auch die Kamerarbeit und der Schnitt wirken ausgenommen frisch, ja wachsam! Das hier ist ein Werk des Kinos (nicht des Theaters). Das, was zählt, sind vor allem die Sequenzen zwischen den Worten. Hier werden keine Allgemeinplätze über Gefühle und Dysfunktionen ausgetauscht. Die Anhäufung der Bilder wirkt wie eine merkwürdig leere Behaglichkeit, eine Ödnis - das wiederum erweckt Necias Anklage gegenüber ihrem Bruder zum Leben: Um nicht zu leiden, betrüge er sich permanent selbst. Nicht das, was die Charaktere sagen, prägt Winter Sleep. Es ist die Art und Weise wie es gezeigt wird: Jeder vermeintlich banale Umstand kann uns in eine trostlose finstere Nacht hinein werfen - bevor wir überhaupt merken, was eigentlich los ist! Verzweiflung, so elend, dass es keinen Ausweg gibt als sich die Verzweifelung selbst zum Begleiter zu wählen. Ein Paradox? Ein schmerzhaftes Paradox, das Ceylan und sein Team künstlerisch spürbar werden lassen. die für uns schönsten und wichtigsten türkischen Arthaus Filme findest du in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

However, despite his family's philanthropy and his relatively harmless personal traits, his aloofness and subtle contempt for other people cause the townsfolk and his immediate family to dislike him, sometimes unfairly. When a rude awakening forces him to realize that other people's views of him contradict his self-image, an inner struggle ensues, with an outcome that is far from predictable.

The central character is Aydin, a wealthy retired actor who owns an isolated  hotel in the mountains which caters for the discerning tourist trade. Whilst the setting seems idyllic (in a leisurely bohemian kind of way) tensions are brewing. At first appearing sympathetic and of good character, Aydin's interactions with his beautiful young wife and recently divorced sister, reveal just how sanctimonious and out of touch he can be. His marriage appears to have gone bad, but Aydin struggles to see his part in any of the problems around him, especially the poverty and class issues in the community that he attempts to stay aloof from. Based on a short story by Anton Chekov.",

From the beginning one can assume the phrase has something to do with death. after watching this film, Winter Sleep, the phrase is worse than death, it is rotting away in a loveless marriage and a bored and dull latter part of the human life. The story deals with Aydin, a rich man, trying to enjoy his old age after a lifetime of earning his \"wealth\". His relationships with all the people around him are distant to say the least due in part to his selfish and skeptical mind brought on by his wealth. The film touches on relationships and marriages and social structors. Through the film there is a constant discourse with how much should a rich person due to help a less fortunate one? Does money really bring you happiness? the film says a resounding No! the issues with this film technically sit with the amount of shots done with 2 characters talking to each other, very impressive penetrative and thought provoking conversations, but minimal in moment. which is one of my pet peeves. Those scenes 3 of which I vividly remember lasted for half and hour and thats no exaggeration. The viewers patience is tested in this film. I enjoyed it looking back at my watch every now and then, I doubt if a larger audience feel the same.",

            "content": "There is much to chew on in Nuri Bilge Ceylan's three hour palme d'or winning character study of a rich self-satisfied man too unable to feel empathy for those around him.  Haluk Bilginer fully inhabits the small-minded man (named Aydin, or \"Intellectual\" in Turkish) who wants to see himself in larger-than-life terms but in fact is the epitome of Sartre's concept of bad faith.  He pretends not to notice the hardships and dissatisfaction of those around him and his role in their fates.  He allows an intermediary to repossess a TV and furniture from his tenants and to threaten them with eviction. He traps his younger wife into a secluded life where she is unable to pursue her own ambitions and he condescendingly meddles when she tries.  But Ceylan asks more questions than he answers. When the wife attempts to act in good faith by donating money to charity and to others who she thinks are needy, has she done the wrong thing or the right thing?  More than once, it is suggested that she just seeks to assuage her own guilt at being well-off and it seems that hand-outs probably don't allow the recipient to retain enough dignity to be acceptable.  Apparently based loosely on Chekhov, the themes are mulled over through conversation after conversation, many ending in bitterness.  Through it all, Aydin has his defences up, even as he seems to be acknowledging his own flaws - an easy trick that anyone can play.  Perhaps this is why the title refers to hibernation and Ceylan sets the film in Turkey's rocky and isolated Cappadocia region; this is a man who has receded into himself, no longer willing to accept that he should act differently or to pay attention to the world around him and the other people in it (aside from his perception of what they are or should be).  Finally, even without all these ideas swirling around, the film would be worth seeing just for the stunning cinematography:  amazing snowy landscapes and cosy fire-lit interiors abound.  And I'm still chewing.",

            "content": "3  1/2 hours of dialogue probably sounds unbearable to most anyone these days, but Winter Sleep's writing is so damn riveting that the experience actually ends up feeling too short by its end. Each conversation is an epic in itself, some lasting nearly 30 minutes, all of which are complete with their very own arc, and packed with unrelenting tension. I had almost forgotten how suspenseful dialogue on its own can be.  \n\nAction in movies is a little overrated these days, and often just plain stupid, an insult by big-budget industries who have zero confidence in your ability to think anymore.  I'll take the risk of sounding like a pretentious jerk by saying that, as viewers, we've forgotten that a movie doesn't need to be preposterous (e.g., giant robots destroying Manhattan, 5+ superheros in one movie, etc) to be enthralling.  Hold on, because superheros and giant robots definitely have a place in cinema, and those sorts of movies can be loads of fun.  I guess my point is that what really counts at the end of the day, no matter what's happening on screen, is whether a movie can keep its audience in suspense, grip us with a genuine feeling of urgency, and imbue a sense of absolute necessity to all of its events.  Spectacle is great, but we're beginning to forget how engaging drama can be. Winter Sleep is astounding because, despite its inaction, it is rife with tension in every scene.  \n\nThe origin of film belongs just as much to language as it does image, so it shouldn't be surprising that a character-driven drama can be very suspenseful.  Let's take a modern example, a mainstream, yet also mostly favorably critiqued director: Quentin Tarentino.  Words have enormous weight in his films, and they grip just as tightly as his use of imagery or action.  Despite the fact that characters might just be sitting in chairs or standing in hallways, while merely talking, the suspense is electric, and it never lets go.  The tension, the awkwardness, the pain-all the emotions exchanged between characters-they hit with a frightening realness, a palpability primarily known to life yet perfectly communicable through film, just as long as a screenwriter is willing to put in the hard work beforehand. \n\nSimilarly, Winter Sleep has a kind of rhythm and elastic snap to its dialogue that is retained throughout the entire film.  The script is really damn wonderful, and yet, as much as the movie may consist of talking, it never quite seems like a filmed play: it's just as cinematic as it is talky.  Each character feels singularly powerful in their own way, god-like before the camera, if anything just because of how incredibly REAL they feel.  These actors are convincing: every sigh, tear, or bout of a laughter mandates your empathy, your love.  \n\nWhat we have here is a beautifully photographed, sharply written film about marriage, morality, wealth and poverty, and the mysteries of aging into an uncertain future.  The plot concerns a retired theatre actor, Aydin, who runs a small hotel with his beautiful younger wife.  It doesn't take long to see how flawed these characters are, and this is where the entertainment ultimately resides.  I don't want to say much more about the story, but within 15 minutes Winter Sleep will have you.  \n\nYes, these kind of movies take patience, and some dialogue-driven films can be just plain boring; but Winter Sleep blew me away, and it supplied such genuine suspense, the kind that has been missing from the drama genre these days.",

            "content": "Winner of the Palme D'or in 2014, Turkish Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter's Sleep succeeds on all levels as a cinematic achievement. Just as other movies in his oeuvre, Ceylan again takes a simple story, and combines it with an exquisite cinematography, well-drawn characters, crackling dialogue, stimulating use of image and sound and a well-balanced black humor. The result: a brillant piece of cinema in every aspect.\n\nWhile the film's central theme seems revolving around never-ending tirades and mind games between protagonist and his family and his tenants; actually the film focuses on a man's internal struggle, an array of moral dilemmas, a clash between value systems, a complex tapestry of relationships, and matters of faith and feeling. Also, the humdrum of remote small-town life in the darkest time of winter is exquisitely reflected. Just like his previous work, Ceylan opts again to keep the running time to a considerable length in order to bring a novelistic effect to his simple yet thought-provoking story. It lasts more than 3 hours and has a slow, measured pace, but no single moment or line feels extraneous. It never drags or gets boring. Definitely, he is a story-teller in the true sense. \n\nLike his previous works (such as \"Climates\", \"Distant\" and \"Once upon a Time in Anatolia\") , Nuri Bilge Ceylan again takes advantage of his background of as a photographer. The picture is gorgeous from the first scene to the last, thanks to the wintry Cappadoccian setting. Ceylan creates an out-of-this-world mood, mesmeric and melancholic, suggesting that his characters are somehow cut off from the realities of the world. The attention to authentic details is impeccable. The hotel, that cut directly into rock, serves as a perfect setting for the movie's gloomy atmosphere. Beautifully lit cave-like chambers, with crackling log fires in the background provide an excellent setting for expansively conceived, circular debates. \n\nLikewise, all characters are well-drawn and well-cast. Incomprehension of another's feelings, and intellectual and emotional dissimilarities of characters are exquisitely portrayed, and reflected into ponderously long, but sharp and crackling dialogue. From cynical, selfish and privileged Ayd?n (Haluk Bilginer) to fragile, oppressed and embattled wife Nihal (Melisa Sözen), and to confused, depressed and resentful sister Nermin (Demet Akba?), all characters are trapped in their cocoons of emotional loneliness and insipid existences.\n\nGökhan Tiryaki's cinematography is outstanding in the use of lights, shadows and dark contrasts that enhance the story to such an extent. Majority of scenes starts with a long shot in long take with static cameras. Indoor scenes are intercut with powerful close-ups, all with the flavor of artsy photography; with reverse, changing camera angles and pans and tilts. Sharpness and colors are glorious too. \n\nLast word: Pure, plain and gripping, one of the best films of 2014. This is a kind of movie that makes you think over and over again about the distances inherent to human relationships. (8.4/10)",

The poster turned out to be very true to the spirit of the film but also a huge \"spoiler\" to whom paid close attention to its details. The film has a very exotic setting, and an extremely beautiful one - a Turkish remote region with strangely-shaped houses, which look like primitive caves but in fact provide the best shelters for the people there during the lengthy white days of the winter. Such remoteness and exoticness may fit well for tourism but it has tremendous and negative influence over the gloomy and defeatist residents, including the odd couple Aydin-Nihal, who are the two sole black figures in front of the white background of the poster. This is a long film, very long one (3 hours and 16 minutes) with more than one hour opening that gives me no signal about how this film could win the Palme d'Or over such films like \"Two Days, One Night\", \"Leviathan\", or \"Wild Tales\" (the latter two actually made the shortlist of Oscars this year, while \"Winter Sleep\" did not). It was all about the colourless and tepid life of the reclusive landlord Aydin, who seemed to be very comfortable with an uneventful life of inspecting his assets, having nice little chats with his wife Nihal and recently-divorced sister Necla or his guests, and spending the end of the day writing witty pieces for newspapers. But as the film went pass the 1-hour milestone, things got loose, and the real depressing face of Aydin was gradually revealed as well as the strained relationship between him and Nihal, and to a lesser extent, Necla. True to its psychological cinema style, all those revelations were brought to the audience mostly through the conversations between Aydin and people around him, which were calm and peaceful in most parts but always contained a deep yet violent undercurrents. Those were the undercurrent of a young wife, who still wants to thrive, to really live, against a conformist old husband, who talks endlessly about \"freedom\" for her but in fact desperately wants to keep her close despite her obvious hostility towards him, undercurrent of the poor yet righteous tenants against their greedy and hypocritical landlord. The more we watch, the more we despite the hypocrisy and greed of Aydin, and strangely enough, at the same time feel pity for him since he himself, as an actor on stage as well as in real life, seems to forget already what is the joy of living, or try to conform him and people around him from the harsh (yet interesting) aspect of lives through his \"acting\" but deeply sad smiles and torrents of moral talks. When the snow fell to sink the whole region in a thick and gloomy white cover is also when the film, and its characters, turned into their finest moments. It seems that the wildness of the winter acted as a catalyst to the emotional explosions within the residents. The only difference is the way each character reacts with such disruption. Nothing too dramatic or philosophical happened, but the audience could still feel the itching desire for true existence of each character especially through the ever haunting eyes of Nihal and numerous forced smiles of her husband. The ending monologue thus is very touching, resoundingly relatable, and gives us some moments of solaces when Aydin finally showed his true face, his true feelings. Still, I would love if the film could focus on just one aspect of Aydin's character development or Aydin-Nihal relationship, not both, because 196 minutes, although long they are, are still not enough to cover such profound human nature and human relationship. Yes, I felt a little bit irritating because the film did so well in depicting both aspects, simply that such length was not enough for two complete pictures of a \"winter sleep\" in one single frame. Still, a film that can give the audience a haunting and unanswered question - \"should we have a winter sleep to preserve our dying strength and desires for a spring that may never come - like a rabbit shot dead by the hunter in the snowy steppe before being able to experience the fresh grass of spring?\" is one hell of a film.",

Previous films have told the truth about life in an ivory tower, but never with the depth, passion and reality of this Turkish masterpiece.  Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) engages in riveting verbal warfare with his wife Nihal and delivers the best performance by an actor this year, in the best film of the year - by far.  The supporting cast is superb.  Why has Hollywood given up on this kind of filmmaking?",

            "content": "Serving as a much praised Turkish film, Winter Sleep sounded like a good chance to step to into world cinema.\n\nPerhaps one thing that messed up Winter Sleep for me was the fact that my expectations for the film were not met. Consideirng that the poster and the trailer emphasised the Turkish setting during Winter as the source of much of the drama. Due to this, I expected that the scale of the story would be a lot bigger and that there would be a lot of emphasis on the setting. This didn't prove to be true as the film used the setting minimally, opting instead to use 196 minutes of dialogue.\nWinter Sleep is mostly composed of extended scenes of dialogue. Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan uses these to depict the inner workings of all the characters and examine the complex nature of the relationships that they share in their society. There are some intriguing moments, but it is such a slow piece. The pacing in Winter Sleep is incredibly slow, following a more realistic style of conversation that occurs in life. The dialogue in the film is extended and not dramatized at all, nor is it made more stylish by the visual elements of the film. It all happens naturally which means that it demands viewers to be able to embrace every aspect of the script. I simply could not. Winter Sleep defied my expectations and did it by focusing on nothing but talking throughout a slow pace for extended running time. I mean, the scenery in the film was beautiful and its setting was intriguing, but for one that is so unconventional and new to the world of cinema I had expected more from it. Winter Sleep was a film which had a lot of characters who shared complex relationships due to the political nature of the setting, but that just didn't interest me. There were so many characters to keep up with who all played seriously prominent roles in the story, and although they were written with depth and strong dialogue, I just couldn't get into it. Winter Sleep was not the sweeping spectacle I was expecting, it was simply an overlong and slow bore in Turkish which made it even more difficult to get a grasp on. \nWinter Sleep has both so little and so much going on in the sense that the focus is all around the characters while there are plenty of them. This makes it a challenge to keep up with everything, and the fact that the film was not interesting to me failed to give me a reason to try. I really did and I enjoyed some parts of Winter Sleep, but more than 3 hours of nothing but talking in such a high concept setting with a lot of potential is not the most interesting piece of cinema to me. It was nothing but a lot of waiting while I failed to grasp what was interesting about who the characters were or what they were saying. The Turkish setting was a nice spin on things, but I expected more to come from the way that things transitioned to winter as one of the key themes. Instead, it was used largely as a subtheme and as symbolism for the cold nature of the relationship that Mr. Aydin shares with everyone, particularly his wife. These concepts have potential, but the way they are executed are on a level of drama which was too subtle for me to really feel something from. The dramatic impact of Winter Sleep is not that powerful because it goes at a really realistic angle on the story, and I commend Nuri Bilge Ceylan for trying that out. But for my first step into Turkish cinema to be more than three hours of that is really a bit much of a step. My opinion of Winter Sleep is partially affected by the fact that I have not had much experience in Turkish cinema before, and I will admit that the film intrigued me enough to keep looking into what else was on offer from Turkey. But Winter Sleep is too much as a first step. Winter Sleep really lived up to none of my expectations and it didn't entertain me. Even though it is a very unconventional film, it didn't challenge me much either. It only challenged my patience, and it worked pretty hard at lulling me into a sleep. It's hard enough to keep up with three hours of dynamics when a film cannot keep you awake, so I can really just confirm that Winter Sleep was not a film I was ready for and not a film I will likely remember throughout life. I appreciate certain aspects of it, but when you can only enjoy parts of an entire 196 minute film, then there is a problem.\nThe primary aspects aside from the scenery that I enjoyed in Winter Sleep were the efforts of the actors because everyone made an impressive effort. But the standout surely is Haluk Bilginer.\nHaluk Bilginer leads Winter Sleep incredibly well. With a sense of wisdom under his belt which also touches upon a sense of self-indulgence, Haluk Bilginer delivers a performance rich with inner drama and gentle line delivery which grasps the nature of the story very nicely. He interacts with the surrounding cast in the film with incredible strength as an actor which is able to bring the best out of both him and whoever he shares the screen with. He puts a complex level of meaning into the role of Mr. Aydin. His scenes with Melisa Sozen are particularly the most interesting as it depicts the disintegrating marriage between them and shows both actors working hard to empower each other. It works out well, and so Haluk Bilginer's performance in Winter Sleep remains one of the most memorable elements of it.\n\nSo Winter Sleep has strong direction from Nuri Bilge Ceylan and a meaningful central performance from Haluk Bilginer, but that isn't enough to turn 196 minutes of dialogue into anything more than a slow and esoteric film.",
