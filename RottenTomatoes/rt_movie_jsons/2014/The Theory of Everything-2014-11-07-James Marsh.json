    "summary": "In the 1960s, Cambridge University student and future physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) falls in love with fellow collegian Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). At 21, Hawking learns that he has motor neuron disease. Despite this -- and with Jane at his side -- he begins an ambitious study of time, of which he has very little left, according to his doctor. He and Jane defy terrible odds and break new ground in the fields of medicine and science, achieving more than either could hope to imagine.",

            "content": "What a fascinating story, wow. Eddie Redmayne is truly incredible in this movie, i don't care what anybody says, he deserved this oscar. Felicity jones was incredible and i loved my man Charlie Cox. Still i feel like this movie wasn't particuraly about Stephen Hawking, it was more a love story about Stephen Hawking his life, which was fine, but different then what i was expecting. I was really invested in the love between them, but still something was missing at the end between them. The direction and locations are great, but i didn't really like the color correction, the blue, the yellow, it was all a bit to dramatic. While this all seems pretty bad, this movie does tackle some really interesting subjects, such as love, friendship, life and of course time. The use of time in this movie made me really like it, life seems so short, but beautitful things happen in the time that has been given. Overall a really solid story, with incredible performances.",

We follow as the ALS ravages his body which puts a strain on his career and most especially on his family. While very apprehensive of the subject, I really was quite absorbed in this biography, and found that Redmayne totally deserved that Oscar, even though it, you know, is probably A#1 of A#1 ways to get an Oscar.",

You really felt for his character when he went through his illness that progressively got worse, however it was very uplifting that despite his physical struggles, he increased in his level of genius over time just like in his real life. The music by the late Johan Johansson (RIP) is very very beautiful as it is in every film he composes for and Felicity Jones did great in her role as well. They need to make more movies like this and the Imitation Game (movies about famous ground-breaking scientists).",

So did her love stop for him because She has needs? She's weak. Supposed religious person succumbs to temptation. Idk how he survived what happened to him. I am pretty sure that he was upset about the disease. But I am also certain what she did, had to have hurt him more than anything in the world. It was hard to watch the rest of the movie when you see what she did. His dad was right for warning her not to get involved. Poor dude.. gets a hard hitting illness and a wife that falls for the \"I just want to help\" church leader. How can you do that to someone?  That Bordeaux scene made me cringe.. good movie but it just made me mad because of what she did.",

But the film doesn't seem to be about Stephen Hawking; rather, it focuses on Jane Hawking's perspective on their relationship. The film does an excellent job of illustrating Stephen's battle with his illness, but you must constantly be reminded of Stephen's accomplishments that the film does not make stand out, otherwise you will mistakenly believe that you are watching the biography of a very ordinary person.",

            "content": "Many people know Stephen Hawking for his groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of black holes or his theory about the Big Bang. Others know him only as the British man in a wheelchair suffering from ALS who communicates through a computer voice with an American accent. James Marsh's biopic The Theory of Everything is about much more than these unique characteristics. While his illness is a strong focus, the film is primarily concerned with the impact it has on Hawking's private life, particularly on his relationship with his first wife Jane. Jane Hawking created the basis for this film with her book My Life with Stephen Hawking: Love Has Eleven Dimensions.\n\nEddie Redmayne is tailor-made for the leading role of Stephen Hawking. Not only does he look identical to the real person in his younger years, but the way he communicates the continual loss of his motor skills is absolutely thrilling. This is why Redmayne's performance is so highly rated, as the illness in the film does not suddenly hit rock bottom from one scene to the next. His performance is especially close when you see that he wants to, but can't. This is especially difficult to watch in the interactions with his wife Jane, played by the great Felicity Jones. The chemistry and love story of the two main characters carries the film for long stretches, in which joy and sorrow are always right next to each other. Their coexistence is also further challenged by the implementations of important supporting characters from family, friendship and care-related backgrounds as the film progresses. It is clear to see that Redmayne and Jones were closely advised and informed by Jane Hawking on the details, as their performances always seem authentic and almost eerily real.\n\nIn the end, The Theory of Everything is not a pure biopic about Stephen Hawking alone, but is just as much Jane Hawking's story. This is a welcome change, as films about so-called geniuses tend to aim to explore only this and the people directly involved tend to take a back seat. There is a lot of humanity in this film, which makes the person Stephen Hawking very tangible. The respect one has for this man, but also for his wife and family, is enormous. Nevertheless, it would have been just as important to focus more on Hawking's fundamental theories and inventions and not just to address them superficially. After all, the person Stephen Hawking is by no means defined only by his illness.",

            "content": "\"The Theory of Everything\" is both a Stephen Hawking biopic and love story. The film is an adaptation of a novel written by Hawking's first wife, Jane. This film highlights the struggles in Hawking's life caused by him having ALS. His marriage with Jane is troubled very much by the disease, and the more he physically deteriorated the harder the marriage seemed to be. When he was first diagnosed with the disease while in college, he was given only two years to live and he ended up living many years beyond those two. The movie is very inspiring showing that even when the odds are stacked against you, you can still have the strength to accomplish what you want. Eddie Redmayne is phenomenal as Hawking and is 100% deserving of all the awards and accolades he obtained from his performance. Felicity Jones plays Jane Hawking and she does very well also. She is aptly able to convey the range of emotion that Jane surely felt over the course of her 30-year marriage to Stephen. The movie is a bit slow, but it does keep the viewer engaged with dramatic and compelling storylines. The biggest flaw with this film is that it does feel a bit overstretched, and then to compensate the last half of Hawking's life is rushed through in a very brief amount of time. Other than that, this is a fantastic film. James Marsh directed it very well and really helped bring out the best in the actors. Overall I give this film an 7.5/10.",

Seeing how distraught and sad she was to see him struggle to play was a real teary eyed moment. \n\nIt's incredible to see how much determination and strength he had to keep going, where most people in his situation would give up on everything. I think what's even more incredible is how he still managed to have that many children. What a champ! I think the person we should be admiring, if not even more than Steven, is his wife. If it wasn't for her, nothing would have happened. It was her that compelled him with the love that she gave him and motivation, to keep going. How committed she was to him in all aspects of his life. \n\nI think one of the most amazing things film can do is when the music and the visuals work together in unison to create a memory, an emotion if you will, that perfectly captures a moment. This movie does it with ease almost as if it came about naturally from the composer. Eddie's performance is outstanding. His commitment to playing Hawking is compelling.

            "content": "A film that exemplifies everything wrong with the ‘Great Man' biopic genre this film has a long way to go in attempting to encapsulate the brilliance and inspiration of Stephen Hawking or the odd dynamics that existed inside his strained relationship with his wife. The film takes what could have been a complex relationship drama and reduces it down to the weakest, most palatable version of this tale with all of the rough edges sanded off. At the center of the film are two highly calculated performances that are never given room to breathe and start feeling like more than stilted impressions of famed figures. I wish that just one of these biopics could have had an ounce of inspiration considering how many of them are made.\n\nAspiring astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, Eddie Redmayne, studies to gain a doctorate at the University of Cambridge where he excels in an environment that fosters his desire to learn. He finds love with languages student Jane Wilde, Felicity Jones, with whom he disagrees on many issues including religion but the two form a strong bond as they get to know one another better. His professional and romantic ambitions would appear to be dashed when he discovers he is suffering from motor neurone disease but with the support of his sweetheart he continues with his training and gains his PhD. He becomes world famous as he makes new scientific breakthroughs and his theories become popular due to the publishing of his novels. His relationship begins to suffer under the weight of his illness however and choral director Jonathan Jones, Charlie Cox, emotionally supports his wife and children before entering into a romantic relationship with Wilde. In his later years Hawking leaves Wilde for his kind nurse Elaine Mason, Maxine Peake, while it is acknowledged that his work has changed the scientific landscape.\n\nIndulging in one of my least favorite cinematic tropes, especially within this genre, the film employs Wilde not as a regular, flawed character but as a saintly figure who exists to support her talented husband. This is detrimental to the film because we spend time watching this supposedly angelic figure endure the difficulties of her husband's condition instead of considering the anger boiling up inside of her or her own self destructive desire to support those in need of extraordinary amounts of care. Wilde could have gone through a proper character arc when the opportunity for a new romance with a considerably less demanding man is introduced that would require her to value her own needs over those of others. Oh no, screenwriter Anthony McCarten says gleefully, we will instead see Hawking rather unbelievably consent to his wife's affair without a moment's consideration and include the ‘tasteful' implication of sex in a tent during a family outing. She is the character through whom most of the events in this film are viewed and because she is never a real character herself the film never has a strong perspective on it's ostensible subject and we walk away knowing little about him or her.\n\nThe performances of the two lead actors fall squarely into ‘oscar bait' territory as Jones is reminiscent of Jennifer Connelly in A Beautiful Mind (2001) and Redmayne gets to play both tortured genius and disabled person. With his pouty lips and impressionable grin Redmayne has never been my favorite actor as he always appears to be pushing too hard for emotion as opposed to simply relaxing into his role and making us believe in his actions. He jerks and writhes, delivers his lines in that irritating high voice that suggests he views the world around him with childlike wonderment but none of it feels genuine or believable. Jones seems equally lost with what little she has to do and has none of the chutzpah of other supportive wives in films of this sort. We have seen other, more talented, performers go through all this before and because these second rate hacks fail to bring anything new to the table we are left feeling as though the film itself has not been a worthwhile effort. \n\nAll in all there is really nothing to recommend the film as it boasts nothing of note and will most likely be forgotten in a matter of decades.",

It brings romance to life with vibrant blues and greens next to cinematographer Benoit Delhomme's stunning cinematography. Many images from The Theory of Everything have stuck with me. The positive outlook of Hawking's and his willful perseverance should reinvigorate any audience. \n\nJames Marsh's direction is truly gorgeous as the bright vivid colors choices, beautiful costumes, long steady shots, emotional close ups, and creative editing make The Theory of Everything one of my favorite biopics. This movie looks so bright and cleanly shot that it is a testament to great filmmaking for such an inspiring story. Marsh captures the necessary parts of Hawking's incredible life, never afraid to mention the saddest or most harrowing aspects to Professor Hawking's condition. Marsh will hold on Hawking unable to climb stairs or staring at a fire that convey a dismal situation with a respectful understanding.\n\nAdditionally, Marsh's subtle use of visual storytelling is impressive as many scenes do not even need conversation, but reveal much of the characters' feelings through their eyes, faces, and body language. Marsh is an excellent director as The Theory of Everything is a wonderful film!\n\nEddie Redmayne is simply phenomenal as Stephen Hawking. He recreates Hawking's spontaneous youth to his restricted infliction. Redmayne delivered his greatest acting performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. His accent, slurs, hindered steps, slight eye and mouth movements, and careful eye expressiveness all convene into a thoroughly convincing portrayal of the legendary theoretical physicist. Redmayne adds a likable charisma and serious thoughtfulness to the role. He is truly astonishing as Stephen Hawking.\n\nLikewise, Felicity Jones gives her best performance as an actress to date in The Theory of Everything as Jane Wilde. Her radiant personality matches her peerless wit in order to depict a believable empathy. Jones is enchanting with her lovely appearance and sympathetic face. She effectively utilizes her eyes and face to reveal a deep sadness and unhappiness in her character. She enthralls you with her kindness, patience, selflessness, and sorrow. Jones beguiles the viewer with a passionate plea for the joys of life. Felicity Jones is just dazzling like the stars in The Theory of Everything.\n\nI must mention besides the riveting direction, fascinating edits, captivating performances, and gripping narrative, The Theory of Everything enamored me with its brilliant score. The classical styling from composer Johann Johannsson is astounding. His rising crescendos and sweeping symphony brings delight and magic to The Theory of Everything. His score echoes the methodical scientific sequences alongside the mesmerizing romance passages. I simply adore Johannsson's score to The Theory of Everything!\n\nIn all, The Theory of Everything is a beautiful romance film that doubles as a shocking biopic. I believe that this film will give you hope and a better appreciation of your own life.",

            "content": "The 2014 film The Theory of Everything, based on Jane Hawking's memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, depicts the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The film does not just focus on Hawking's progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to be in a wheelchair and speak through a computer system. It shows his relationship with his ex-wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and his successes in physics. ALS is fittingly shown as just one part of Hawking's extraordinary life.\n\nThe movie has received criticism for casting Redmayne as Hawking and being \"the latest [performance] in a long line of what detractors call 'cripping up': able-bodied actors taking on disabled roles, which some critics find as deplorable as the thankfully outdated practice of white actors pretending to be black\". I too would be critical of this casting decision were it not for the special circumstances of this film.\n\nThe film is meant to reflect Jane Hawking's memoir, a story that shows Hawking's life before and after his diagnosis and through every stage of his ALS's progression. This situation is not identical to a character who is always seen in a wheelchair being played by a nondisabled actor or a character who is born blind being played by a seeing actor. When the circumstances prevent the role of a disabled character from being filled by a disabled actor, there are certain steps that must be taken to ensure that the experiences of disabled people are as accurately portrayed as possible. The Theory of Everything does a very good job of fulfilling this criteria.\n\nFirst of all, Redmayne spent over four months studying Hawking's life, watching every video he could find on him and reading books written by him. Redmayne worked with a choreographer to record and analyze every movement from picking up a pen to drinking to walking. To understand and accurately portray how the disease affected Hawking throughout the different stages, Redmayne met with over 30 people affected by ALS and viewed photographs of Hawking throughout his life.\n\nMost importantly, Hawking was consulted during every stage of the movie's production. Redmayne met with him before starting to film, and he visited the set during production. Before the movie was released, Hawking viewed the film and gave his approval.

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I thought that The Theory of Everything would take forever to tell.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Nothing to worry about, Greg. More than anything, it was a theory of something. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), a graduate student at Cambridge University in 1963. He s a gangly young man and socially awkward. He goes to a mixer where he meets young Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). She s studying the arts. The two seem to have nothing in common. But when they go to the fall gala, Stephen starts talking about the stars. Jane quotes poetry back to him. The two quickly fall in love.\n\nSCOTT: But all is not well with Stephen. He has a clumsy gait and grabs awkwardly at flatware, pens, and chalk. One day he falls flat on his face on a walkway and is sent to a doctor who diagnoses him with ALS, a deadly neurodegenerative disease. Although Stephen is given only two years to live, Jane marries him and the two make the most of the time they have together. Jane volunteers to sing in her church choir and strikes up a friendship with the choir director Jonathan (Charlie Cox). Soon Jonathan helps out with Stephen and Jane s children. But trouble is brewing in the family.\n\nGREG: Scott, this movie is problematic as it s not clear who the hero is. It looks like Stephen Hawking may be the lead character because its all about his genius and his battle with ALS. But then they quickly bring in Jane and strangely, the story seems to focus on her. Hawking become a bit of a prop, scooting around in his wheelchair. We get to see him at the chalkboard here or there, or in a lecture. But after the point where Hawking is confined to a wheelchair, this becomes Jane s story. In our book Reel Heroes: Volume 1 we break hero patterns down by the number of characters who are in the lead of the story: the lone hero, the duo, and the ensemble. And I think I have to land on this being a duo story, even though Hawking seems to fade into the background in the second half. Further, we break the duo down into the Hero/Sidekick, the Buddy Heroes, and the Divergent Heroes. And I think that last one is where Theory falls. This is the story of how two people came together and ultimately fell apart.\n\nSCOTT: I agree that Stephen and Jane are divergent heroes who travel much of the journey together but then go their separate ways. This movie tells a poignant love story of great triumph over significant obstacles - for both characters, not just for Stephen. It also tells a story about the collapse of a family and the loss of love. The film boldly portrays Stephen in a less than positive light in that he shows less loyalty to Jane than she shows him. We re presented with a realistic view of human resilience and human weakness. While I was impressed with the heartwarming story and with the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, I was a bit underwhelmed with the movie as a whole. The film ventures perilously close to Hallmark-made-for-TV territory. Moreover, we re not given any more than a fleeting glimpse of the scientific breakthroughs that Hawking is known for. I felt a bit cheated by the constant stream of puns about time that apparently (according to this movie) is the foundation of Hawking s genius. A lot of smart professors in the movie clap and shake his hand, and that s about the only indication of his greatness.\n\nGREG: I think you ve really struck the nail on the head. This was a love story. I was surprised that the teen-aged ticket taker said that she had seen this movie and it made her cry. Clearly, this movie was more aimed at an audience more interested in the relationship than the story of a man s genius. And since the title is The Theory of Everything I think we re right to feel a bit cheated that we didn t get any insights into Hawking s genius, or at least his thinking process. If there s a villain in this story it s ALS. This is the thing that is stealing Stephen s physical self. It s also the thing that promised to be done with him in two years. By some miracle, he lived and continues to live well into his seventies. And this is the diabolical turn this villain takes. At the beginning of the story we meet two young and idealistic people who are in love. Jane essentially signs up for a two-year stint. But it is the ongoing and debilitating disease that ultimately destroys their relationship. And this is truly heartbreaking.\n\nSCOTT: The Theory of Everything is a commendable story of two people whose love and loyalty carry them through decades of adversity, but alas, not forever. The movie is interesting in its focus on one of the greatest minds of our generation but there is a lack of depth here that left me wanting more. On the strength of the performances of Redmayne and Jones, I can award this film 3 Reels out of 5. The two divergent heroes travel a remarkable journey, and I was moved and impressed by these characters  strength, loyalty, and resilience. The couple does receive help along the way, and ironically two sources of help (Jonathan and Elaine) end up being the source of the couple s demise. Our two heroes travel a remarkable journey and hence I give them 4 Heroes out of 5. As you point out, Greg, the villain here is a horrid, destructive force of nature that doctors have labeled ALS. As villains go, this disease is formidable even if it isn t quite as interesting as, say, a human villain might be. As such, I will award ALS a rating of 2 Villains out of 5.  Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: The Theory of Everything doesn t deliver on the promise of its title. I kept comparing this movie with a similar story A Beautiful Mind. There are strong parallels. John Nash was a brilliant mathematician plagued by schizophrenia and was helped and supported by his wife. But Mind succeeded where Theory did not because it focused on the struggle of the hero overcoming his obstacles. Theory got divided between the struggle with the disease and the loss of the relationship. The goals of the movie were divided and that splits our attention. I give Theory just 2 out of 5 Reels. This is a divergent hero story but unlike other such heroes we ve reviewed, the focus starts on one hero and the shifts to the other. The first half of the movie is really about Stephen and the second half is about Jane. It s a weak approach and leaves us wanting more. I give this pair 3 out of 5 Heroes. Finally the villain is ALS (or time itself) and is not given much screen time. We watch Stephen lose more and more physical ability, but we really don t see much about the disease or how he overcomes it. What we do see is how Jane is increasingly overwhelmed having to take care of not just their three children, but Hawking as well. I give ALS 3 out of 5 Villains.  Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

Hello Kiddies your pal The Cupid Critic here with the true life story of Jayne and Stephen Hawkin told mostly through the eyes of Jayne as she struggles to help her husband through over the years. What I like mostly about this picture is that its told through the eyes of two people. We see the toll it takes on Jayne trying to help her husband over the years through the tremendous acting of Felicity Jones. They could have easily alienated one of the two but no they don't. I love the first thirty minutes where Stephen is well and can walk and the time they share together is beautiful and its shot beautifully as well by director James Marsh. We can see how much of an impact Jayne makes on Stephen as well, I loved this film for that and I hope it wins for something at Oscars. I give The Theory of Everything a five out of five.",

No doubt Stephen found in Jane, their three beautiful kids, a supportive family, caring friends and last but not least his subscription of Penthouse magazine the courage and interests in life to face every day as a cripple and one dependent on people for everything from feeding to ablutions for the rest of his life. Eddie Redmayne played Professor Hawkins brilliantly and one could see why he was the prohibitive Oscar winner, just as Daniel Day Lewis was the prohibitive winner for My Left Foot.

            "content": "If you dumped a bucket of ice water over your head this past summer, you're (hopefully) well aware of the ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING tells the story of the world's most famous theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Stephen W. Hawking, from his time as an able-bodied Ph. D. student at Cambridge University in the early 1960s, his relationship with his girlfriend and later wife Jane, his personal and professional challenges over the years dealing with his ALS affliction, and up to his receiving the Companion of Honour from Queen Elizabeth II in 1989.\n\nThe film is adapted from Jane Hawking's 2008 memoir, Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen. As the film opens, we see Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) as a wild and carefree student, coxing the university's rowing team, leaving his school work to the last possible moment, and going to coed parties. It is at one such party where he meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who is also at Cambridge, where she is reading Spanish literature. On the surface, they seem like chalk and cheese. She's a devout member of the \"COE\" (Church of England); he has \"a slight problem with the celestial dictatorship premise.\" But Jane falls for Stephen's geeky confidence and the two start dating. It is not long after, when his body begins to fail him, that his doctor gives him the bad news - he has, at most, two years left to live. Jane doesn't care and decides to marry him anyway, promising to look after him for as long as he is alive.\n\nLittle did she know at the time that Hawking would defy all expectations and live well beyond that prognosis. As the disease continues to ravage his body, Hawking goes from relying on one cane to two to being forced to use a wheelchair. Feeding himself becomes increasingly difficult until it becomes impossible. His mind, however, is just as sharp as ever and he completes his doctorate. Jane, meanwhile, has to forego her own doctorate studies to look after Stephen and their children. As Hawking tells a friend, not every part of his body is affected.\n\nWhile at a conference in France in 1985, Hawking contracts pneumonia and, once again, the doctors give him no chance of survival. Jane, however, insists that her husband will recover, which he does. The price of that recovery, though, is a tracheotomy which leaves the physicist unable to speak on his own. Fortunately, American Walt Woltosz comes along and he provides Hawking with an \"Equalizer\", the world's first portable speech synthesizer - the method of communication Hawking uses even today. (Woltosz built the Equalizer for his own mother, who had also suffered from ALS.)\n\nYears of looking after Hawking's needs takes its toll on Jane though. At her mother's suggestion, she joins a church choir where she strikes up a platonic relationship with the choirmaster, the recently widowed Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox). When Jane decides to finally complete her degree, Hawking agrees to hire external help. Hawking takes a shining to one caregiver, Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake), who seems only too pleased to turn the pages of his Penthouse magazine for him. It's only a matter of time before the Hawkings' marriage falls apart and the two separate in 1990. (They divorced in 1995.)\n\nThere is a fine line a director has to walk if he/she is going to make a film about a character with a physical disability. If the story is too teary, it risks being a sob fest. Not teary enough, and there isn't an emotional connection to the characters. The latter is the problem I have with THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. At its heart, this film is a love story, albeit a very complicated one. But there is something too clinical about the story. We don't feel either of their pain. The science-y parts are cinematically reduced to swirling coffee cups, fireworks in reverse and a blazing fire as viewed through a wool sweater. Similarly, the disability parts are limited to seeing Hawking's body atrophy as the disease progresses. There are no scenes of Jane spoon-feeding Stephen, putting him in the bathtub or cleaning him up after he goes to the toilet. The story could have benefitted from a bit of tasteful schmaltz - but just a bit.\n\nBut this is my only beef and THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING really is a good film thanks to the competent performances from both Redmayne and Jones. Together they elevate the film from what could easily have been movie-of-the-week melodrama to something artful and entertaining. I predict that the two actors, as well as the director (James Marsh, MAN ON WIRE), will take home BAFTAs (R) in February. \n\nFree up some \"space\" in your calendar and go see this film. It's definitely worth your \"time\". That's my pun for the week.",

            "content": "For over one hundred years the silver screen has been bringing us stories that chronicle the lives of well-known individuals; some choose to veer off the facts for a more entertaining viewing experience whilst others are often inspiring in their nature. The Theory of Everything is the newest addition to the long line of biographical films and it's another moving example of why the genre has endured for so long.\n\nThe Theory of Everything (based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Hawking) follows the life and exploits of Professor Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) as he deals with the sudden onset and progression of motor neurone disease, the relationship with his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) and his studies and theories of astro-physics. Beginning in 1963, we are taken through the entirety of Stephen's adult life and are given full witness to the pressures and struggles he and his wife endured over the years. Their bond is kept as a central focus at all times with Stephen's family life and contributions to science running alongside, allowing the film's emotional scenes to draw immense sympathy and even a hint of heartbreak from the audience. Yet just as Stephen feels intense frustration at first and then accepts and learns to transcend his condition, so too will audiences move beyond the sad nature of Hawking's situation and be instilled with a feeling of hopefulness; the final scenes especially are filled to burst with emotional resonance, seamlessly putting across the film's inspirational message. The film also integrates the theme of science verses religion at certain points, with the intellectual dialogue drawing the viewer in even more. Audiences will be endlessly drawn to Hawking's tale; between the titular professor's seemingly impassable constraints and ultimate overcoming of difficulties, The Theory of Everything is delightfully absorbing from start to finish.\n\nLooking at the film's production details reveals that Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones spent quite a bit of time learning their roles and the results are something to behold; with a combination of facial expressions, muffled speech and awkward movements, Redmayne comes as close as possible to the real Stephen Hawking, delivering an uncompromising and compelling performance all around. By contrast to Redmayne's restricted expressions, Jones conveys a great range of emotions for Stephen's wife; most notably her determined and resilient nature in being with Stephen and promising to beat his condition. But despite her steadfast dedication to Stephen, Jane isn't a perfect individual; she does feel the frustration and pressure starting to mount and she does come to question just how long her marriage to Stephen will last. These are the kinds of performances which are both highly relatable and reinforce the film's realistic portrayal of its source material. The side characters played by the likes of David Thewlis and Maxine Peake make good use of the material they're given and never distract from the central chemistry between Redmayne and Jones. The cast members are every bit as engaging as the plot they inhabit and are most definitely the greatest aspect of the film.\n\nDespite being a drama as opposed to a genre with rapid cuts and framing, The Theory of Everything also mixes in its own style of cinematography. To link in with the film's scientific undertones, the camera often spins and homes in on circular objects to reflect Stephen's theories of space and time, which transports the viewer into the inner workings of his mind. The music is a delicate blend of emotive undertones and hopeful rises, perfectly complimenting Stephen's climb from frustration to overcoming the greatest of personal challenges. The make-up and costuming team also deserve high praise for their authentic designs and the very convincing way in which they show both Stephen and his wife aging and changing over 30 long years. Technical presentation isn't really such a major component in dramas but The Theory of Everything takes pride in going the extra mile to engage the audience that much more.\n\nThe Theory of Everything has a heartfelt and emotional story, a symbolic cinematic style, and brilliant characters brought to life by the outstanding performances of Redmayne and Jones, culminating in the first big hit of 2015. As an inspiring biopic on an extraordinary individual, it has very few equals.",

            "content": "The following is a brief review of singularity in cinema, the life of Stephen Hawking from his college days to the publication of his theory on the universe.  The movie begins in 1963, we get an insight into the everyday life of a young genius, he's fun, he's flirty, he's a messer just like most young college kids. His charm and intellect captures the heart of the poetically sensitive Jane Wilde and love begins to bloom, but the tide soon turns on Hawking as he's diagnosed with motor neuron disease and given two years to live. Hawking comes to terms with his mortality over a game of croquet with the very lovable Jane, I have to say I don't really understand croquet very well so I think I missed out on some of Hawking's game but he ends up with the girl in his bedroom so he obviously plays it just right. I think the rest of the movie plays out a little like 'Love & Other Drugs' but it replaces risqué romance with risqué mathematics. All in all the film is a slow moving drama, it's concerned with the decline of the human body when afflicted with Motor Neuron, it's about changing views in science, the depth of the cosmos and the more complicated intricacies of love. \n\nThere's a brief Michael Jackson moment where Hawking is left holding his baby and you're not sure what's going to happen, but other than that the film doesn't really deliver on suspense. The movie doesn't challenge the various relationships that develop within the household and fails to really deliver on the science kicks, it's too appeasing to be entertaining and you'll get more insight on the life of Hawking from Wikipedia. The movie is well acted and pays huge respect to a man who's dedicated his life to scientific development, but if your inclined to see the film I'd recommend waiting for the DVD or for free-view tv to pick it up because it's not going to have you on the edge of your seat, it's not going to change your life and it's just not worth venturing to the cinema to see. \nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

Black holes and the beginning of time largely being summarised by swirling coffee and sparks in an open fire. In this terrific biopic, the director concentrates instead on the very different story of Hawking and his relationship with his first wife Jane during the onset and progression of his motor neurone disease. Both leads, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are superb as the central protagonists. Redmayne won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the cosmologist and it is perhaps easy to overlook the brilliance of Jones' performance. This is a moving story about how love can conquer every obstacle but that is doesn't necessarily always turn out in the way we would have expected. I was left with a great feeling of admiration for the former Mrs Hawking who with her sometimes uncompromisingly English way of dealing with her husband's illness, did much to ensure that this brilliant man achieved as much as he has done to date.",

            "content": "The life of Stephen Hawking makes for an amazing story, which probably explains why Hollywood finally got onboard and put together 'The Theory of Everything.' The elegant biopic, directed by James Marsh, is a look at the trials and tribulations Dr. Hawking and his family endured as he was diagnosed with ALS.\n\nIn 'Everything,' Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones light up the screen as Stephen and Jane Hawking. Their story is told from the beginning of their relationship, when they met at a party at the University of Cambridge. From the beginning, Stephen and Jane are the definition of opposites attracting, and a central point of 'Everything' is the duality between religion (Jane's Christian faith) and science (Stephen's constant conquest for solving the origin of the universe). This theme surfaces at multiple points, and helps to humanize the two of them. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but no one even comes close to distracting the audience from Redmayne and Jones (Redmayne of course won an Academy Award for his portrayal).\n\nOther elements that help 'Everything' include a simple, yet touching soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. While it's a dialogue-heavy film and there isn't a whole lot of \"excitement\" to speak of, that does not detract from the story that is told. There are no scenes that feel like a waste of time, and importantly, 'Everything' does not turn into a bloated vanity project, which is what happens to many similar films. Fortunately, Dr. Hawking's life is interesting and the central role that his family plays in the film is definitely touching to see.\n\n'The Theory of Everything' garnered quite a bit of Oscar buzz last year, and for good reason. While few actually saw the film in theaters, it will likely build a larger audience from here on out.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Hier die traurige und frustrierende Ironie von The Theory Of Everything, des Biopics über Stephen Hawking: Hawking, berühmt für die ungewöhnlichen, risikofreudigen Wege, die seine Forschung bestimmten, bekommt den denkbar konventionellsten Film, der jedem Risiko aus dem Weg geht. Regisseur James Marsh kratzt allenfalls an der Oberfläche des Autoren von A Brief History of Time, ohne auch nur einen Versuch zu unternehmen, tiefer zu graben. Ein Film, der einfach nur alle Erwartungen erfüllt und am Ende - ganz gut funktioniert. Eddie Redmayne spielt Hawking nicht nur als aussergewöhnlichen Wissenschaftler, sondern auch als leidenschaftlichen Mann. Nie hat der Anfang Dreissigjährige so überzeugend eine so komplexe Figur gespielt - ich wünschte nur, der Film hätte mehr hergegeben für seine Kunst. Die unermüdliche Hingabe, Liebe und Unterstützung von Jane Hawking wird dargestellt von Felicity Jones. Jane ist eine Figur voller Grazie, aber auch Stärke. Was musste diese Frau nur durchmachen: Sie zog drei Kinder gross, während sie ihren Mann im Rollstuhl betreute. Nebenbei unternahm sie noch ihre eigenen intellektuellen Aktivitäten. Es muss hart gewesen zu sein, das alles zu schlucken, doch davon sehen wir nur wenig im Film. Jane muss eine Heilige gewesen sein! Die frühen Szenen des Kennenlernens von Stephen und Jane sind die schönsten. Beide sprühen vor Energie und ergänzen sich gegenseitig. Alles scheint möglich für das brillante Paar - bis Stephen auf dem Campus zusammenbricht. Die Ärzte geben ihm nur noch zwei Jahre. Er will Jane verlassen, doch sie besteht auf die Beziehung, egal was kommt. Stephens Körper wird schwächer, schliesslich spricht er durch einen Computer, um sich mitzuteilen - sein Verstand aber arbeitet weiterhin scharf. Da Stephen sich andererseits beginnt, wie ein Kind aufzuführen, nimmt ihre Ehe einen irreparablen Schaden. Beide sind offen für andere Partner. Der Film wagt es aber kaum, diese neuen Beziehungen näher zu zeigen, sondern weicht aus. Gibt es eine passende Metapher für The Theory Of Everything? Vielleicht ist es Ganzheit?

            "content": "The Theory of Everything wants to be a serious, important film full of ACTING and EMOTION. It wants to weave together science, faith, and love in a way that's accessible and touching. And it wants to prove that the human spirit can overcome anything.\n\nAll it really accomplishes is demonstrating that Benoît Delhomme is one of the most underrated cinematographers working today. Director James Marsh's film is lovely looking, but it's sorely lacking anything that doesn't feel cliche, misleading, or inert. Eddie Redmayne is...fine. Felicity Jones is...fine. The screenplay, score, Marsh's direction...all fine. But it's hard to feel inspired watching this movie. Everyone seems like they're going through the motions, hitting all the beats someone deemed necessary to make the audience feel some feels.\n\nThe film is a biopic chronicling some of the life of world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (Redmayne). We meet him as a young student, brilliant but cocky. He's interested in finding a unifying \"theory of everything,\" something that binds the laws of quantum mechanics (micro) with the laws of general relativity (macro), when he meets Jane Wilde (Jones), a God-fearing young woman who clicks with Hawking despite their opposing sets of values.\n\nNot long after their meeting, however, Hawking collapses. His doctor tells him he's suffering from a motor neuron disease (one that's similar to ALS) which will rob him of all muscular function but leave his brain unaffected. He's given two years to live. Wilde is offered an out, but she won't have it. She does love Stephen and vows to be with him, care for him for as long as they have together. So they marry and have a few children, and Stephen continues his work-physically handicapped but as mentally sharp as ever-unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThe film is at its best when it's simple. Its first 20 minutes tell a delicate story about a man and woman laying the groundwork of a relationship with potential. Two gentle souls date, meet their families, and learn about the other's interests. It's nothing new, but it's very well-executed.\n\nPerhaps that's why the rest of the film's running time-when you're being blugeoned to death by overcooked ham-feels interminable. From the moment Hawking is diagnosed, the film falls into a series of predictable and socially regressive traps. Conversation about a suffering wife's faithfulness? Check. Diminishing complex science by using everyday objects as examples? Check. \"Love conquers all\" platitudes? Check.\n\nBut those platitudes (handled so uniquely in Interstellar...seriously, anyone doubting Nolan's ability to script emotional plausibly need only watch this film to observe the power of what he pulled off) are unproven before the film even reaches its conclusion. A Brief History of Time-Errol Morris' great Hawking doc-went there, but I wasn't sure Marsh and company would. That said, every line is phrased in a way that prevents the audience from feeling anything other than exactly what the filmmakers want them to. The Theory of Everything's final act could have been really interesting, but all that is eschewed for overcoming-the-odds biopic sappiness.\n\nEddie Redmayne gives a performance that's impressive physically, but his Hawking, even in older age, is just a boy. It's disappointing because Hawking's life is such an astounding one, and this film covers more than thirty years, yet Redmayne never lends his character the gravitas the film's second half so desperately needs.\n\nFelicity Jones is better than her co-star on that front, but she's let down by a screenplay that never sees her character as more than a facilitator. She helps a (male) genius do his genius work, but when she's afforded a chance to talk about something other than her husband or the man she's accused of being unfaithful with, she is forced to demonstrate scientific principles on the level of a fifth-grader.\n\nTechnically, the film features some great cinematography, as I've mentioned, as well as a decent, delicate score from composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. But ultimately, there's very little inspiring about The Theory of Everything. It's content being a straightforward biopic because it assumes its emotional power is enough to overcome the trappings of the genre. It doesn't, and its startling lack of originality makes it come across as lazy. What a shame.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/the-theory-of-everything-review/",

            "content": "Você já assistiu a um filme tão perfeito a ponto de sua grandiosidade ser absurdamente indescritível? Bem, penso que esse é o caso perfeito, mesmo possuindo seus defeitos menores. Pra começar, gostaria de tentar explicar sobre o que se trata o filme, já que muitas pessoas podem ter uma repentina aversão ao fato de ser um filme sobre um físico, no caso, Stephen Hawking. The Theory of Everything nos mostra a vida de Hawking por uma outra perspectiva, a perspectiva de Jane, sua esposa e mulher que dedicou boa parte de sua vida ao marido. Acredito que eu nem precise dizer quem é Stephen Hawking, pois sei que mesmo se você não é uma daquelas listas telefônicas vivas, que lembram do nome exato até o telefone celular da avó da pessoa, você tem uma noção de quem é esse cara. 5 palavras, 1 voz melódica, acústica e mecânica: CADEIRA - DE - RODAS - QUE - FALA. Pronto, você já se lembrou de Hawking e agora posso dar continuidade à reseca. Stephen era/é um homem da ciência, cosmólogo de primeira e responsável por apresentar à ciência conceitos até então inexplicados, como a Singularidade e o modo como funciona um Buraco Negro. Jane, por outro lado, possuía uma alma poética e estudava francês, espanhol e poesias da Idade Medieval. Até então parece uma daquelas canções melodramáticas como Eduardo e Mônica, da Legião, mas é bem por aí que funciona o negócio. J. Marsh - diretor do Filme - \"brinca\" não só com a física do filme, de modo que manipula o tempo totalmente a seu favor, mas também brinca com as tonicidades do drama, indo do mais teórico ceticismo ao intenso emocional. Isto, é claro, sendo nos apresentado de forma magistral por TODO o elenco, sem exceções. Pode-se resumir o começo do filme como uma chuva de conceitos físicos sobre a pseudo 'origem do Universo', com Hawking e seu clube dos cuecas tentando encontrar uma Teoria de Tudo. Essas teses, teorias que nos são apresentadas de maneira bem superficial servem perfeitamente para construir toda a estrutura do filme. É estranho pensar que algo relacionado às Ciências Exatas possa ser tão subjetivo e cheio de \"furos\", que creio eu terem sido intencionais, que pudessem ser preenchidos com a genialidade de cada espectador. Um elemento bastante discutido no filme é a existência de Deus e a sua influênca sobre a vida e o Universo. Se Deus é o criador de tudo, inclusive do universo, ele também será responsável pelo seu fim, se é que podemos dizer que existirá um fim. No final, temos o que é pra mim a melhor sequência de todas, com a Singularidade nos mostrando o quão grande foi o amor de Jane por Stephen, abrindo mão de tudo em prol do bem do marido.. O Amor, assim como Deus, o Universo e o Tempo, talvez não precise de uma equação exata, afinal, qual o nosso problema de querer resumir a essência da vida em uma única e fria sequência de números?\n\n\"Deus não só joga dados com o Universo, como os joga onde não podemos ver.\" - Stephen Hawking",

I realized that that computer tone, for one reason or another, represents a higher learning and understanding of ethereal concepts and lofty thinking.\n\nThis playing of Stephen's life, essentially, also made me realize how my thinking of Stephen Hawking has changed as I've learned about him and understood how his life has changed as well. The film is absolutely beautiful; the cinematography and drama laces together so perfectly and the time passes effortlessly over the course of Stephen's life. First and foremost the film is about Jane and Stephen, and THEN how motor neuron disease affects them. That turn hits so early, like in the first 20 minutes, where Stephen trips and gets his diagnosis, which is GREAT - i love a film that is almost exposition-less and gets right to the interesting parts.\n\nI think there's a lot to learn about patience and dedication from Jane and Stephen's relationship - if you put yourself outside of the situation and look at what it means to be a loving and forgiving partner you'll see that being caring and taking care of each other is far and away the most important part of being supportive and significant.\n\nThe other huge takeaway was the wonderful score; god, it supported the story and transitions so well. It's also interesting how time is so integral to a film and how Stephen's studies and theorizing fold into his life and then the exploration at the end (you'll have to see it to know) really brings the whole story full circle.\n\nIt's such an interesting mind and character that Eddie Redmayne brings to life as Hawking; he never loses his humor and insight and in his final monologue at the end of the movie, it really hits you how influential his work has been over the course of his life. He's really a visionary mind that the world will sorely miss when he's gone.\n\nNot worth the theater, but worth your time. Don't be foolish - see this soon!",

When he divorced her, no allegations of abuse of him on her part were made, but once again he started to maintain a closer relationship with his family.

Years down the line, with Hawking a physical wreck, she falls for the widower priest who leads the choir.

It's a well-made movie, focusing on his relationship with his first wife with whom they have three children. \n\nIt's more or less a film about a relationship where one of the two partners is seriously ill and the other tries to support and be there. And then again, it's not completely about that. It seems to me that the intention was to portray this, but with SH being who he is, it could not be just a movie about his relationship. They had to have some background about him and his work. But then, incorporating this in the film, it inevitably took away time and depth from the depiction of the relationship and all its ups and downs. \n\nThe result for me is indeed a touching movie with all the elements there, or at least most of them, and with an amazing role being performed in the best way possible. Apart from that, it seems that the movie remains superficial around the topics of the relationship, leaving out many elements of the cruel reality that could serve the purpose of the movie. We never got to find out how they coped, we never got to find out about the actual and real problems of the couple and the children. They are being heavily implied but not tackled with directly. Instead of that, the movie just shows the picture of Professor SH running around on his chair with the children hanging from it. \n\nI also missed the participation of the respective families in this or the declaration of their absence. His father and mother seem really distant from everything else other than some family gatherings, which looks odd when we do not have any indication of them having some tension or problems in their relationship. I mean, if your child goes through that, you are there the whole time, something we never saw in the movie. \n\nDon't let me be misunderstood, I really loved the movie. But, I would expect something more from it, given that it does have a really interesting and powerful story in its core. My problem is that in a way the director or maybe the script writer, chose the mainstream/in between path, of creating a film that shows a little bit of everything to capture diverse audiences, whereas this film should be about the relationship in all its depth and width... \n\nI would highly recommend watching it! And if a comparison could be made with the Imitation Game, which kind of resembles it in a way, I would give thumbs up to the Imitation Game any day of the week.",

The story is less about physics than about human relationships (check Errol Morris's A Brief History of Time for a bit more science) and it plays pretty well given the heightened emotions that motor neuron disease adds to the story.  Somehow it is hard to believe that Hawking is 72 now.  At any rate, it is probably a stereotype-breaker to see Hawking as sexually active and leaving his wife for his nurse, but it really happened (with no ill will apparently).

His physical transformation is astonishing, but is enhanced by the humour and energy he evokes from Hawking's character. And he is at least matched in a much less showy performance by Felicity Jones, who anchors everything through the film (based on Jane Hawking's book).\n\nThere are some lovely scenes, and the film does skirt around some of the less cosy aspects of the real-life story. Despite cramming decades into the film, it also felt a bit long for me. Perhaps that's where the 'less-than-extraordinary' aspects of the film finally outweighed the compelling performances.",

I wish the film could have incorporated more of Hawking's ideas, which I think could have been done without throwing off the emotional arc of the film.  And ultimately the sentiments seem a little too easy and one-sided, by which I mean the overwhelming goodness of the characters is not entirely believable in this sanitized treatment.

And there's no better time to release a good story, well told, than while awards show voters are starting to think about which films and performances to place on their nomination ballots. \"The Theory of Everything\" (PG-13, 2:03) is a story of love and logic that takes us on a journey through the relationship of Jane and Stephen Hawking and through his quest to explain the mysteries of our universe with verifiable formulas and provable theories, even as disease gradually robs him of all muscular control.\n\nStephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) are students at England's Cambridge University when these two opposites attract. He's a gangly PhD candidate with perpetually dirty glasses and unkempt hair. She's a pretty and confident fellow student pursuing a degree in the literature of the Iberian Peninsula. Oh, and he's an avowed atheist, while she's a faithful member of the Church of England. But none of those differences seem to matter as love blossoms. It's a love so romantic and deep that not even Hawking's ALS diagnosis and a prediction of his death in about two years can derail it. The couple marries and ends up having three children together. He, of course, lives much more than two more years and her self-sacrificial devotion enables him to earn his doctorate and pursue some of the most important scientific research of the 20th Century, culminating with his best-selling book \"A Brief History of Time\".\n\nThe story is based on Jane Hawking's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\" and takes its title from an unauthorized compilation of Hawking's research as he looks for a single formula which would tie together the main fields of study within physics. The stories of Jane and Stephen's relationship and Stephen's work are interwoven so that the two narrative threads are inseparable, as they were in real life. Stephen's deteriorating condition is dramatically portrayed, but not exploited. The story of their marriage is both uplifting and unsettling, as both partners provide what the other needs, but each of their hearts eventually drifts toward another.\n\n\"The Theory of Everything\" is both realistic and artistic. The skillfully told story is laid out with exceptional emotional depth by both of the leads and by the extraordinary commitment on the part of Redmayne to portray Stephen Hawking's physical and vocal deterioration with both accuracy and Hawking's characteristic humor and well-known humanity. At a few points in the movie, director James Marsh uses a subtle color tinting in his cinematography to help enhance the mood of the scene. He also gives the movie an ending that is perfectly suited to the subject matter. Although, the film has a few dull moments, most of it is positive, enlightening and beautiful to behold. I'm giving \"The Theory of Everything\" an \"A-\", and I'll be looking for it and for the names of Redmayne and Jones on nomination lists during the fast-approaching awards season.",

The cinematography is very good as well. The costume design is great. The pacing is very good. One of my problems with the film is that I wish there would have been some more background on the characters. There are some poor scene cuts. Also I thought the film at points focused a little to much on Felicity Jones' character and didn't put enough focus on Redmayne.

            "content": "Ph.D. student Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is given news that he has two years to live. After a thorough examination, doctors conclude that he has a motor neuron disease which will inevitably result to gradual muscle decay, wasting away, and his ability to control voluntary movement will be lost entirely. We all know that Dr. Hawking will surpass the given life expectancy and so one of the challenges of the film, adapted to the screen by Anthony McCarten from Jane Hawking's memoir, is to construct an arc that feels complete, from the moment Hawking received the terrible news until the publication of his book, \"A Brief History of Time.\"\n\nThroughout the course of the picture, I admired Redmayne's very human performance. He is able to turn a renowned astrophysicist into just another person afflicted by a disease that has no cure and yet provide colorful, complex layers, especially during the final third in which the subject is no longer able to speak. I imagined how difficult it must have been to play the character convincingly because every limb and facial expression must be on point-even if the camera is capturing images only from the chest up.\n\nTo be consistent in his portrayal take after take must have required a lot of effort, research, and determination. The way he is able to contort his face and fingers appears highly uncomfortable but nonetheless convincing. To top it off, not once does Redmayne forget to communicate with his eyes. They are always strong and alive even when the character's body is weak and frail.\n\nI was surprised and disappointed that the picture is not really about the science behind Hawking's theories. There are some science, simplistic enough to be understood by laymen but still interesting enough for those who would like to know more. The movie is more about the relationship between Stephen and Jane (Felicity Jones) and the love they shared. Although their partnership comes across as too glossy at times, there are enough moments of honesty that are painful, like Jane having to push herself to be with Stephen in their later years even if it no longer felt right. The push-and-pull between Jane wanting to stay and leave is great drama because it is essentially a question of doing the right thing. But for whom?\n\nAlthough the score is a bit overbearing at times, the picture is beautifully photographed. The first half is bathed in a bright yellow glow, signifying optimism, youth, a surplus of energy and inspiration to tackle what the world has to offer head-on. The second half, on the other hand, is considerably less saturated, as if to reflect the subject's physical decay. The characters move a little slower, their faces more saggy, a bit grey. A certain level of acceptance is in the air.\n\n\"The Theory of Everything\" is able to hone in on what is important to Stephen and Jane, together and respectively, and that is why it works. I felt a bit of dread when I began to realize that the romance would comprise about half of the running time. Instead, it surprised me because I grew to invest in Jane and Stephen as a couple, that romance is not just reflected in maintaining a marriage but in the compatibility of souls.\n\nFilm-Review.org",

At first I felt like the Theory of Everything is one of those movies that is almost worthy of the nomination, but that it was only nominated since up to 10 movies can now be nominated for that Oscar. Now after looking at the list again and having seen all those films nominated for best picture, Theory of Everything triumphs over The Imitation Game, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and American Sniper - perhaps even Selma.\n\nI still think the two strongest films of the year were Birdman and Whiplash, but the acting in The Theory of Everything is phenomenal, especially Eddie Redmayne's performance as the brilliant yet handicapped Stephen Hawking. I felt guilty nearly giggling at Hawking's speech impediment when it is first introduced in the film, but shortly after realized it is how the physicist actually had to speak and that Redmayne must have a true gift to be able to recreate such a severe handicap.\n\nWhile I realize the purpose of this film was primarily the romance between Hawking and Jane, his wife who he eventually leaves, I would have liked to see more of Hawking's theory/work or at least see more into the theory with specific details. We have a film about one of the most intelligent people who ever lived, but the filmmakers wanted to dumb down Hawking's theory and his discoveries to \"benefit\" the audience.\n\nI'm not sure how I would have liked to see the film end, but I thought it was strange to have Hawking acknowledge his wife and family so abruptly after leaving Jane towards the conclusion of the film. It is a sentimental moment, but it is brief and simple before a \"rewinding\" sequence which looks back on the film (the lives of the two lovers) as a whole. A strong relationship story, but I would have liked to see more about the theory instead of that becoming disregarded for the sake of the love story.",

            "content": "Who really is Stephen Hawking? â?? That is the question you should really ask of this man who has made his mark on the world both scientifically and personally. Many will be able to recognise the name Stephen Hawking and even remember his wheelchair-bound appearance, yet not many people will be able to elaborate on his scientific endeavours or his personal struggles. So it appears that the world needs a nourishing of knowledge as to who really was this great scientific mind of the last 50 years. There are no visual depictions of Stephen Hawking therefore now at the age of 72, it seems apt that his life should be hailed scientifically and investigated personally as to how he experienced his physical transformation. Well, 2015 has just begun and brought along a film exploring the younger transformative years of Hawking up until his worldwide recognition as a disabled genius.\n \nJames Marshâ??s The Theory of Everything falls into the category of a biopic, and considering the life of Stephen Hawking encompasses 50 eventful years starting form his university career at Cambridge to his scientific breakthroughs of black holes, The Theory of Everything does just about enough to satisfy your understanding of the enigma that is Stephen Hawking. The film explores Hawkingâ??s relationship with a fellow student Jane Wilde perhaps a little too over-zealously, his tragic physical deterioration as a result of his Motor Neurone disease gradually paralysing him and his scientific endeavours that have shaped modern cosmology. The Theory of Everything places so much emphasis on Hawking and Wildeâ??s relationship that it has shaped the film as a romantic-led drama. Often, romantic-dramaâ??s are the paramount amalgamation of boredom, but this film manages to keep its head just above water and produce an intriguing depiction that enriches your knowledge of Stephen Hawking.\n \nEddie Redmayne, star of Les MisÃ©rables and My Week With Marilyn, literally buries himself into the role of Stephen Hawking as by the end all you see is the scientific genius himself. Redmayneâ??s physical transformation is truly a marvellous piece of acting as he scene by scene excellently calculates Hawkingâ??s gradual frailties making his downfall appear realistically tragic. Redmayne needed to accustom himself to the habits of Hawking in order to even attempt the role. He has transformed his stature, his voice, his movements but most importantly has still managed to retain the genius of his thoughts by always appearing aware of situations even though he looks unresponsive. It is a real struggle to watch him do his interpretation because it looks so real, or even better, someone real actually went through this same problem and is still going through it. This is a truly visceral performance that towers over the film by instigating all its success as it plays such an integral part in the filmâ??s course of action. Felicity Jones stars as the female lead, Jane Wilde. Not taking anything away from Redmayne but she is the audienceâ??s connection to the ever-deteriorating Hawking and actually is most of the time the only one resuming normal acting duties and boy does she do a good job at it. Jonesâ?? character faces a delicately stringent dilemma that could tarnish her reputation as a patient, loving wife even though she has endured more than anybody has seen of her. After 25-years of tiring struggles, no one can blame her if she wants just a little bit of action! Jones is truly captivating as the lead woman whose aura of boldness and power grows as her husband physically declines. Jonesâ?? performance excels as a woman that has performed the miracle of patience. Both Redmayne and Jones are the engines to this movie and without their Golden Globe nominated performances; The Theory of Everything would truly suffer.\n \nThe Theory of Everything is essentially divided into two genres: romance and drama. The romantic aspect of the film is perhaps a little too overly-incorporated into the film that it directs which road of his life to head down. Yes it does teach us the personal life of Hawking and the woman that endured his transformation, but the filmâ??s digression into romantic territory has undoubtedly impacted the scientific side of his life. The film makes you feel the love between two people who have been through a hellish struggle together but their relationship lacks a bite to it as it never fluctuates and always remains on the same level. Their romance is disappointing, but you canâ??t manoeuvre real life for cinematic benefit. However, there is an emotional ode to their relationship and this is perhaps the best scene in the film because it feels so real and heart-rendering making the experience seem worth it. The drama side of proceedings formulates itself as extremely tough viewing at some points of his physical change. You end up becoming bogged down in its tragic depictions of his physical downfall but because you know there is a positive outcome to this story you try not to fall into dreariness. Thus, The Theory of Everything is a moving film that lacks an ending because the story still lives on and that is testament to how remarkable Hawking is as a person as he has defeated obstacles continuously for the last 50 years. Romance and drama donâ??t go hand in hand as both are powerful genres on their own and need a lot of time for exploration. As a result, the film touches over things and never really explores anything that isnâ??t romantically involved. There should be more about the science Hawking is most known for, but his breakthroughs in science are merely mulled over and employed as a foil to his physical capitulation as the unknown hope the universe radiates is mirrored in his conditionâ??s unpredictability.\n \nIt is a polished looking film that despite its harsh subject matter appears bright and hopeful. It is brightly lit giving it an almost glowing appearance symbolising The Theory of Everything as a film of hope and belief that even through inconsolably despondent times, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. This metaphoric understanding demonstrates that the film has utilised everything as a means to comprehend his personal life rather than know what Stephen stands for scientifically. As a result, the film drags for long periods because it swallows you in its shiny-looking despondency. Both the lack of humorous output to dumb down the filmâ??s intensity and whining instrumentals to accompany despondent scenes truly brings you down a lot that when the film is 1 hour and a half in, you canâ??t wait for the end because the uplifting moments become overshadowed by the barrage of negativity in Hawkingâ??s life. The only thing that keeps you feeling upbeat about Hawkingâ??s life is that he is still alive today and has made monumental strides in our scientific understandings of the universe. The Theory of Everything intently explores the personal downfall of Hawkingâ??s physical abilities, but what would have suited Hawkingâ??s story is a more fervent display of his scientific prowess; a contribution most people would recognise him for but struggle to explain exactly what he has done.\n \nThe Theory of Everything is an intriguing insight into the personal life of Stephen Hawking brilliantly acted by Eddie Redmayne, but this insight would have fascinated further if it payed more attention into the science that made him famous.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        6/10",

Eddie Redmayne's commendable performance does little to make Hawking appear like anything less than an eccentric madman, without much in the way of reasoned genius.\n\nThere's another, somewhat unavoidable problem with the film. Stephen Hawking is an atheist. This is a dramatic film. Mostly only old people see dramatic films. Old people are not atheists. The film portrayed some portions of Hawking's life strangely and seemed to play a lot to old people's religious sensibilities by ridiculing his (lack of) beliefs.\n\nThe best parts of the movie focus on the personal battles of the acclaimed physicist, specifically his struggle with ALS.

            "content": "The Theory of Everything is a truly remarkable film about one of the most remarkable men who has ever lived. Eddie Redmayne puts down one of the best performances of the year with his representation of physicist Stephen Hawking. \n\nThe film begins with Stephen Hawking about to complete his thesis topic. He meets Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones) and the two instantly start to fall in love.  From the start you see the progression of Lou Gehrig's disease in Redmayne's performance. Starting with small limps, awkward pen holding, clumsiness, and shakiness it culminates in a fall on the way to class. Doctors tell Hawking he only has two years to live and takes the news very hard.\n\nWilde stands by his side during all of this and tells him of her love. The two get married and have children. All of this occurs while Hawking's body muscles continues to degrade from him having to use crutches to the eventual use of an electric wheel chair. Redmayne plays the struggle to speak and move brilliantly. You can see the pain and sadness with each progression.\n\nFelicity Jones does an excellent job in her own right. Portraying someone in love who struggles to keep everything in order. The struggle is one of mutual love and respect without anger. Jones pulls off an indescribably good performance showing how loved ones adapt to difficult situations. You can't help but feel for her as the two start to grow apart.\n\nMy only real criticism would be in the story itself. It seems to almost downplay the importance of what Stephen Hawking discovered and it never gives you a scope of how it affected the science world. It's focus on the personal life story comes at the cost of not showing you how brilliant this man is to overcome so many physical obstacles to accomplish so much. The movie isn't short on telling you how brilliant Stephen Hawking is but they don't show it. \n\nIt is also unfortunate some scenes seem a bit dumbed down for the audience and the film spends too much time arguing the possibility of God, time that would have been well spent on showing Hawking's accomplishments in more detail. The acting in The Theory of Everything is world class and nothing short of brilliant, the cinematography and score are beautiful, but the story left me wanting more.",

Using the autobiographical book by Jane Hawking, Marsh explores the love life of one of our greatest scientists, Stephen Hawking. Around the time Hawking was a student studying relativity and black holes, he was stricken with the neuromuscular disorder which leaves him paralyzed and helpless today. But he had just met Jane who devotes her life to his care and builds a family with Stephen as his physical body succumbs, his intellect grows and his celebrity explodes.\n\n Actually very little of the science of Stephen Hawking is in this film which was a bit of a letdown. Marsh focuses on the personal relationship between Stephen and Jane and the strain his circumstances place on their marriage. But the two leads sell the love story like gangbusters and curiosity remains throughout as Jane struggles with her desires for normal companionship while never giving up on her increasing famous and dependent husband. \n\nEddie Redmayne (Les Miserables; My Week With Marilyn) gives a miracle performance as Stephen Hawking. Every mannerism and nuanced emotion is precise and never showy. It's a masterwork of mimicry. And Felicity Jones (Like Crazy; The Invisible Woman) matches him as the capable and devoted Jane, her powerful raw emotions drawing us into their unique world - tragic, beautiful, and uncompromising. They are both Oscar-bound, and the film should be an across the board contender in a number of major categories. The Theory of Everything may not be the most successful - or for some, compelling - biopic, but it's worth seeing for those amazing lead performances.",

The result is a film that seemingly loses nuance or objectivity with its subject, and instead gives us a central story, that of the romance, that never feels real. The performances, though good, fail to gain any real chemistry.\n\nAbove all, the biggest fault of Theory of Everything is in the direction. James Marsh, as talented and as mature as he is, fails to engage the viewer. The pace is slower than innovation at the DMV and what we see fails to translate well to cinema, it's a story that feels forcibly put on to screen, and a drain on our time. \n\nA disappointment.\n\n2.5/5 Stars",

Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth-shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, breaking new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever have dreamed.",

            "content": "Some things may continue to go undiscovered throughout the history of time with people striving to figure out the most perplexing questions the universe has to offer. The search for a theory that explains everything may be a fool's errand but perhaps its been with us the whole time. Geniuses like Stephen Hawking based his whole life on it but maybe it's the love of another that is the reason for being and makes us continue to go on. Because without it he wouldn't be the man that he is today, surviving against insurmountable odds to tell his extraordinary life. With The Theory Of Everything, his life is told in such exquisite detail that it's hard to realize that we are watching an actor play him. The love of his wife Jane and the search to discover all that is around him made for a gorgeous love story that transcends all barriers while showing that without love, a person can never be whole within themselves.\nStephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is studying at Cambridge unsure of what to label his thesis. Hawking is a highly intelligent student who just happens to catch the eye of fellow student Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) which quickly blossoms into a romance. When everything seemed to be going well for the time being, Stephen is struck a major blow when he is found out to have Lou Gehrig's disease at the all too young age of 21. With a life expectancy of two years, he struggled to find a point for his grim time table. But Jane having falling in love with him vowed to stay by his side despite the short time he has. Now rejuvenated and given a new lease on life, he discovered theories that changes how we view the universe and life on earth itself to later become one of the most intelligent, highly respected and influential men on earth. \nSometimes singular performances in biopics often muddle the truth to make them more appealing like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind and sometimes they transcend what we expect from them and go into another level of brilliance. Such is the case with Redmayne's impeccable performance as Hawking who literally takes it to another plane. Never really hearing of him before, I was awestruck by how great he was and may look back on his previous roles that he is also famous for. He was pretty good in Hick that being the only other film I've seen him in. It was one of the best performances I have seen in quite a while and was like watching a carbon copy of Hawking himself. \nIt got to be hard to watch after a while seeing him struggle to perform even the most simplest of tasks. The dedication to the role that Redmayne showed is unlike anything that has been seen lately and something that needs to be seen to be believed. I compare it to Daniel Day-Lewis Oscar winning role as Christy Brown in My Left Foot as they share many comparisons. Two European geniuses stuck in a body that is just begging to come out that persevere with horrible odds. Whether Redmayne gets the Oscar for best actor is yet to be seen but he will without a shadow of a doubt be nominated come January when the nominations come out. Redmayne completely transforms his body and mind to become the man which is no easy thing to do given his worsening condition later in life. The way that he contorts his body and speaks in nearly unintelligible form is one of the most awestruck and believable pieces of acting that will be hard to match. The limited speech and movement that he portrayed was one of the most realistic performances that I will ever see. \nAnybody who knows his story can see where it was going but it didn't make it any easier to process and handle. Seeing him breakdown physically and mentally was heartbreaking as the film went on. I had no idea how open and inviting Hawking was, but Redmayne exuded great charm, wit and personality to really flesh him out and bring him to life. Those little instances of comedy and warmth that he provided made the film a little easier to watch. Seeing him persevere despite all that was happening to him was inspiring while showing that anything was possible. As he lost more of his senses and body movements, he still showed how expressive he can be. Redmayne may have been stuck physically, but he still was able to present a wide array of emotions through his facial recognition. Anybody who can do that is a superior actor in the highest order and not many can do that with such limited capabilities. \nJones was just as good and integral to the makeup of the film. She was just as charming and witty, challenging Stephen along the way from their first initial meeting all the way up to their long standing marriage. Jones brought a fine groundwork to the proceedings that brought out the harsh internal struggle that she was going through across the film. She played a subdued performance that showed the strenuous toll that Stephens's condition was having on her, her life as well as dealing with three kids. Her best scenes showed her trying to deal with it as Stephen is having fun with the kids, leaving her alone to deal with everything else. Jane's pained struggle brought out the best in Jones as she was put in a situation that no one ever wants to be put in. their dual performances brought out the best and the worst in themselves while providing a great anchor to the story making it all the more heartbreaking and satisfying in the end. It was one of the best one two performances this year with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl being the other.\nThe direction by James Marsh was impeccably well done and presented in such an artful way that the love story never felt like it bogged down the film. You really get deep into the mind of Hawking at his most vital moments of his professional and personal life where you feel like nothing was left out. Using an array of colors, music and imagery, a gorgeous spectacle of emotions was expertly conveyed. I loved the use of spirals used like the staircase, crackling fire and the milk in the coffee that would harken back to his black hole theory at certain moments of his life. The gorgeous cinematography by Benoît Delhomme showed how isolated and alone Jane and Stephen were during the film. Some of the shots looked downright spectacular like when Stephen was given his diagnosis by a doctor. Stephen was so detached from himself and the doctor that the hallway in the foreground looked to be going on forever, overtaking the shot and the doctor in it. You feel how entrapped both Stephen and Jane are, just begging to get out for some air. The pacing was very even allowing for certain moments to take center stage while pulling at the right heartstrings when needed, but not feeling too overly sentimental or cheesy. \nOne of my favorite scenes was the dance that Stephen and Jane went too with Stephen being confident but not over confident. They both charm each other with their respective intelligences throughout the night, winning her over as it progresses. Stephen finally gives in to Jane for a dance amid a beautifully lit bridge under the dark moon light. \nWithout knowing too much about his life, I was completely captivated by all that he has been through and far more brilliant than I ever anticipated. It's a story that was simply made to be told and may fall into the Oscar bait category but it rightfully deserves any accolades it gets.\nThe script by Anthony McCarten was great and full of charm, love, whimsy, wit and heartbreaking truths of what one would do for the ones we love when put in a terrible situation. It was light on science which is what I expected since that would have been far longer and complex to get into. It was never meant to be the main focus anyway and I'm glad it wasn't. It was surprisingly funny and charming with a brisk natural feel to it. Throughout the film, it never felt like it was glossing over things and went into subjects like the divorce between Stephen and Jane. But not making either one of them the bad guy since any relationship like that is bound to become strained. Both of them were looking for new things but waiting for someone to make the first move. It didn't have the controversy that John Nash had with A Beautiful Mind that white washed practically chunks of his life that many people don't know about. The script utilized Stephens sense of humor to great effect, allowing it to come out of nowhere when you least expect it. While he was an atheist and went into his beliefs, it never looked down on other religions or made it seem like other points of view are wrong; unless when it comes to black holes of course.\nMy knowledge of Stephen Hawking usually pertained to his appearances on The Simpsons and never really got into the brilliance of the man. Watching The Theory Of Everything makes me wish that I have read about him much earlier since it's so extraordinary. It's not every day that there is an iconic and revered figure who is not only alive and well today but is still hard at work at the questions that puzzle us all. Seeing him brought to life on the screen so honestly by Eddie Redmayne was nothing short of amazing and is truly one of the great recent performances out today. When it comes to a portrayal of such a brilliant man, nothing should be left on the table. With such a short shelf life to live from the start, Stephen Hawking spent his life studying what he had the least of, time. By doing that he changed the world how we view the universe and shows that one can do anything if they have love. Four and a half black holes out of five.",

            "content": "The Theory of Everything suffers from two major issues: It often becomes more melodramatic than it needs to be, and it is perhaps a little too much love story and too little biopic.\n\nThat being said, the movie is still a very honest portrayal of Stephen Hawking. It follows his life from when he first meets his now ex-wife jane, who is portrayed brilliantly by Felicity Jones, and ends when they part their ways. While the outline could easily makes this movie sound like it focuses entirely on love, which is true at times, there are still plenty of relevant points in Hawking's life that this film definitely does not gloss over.\n\nThe primary place where this movie truly shines is in the perfromances by and chemistry between the two lead actors. Both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones deliver absolutely stellar performances as the couple who are struggling in their tough situation. The film never romanticises or ignores that hardship that the two lead people go through. \n\nAs mentioned before, the movie is partially a love story and partially a biopic. While the movie certainly tells us the stories and events of hawking's life that are relevant, some of the scientific stuff is only touched lightly. But there is only that much science that you can shove into a biopic about a certain person. had it been a documentary, it would have been a different story. The other part that the movie does right is the more emotional moments between the two lead actors. Especially Jones often delivers moments that feel genuinely emotional, and her feeling of responsibility, hardship and test of patience are easily conveyed to the audience thanks in much part to her excellent portrayal. But the love-related themes are more present in the first half of the film, and gets a little more loose towards the second half. But the romance is also felt through the cinematography and direction at certain scenes, which is excellently exectued, while not falling entirely into the trap of becoming a tiresome, cliché scenario.\n\nThe Theory of Everything is a biopic of a person whose life story is definitely worthy of such. As his situation was undeniably hard and demanding, it is only relevant to show a lot of the emotional moments between the two lead characters, but as a biopic, the love-related themes may feel a bit too heavy-handed, as the movie misses a bit of its potential to really explore the ideas behind Hawking's theory. The story is still a very satisfying one, however, and shows largely what was the biggest moments that needed to be told through a cinematic release. It is good, but not great.",

            "content": "I know it is based on a true story so it cannot be accused of copying, but this film is trying really hard to be 'A Beautiful Mind', with the consensus pointing out that it is part biopic and part love story, it even has the part where the lead cannot pick a topic for his project but it quickly skims over that. And that is the main problem with the film; it zips through Hawking's life so fast that it feels like a highlight reel of Hawking's life and glosses over many things as opposed to a true story. Obviously they can't go through every single detail in a film and it isn't uncommon for a biopic to change a few things because of film limitations but there still needs to be a solid story. If Eddie Redmayne wasn't here to give his performance, there would not be much reason to watch it, which hurts to say given the absolutely fascinating person at its story's centre. \n\nThe film just feels like harmless fluff, it does what no biopic should ever do and presents Hawking as this perfect person who did little wrong and, in turn, seems to demonise Jane for some reason. We see Hawking smile to the camera, even though there clearly wouldn't have been video cameras back then, so the whole idea seems rather odd, and the look of the wedding seemed rather manipulative. There was one part where the nurse says how great of a person Hawking is and that seemed even more like a, hey-look-how-great-I-am, moment. They took some stuff out that would have made Hawking look like a 'narcissistic jerk' but at least that would have presented some actual conflict and something to engage, it would have been believable that he didn't want any help because that's how some people act sometimes, they want to do things by themselves, no matter the odds. There is some intrigue introduced about who the third child belonged to but that really doesn't go anywhere at all, it's subtlety implied in the camping scene when Jane goes over to Jonathan's tent in the middle of the night and calls for him that something is going on but it never goes anywhere other than that. Hawking was doing something similar with one of the nurses he was involved with but besides being subtlety put in, it doesn't go anywhere, either. It just seems cruel to do that to Jane anyway, she did all that for him and then just decided to be with someone else, sure, love is a weird thing, whatever, but still.\n\nThe biggest negative of this film is that it makes Hawking's ALS disease, which is an absolutely horrible thing, seem like a mild inconvenience. Besides some truly hard to watch scenes like when he is trying to eat his food, or when he falls over or when he starts to cry on the stairs, the film never showcased how hard it truly would be to live with this disease on a day to day basis, which showing us would have made it have more of an impact. You take one look at the real Steven Hawking and you feel so much for him, as soon as this film finished I went on about my day and it was like I hadn't even watched it. We see one scene where the children are playing on him with him saying 'exterminate' where he gives the defeated smile of someone who just wants to give up with Jane clearly struggling to work but these scenes are about 30 seconds. I also found it a bit unbelievable that when he is first diagnosed with it, he is allowed to be in a bath by himself, what if something happened? It didn't seem like someone was outside being on the ready just in case anything happened. As well as earlier on before this scene when the doctor just tells him what it is and then walks off and leaves him alone, these might seem insignificant but it adds up after time. The film never strikes a balance between the love and the science and you don't really fully understand what it was that made Hawking famous in the first place. The film didn't have enough to relate to its own title, and from the film itself, I didn't really get a good understanding of how his chair worked, either. I already knew about both prior to the film but that isn't the point; for a film about someone's life leaving out key details like this, the film has failed in educating and explaining to its audience.\n\nThe film also has its clichés, of course he flips his chair when he goes back into his room after the croquet game, and I knew there would be a part in here when he flips something. You would expect Hawking to move as much as he could while he still could; I know he was obviously depressed, but still. In the final part of the film when his tutor goes up to say something, of course he says colleague and then friend, but, hey, it was great to see David Thewlis in this. There was a part where Hawking says he didn't dance but then offers to dance a little later in the scene and I did expect her to say, 'I thought the great Steven Hawking didn't dance?' I also expected a part where she makes a light joke for all the 'geek' talk and they didn't fall in the water when they are spinning around. I also thought there was a point where his friend was stealing his idea but he was just explaining it. \n\nThere was one part that didn't make sense just from a nitpicky standpoint. Jane calls Steven at one point, his friend is in the room, he leaves and goes to answer the phone and he hangs up.  Jane then goes to look for Steven and the friend asks her to sit down and have a talk about the news about Steven. Why would he propose to say that to her? It isn't like he knows that Steven put down the phone on her, because presumably he expected Steven to tell her over the phone what the matter was and the scenes were right next to each other, so it isn't like there was much progression of time. \n\nFor a film that speeds through his life, I'm surprised by the lack of a cohesive timeline; let's just pretend for a moment that someone watching this film doesn't know who Hawking is. One moment one of his children is just a baby and in the next scene they are at least 3-4 years old; besides that being a bad timeline anyway, someone who isn't in the know won't understand what just happened. They say in a scene later on that he surpassed the 2 year life expectancy but that is quite near the end. \n\nOn the plus side though, the acting was certainly good, there is a fine line Redmayne had to tread with this role but he is so natural with the gradual progression of the decaying of his body, with his movements and especially his speech that you can't help but pay attention. He looks the part more and more as the film goes on to the point at the end where you sometimes need to do a double take; it is quite scary how similar they look. Hawking even said himself that he saw himself up there on the screen at some point. I did wonder if they were going to put him in there at some point right at the end or something. Some thought 'The Norbit curse' would affect his chances of winning with 'Jupiter Ascending' (same with Julianne Moore for 'Seventh Son') but clearly not. Whether or not you think he deserved the Oscar, given that he didn't have to do all that much nearing the end, his final speech was certainly heart-warming. I find it tragically fitting that Felicity Jones' only award for her performance and that was the, 'Invisible Woman' award, despite the fact that she, herself, was mostly ignored in the hype for this film, it's fitting of the unsung heroes, which is usually the wife, which is probably why she won that. She also reminded me of the girl from the 'Orphan' poster at one point when Steven went for his speech in the lecture room, just because of what she was wearing. The film had its funny moments, especially with the bus schedule bit and the film looks lovely, the UV part especially and generally has that clear look that an English film would, although the scene in the opening credits was weird. \n\nIt was hardly a horrible film; it just wasn't all that memorable, like it should have been and is perfectly happy being a by the numbers kind of film. It means well, but sometimes that isn't enough. The award that this film won should have been the award Crowe won for 'A Beautiful Mind' but I have already explained that in livid, and vivid, detail in my review of that film, and I digress. The film had a good ending with the inspirational speech and the nice added part of everything rewinding, even though that odd fantasy sequence of him getting up and getting that pen was weird and the fact that Jane wasn't at the speech as weird, she has her reasons, but even so, with something that big, you'd expect her to go. The credits reminded me of 'Interstellar' a film that was horribly ignored in the Oscars as well in general in the award in general. I feel bad saying negative things about this subject but all of this is just about the film around them. The film was good for its first half and sped by unbelievably quickly but the second half really, really, drags this down. He is famous for his, 'A Brief History of Time', and that is exactly what this film feels like.",

You get more detail into his life and background. I think they were unfortunately doomed for divorce despite loving one another very much. I think Steven was a bit stubborn and naive in not getting more help sooner. So instead she wound up picking the handsome help and it also contributed to his pneumonia and thus coma. She has an affair and Then of course Stephen falls in love with his help. It's so hard to have a marriage with a disabled person and this film explains that.

            "content": "A friend of mine shared her views about biopics and the acting challenge that it requires.    In the last 10 years, there have been 6 biopic Best Actors award winners and 4 non-biopic.  The last six years it has been alternating between biopics and not.   Last year was NOT with Matthew Matthew McConaughey.  The year before was Yes for Lincoln.   Then The Artist (No), Kings's Speech (Yes), Crazy Heart (No), Milk (yes) and Last King of Scotland (Yes).   If the pattern continues, and it will, this year we have a biopic winner.   But history aside, what about the movie?\nI had heard mixed reviews about the film.   All the nominations quite frankly surprised me.    The two key performances with Redmayne and the Wife (Felicity Jones) are solid.   This is a story of remarkable resilience for a man who was given a death sentence (\"two years to live\") early on in his life.    We see his struggles and the brilliance of his mind.   Much like Daniel Day Lewis with Christie Brown in My Left Foot, you have a physical transformation of the man as he succumbs to the disease.    His body folds away underneath him and settles uneasily into a wheelchair ultimately.   There is a scene of tremendous struggle where he tries to get up a flight of stairs to his bedroom with his young toddler son watching.   Another after he loses the power of speech.   Still, he has the love and support from his Wife.  She is good as well.  Although for the older scenes as she ages, she is just a little too young looking still.   I was awaiting her Jennifer Connolly A Beautiful Mind moment where she explodes from frustration in dealing with her everyday life, but she doesn't.   Maybe that is a strength in the performance, but somehow I think that more range can be shown.  Or perhaps it comes from the fact that this movie is based upon Jane's own book of living with Stephen.   It reminds me of The Affair (Season 1 finished by me earlier in the year  - where perspective plays a huge roll and the same scene is shown to different eyes and lens).   Maybe that is HER interpretation of events with him.   Redmayne has to show range through his face, and body language as his character loses speech fairly early on.    I did find it predictable as a story, and I cannot think of this as the Best Picture.    I like Imitation Game and Birdman more than this -unfairly comparing completely different films.    But back to my friend's point, Professor Hawking is still alive.  There is much footage about his life and his history.   In many ways Redmayne is replaying old home movies.    To that end, I am still backing Cumberbatch as a better performance and gets my vote for Best Actor.  And although Alan Turning was a biopic as well, there you don'y have the celebrity attached to his name nor all the home movies and interviews.  But to me, there is more to fill in (and act) for a character who was not as well known.",

Rather than thinking of this, Hawking has one of those swirly cosmic thoughts that geniuses have.  That's why he's a genius and deserves to be protected and cared for by the world, while the rest of us just muddle along without genius or paralyzing diseases.  His wife is shown as a conscientious, moody caretaker who nervously vacuums and tends her children while keeping and eye on Stephen.  When the children are raised and she could concentrate more on the pleasures of his company, he runs (no, wheelchairs) off with a saucy red haired nurse.  Since this is a high budget movie, she has her own happily ever after with a handsome choir leader (in real life he's a little less handsome but just as self-sacrificing and kind).  Hawking's life is inspiring but not especially uplifting for women.  It was necessary for his ideas to get out there, so Jane had to sacrifice her mere diplomatic and medieval spanish interests to produce \"the theory of everything\".  Because we need to know about the creation of the universe, don't we?",

Eddie Redmayne, if he continues down this path, is the next Daniel Day Lewis.  With that out of the way, not my favorite movie.  It's a good movie, if you like romance flicks and there are some really good parts to the film, it's just not my cup of tea. My wife liked it and Redmayne's performance was outstanding.

            "content": "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this emotional drama about Stephen Hawking and his rise to fame whilst suffering with a rare slow-progressing form ofÂ amyotrophic lateral sclerosisÂ (ALS), also known asÂ motor neurone diseaseÂ or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. The movie also concentrates on his relationship between him and his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and it shows how she struggled to care for Hawking whilst bringing up there three children and studying for a PHD in medieval Spanish Poetry, whatever that is. Hawking also produced a best selling book called A Brief History Of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies and at 72 years of age, after getting told that he only had 2 years to live, he still continues to seek the theory of everything. This is truly a remarkable story about a man who, against all odds, is a scientific genius. It really does prove that you can achieve your dreams, no matter what obstacles come in your way. The performance from Eddie Redmayne is unbelievable and it must have been hard to perform because Hawking was on set while he was making the film. Felicity Jones also put in a great performance and the director told his story extremely well. Before I had seen this film, I never knew anything about his life so it was good to see him as an ordinary intelligent student before he came down with the terrible disease. The gradual decline in his abilities to do things, was sad to watch, but he still had his sense of humour and the ability to achieve his dreams. The love story was quite sad but they are still close friends and they have 3 grandchildren so it wasn't a sad ending. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Eddie Redmayne really did deserve the many awards that he received for this role. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nLike many others that have seen this movie, I really didn't know that Stephen Hawking was English. Maybe that's because his computer voice is American! I didn't understand why he turned down his knighthood from the Queen but I'm sure he had his personal reasons to do so. I couldn't help feeling that his wife was being a little bit of a bitch throughout the movie and she didn't show that much sympathy for Hawkings situation after a while. I'm glad that Hawking finally let her go so they both could find true happyness in there life's, because it made them closer as friends. Anyway, I have seen Hawking in a few TV series and he has made a couple of special appearance in a few programs and he still hasn't lost his sense of humour. That's what makes this a truly remarkable story and I couldn't help feeling emotional through it. This has boosted Eddie Redmayne straight into the limelight after starring in movies like Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn. His next film starring Channing Tatum called Jupiter Ascending, has blockbuster written all over it so there no turning back for this 33 year old actor.\n\nBudget: $15million\nWorldwide Gross: $121.2million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the remarkable life of Stephen Hawking and his rocky relationship with his wife. 7/10",

It's the uninspired script that makes The Theory of Everything feel like a totally empty affair. Anthony McCarten's screenplay simply tries to cover too much ground and thus loses sight entirely of what three-dimensional characters look like. Again, the actors are definitely up for it and both Redmayne and Felicity Jones are terrific, they just don't have a lot to work with. Though the film plays Stephen and Jane Hawking's romance as something as epic as the universe, it never feels that way. I never felt the gravity of their love because the film is too busy racking up Cinema Sins. Fortunately there are some beautiful moments where the cast and crew overcome the writing, but it's just not enough. The story just needs to be smaller and needs focus (a la, say, the Diving Bell and the Butterfly) but it's clear that whoever was throwing money at this film would rather have Oscar bait than what could have been an intense portrait of a romance despite some pretty terrible circumstances.",

            "content": "For me, this movie was tough to get through emotionally. It made me feel kind of evil and worthless. A lot of the themes in this flick, I have in my writing, but this is hopeful while mine tends to be a lot more nihilistic and negative. I also have some things in common with Hawking (thankfully not any physical problems) but my collegiate years were not marked by such buoying emotional or intellectual development. Therefore I always have to view this narrative with a touch of cynicism. I suppose the lesson is that while Hawking was atrociously unfortunate to have his disease, he was also blessed to find true love and academic inspiration and support.\n\nThere are a lot of small holes you can poke in it - the depiction of university is not very realistic, why would Jane be attracted to Stephen, not much development in the beginning of their relationship, common biopic foibles, unending will-she-cheat sexual tension in the second act, etc. But really, none of those very minor things matter much - this movie is all about theme. There's a kind of similar movie from 2001 - A Beautiful Mind. Every once in a while, the dialogue is a metaphor. In this movie, pretty much every line is a metaphor for the emotions of the characters. \n\nRedmayne's performance was very affecting, like Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game, before he entered the ASL phases of the script. Once it started coming on, he was very effective still, though his mannerisms reminded me very much of a friend I have with cerebral palsy. Don't know how similar the symptoms are between the two afflictions. After the disease hits him fully, I didn't really buy it as much, particularly because of the voice. Jones was solid as Jane, and the supporting cast did well too. I think in general, both the film and the acting was regarded in the proper light. Maybe I wouldn't have selected Redmayne to actually win the Oscar, but his performance is certainly deserving of a nomination. Meanwhile, the film as a whole is rightly an also-ran for Best Picture.",

            "content": "An inspirational, if conventionally realized, biopic that is elevated by great performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.\n\nAs mentioned in the review of The Imitation Game, The Theory of Everything also suffers from many of the pitfalls of the modern biopic. Efforts to keep pacing flowing while hitting the important points in the subject's life, for instance, are handled in as contrived a manner as I've come to expect from these types of films. Without even being too familiar with Stephen Hawking, it's easy to spot when notable events in his life are banged together for convenience's sake. Perhaps this is a necessary evil, but unfortunately it takes me out of the film. \n\nA more significant failing (in my opinion) on the part of the script would be in the oft-repeated biopic contrivance of having one's subject almost inexplicably fall in love with their lover at first glance and within the first ten minutes. I understand that time is valuable and that there's a lot of Hawking history to get to, but this takes me out of the film and leaves me doubting the veracity of the relationship. Thankfully, the two lead actors' chemistry helps the relationship along, but Come on! Is every notable figure in human history a victim of love at first sight? I'm serious. Watch these movies. \n\nThe film is competently directed. The cinematography is actually quite stunning at times. Uses of color and imaginative angles keep the eyes quite busy. Sometimes, however, this imagery is so picturesque that one wonders if the DP is trying to inject a visual style simply to stave off audience boredom. This is a simple story. The photography doesn't need to draw attention to itself, which it most certainly does on occasion.\n\nAs noted above, the real meat of the movie is in the portrayals of its main couple. Once their relationship has been established, and Hawking has finally proven himself to be the genius that he is, the film becomes far more enjoyable and the actors really start to shine. Honestly, everything is fairly contrived and cliched until Hawking loses his ability to walk. It's here that the \"special-ness\" of this acting duo comes into play. Redmayne as Hawking deftly engages in a very physical performance that seemingly limits his emotive ability; and Jones as his wife juggles her undying devotion to him with feelings of resentment about her husband's handicap, and her inadequacy as a caregiver. Neither actor resorts to melodrama. Both performances utilize the appropriate level of restraint while showing unquestionably deep and relatable emotion.\n\nRedmayne isn't the first actor to take on this type of role (Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot comes to mind). I wouldn't go as far as to say his performance is a revelation of some sort. The academy, however, really likes it when actors physically transform as the actor does here. His Oscar win, therefore, shouldn't be too surprising, and I wouldn't even say it's undeserved. But if I were voting in the 2014 Oscars, there are many other examples of good work that are \"fresh\" and \"brave\" (see Keaton or Gyllenhaal) that I would be more apt to heap props upon. Just a little, unnecessary rant for good measure.",

It caters to a particular viewer, and ive seen this one far too many times \"the struggling couple, due too ones physical restrictions\" when one party in the marriage becomes \"sexually frustrated\" etc.\n\nThis one was far too clichÃ (C) for me, and wouldn't recommend it.\nThat being said Redmayne's performance was great, not outstanding and maybe that made the movie slightly better.\n\n4/10",

This should really be about an hour 40 minutes or so, and it's nearly a half hour more than that.  This causes the film to seriously drag at some points, especially when nothing of substance is really happening there.  And also, for a film about Stephen Hawking, it really doesn't focus that much on his theories of the universe.  Yes, there's like one or two of them here of some import, but for the most part, the film focuses on Hawking and his girlfriend/wife, which is honestly incredibly boring compared to what I signed up to see.  I thought I was going to see some mind-bending theories put into practice, all while being told the story of Hawking's life.  And while this is true to some extent, I really don't care about his relationship with his ex-wife at all.  So while it's a good film, it's also pretty damn deceptive on what it's advertising..",

As in real life, Eddie Redmayne portrays Hawking with a radiant smile, brilliant wit, and an unrelenting penchant to be independent even whilst gravely ill. Meanwhile Felicity Jones (Jane Wilde) is flawless as she portrays a woman caring for Hawking as long as she could but eventually was unable to sacrifice any more of herself after roughly 30 years of marriage. This would surely resonate with anyone caring for a loved one over a long period of time. In fact, Hawking was expected to die within 2 years of his diagnosis but has been able to survive into the present day. \n. \nWhile supreme genius seemed to come easily to Hawking, it was his sheer existence which is portrayed as most trying. Throughout the film's course, it seems that little poetic license is taken, giving a rather realistic view of the joy the Hawkings experienced early on, followed by a wandering heart in his wife, subsequent divorce between the two, and each remarrying another. Hawking, as well, was no stranger to wants outside of marriage. \n.\nHawking is defined cinematically as having no boundaries, not believing in God, and engaged in a life long search for something whose common denominator is time; the one thing that Hawking most likely has the least of even as he defies the odds time and again. \n.\nSome of my favorite lines from this work include Jane saying \"I have loved you. I did my best\" and Hawking with \"Where there is life there is hope ... \" It is from this belief that I think he has been fueled for so many years. \n.\nThis film is engaging, beautifully filmed, heart wrenching and yet uplifting as its touch upon us seems universal. A man, seemingly limited more than most, manages to continue to accomplish more than most who are considered able-bodied.

The true story of Dr. Stephen Hawking and the monumental trials he and his wife Jane Wilde Hawking who wrote the book \"To Infinity and Beyond\" (not buzz lightyears version) had to triumph over. Sometimes it was painful to watch Jane's spirit get crushed.\n\nThe theorum's described in this movie are pretty awesome to be thought of and mathematically defined by one person who attended the world renowned Cambridge University in England. \n\nThe Love story wraps around the genius who is Stephen Hawking. A modern day Einstein. The fact that he was given 2 yrs to live in 1965 and is still here today is a miracle. He has all the life you could imagine for someone as severely handicapped as he is. His computer voice is solely identified with him. \n\nI wonder sometimes why the truly great Physicists of our time like Hawking and John Forbes Nash (A Beautiful Mind) have such monumental challenges in their lives, yet share so much with the scientific community towards mathematical relativity. And attempts to answer space and time conundrums.\n\nThere were certainly predictable parts in the movie. I guess a lot of life is predictable. The cinematography and editing esp the backwards recap of the movie  at end of movie was done with great brilliance. It takes us back in time before Professor Hawking's disease sets in and shows two young lovers trying to solve their own mysteries of time. Truly a great metaphor for a great movie. I look forward to more of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in the future.  (I liked Jupiter Ascending with Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, and Redmayne)\n\nA side note, I still think that The Imitation Game was a better movie. Both British, both had their leading actors nominated, and their movies for Oscars.

            "content": "Jane : What are you ?\nStephen : I'm a cosmologist\nJane : What's that ?\nStephen : It's a kind of religion for intelligent atheists.\n\nI must admit that I've seen this film a few weeks ago. Probably the fact that Eddie Redmayne was nominated for an Oscar, prompted me to see if he was a worthy contender for the coveted golden statuette. And the only thing I can say is that he totally deserved to win with his magnificent performance. I love to watch a biographical movie now and then. The only drawback is that I'm always a little bit disappointed about the subject covered in such a biopic and that the emphasis lies on something I wasn't looking for. In \"jOBS\" I missed the philosophy this visionary had about the Apple phenomenon and the development of the applied interface (which is currently perfectly normal for everybody). The clash between Jobs and Gates was cited as a fait divers, whereas that interested me. Also in \"The Theory of Everything\" the focus was on other facets of Hawking's life. What applies to both these films is the fact that the protagonists physically look an awful lot like the corresponding character. It's creepy to see how they both manage not only to capture the emotional part, but also to match the characteristics and physical traits of these famous people. \"The Imitation Game\" is obviously also a biopic which, however, had a more adventurous twist rather than being a purely biographical sketch.\n\nYou must admit that the performance of Eddie Redmayne is simply magnificent. Both excerpts from the college years, where he's still healthy,lively and the way he finishes his studies in a nonchalant manner, as the portrayal of a genius who's struck by a muscle disease, are brilliant and striking. A series of events wonderfully visualized using a variety of intense colors at certain times. The university professor who looks surprised at the solutions scribbled on the back of a timetable (10 math assignments which are almost impossible to solve I suppose, of which Stephen could ONLY solve 9). A family dinner Jane was invited to and where you already can get a sense of the intellectual atmosphere. The contradictions between Jane and Stephen when it's about religion. Hawking who excludes everyone after hearing the terrible verdict and the determination of Jane. These fragments stayed with me and made it a fascinating film. \n \nWhich theories the brilliant mind of Hawking produced in that cripple body, isn't explained in detail. Here and there black holes, big bangs and the concept of time is mentioned, but eventually I was wondering what exactly Stephen Hawking's ultimate contribution was to mankind. What Jobs achieved you can discover in any computer shop. And from Turing we know that he has broken the Enigma code. But what abstract evidence Hawking delivered, wasn't clear to me. From one moment to the other he's a celebrity and a much sought-after guest speaker. That a woman who lives together with a paralyzed person can't really enjoy a thrilling,romantic life and that she's actually the person who's responsible for all practical matters in a marriage, is of course obvious. And that's the central theme of this biopic: a loving relationship slowly falling apart because of a fatal disease, the awareness of limitations and the danger to seek solace in someone else's arms. So it's mainly a biopic about the wife of Hawking, instead of about Hawking himself. An insight into the life of mathematical genius, who could explain the mystery of the origin of the universe by using his phenomenal intellectual brain, is thus transformed into an ordinary dime novel about an unhappy woman who feels abandoned by her ever loving husband. And that's something I wasn't waiting for.\n\nDespite the romantic approach, I think it's an admirable film. The situation Hawking is facing during his life, ensured that other qualities came up : humor and willpower. These two qualities are subtly incorporated into this film. Even the choice Hawking made at an older age about his marriage, took me by surprise (actually it wasn't much I knew about the life of Hawking). Once again this proves that he sees himself as a normal functioning man. \"The Theory of Everything\" is a beautiful film that actually moved me and should serve as an example to show what one can achieve with the right attitude and a big portion of perseverance.\n\nMore reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

Then there's Redmayne's performance... well I don't really have the words for that, apart from 'utterly impressive'. Interesting fact is that, whilst it's presented as a biopic about him, it's actually about her, based on her book. Which brings me to the few things I don't like about this movie. I understand why the existence of a god would come up in this film, but I don't like the fact that when Stephen stops adamantly saying there isn't one is presented as a triumph, as if that is the accepted and only right way of thinking. Also, even though I like its polished look, I think the content is a bit too polished, as the struggles will have been huge but are presented as in an almost \"oh well...\" fashion that could have been presented more poignantly.

Stephen Hawking is a man that has defied the odds and surpassed not only scientific and medical boundaries but personal as well. Diagnosed at the age of 21 with a type of motor neuron disease called ALS, Hawking with the vital help of Jane, decides to finish his PHD thesis on time at Cambridge University. The film is based on Jane Hawking's memoir Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen. BRAVO to the cast and crew of this exceptional and epic motion picture that will have you crying and cheering for this remarkable couple. Nominated for five academy awards and it won for best actor. I was surprised to see that Professor Hawking turned down the offer of a knighthood over 10 years ago on principle citing the UK government's mismanagement of science funding. He has three children with Jane and they divorced some time ago. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED in Blu-ray, its a winner!!!",

The movie takes a deeper look into the life and family of Stephen Hawking, a theoretical physicist which was diagnosed with ALS while still in college.  What impressed me the most about the story is that there were so many times in his life where it would have been so much easier to give in, to quit.   Even when he contemplated his own suicide, he somehow found the perseverance to keep going.    The movie also does a wonderful job exploring the challenges of being in a relationship with someone that may be physically challenged.  How the caring for someone who needs more attention can change the dynamics of the relationships.  A very touching story that doesn't sugar coat the challenges they went through as a couple.\n\nI had a block on seeing this movie, but I am glad that I pulled the trigger.

From how he became the genius that everybody knows, to the private family life of the invalid man.\n\nThe first half of the movie is amazing. You just put your feet in Stephen's shoes and you live with him his first love, receiving his Ph. D., and getting the bright idea of black holes. I think that it is engrossing to learn the way in which a scientist makes a discovery, better than be taught only his theories.\n\nHowever, as soon as Jonathan appears in the story, the movie get unfortunately very flat. The scenario only focus on the emotional on the emotional life of Stephen, and the brilliant picture becomes a dull love-story. That's too bad, because the first hour is stunning, but the movie ends with monotony.\n\nFinally, The Theory of Everything remains an excellent movie, that I can only advisor.",

However, what makes 'The Theory of Everything' wroth the price of admission is that this movie explores the events from the perspective of his wife and tells the story of how Jane took those wedding vows (in sickness and health) to heart. When doctors were ready to give up, she continued to believe and fight and stood by her husband despite the day to day struggles. Therefore 'The Theory of Everything' looks more into the personal lives of both Jane and Stephen which has not been explored before and what makes this movie a must-see.\n\nAs far as Eddie Redmayne winning the Oscar for Best Actor, I couldn't have agreed more and yes, I have heard the critics talk about that he portrayed a disabled person which gave him the emotional vote but let me point out that you could not throw any actor out there and the performance would have been as good. The look itself as well as Redmayne's facial expressions were truly extraordinary in telling the entire story, not simply just about what he was going through but in also being so devoted to Jane that we see that Stephen eventually understands that Jane has done so much for him that he understands the budding relationship between Jane and Jonathan.",

The depiction of Hawking's physical deterioration thanks to Redmayne was well-worth the Oscar he won for it. By the end of the film, he's almost unrecognizable. Felicity Jones plays his loving wife, who also turns in a great performance. My problem with the film is understanding exactly what director James Marsh was aiming for: it focuses on their relationship while at the same time focusing on Hawking's revolutionary work. It was sad to see what actually happened to the love that began as an unbreakable force turn into something that lost it's spark. Hawking initially sets out to find an equation that allows him to reverse time so he could find the beginning. The final scene of the film mirrors that with his relationship with Jane. At first, I wasn't crazy about that scene, but I understand what they were going for: going in reverse to show us what Hawking's personal \"beginning of time\" was. The scene felt a bit sentimental, and perhaps a tad cliche, but it was cute. Maybe the ending of their relationship related to his final thesis: that time is boundless, and so are human beings. The performances and Hawking's final speech are more than enough to warrant a viewing here. I was definitely impressed.",

Each new act has Redmayne take on an entirely new performance, as Hawking's disease worsens.  Its truly a performance that has deserved the praise and awards, including his Oscar.  Felicity Jones should not be forgotten as well, with her performance being an emotional powerhouse that really hits the viewer.  We sympathize with her as she is put in a tough situation along with her husband, and it really helps us see how this disease effects not only the victim but the ones closest to him or her.  Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of all time, and seeing his journey was an honor.  While the film did feel like Oscar bait at times and it having dozens of similarities with Ron Howards A Beautiful Mind, it never strayed from the story it wanted to tell and gave us two brilliant performances in the process.  The Theory of Everything may not be anything life changing nor is it the first of its kind, but its still a grand achievement in direction and acting and should be recognized as one of 2014's best films.",

Eddie Redmayne deserved that Oscar for all the charm he brought to this turd of a movie. He is the only reason I sat through the whole thing. He has a spark that makes it hard to tear your eyes away from him. I wish I could say the same for his costar, who played a character advertised as Stephen Hawking's \"tireless first wife.\" She had exactly one scene where she told another character how strong she was, and the rest were spent crying and self pitying. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point: was this movie shot to simulate the uncontrollable empathetic sobs of the audience? Because I wasn't crying and I was wearing my glasses, but nearly the entire movie was poorly lit, colored in similar pastels, and slightly... blurred. Clearly I am not of the artistic caliber required to understand the art direction. It looked to me like they dropped their lens in Vaseline and forgot to wipe it off all the way.\n\nFinally, I'll just skip ahead to the worst thing about this chore of a movie: the plot. It can be summarized in one small sentence, which would have made a much more truthful tagline for the posters. \"Watch this marriage fail.\" We don't really get the nice parts of their relationship, the loving (or even liking) moments they theoretically shared as a couple who loved each other. All we got was her crying as she failed to take care of her husband and multiplying gaggle of children. \n\nOh, and the children. I understand that I will likely be alone in hating this, but the message of the movie was the CHILDREN? How special. You hated each other for years but you made three people so it's all fine! \n\nAnd one more thing while I'm at it. This movie could not make up it's mind about whether it wanted to tout a religious message or not. It was like a shy missionary, knocking at your door ready to tell you all about Jesus and then scampering away as soon as you answer! It came across as weirdly preachy but without actually espousing any system of belief. \n\nIn summary, this is a weird Frankenstein's monster of a movie and I don't recommend it.

Lo mejor del 2014 por mucho.\n\nEn linas generales es una experiencia disfrutable, pero no memorable.",

            "content": "While some people may be off-put from the lack of focus on Stephen Hawking's scientific aspect of his life (which I'll admit I was initially as well), I ended up really appreciating the personal and human element. And the passion of revolutionizing the scientific world is still present as well, it just isn't shown as much of a conflict as Stephen getting more and more consumed by his disease while his wife and other loved ones try to support him all the way through. Once I found that the biography this was based on was written by Jane Hawkings, I realized that this was more of the story of Stephen Hawing's life shown from his wife's perspective, their shared conflicts are at the main focus and they both get equal amount of screen time. However, it is still Stephen freaking Hawking, so I can still understand desire for more of his scientific aspect shown. As for the cast, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne both hit it out of the water with this one. You really feel for these characters and understand all of the layer Eddie in particular had to perform since as the scenes go by he has to find a new way to communicate to the other actors in a respectful but realistic manner. Fortunately the religion vs. science aspect is kept to minimal banter, and the personal conflicts in the last act are for the most part handled quite well. Overall while this may not be the scientific Stephen Hawking biopic that you were hoping for, it still provides enough personal conflict and human connections with two spectacular leads to make it worth a watch.",

It handles the subject remarkably well, placing us in the wheelchair right beside him throughout his physical descent. When he aches, struggling with staircases, obligations and words alike, we hurt along with him. We fall head over heels for Hawking's relationship with his young love, Jane Wilde, only to watch their spark slowly flicker amidst the trials of his condition and increasing social status. It's a bittersweet combination of enduring hope and crushing loss. Beautifully shot and superbly acted, particularly in the two lead roles, this is a wonderful encapsulation of the vibrancy of a life well-lived. Well worth watching, it's sure to move you in many different ways, and maybe even make you think twice about what you've unsuspectingly put your own loved ones through.",

Though not all love stories have happy endings, as this one, the romantic moments are some of the most precious, and the chemistry between Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in the first half shows the real meaning of love, and proves that it's what's on the inside that counts.  Even though the film takes a surprising turn, and doesn't end as most people would like it to, the film is still written brilliantly and is a must see before awards season. I was so pleasantly surprised and was so fortunate that I could learn about Hawking's life, and his accomplishments in life. Hawking is a role model for anyone, may you be a scientist, lover, or not, and this film certainly showcases his life BRILLIANTLY through amazing filmmaking and acting.",
