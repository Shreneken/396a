Instead, she makes contact with a spirit that calls itself DZ. As strange events begin to occur, Laine enlists others to help her determine DZ's identity and what it wants. As the friends delve deeper, they find that Debbie's mysterious death was not unique, and that they will suffer the same fate unless they learn how to close the portal they've opened.",

Once it finally came out, seeing it universally panned gave me this sick sense of satisfaction because I had been so annoyed by the ads. I never saw it and moved on with my life.\n\nWell fast forward to 2022 and I happened upon Ouija: Origins of Evil on Netflix and decided to watch it. I thought it was great! Absolutely astounded to find out it was a sequel to this movie, which I had refused to watch for nearly a decade. \n\nWell I finally conceded and watched it today. It's not.. Good.. and definitely too boring the first 20 min of the movie. But it's your run of the mill paranormal horror and I was perfectly happy to watch it to the end. The final destination aspect was kinda meh.\n\nI honestly wonder if all of the reviews completely slamming this never even watched it but just hated the obnoxious ads for it. Or maybe they were disappointed bc it was hyped so much.",

It takes about an hour for anything scary to happen in Ouija and, after that, it's not really that frightening. This horror film exclusively relies on jump scares to elicit any sort of reaction from its audience. Some of them work, but you can see most of them coming from a mile away. The acting is middling at best, while the plot is dreadfully predictable, and not just because the story is eerily similar to The Ring. Ouija feels just as manufactured as the game it was named after.",

This movie was by no means a cinematic masterpiece, however can you really expect something of such high quality when the entire premise is based around a Ouija board that wreaks havoc upon a group of close friends. I found this movie to be highly entertaining in a cheap-thrills kind of way.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple, clich\u00e9 supernatural themed movie to watch with close friends for a movie night, I'd definitely recommend. This movie is neither terribly unbearable nor disgustingly gory, and as such I feel is relatively inoffensive to those who enjoy these themes in their movies.",

I can honestly say that I enjoyed \"Ouija\", and although I found there were a few hiccups here and there, I still thought the overall movie was entertaining. The beginning was a little slow, as all horror movies tend to be, but once this movie started to pick up, it got pretty exciting. The ghosts in this movie were very creepy, and the intensity of the scenes really kicked up a whole couple gears when the climax hit. There were some things about \"Ouija\" that this movie just didn't bother to really explain, such as Lin Shaye's character (Paulina Zander), as there was just a hole in the plot where her character and that family comes in. However, the story of the little girl and the entire ghost world was actually pretty smart, and actually got to me quite a bit while watching. Some of the acting in this movie wasn't the best, sure, and a lot of the characters just seemed to somehow stay perfectly calm as all the mayhem was going on around them, but in the end, those were just minor flaws. There were plenty of scary and exciting scenes in \"Ouija\", and even if it took a little while to get to them, and there were a few minor problems with the plot, I still think that \"Ouija\" is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "In October of 2014, Ouija was unleashed unto the world. From a critical standpoint, it had been reviewed as one of the worst horror films in years. It ranked among many audience members top ten worst films of that year and very quickly dropped at the box office. Still, it made much more than what it cost to make, so obviously it would warrant its sequel coming soon, but lets have a look back on what spawned Ouija: Origin of Evil. While this film is admittedly bad, there are a few aspects that keep me from saying it is complete trash. Most people comment on how bad this film is as a whole, but it does attempt to tell an emotional story. Here is why the story of this film is under-appreciated, even if its execution is pretty bad. \n\nWhile the idea of a Ouija board has never been all that terrifying or interesting enough to me, I must say that the first ten to twenty minutes of this film had me intrigued. It was less of a horror film and more of a drama about how this board makes people commit suicide. It was a very depressing first act, but it surely played all of the right moves to keep me engaged. That being said, the film quickly spirals into a cliche-ridden story with all of the horror tropes you have come to expect. To add to that, there aren't even enough of the cliched tropes to even call this a full-fledged horror flick. It is more of a drama with horror elements, which would have worked better if the films main focus was not on a game that is meant to scare people. \n\nAlthough almost every character throughout this film is completely one-note, including the main protagonist, Laine, played by Olivia Cooke. Cooke does give a solid performance here, which comes as no surprise, due to the fact that I think she is a terrific actress in almost everything she is in. That being said, her character is not given enough to do, other than weep over the loss of her friend and learn more about the Ouija board. This film is a series of unanswered questions about who is really behind the words being spelled out on the board. By the end of the film you already known everything and the conclusion is about as cliche as you can get. \n\nThis film is about as serious as you can get with a horror film, but it does come off as comical at times. There are shocking moments that are ruined, due to the fact that they are just too silly to take seriously once revealed. I found myself poking fun at the film rather than being genuinely terrified. Not to say that there are not a few chilling moments, but most of them are followed up by something you see coming from a mile away. This film does nothing new to try and scare its audience. Normally great camerawork in a horror film can help build tension for a viewer, but this film was shot pretty static, making everything seem clean. \n\nIn the end, I admired the fact that Ouija tried to put a dramatic spin on this horror film, rather than just going all out on its horror aspects, but it was too little and it almost felt completely absent after the first act. When a film begins with promise, only to abandon its viewers halfway through, it becomes a frustrating film to watch. I see where everyone is coming from when they speak of how truly awful this film is. That being said, Ouija does have enough solid performances and intriguing set-up to say that it is not quite as bad as the critics make it out to be, but that is not saying much when looking back on the overall film. Simply put, this is a pretty bad horror film with some neat ideas.",

You can tell the film was directed to the teen market, like myself, but even I didn't appeal to the film, especially during the second half, while the first half, I do have to say, is entertaining.

            "content": "The beginning of this film right away tries to extract an eerie atmosphere of dread. The person watching does not know why the girl just threw the ouija board in the fire but it makes them want to keep watching because it gives a feeling of mystery. Following the Buring of the ouija board we learn the young girl's name is Debbie, the movie then takes a stereo typical but still scary turn. The evil spirit takes over Debbie's body and kills her. Debbie's friends refuse to believe she would do this to herself, so they vow to find the truth. Then Lane, Debbie's closest friend, finds a video of her using the board alone. Debbie knew not to use a Ouija Board alone but did it anyway. This is where the film goes off the rails. The standard horror-movie elements come out, involving ghosts, zombie-like trances and violent, exorcist like actions. Little is left to the imagination, which is what makes this so scary.\n\tAs you get deeper into the movie you will find more suspense. For example a Ouija Board is pretty simple, but the filmmakers had to add a little detail not included in the original Ouija Board. In the film, if you look through the \u0093window\u0094 of the planchette, you actually can see dead people. This adds another layer of terror when it is not only things jumping out to scare you, but actual scary images of dead character. Most horror movies just put one or the other but the filmmakers of Ouija did an outstanding job with combining both. So If you enjoy horror films I would highly recommend this movie for teens or young adults.",

With a ridiculous premise, horrible actors, bad pacing, cheesy effects, laughable dialogue and a boring and predictable script, Ouija is very hard to get through. I can't remember the last time I watched a horror film and felt absolutely nothing. There are sequences where you can see the filmmakers are trying so hard to create atmosphere and tension, and they just miss the mark so epically every time. It's not scary because the plot makes no sense, and the film doesn't explain ANYTHING. People just start dying, and we are never told why and no effort is made to build the ghost/spirit(?) up as any legitimate threat with a malicious nature. The ghost appears to play by its own random laws, and that isn't scary. Not once did I feel the slightest hint of unease or fear, and it was actually kind of sad seeing so many genuine failed attempts. \nThe lead girl in this movie, Olivia Cooke, is actually a really good actress, but even her talent was completely squandered by the terrible writing and direction, and that was pretty sad to watch too. In fact this whole movie made me pretty sad, especially knowing that this is the kind of horror movie that mass audiences are watching. The resolution of the film too (how they defeat the ghost) is so laughably easy, reminiscent of an episode of Supernatural the way the spirit is defeated so simply in a procedural type fashion. And the use of the Ouija board is totally forced. Also, the movie even comes with one MASSIVE defining plot hole that renders the entire plot nonsensical - just to make it that little bit worse.\nOuija is the definition of generic, studio-packaged horror that is completely misguided, unscary and uninspiring. I want to laugh at this movie, but the fact that Ouija represents mainstream horror, made a ton of money and will likely get an equally bad sequel is more sad than anything.",

            "content": "Let me just start off by saying I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. There was quite a bit of hype around it, but being an avid horror fan I had my doubts they could make another haunting movie scary. Mostly due to my opinion on the quality of a certain haunting movie franchise that I personally think is overrated. I can't say this movie brought anything new to horror, and I don't think it surpasses much more than being \"Good\", but I can say that it does have a refreshing take on the genre. \n\nThe story was pretty good and I'm honestly surprised at how well they pay respects to actual medium rules and guidelines. It's impressive to see an actual spiritual contact concept be given proper representation unlike some other movies (*coughconjuringcough*). And I'll be honest, the only reason I knew there would be a twist in the story was that I saw there was still plenty of time left in the movie for the twist to appear. If they had drawn out the scenes of supposedly being done, it would have been a legitimate surprise that there was a twist. \n\nThere are at least seven characters involved and while none of them are oscar worthy performances, it's passable. The characters themselves aren't horribly bland, but they don't have a whole lot of personality either. Personality in your main protagonists isn't exactly a strong suit in horror movies, though, so the effort they manage to put in is appreciated. \n\nI will give the movie this to its credit: The characters are smart. I think Ouija may be the horror movie that has the least number of times I called the protagonists \"Dumbass.\" They turn on lights, they make a point to never do something alone, they actually think about what they're doing before they do it, they know to f**king run whenever bad shit happens, and they constantly jump to the simple solution of fixing their problems. Now granted, there are times in the film where I shook my head and told the characters they're idiots, but it was far less than in other horror films. \n\nFinal Verdict\nOuija is far from a masterpiece and I honestly don't expect it to get a cult following, but it's probably one of the better horror movies I've seen come out since Saw and Paranormal Activity finally stopped cluttering up the horror movie genre. It's good, but it's not great. I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters because I don't think it was worth the price of a ticket. However, if you're a fan of horror movies like I am, I think it's worthy of being part of the collection...but just barely.",

While Olivia Cooke gives a fairly decent performance, the rest of the cast is rather bland.  And the plot is a pretty stereotypical ghost story with all of the usual tropes.

You have the good looking twenty-something actors playing high schoolers, the excessively bad jump scares, the overly telegraphed deaths. In all honesty, this could be a film of MTV, and no one would know the difference. The film slogs along, even with such a brisk runtime, and it writes itself into so many corners, it just bounds right over them. Acting wise, no one is given anything of substance to work with, so they're all pretty bad. And effects wise, even those manage to look cheap.

What A Big Mistake! Everybody knows that nothing good comes out with playing with a Ouija board but when Laine's best friend mysteriously dies, she finds footage of her using the board so she decides to try and connect to her through the board, with her friends. Clever! They then awaken a dark force which begins to make there life hell so they seek help to try and takedown the dark force. To be honest, I totally lost interest in this film once I saw that it was a gullible bunch of teenagers messing with a darker force. The acting isn't that great and the predictable storyline became tedious after a while. The little bit of action towards the end was also a let down, after such a big build up and I really don't know why they just didn't leave the whole board thing alone after the first mysterious death. Anyway, I totally didn't enjoy this film and I can't believe that it made so much money at the box office. Boring & Uninteresting!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nAll of the cast in this movie, haven't starred in anything major before this project so I can't really comment on there performance. Its the first movie from director, Stiles White, but he has contributed to many big movies with his writing and special effect skills. From Jurassic Park III, Galaxy Quest, The Sixth Sense, Interview With A Vampire and the Ghost in the Darkness, we have all enjoyed his special effects at some point and he has also written the Possession and Knowing, which weren't that great. With such a big profit at the box office, I'm sure were going to be seeing Ouija II soon but I personally won't be rushing to see it. My expectations for the movie wasn't that high so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. It also didn't go down well with the critics which is why I'm so surprised with the box office takings. There's obviously still an audience for this type of movie but I still find it quite hard to take them seriously.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $5million\nWorldwide Gross: $102.5million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their supernatural, horror movies about a group of friends who try and connect to there dead friend through a Ouija board. 2/10",

The film is also poor acted, and the characters are poorly developed (They are all your typical stupid white teens) so that you don't care if any of them make it out alive (speaking of which, there are very few deaths here and the ones that do occur are extremely weak and unsatisfying). Olivia Cooke has proven that she can act in the surprisingly great show Bates Motel, but she fumbles and flops here....it's almost like she isn't even trying (something that can safely be said about most people that were involved with this film).  Lin Shae makes a brief appearance, but is reduced to being a babbling crazy woman (how embarrassing. She seems to be the only one even remotely trying here, but she is given zip to work with). The Ouija Board has a rich history and mythology behind it. Really, it shouldn't have been too hard to craft a cool horror flick based around the board (Hell, a Ouija documentary about the history of the board and the mythology and stories that surround it would have been cool). Unfortunately (and bafflingly), the people behind this film were clearly very lazy and instead decided to make a generic, paint-by-numbers horror film that has absolutely zero scares and zero surprises. The film is aimed squarely at the young teen female demographic, and I can easily see young teen girls playing it at a slumber party and pretending to be scared while watching it. I suppose that if you've never seen a horror film before, then MAYBE this could freak you out a bit but for anyone who is a fan of the horror genre or the Ouija Board this is a supremely disappointing and BORING film. SKIP IT SKIP IT SKIP IT! (Also didn't like the extra rules they added for the Board).",

Not to mention that it relies so much on cheap jump scares, the acting and CGI effects are cheesy as heck, and almost nothing happens. The script is an uninspired mishmash of ideas done well in better horror flicks and horribly here. And don't even get me started on that \"twist\".

            "content": "This is a stupid movie even going back to its planning phases.  This film is produced by Hasbro Films (who have developed such classics as the Transformers franchise, the GI Joe franchise, Battleship, and this film).  Now that I read that, this company must have the worst track record in developing quality films of anyone out there.  But I digress.  The idea behind this movie, I'm assuming, is making a movie that somehow manages to sell people on Ouija boards, so they're motivated to go out and get one.  They go about this by making, theoretically, a movie so goddamn scary that people won't want to buy their stupid board game anyway.  And I say theoretically, because this movie isn't scary at all.  At the same time in all of that lack of scares, it doesn't make playing on this Ouija board look like much fun.  Then again how in the fuck do you make summoning the spirits look like fun.  I suppose you could have them asking stupid questions like 'will Chad ask me out to the prom' or 'will my girlfriend and I have sex tonight'.  Stupid shit like that.  At the very least with The Lego Movie, in all its awesomeness, made you want to go out and buy all the legos you could.  Hell even some of Hasbro Films' productions, as terrible as they may have been, made people, mostly kids, want to buy the merchandise.  I guess the people who went out and bought Ouija boards after this were people who don't give a shit about superstition and would want to summon all the spirits they could.  But those people are already likely to have Ouija boards anyway, so it makes this film's existence perplexing and unnecessary at the same time.  As can be explicitly seen, from the score I gave this, this movie is absolutely fucking horrendous.  It's just a disaster from beginning to end, stealing shamelessly from various, and superior, horror movies.  Not to mention the main character being immensely unlikable.  Unlikable in the sense that her stupid bullshit about wanting to say goodbye to her friend, who killed herself, THROUGH A FUCKING OUIJA BOARD is possibly the most idea I've ever heard in my life.  And her insistence on seeing this through to the end ends up in two of her friends, and her boyfriend, all ending up fucking dead.  I understand the need to say goodbye to a friend after a tragic suicide, or what looks to be a suicide in this case.  But, really, your best option at saying goodbye is using a board game?  For fuck's sake.  Look when one of my friends dies due to doing something at my insistence, you know what, I would fucking stop.  Nope, that's not what the main character does.  She insists on her and her friends finishing what she started in the first place.  How fucking selfish.  It's not that the character's personality is unlikable, it's that her actions are unlikable and result in the death of three people, and her sister almost pays the prize for her stupidity as well.  Instead of just going to her friend's grave, saying goodbye and leaving it at that, she had to go get three more people killed.  Hell, she's more unlikable than the \"villain\" in the film.  The only way this film would work, in any way, is if you pretend that all of the characters are idiots with 2 brain cells.  That's the only way this will be enjoyed.  The film relies on old and tired jump scares, a few of which will probably be effective for some people.  But, you all know how I feel about horror movies and their reliance on them.  It's fucking lazy, it's cheap and it's easy.  Unexpected loud noises will almost always get a reaction, that doesn't mean it's actually scary.  You've all heard this before.  The acting is horrible with the exception of Lin Shaye, who should be in every North American horror movie.  I blame the acting being awful in shitty characterization and not on the cast.  Though I wouldn't say that they're great to begin with, but I'm sure they're slightly better than what was shown on here.  The story, do I even have to go into it?  It was awful, what the fuck do you expect?  This movie is all around fucking awful.  I'd have to go back through my reviews, but this would definitely have to be the worst movie from 2014.  No question.  The few decent scares are not nearly enough to save this from an incompetent plot and even more incompetent characters.  This is just a dreadful experience.  One that I will hopefully put out of my mind 5 minutes after finishing this review.  Just don't.  There's so much good horror out there, like House Bound and Dead Snow 2.",

This film has way too much exposition and it's added as the film goes along under the guise of clues or uncovering a mystery where there isn't much of one. We have two very brief Ouija sessions and that is it. The rest is mundane activities looking dramatic, more exposition, and some menacing shadows and writing. \n\nThings perked up a bit when Insidious Lady showed up but things quickly got boring again.

It does feature a few horror clich\u00e9s such as people suddenly appearing, doors slamming, and even the clich\u00e9 of the parents conveniently going out of town right when things are about to go down. However, the overall story is interesting and features a pretty decent, although not totally surprising twist--This  is what you would expect from a modern horror film these days, but is able to present watchable content while not dwelling to far out of the ordinary. You'll probably already know the story about the ancient spirit board that can have supernatural abilities linked to the dead, but Ouija manages to make them interesting and fun to watch. Not only that, but it seems as though the producers and directors knew exactly how to coordinate the plot in order to make the film robust. Unlike other horror films these days that go so far out to stand out, Ouija a uses a simple premise that just works. The acting is good, the story is good, and the scares might sometimes lift a hair up from the back of your neck!!",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is somewhat of a paradox of a film. Imagine a movie made by the makers of a game warning you not to play the game. Now imagine the makers of a game warning you not to play it, but double-dog daring you to play it. I've pretty much just described Hasbro's supernatural horror dud \"Ouija.\"\n\nA girl is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. A group of her friends investigate the spirit board. They soon find out some things aren't meant to be played with when they awaken the dark powers of the \"other side.\"\n\n\"Ouija\" is one of those movies where the kids involved do incredibly stupid stuff, make all the wrong decisions, and then die because of their bad choices. Unlike most teen slasher films, there's nothing fun or humorous here to be found. It's just one predictably bad action after the next resulting in death for whoever committed the transgression against the dead.\n\nSet up like a visual instruction manual, \"Ouija\" teaches you how to play the board game you know you shouldn't. It's like they're taunting you to play with fire. Imagine someone telling you not to do something, but then giving you exact guidelines on how to do it. The actors say the words they're supposed to and follow the rules to communicate with the dead... which is never a good idea, by the way. It all plays out like an over-extended TV commercial to sell the game.\n\nThe ultimate message of \"Ouija\" is you shouldn't play with the occult. Unfortunately, the message gets a little jumbled up when the friends use it to do battle against the spirits. Okay... so don't use it unless you need to use it to fight the bad guys? Am I getting this right? \n\n\"Ouija is rated PG-13, of course. Why wouldn't it be since its target demographic is plainly teens looking for mild scares. It includes disturbing violent content, frightening horror images, and thematic material.\n\nThe only special features included for \"Ouija\" is a bland \"Making of\" featurette. It's around three minutes long and consists of the cast and crew yammering about being scared on the set. They also talk about playing with the board for a movie that tells you not to play with the board while being a commercial for it. I digress... much like the movie.\n\nAny Christian is going to have problems with watching \"Ouija.\" We're all warned from childhood not to play with the occult or communicate with the dead... and with good reason. It's pretty cut and dry in the Bible. When my wife found out I watched the movie in our home, she made me immediately take it out of the house and put it in the car. The film really does send a mixed message to younger viewers. \n\n\"Ouija\" is obviously an attempt at both promoting a Hasbro board game and creating a teen version of \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring.\" However, there's nothing to be found here that is even half as endearing or memorable as either of those two films. Even the little twist during the climax can't save the movie in the end. \n\nIf you want to buy \"Ouija,\" you know where to find it. I'm not going to have providing a link to purchase it on my conscious.\n\nwww.ersink.com",

The face of the spirit was Sooo scary!!\nNot gonna lie, the idea of oiuja boards and how they can haunt you, still plays on mind...

The acting is fine, Olivia Cooke is the best part in the movie, but their characters are not so. I barely know anything about them and it doesn't make me root for them to survive as they keep doing stupid things. The scares are limited in it, and once in a while it startled me at the very best, but for most of them I knew where it was going and was just going for loud noises to scare people. I do appreciate that despite being a ghost story, it doesn't become an exorcist movie when Ouija goes along, but it gives us scenes that reminds us of other scary movies that are way better than this.

This is director Stiles White's (Knowing and The Possession, ugh) logic behind scaring the audience effectively. And you know what? It didn't work one single bit. In fact, if anything, it made the actor's look even stupider than they already were. From the moment Ouija began you knew that you were going to be sitting through a major snore fest. Half of the film is just blundering product placement for that ridiculous Ouija board. Please come buy this. You know you'll like it. It's the game to die for ... \n\nIf only that was the truth for this film: After the recent death of Laine's (Olivia Cooke) dear friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig), she decides to invite all of her buddies (Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos and Douglas Smith) over to hold an s\u00e9ance in honor of Debbie. So Debbie apparently committed suicide because of this Ouija board and Laine thinks it would be a great idea to still communicate with it? ... Bravo Laine. On top of the unintelligent cast is the lack of scares and the kiddy PG-13 rating. Universal Pictures only did this to bump up their box office moola. It's also a cheap scheme to get all of the middle schooler's to see their so-called 'scary' Halloween movie ... lame. \n\nThe part that's really frustrating about this movie is the lack of scares. White thinks making loud noises will make the audience jump, but instead it makes the movies less serious and more laughable. An effective scary movie uses suspense, tension and dramatic/eerie music too draw the viewers in. There's also lots of striking camera movements/angles to keep us on the edge of our seats until the scares come naturally not forcefully. Ouija does none of this and ends up recycling far superior horror films. This board, as well as the movie, is best left on the shelf.",

In going another round with my girlfriend at the theater for a horror after being tortured by Devils Due earlier this year Ouija was quite a delight. Scary as well which I got bruises on my arm to prove from how many times my girl kept grabbing my arm. As well as being scary it was nice to finally get some descent acting such as from Olivia Cooke who has made it big on the show Bates Motel. Also a nice cameo from Lin Shaye whose character luckily doesn't rip off Insidious which had me worried especially placing her in a horror in between Insidious sequels. So all in all this movie made my Halloween weekend with something new outside the realm of Paranormal Activity and Saw.",

Not to mention, there was never a slow moment. In scenes that were \"suppose\" to be slow, it was just building up anticipation for the next scary moment. Highly recommend if you want a good horror movie!",

In the futuristic metropolis of San Fransokyo thirteen-year old genius Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) lives with his older tech-whiz brother, Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney) and Aunt Cass (voiced by Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph). After getting saved by Tadashi from a group of robot fighter thugs, Hiro is taken to his brother\u00e2??s college which Hiro calls \u00e2??Nerd School.\" Tadashi shows Hiro the experiment that he's been working on; a loveable robot healthcare nurse named Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit). Hiro is amazed by what Tadashi has created and motivated to join him. At the exhibition to apply to the college, Hiro unveils his microbots invention. Impressed by Hiro\u00e2??s invention, Professor Callaghan (voiced by Academy Award nominee & Emmy Award winner James Cromwell) offers Hiro a place at school only to be one-up\u00e2??ed by businessman, Allistair Krei (voiced by Alan Tudyk of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, TV\u00e2??s Firefly & Serenity) who wants to buy Hiro\u00e2??s microbots which results in tragedy.  Now with an upgraded Baymax & the help of his new friends: adrenaline junkie Go Go Tomago (voiced by Jamie Chung), neatnik Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans Jr. ), chemistry whiz Honey Lemon (voiced by Genesis Rodriguez) & fanboy Fred (voiced by comedian T.J. Miller), Hiro will save the city of San Fransokyo, but also learn the power of friendship though tough times. Based on the popular Marvel comics, directors Don Hall and Chris Williams together with screenwriters Jordan Roberts, Daniel Gerson & Robert L. Baird have brilliantly created a very funny, entertaining, and wonderfully moving story. This is the best animated film I\u00e2??ve seen in years. A CAN\u00e2??T-MISS FILM & you can join the fun in 2D, 3D or IMAX 3D. Pior to the film, there was a short animated film called Feast. This charming & wonderful little film tells the story of one man's love life though the eyes of his best friend, an adorable dog Winston, and the meals they share.",

            "content": "Ouija is a 2014 supernatural horror thriller film co-written and directed by Stiles White, co-written and executive produced by Juliet Snowden, produced by Michael Bay and Jason Blum, based on the board game of the same name created by Hasbro, and starring Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, Shelley Hennig, Ana Coto, Bianca Santos, Lin Shaye, Sierra Heuermann, Vivis Colombetti, Robyn Lively, and Matthew Settle.\n\nDebbie Galardi (Shelley Hennig) is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. Her childhood best friend Laine Morris (Olivia Cooke), her boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith), Laine's boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), their friend Isabelle (Bianca Santos), and Laine's sister Sarah (Ana Coto), all dealing with Debbie's loss, decide to investigate the Ouija board. They later find out that some things aren't meant to be played with, especially the other side.\n\nOuija is the bastard three-way love child of Hasbro, Transformers director Michael Bay's production company Platinum Dunes, and Blumhouse, the production company of Jason Blum, the producer of films such as Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, Oculus, and The Purge. The project was first conceived as a supernatural adventure action film with a proposed budget of $100 million.\n\nScott Stewart, Breck Eisner, McG, Sylvain White, Pierre Morrel, and John Moore were all in talks to direct, and the original script by Richard Jefferies was going through several re-writes. Screenwriters included Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz (Tron: Legacy), Marti Noxon (Fright Night), and Simon Kinberg (Jumper) among others. However, Universal shut down the project because of budgetary concerns. Later, they decided to resurrect the project and re-tool the script as a microbudget horror film, hiring Jason Blum as producer and Juliet Snowden & Stiles White to pen the screenplay, with White making his directorial debut with the film.\n\nYes, I actually saw Ouija. But keep in mind I did not pay my money for this. I, instead, paid for John Wick (a movie that actually looks good), and snuck into this piece of shit. To make a long story short, Ouija is one of the worst films I've seen all year as well as the worst and dumbest horror film I've seen this year. Bad acting, bad writing, bad story, bad characters, bad directing, the list goes on. Ouija is the worst film ever to be released under the Hasbro name. Yes, worse than Revenge of the Fallen, Age of Extinction, and Battleship.\n\nNow, is there anything good about Ouija? Yes. There are only three good things I can say about this movie. The first good thing is Olivia Cooke's decent performance as Laine, the main protagonist. You can tell Cooke's trying very hard to turn her boring, poorly written character into something. The second good thing is the slick cinematography by David Emmerichs. Ouija is an admittedly well-shot, sleek-looking picture. The third good thing is that the opening ten minutes were watchable and atmospheric.\n\nThat's where all the good stuff ends, because everything else is absolutely horrendous. With the exception of Olivia Cooke, the actors are all terrible. The dialogue they exchange between each other is either laughable or horribly clich\u00e9d and generic. These are some of the most bland, boring, one-dimensional characters in film history. Seriously, there isn't any character development at all. The actors put no effort into their performances. They're never convincing or believable.\n\nStiles White's direction starts off well enough but then quickly sinks into the bottom of the barrel. His script, co-written with Juliet Snowden, is just horrendous. Dialogue? Terrible. Story? Terrible. Plotting? Terrible. Everything about this script was just terrible. Here's the big twist: So there's this little girl that these dumb-ass teenage cardboard cutouts mistaken for characters come into contact with using the Ouija board.\n\nThe little girl warns them all of her evil mother, who's killing all their friends, so she tells Laine to find her dead body and remove the stitches from her mouth so she can stop the madness and defeat her mother. Laine does exactly this, only to find out that the little girl was evil all along and that the mother was warning them that her daughter is evil and was lying to them. If the mother was innocent and the little girl who needed her body to be freed because it was trapped was the bad one, how the fuck were people dying before? This makes no sense!\n\nAnd of course, here's the big one: IT'S NOT FUCKING SCARY. This movie isn't even OCCASIONALLY startling. Most of the scares consist of loud, irritating, cheap jump scares and horror visuals you have seen from every other fucking horror movie ever made. I was begging this movie to end. It was just so boring, so ineptly scripted, so horribly paced, so badly acted and directed, I considered walking out of the theater. Fuck this movie and never watch it. If someone buys the DVD for you in a few months, punch them for insulting you.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 1/10\n\nThe first ten minutes were effective, Olivia Cooke was solid as the lead, and the cinematography was pretty good, but the story was nonsensical, the characters are dull as shit, the other actors either needed to express emotion or need acting lessons, the dialogue is terrible, there's no tension, there's no atmosphere, nothing is ever scary, and the twist was maddeningly incomprehensible. Ouija is a pathetic excuse for a movie. You're better off playing with an actual Ouija board than sitting down and watching this crap.",

(Lacks at trying to be a thriller) (Has jump scares, but not many.) Just watching the movie, you can clearly note a lot of cliches that is has. It's so bad, it ruins the \"twist\". It felt like M.

It looks like I have to talk about it.\n\nThe good things in this movie: Nothing good at all.\n\nNow for the bad things in this movie: Is this movie scary? no it is not, because this movie has nothing new and nothing to stand out, it just ends up being a water down horror film that doesn't take any risk. The acting in this movie was so bland and so dreadful, I see nursery kids act better then the people in this movie. The character's in this movie are so stupid and really uninteresting, and in every bad horror film there just to get killed off or fill out the screen time with their awful acting. The script, the directing and the way the movie is shot is so poorly done that I could have directed this movie better and more interesting. \n\nOverall Ouija is a water down horror film that only tries to scare you but the movie has I said before has nothing to live up to and that's way it fails hard.",

Pretty young things get dead, like, bad. And, if we hadn't seen these trappings so many times before in better thrillers, the unique supernatural plaything twist might've provoked some new thrills. Instead, it plays out as predictably as a Little Golden Book. Once the game offs one of the childhood group who innocently played Ouija as kids, the now-teenage players reunite for - wait for it - one more game. They act like its a way to help them grieve but  the goings-on meet such predictable ends that you wonder how these pretty libel liars walked into this scenario having watched so many similar set-ups on-screen. Granted, they set up their own closed mouth ghost story but its derivative stuff. Honestly, the two minutes of screen time dedicated to a Ouija board in The Exorcist generates more legitimate jumps and screams than the entire 90 minute running time of this flick.\n\nIn this PG-13-rated horror flick, a group of friends (Cooke, Coto, et al) confront their most terrifying fears when an innocent game awakens the dark powers of an ancient spirit board. Well, here we groan again. \n\nEmerging as a standout from the decent scarer The Quiet Ones, Olivia Cooke's performance remains serviceable even if the dialogue comes off as pure stock. The rest of the cast can't act their way out of a paper bag, which the mostly recycled script seems to have been written on. As for first time feature director Stiles White. Most of the actual thrills come from people walking in on the POV unexpectedly. This doesn't count as horror; it simply counts as bad timing.\n\nBottom line: Bored Games",

If they go into the theatre already convinced that the angry spirits of the netherworld are waiting to pounce upon the living via wooden SMS messaging, then that's fine. If hardline skeptics emerge blinking into the foyer afterwards, shrugging off an hour and a half of solid scares, that's also fine. But if you make no attempt to convince the doubters, even through characters in your film, then it's going to be an eye-rolling ride. There are no cynical characters in 'Ouija', just a bunch of teenagers who appear to be auditioning for 'Final Destination 6'.\n\n'Ouija' is a film which realises it's been staggeringly lacklustre in its build up, so for its third-act revelation not only employs an attic and a basement, but also some old black-and-white photographs, a creepy child's doll AND wheels out (literally) 'Insidious's Lin Shaye to explain the last sixty minutes and set up the next twenty five. The film is at least reasonably effective in what it does; the problem is that 'What It Does' is lazily rehash every mid-budget horror made in the last 30 years...",

This movie suffer with really clich\u00c3\u00a9 horror elements like the jump scares, acting, suspense, ect. Let me just say I knew this wasn't gonna be a good movie not even a decent one I knew this movie was gonna suck as soon as walked into that theatre. I had hope with this movie because the idea of the Ouija board is pretty clever for a movie maker because of it's background and legacy throughout the years. But of course this movie just messes the opportunity up big time. The acting is bad, no surprise they're. The jump scares are cheap and predictable. The movie looks like a straight to Netflix film, yeah that's how bad the CGI looks in this movie, the plot was very very very dumb, no character development at all, a lot and I mean a lot of plot holes, and the list goes on and on. The plot twist in this movie was not really clever but caught me by surprise. And I was going to give it one star for that but then I started to think about it more and more. Then figured out that this was a BS twist that made no sense to increase the very short run time of the movie. The characters are so idiotic I was glad some of them died. I give the film this. Some death scenes were pretty cool and graphic for a PG-13 movie and that's on the mediocre scale for me but I have to put one positive thing about this horrible movie just to be nice. But why can I be nice to such a cash grab movie like Ouija. If you seen the movie then you know exactly what I mean. The ending of the movie is so stupid and was a forced set up for a sequel. This ending was worst than 'The Maze Runner' ending! Please never see this movie in your life! Seriously, don't save your self from a bag of stinky smelly garbage like this movie. I'm going to give 'Ouija' a F grading. Even though some death scenes were mediocre at best. That still couldn't nudge the movie out of the F range! I'm just glad I'm done with the movie and NO I won't see the sequel!",

In this remake, a girl dies unexpectedly and her friend uses the Ouija Board to contact her.  I know it sounds interesting, but believe me It Is NOT !!!  This remake is not a horror but a horrible film.  Not only does this movie SUCK but it completely associates itself with the original version of this film which was made in 1986 called \"Witchboard aka Ouija\".  The original flick from 1986 \"Witchboard\" was one of my favorite all time movies and it was sad to see that the horrible  2014 remake lived no where near the expectation of the original movie from 1986.  This remake SUCKED and I absolutely do not recommend seeing it in the theaters, DVD or even on regular cable.  Take my word, if you are interested in this movie, Please do yourself a favor and rent the original 1986 flick called \"Witchboard\".  The original was Great and the 2014 remake SUCKS... in fact the only thing i can say about the remake is that it was a little scarier then Annabelle, another one of the so so lame horror flick that was released in 2014.",

            "content": "Ouija is a flawed but great Horror film and it is a very neat Horror film to watch for Halloween along with Annabelle. Ouija is about a group of friends who lost their friend after their friend committed suicide and one of them decided to try to use the Ouija board to contact her but soon they learn that they did not contact their friend and instead the group learns that they unleash an evil force that is ready to kill them and the group must find a way to end the haunting before they all get killed. I just came home from Robinsons with my parents in watching this film and I have to say it was a great experience and this film and Annabelle are worth watching for this Halloween. At one point when I saw the trailers I was kinda expecting a Horror movie that at least uses the genuine Horror elements from the 60's-80's the result is the movie delivers instead another Insidious or The Conjuring type style Horror film and it does work at one point and I love that these are the type of Horror movies that are showing now a days instead of films like Saw or Hostel back from 2003-2010 movies like Saw were successful at the box office and this year movies like this are now successful beginning with Insidious and The Conjuring. What's very good about this film is that the movie has a unique, creepy and grim atmosphere from start to finish and it gives the film a creepy feel and sends a lot of chills down on my spine. The other good things about this film is that the movie has a couple of good scares and creepy moments(The opening scene, Scenes with the group using the Ouija board, The attic sequence and the creepy sequence when Lin Shaye starts to react at the main protagonist)plus the soundtrack is creepy and the editing by Ken Blackwell(Friday The 13th remake)is outstanding oh and the pacing is good, deliberate and neat. Now like I said the movie itself is flawed and the film suffers from a few issues. One of the film's main problems is the film's shallow screenplay which is also full of plot holes and missing plot points. The film also isn't suspenceful. There's hardly any tension in several scenes. There are a few dull moments. Most of the CGI is poor. There are a few scares that at times worked but some tried to work but ends up failing. A few also of the scares are a bit predictable and the ending is flat, disappointing and overwhelming. Now the acting is pretty good the casts did a decent job with their performances in the film mostly the acting range from good to decent and I think out of all the casts Lin Shaye was the best out of all the casts and I love her performance in this film as much as I enjoy watching her in the Insidious film and I love that in the Insidious films her character is a loving, kind and helpful person and then when she appeared in this film her performance range from kind hearted to super creepy and chilling. Director Stiles White did a great job with his work on this film and for a first time director he at least delivered a great Halloween Horror film and hopefully he'll make another good Horror film either next year or in the near future. Overall Ouija is a flawed but entertaining Horror film with a couple of good scares and worth watching for this Halloween along with Annabelle. This movie could have been better if it was directed by James Wan and written instead by Leigh Whannel and Mike Flanagan. I would dare say that if you want a perfect Halloween movie I highly recommend The Conjuring, Insidious 1 and 2 along with Oculus oh and Oculus is still the best Horror film of 2014. This movie gets an 8/10.",

The cast is full of people who are only there to die and once they actually do bite it, none of the other characters seem to give a fuck; they have blank reactions and then just move on! The script is one of the all-time stupids that had me groaning at all the terrible set-ups and contrived reasons for the characters to continue using the board. This film went through tons of re-shoots and it shows because the twist makes no damn sense and the ending is laughably non-existant. Pretty much everything is wrong with this movie and the worst crime it commits is that it's not scary in the slightest, everyone involved should hang their head in shame because this shit was AWFUL.",

            "content": "Wow.  Just wow.  I'm struggling to come up with sentences that lack the word \"garbage\" to describe this movie.  Never have I seen a more blatant halloween cash grab than 2014's \"Ouija\".  Riding on the heels of the decent PG-13 horror films of the past few years such as Insidious and Paranormal Activity, Ouija, with its ominous title and minimalistic marketing, (For the record, I don't watch trailers anymore), seemed like it would at least be a fun movie.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nEvery overplayed generic cliche of the genre is present here.  There's no mood, there's no atmosphere, there's nothing here.  You can feel the movie attempt to build tension, but the pacing is so off-putting and terrible that the plot line crumbles out from underneath it.  \n\nThe saddest thing is that most of the cast actually felt like they were trying to be decent in their terribly written parts, and failing miserably. These kids don't have a bright future ahead of them, unless they find a director who doesn't take \"Pouty looks\" as an excuse for acting.\n\n  The main character, Laine, makes such backwards decisions for her friends who blindly follow her that I found myself guffawing at the screen.  The male characters, who seemed like they accidentally walked onto a set from an \"Abercrombie and Fitch\" ad, had little to no say in what happened in the film, and Laine's puppy-dog eyes seemed to be able to get them to do the stupidest things at the drop of a hat.  Every kid in the group was hollow, and I breathed a sigh of relief watching each and every one get killed off, knowing I was growing ever closer to the credits rolling.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the kills themselves, you know, what most of us go to these movies to see.  The \"HORROR\" part of the horror movie.  Well, even with all the supernatural power of ghosts and demons, they could come up with creative ways to kill off these kids.  Each and every kill has the same stitched-mouth, white eyes effect, and it loses its touch after the very first time.  Made me wish I could just have my eyes sewn shut.\n  The main characters main love interest gets possessed and then just goes poof.  Into a cloud of particles. Seriously.  I know it's PG-13, but it shouldn't feel like the Fairly Odd Parents just poofed a character out of the film.  It was like they granted my wish!  He was gone for the rest of the film.  What's funny is, the leading lady cares even less about these characters than the audience!  It's the poor writing that does it, but damn.  Not a tear shed for all her dead friends that she's responsible for the deaths of at all!  What a sociopath.\n\n If you're coming to this film looking for any interesting characters, story, or even a scare or two, turn back while you can.  \n\nIf you're absolutely wanting some positivity out of this review, here it is.\n\nLin Shaye is the only redeeming actor in the film.  She plays a psycho in a mental ward.  I don't know what it is about Lin Shaye, but she always captures my attention more than other characters in today's horror films.  There's just a tone she uses that's really unique, although I feel she plays the same Shamanistic-paranormal-knowledge character in every role.  Yet, there's something charming about it, as cheesy as it is. If she keeps on keeping on specifically in the horror genre, she could very easily land in a Vincent Price-esque role for modern horror movies. I hope so, because it seems like she really has fun in her horror roles.\n\nTL;DR: The 13 year old girls that sat behind my date and I were Laughing at the scares.  Does that not say enough?",

With all fairness to the film, although I liked it, in some areas it lacked like most horror films. The story should have gone a little more indepth and the scares should have been longer but overall it was not a sucky film. I cant say its a MUST SEE, so I will say its a great film for this Halloween 2014 to check out. P.S. the ending bummed me out with a cliffhanger, BUT left room for part 2! ;)",

The resources and materials for the film isn't something potentially fresh but the film makers are being lazy, substituting a supernatural board game and then imitated with Paranormal Activity lame scares and the thrilling secret behind just as in Insidious. It is obviously that the ending which intends for another sequel closed in a pointless and ridiculous way, fooling and wasting the time of audiences, which one may feel to just purchase an Ouija from Hasbro, perform self-playing and force pointing the planchette to the direction of no for this overall disappointing horror film.",

From the way that it ended, there will be a sequel. I thought that the way the Ouija board kept on appearing was the funniest thing ever in the entire film because the audience could NOT get over talking about it and really reacting to it resurfacing like Michael Myers in all the Halloween movies! Lol! In short, this movie was enjoyable & it is always good to see people get scared in a horror film that is not scary or has minimal horror in it! The cast of young actors did an average job, but the main character, Lainie really did a good job at looking scared, skeptical, and the lead. I have to give credit where it is due.

This is on a level worse than a teen scream. \nThere are no real scary parts even when they try, there is no creativity to the plot and there is no reason for this. \nI do admit that there is potential with the idea of a Ouija board movie but this is not the road to have taken.

The movie has a simple cliche horror movie plot, four friends want to find out what really killed their seemingly happy, hot popular girl best friend and get caught up in the other world along the way. The film provided some emotional dialouge between Oliva Cooke(who is amazing in the film) and I'm just going to call her Elaine(insidious) but the final climax of the movie was just terrible. It didn't make any sense and it just painful to watch. So many things were out of place, Elaine didn't make any sense, Why didn't Olivia Cooke do anything to help her friends and so many other unanswered questions. The film made 20 million opening weekend on a 5 million budget so expect a sequel next year. Especially the stupid ending where she knows something is there when she looks in the planchette, that was just painful to watch. Overall, it's a fun stupid movie to watch with your friends and not think about the flaws much. Coming soon Ouija 2:Age of Planchette",

Yeah, you may jump, but even you begin to feel stupid for jumping at it. Director Stiles White makes this happen, because all he does to make you jump is keep things quiet, and then all of a sudden makes a creature jump out and scream with deafening noise. That's not a good scare, that's just effective.\n\nWhat happened to playing with our anticipation? What happened with playing with convention?

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is a horror movie based on an interesting premise, but one that is never really fleshed out well. As a quick refresher, Ouija boards are supposed to be gateways that demons and spirits can use to communicate and essentially gain entry into the human world. In the case of this movie, it's a malevolent spirit. I found the execution of this movie to be scattered and confusing. The evil spirits are never really fully defined, thus I am left with an unclear picture of what drove the spirit to kill so many people. The jump scares in the movie, however clich\u00e9d, kept my attention for most of the movie, and the acting is serviceable, but what this movie is really lacking is clarity. For example, I'm still not sure which spirit tortured the friends with the \"Hi, Friend\" message. I enjoyed watching this film in the spirit of Halloween, but it is an incredibly derivative and unremarkable horror film. I won't fail it, but there is really nothing terrific to take from this film other than semi-effective jump scares that will at least (mostly) keep your interest ----------------------------------------------- C",

Debby plays with an Ouija board from up in the attic and a spirit possesses her to kill herself causing her friends to play the game together to see if they can seek out her spirit. Throughout the movie we go by the typical jump scares and horror movie cliches, nothing special. Some special effects looked great though, the makeup on the spirits was pretty cool and the spirits being thrown into the wall and making a shadow was cool. I can honestly say I don't remember anyone's name except for Elaine, Trevor and Debby. VERY forgettable characters and forgettable performances too, although whoever played Elaine was pretty good. There were no shockers as to what happened except seeing the lady from Insidious who was forgettable actually. The creators had such a great opportunity with a plot like this but completely went the wrong way. When Debby came back from the dead to save Elaine, I was so stupefied as to why they did that. SHE'S DEAD let that be a mystery as to why they couldn't find her. Lot of scenes like that too, example: when the power goes out and they try turning on one lamp and Trevor says \"All the power is out\". There's a lot they could've done to make this movie more interesting but I give it a star for entertainment because it was interesting at parts and Elaine was a pretty good character. Ouija is a skippable horror flick that is sleepover material and not a great horror movie really. I hate to see a good idea for a movie go to waste like this. D-",

After the dreadful \"Annabelle\", I wanted to go into this with an open mind and that didn't even help. Aside from the great Olivia Cooke, \"Ouija\" is a typical by-the-books \"PG-13\" Horror film with an obvious twist and a sh*t ton of lame jump scares. Nothing original just another excuse to cash in on Halloween. A dragged out opening scene and nothing even minutely interesting. If you want a good Horror film to watch, check out the new remake of \"The Town That Dreaded Sundown\", \"V/H/S: Viral\" or \"The ABC's of Death 2\".

Not that I expected much from a horror film based on the spooky toy, once mass-marketed by Parker Brothers, but it amounts to nothing all that special or entertaining, just laughably dull.  Something interesting to note is how so many old slasher films and even the recent Saw franchise, among other horror franchises, end up receiving similar bad review scores, but will go on to be remembered by cult audiences.  No one will remember Ouija.  That is the kind of movie it is. This is a thing that will come and go.  It may have allowed work for some young actors and a decent job for the filmmakers involved, but that's about it.  Good on them for getting the film done, but yeah, it's just a silly horror movie.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

            "content": "Earlier this year, I saw a new horror film called It Follows. I'ts nice to get a solid horror movie amidst a pile of feces. Guillermo del Toro's, Crimson Peak hits theaters later this year as well. Nowadays, most horror movies are sh*t. Just when I think, maybe they'll get better, they get much worse. Films based on board games have been made before. Needless to say, most of them have been horrible. I can remember the classic Robin Williams film, Jumanji. Well, now we have a new one. \"Ouija\" is directed by Stiles White, and it's based on the board game of the same name. Frankly, it doesn't matter who stars in the film.\n\nThe story is-in is much detail as I can give-a girl plays the Ouija board and dies. Her parents find her hanging in their home. The first ten minutes are bearable. It wasn't great, but it set up everything plain enough. A girl hangs herself and all of her friends have to figure it out. Well, this doesn't last long. They go to the house, feel a presence, and assume it's their friend. Obviously, they have to use the board, and obviously they have to play in the house of their dead friend. Obviously, there are endless jump scares, none of which are scary. Obviously, the acting is really bad.\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting grade A performances, but these kids were awful. If there was one decent performance, it came from Olivia Cooke. Surprisingly, she was actually really good. Everyone else was a complete brick, especially Douglas Smith. None of the characters are memorable, none of them are interesting.\n\nI want to touch on the \"horror\" aspects of the film. The director has no idea how to make a horror film. While certain scary images are somewhat decent, and certain character deaths are sort of effective, they kill it with the incessant jump scares. A good horror film doesn't use this many jump scares. Personally, I have found the best horror films build tension slowly throughout themselves. When you use jump scares constantly, it makes the experience less scary, and more annoying. I was able to predict almost every single jump scare, before it happened. Some of them weren't even scary. Some idiot would yell or come around a corner making a loud noise. Sometimes a kid would drop something, or shut a door to hard. It was so predictable, not to mention boring as hell.\n\n\"Ouija\" is a film based on a board game. If that's not enough to get you uninterested, stay tuned for the final verdict. If there was one redeeming feature in this movie, it was the beautiful cinematography. Aside from this, everything was crass. The acting was garbage, the dialogue and script were juvenile, and it wasn't scary. Sure, some of the scares-maybe two of them-worked fine. It was just a drag from start to finish. At least it wasn't as horrible as A Haunted House 2.",

And in this particular case the prop is just hiding the fact that Ouija is actually more of a haunted house, critters in the attic film more than about an object of the occult. In this case it circles around a group of friends whose lead two female buddies played with Ouijas as children as their initial way to bond, as as adults comes as a wedge between them. When while playing with the Ouija one night the blonde friend has an encounter which results in her suicide, the rest of the scooby gang get together to initially mourn and then hold a saiance in order to make sense of the ghastly occurances that led to the event since it seemed so out of character. Enter the 1950's ghosts of the family who originally played with the board and shadows playing tricks with you and there you essentially have the film. Nothing cinematic or truely scary. Just an extremely slim premise that remotely has to do with something scary that hopes to pull in the droves at Halloween. Thankfully can only be now discovered somewhere at the bottom of a remainder bin near you.",

            "content": "People often defend horror movies. They say they're \"fun\", and I understand, people like to be scared. It's thrilling at times, and I agree that horror movies can be good, but that doesn't mean they all are, especially nowadays. Horror movies used to serve a purpose, they used to have a brain and a heart, and more on their mind than simply trying to scare everyone that goes to see it.\n\nSo I'm not writing this on the film's ability to scare, if you want me to, then fine, I'll sum it up. The movie is as scary as any other horror movie released in the past 5 years. Also remember, the film is rated PG-13, which restricts it from showing too much, although I must admit it, they seem to have gotten away with a lot with \"Ouija\". \n\nIt seems quite clear that most modern horror films have only one thing in mind: to scare the crap out of everyone as much and as often as possible. This has been the case for a while now, so much that I think people begin to forget about the story, which in this case, is absolutely horrible. It's even mistitled, the ouija board is barely a part of it, and it could've been better. It's basically only a reason for all of this crazy ghost nonsense to be happening, it's not smart or clever or unique in any way at all.\n\nOn top of the lame story, \"Ouija\" has little to no characterization, and of course they get good looking young actors and actresses to star in it, because that's so realistic right? Honestly, I often got confused about the differentiation between characters. They're all so similar, and why does the audience care if any of them succeed at their ultimate goal: to stop the ghosts and such, you know, the stuff that used to matter in older horror films.\n\nIt's possible to make a good horror movie, it is. It's just so difficult for people to do it when all that seems to be on their mind is the film's ability to be scary. Yes, they're horror films, obviously they should scare you, but we're all so sick of the anticipated jump scares. Can a movie scare us without finding the need to cheaply jump out for a quick second, especially when we can anticipate it? Horror movies are boring nowadays, and \"Ouija\" doesn't change anything. \n\nI watched a film called \"Psycho\". Nothing jumped out, no loud music played for a split second, yet it's chilling as hell. When I left the theater after \"Ouija\" I quickly returned to reality. A good horror movie should scare you with its story, it should have the ability to effect the way you think about the world. It should make you wonder. It should not make you laugh.",

            "content": "Sometimes I usually just rate it with the stars and don't write a comment, but I had to write one on this one. First of all, let me start by saying thank god I rented it on redbox. I originally was going to get it on Dvd for $20, since this was the movie I hyped most for in 2014 (besides Transformers 4). My friend suggested to get it on redbox first to see if I liked it, and if I did then get it on dvd. If you really want to see this, no matter what, rent it first.\nSecond of all, I am a die hard horror fan. There are only 2 horror movies I don't like (now 3 including this one) and only about 10 movies I have ever seen that I didn't like. So, this shows you if I don't like it, and I hate only 10/ a billion movies I've seen, it must be bad.  I thought it did a well job on creating a creepy atmosphere and having a good story and not just about the ouija board, but i am telling you they tried so hard. They had about 1 million \"jump scares\", and only one of them made me jump. I was so disappointed by the middle of the movie that I turned up the volume and sat in a different position to see if that helped. Nope. So, if a die hard horror/movie fan says this isn't good or scary, it isn't good/ scary.\nLastly, this had so much potential. As I said before, this was the 2nd most hyped movie for me of 2014, since horror movies rarely come out these days, and when they do, they are just about demons and possessions. So, when I found out this was going to be original  and new, I was excited. The trailer made it look creepy, even watching it was creepy (until about 30 minutes in.) \nThis also had Michael bay in it. He has done the purge( if u didn't like that, he did the second one) he did bad boys, transformers, TMNT, and many more. Even he couldn't save this movie.\nAnd one more thing. There was no character development, and no depth in the story. The characters the whole movie either died soon, or you just saw them playing with the board. There was no depth at all concerning there lives aside from being friends. Also, the story wasn't done well. The ouija board playing parts were well, if you consider that the story. I. Talking about the story they add in later on, where she has to unstitch the mouth, and all that. Well, that story was in the last 10 minutes of the movie. Yikes.\n\nUsually I don't write long reviews like this. I usually write in a sentence or 2, or I don't write anything. But I felt like I needed to express my dissapointment. So, no matter how much you think you want, to see it, believe me, you don't. Ouija 2 is coming, and I am excited believe it or not. I'm excited because I have high hopes they will do better. And, usually horror sequels are scarier than the original. So, to end it off, I hate on,y 10 movies that I've ever seen. If I think a movie is bad, it isn't good!!",

Sadly, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White script was green light that provided a smaller budget. The script gave very uninteresting characters, even seeing the actors on screen made them look a little awkward with their interaction. \n\nLaine (Olivia Cooke), Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), Pete (Douglas Smith), Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos) and Sarah (Ana Coto) band together to use a Ouija board to communicate with their dead friend except they have unleashed something sinister. The movie had a very few thrills but was slow moving watching Laine obsessively needing to make ends with their dead friend. The director Stiles White could have made it suspenseful but only following with senseless characters, the music composer could also have done something to add to it. Guess at a low budget, lets not put much effort while there is other supernatural horror films that worked really well like James Wan did with Insidious. \n\nOuija has a concept that could have been something and add to the horror genre.

Santos, Matthew Steele,\nLin Shaye, Ana Coto, Shelley Hennig, Robyn Lively and Vivis Colombetti.\n\nHollywood, will you ever learn. Board games cannot be turned into feature films. \"Battleship\" was a complete mess and now we have \"Ouija\", a supernatural horror film about a spiritual board that kills the teenagers who haven't seen at least one scary movie in their lives. It is one of the least scary movies I have seen in a long while. You will guess every shot from the closet door to the bathroom mirror to the dental floss. You will find more suspense in a game of Hungry Hippos.\n\n\"Ouija\" focuses on a group of friends who are trying to communicate a friend (who had just committed suicide by hanging) by playing around with the Ouija board. Soon, they awaken an evil spirit from the board and the spirit begins to haunt the group by killing them one-by-one. That isn't surprising. The group of five friends are played by Olivia Cooke (from TV's \"Bates Motel\"), Douglas Smith, Daren Kagasoff, Ana Coto and Bianca A. Santos. I believe these young actors will have bright futures in Direct-to-DVD scrap heaps.\n\nDirector and co-writer Stiles White has slow pacing and he can't generate scares or suspense. His previous movie credit was co-writing the godawful Nicolas Cage sci-fi thriller \"Knowing\". Not surprisingly, \"Ouija\" was produced by Jason Blum (who started low budget horror moviemaking with both the \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Insidious\" franchises) and Michael Bay (who produced the remakes of \"Friday the 13th\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"). \n\nI'm still not sure any Hasbro board game can be turned in a good feature film but if it has characters, a story and clever writing, I'll make it an exception. Even though it is totally disposable, \"Ouija\" has remained number one at the box office for two straight weeks.\nYou're better off watching \"The Conjuring\" or \"Insidious\" again. That's my advice.",

Hmmm, the jury remains out on that one, although I certainly won't be wanting to try a ouija board anytime soon. I think the whole concept itself is one that strikes fear into people anyway, so the film just has to enhance that fear with some psychologically daunting scenes. I'm not sure if it's fully done that to be honest, as I've not come out any more mentally scarred than I was before watching it. I think the introduction and build up is good, and the anticipation of what's about to happen is quite tense, but in reality what unfolds lets it down a bit as I became lost in translation in the concluding scenes. Evidently, people started becoming possessed by some spirit that has resided in the house as a result of its former occupants actions, but that wasn't presented very well. I think it would be scary to some teens, but not to a hardcore horror fan like myself. It was a little predictable when something was going to jump out, which spoils the atmospheric stakes really. I still liked the movie, and the storyline is always going to have the foundations of a winner, but it needs to be developed a little better in my opinion. The ghostly setting was there to be exploited a little more I think, as it seemed very short and a little rushed in places. There was nothing too original about it, meaning that although I enjoyed it on the whole, I wouldn't really fancy sitting through it again for the sake of friends, nor would I recommend it for a sinister evening in. I'm still looking forward to the sequel mind and will keep an open mind as to how good it could potentially be.",

Cooke gives a good performance in what feels like her first true starring role, rather than alongside bigger names (Jared Harris, The Quiet Ones; Brenton Thwaites and Lawrence Fishburne, The Signal), and Shaye (albeit a brief performance) gives an appropriately creepy one, continuing to prove her worth in the horror film world.

Normally when you see a PG-13 horror movie come out, it's either going to totally suck, or rock. Well you guessed it right, this Michael Bay produced horror film is pretty bad! The story is pretty simple, a bunch good looking/no-named actors (most of them in their late 20's) play teenagers, who think it's a logical idea to play with an Ouija board after one of their friends dies from, well while playing with an Ouija board! Ten minutes into the movie, things start spiraling downwards, as we sit through these worthless characters who are systematically getting picked off, one by one; but not in any cool \"Final Destination\" way, but in the dullest, least terrifying way imaginable. Honestly, I love these type of flicks because of the chills, and jumps they induce. Well, this movie didn't present any any of those, for all the jump scares, there wasn't any buildup, and it's predictability was unparalleled. The acting is pretty average, with the lead Olivia Cooke being the only one who actually had some scope, considering the idiotic script. The films also has a cameo from Lin Shaye (Insidious). Overall, there isn't much more to say about this film without becoming redundant. Ouija is a horrible, terribly written, and atrociously directed excuse of a horror film.",

            "content": "Olivia Cooke I think is a good actress, but she needs some work at picking better projects. All that Ouija does to try and be scary is make loud noises, and trying too much too often, the acting mostly is fine but the script makes watching the acting laughable at times, and the characters, while not unlikable, you never get to know them well enough to like or care about them. In the end, the movie just feels like a cheap and lazy attempt at making money, which unfortunately worked.",
