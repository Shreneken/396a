It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.\n\nThe lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would've been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proven formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.\n\nIts use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view. \n\nThere's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.\n\nGranted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

It's time we put this film style out to pasture, because this shtick is getting beyond old. Films like Cloverfield, Chronicle, and the first Paranormal Activity made good use of the found footage genre, offering different experiences and inventive uses for the medium. Here we are, years later, and this medium is beyond milked. In this recent milking, a newly wed couple find out they're pregnant after the honeymoon, only to find out that their \"baby\" to be is something more sinister. There is nothing scary, original, or inventive about this film. There isn't even anything good. The acting, the direction (found footage or not, it is horrible), and the writing are atrocious. Genre cliches are plentiful and ripe for the picking apart, but you'll be spending more time trashing this film than watching it. Better yet, just skip this junker and move on to something more interesting.",

Sure. Is the story good? No, it's not original in any form. Is there anything new brought to the genre with this film? Absolutely not.

            "content": "You may think Devil's Due looks like garbage pretending to be a movie - you'd be wrong. It is so much worse than you could possibly imagine.\n\nWhen a film is terrible, truly Devil's Due is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it is hard to choose a starting point for a review. While trying to formulate a procedural direction you think of each infuriatingly poor decision on behalf of the writer and director and how wasting 89 minutes of your life was easily avoidable.\n\nA recently wed couple, Sam and Zach, embark on their honeymoon to a tropical destination. On their final night they go off the beaten path to an underground party at the behest of their taxi-driver. Sam discovers she is pregnant almost immediately after they return home. The rest of Devil's Due is about the alleged terrifying events unfolding around - and inside of - her.\n\nAs a couple, Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are far from distinct, compelling or even believable. Allison Miller's Sam is cute but about as basic as you can get - case and point: she hugs a juicer she receives as a wedding present. Gilford painfully overacts as the cheesy newly-hubbied other half. He intrusively catalogs their whole life together, obnoxiously toting his video camera everywhere he goes, making sure it is always in focus, perfectly framed and well lit even when his wife is doubled over in pain.\n\nDevil's Due is touted as a 'found footage' film. If one more cheesy camcorder style horror movie is released I am going to dig up and then punch Jerome Lemelson's corpse in the face. Apparently a handheld camera is not enough for our character Zach in Devil's Due. In addition, he is a creepy pervert with hidden cameras throughout the house to capture life as well. Yet it also utilizes security footage at a grocery store, secret cameras in every room of the couple's house and police interrogation footage. This lack of direction must be what happens when there are two directors, Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, working on one film.\n\nAll the exasperatingly frustrating facepalm-worthy horror clichés are included in Devil's Due thanks to inexperienced screenwriter Lindsay Devlin. The plot is not new, not interesting and insanely moronic. Immediately, the main characters obliviously follow a stranger down a dark alley while in a foreign country to go to an unmarked party. Later, all the footage husband Zach painstakingly films is never actually reviewed, let alone uploaded to a hard-drive, so one must assume he buys his SD cards in bulk. Further, the transformation within Sam is purely incidental as the demonic fetus becomes stronger in her womb. In the meantime there is enough stagnating filler scenes to grind the film to an immediate halt.\n\nThere is nothing redeemable about Devil's Due and the fact it was even released, let alone in mainstream movie theaters, is baffling.",

If it has a fault, it's that it moves a bit too slow too frequently, often mistaking the building of tension for just dull and slow moving sequences without any tension.  More often than not though, the deliberate pace works, building up a creepy mood and a feeling of genuine uncertainty.  You never really know when things are going to hit the fan, and then when they do, they hit hard.  The film actually managed to illicit a scream from me on a few occasions, and the unsettling mood escalates to levels that are downright disturbing by the end.  The found footage approach is done a bit differently (not so much \"found\" footage, more that real-life cameras are the lens we view the movie through), and the performances feel genuine and realistic.  It would have benefited from some cuts to the slower scenes, but overall it's a truly great horror flick..",

I do like that the movie hold off the scares, and builds the relationship between Samantha and Zach so I can care and be worried about them whenever something happens. When the scares come, there is a decent amount that scared me, though I wish there could've been more of them. There were smart moments when the main character actually puts the camera down when trying to help his wife instead of just still recording her. The best part was the ending where everything goes crazy with lots of stuff in their house goes everywhere just like the director's segment with V/H/S.

            "content": "Devil's Due, otherwise known as The Most Realistic Film about Pregnancy Ever.  That's the best thing about this movie, that it helped me come up with a very stupid joke.  I don't wanna say that this is scraping the bottom of the barrel as far as found footage horror films go, I'm sure there's some really low-budget, cheaply produced crap that's far worse than this.  But, as far as \"mainstream\" found footage films go, this is only a slight step above The Devil Inside.  Perhaps that's a bit harsh because, at first, glance this film doesn't seem so bad.  There is some stupidity like the antichrist protecting the unborn baby when it sense it's in danger.  If that's the case then why not just get rid of the Zach, Sam's husband, and avoid him putting up a resistance to the coming of one of the antichrist's children.  Don't let him ever find out about the cult that is facilitating this process.  Turns out the antichrist isn't as smart as he has led people to believe.  That's the stupidest thing that comes to mind.  The problem is that the film is absolutely content in mimicking found footage films that came before it, that were better.  The one that comes to mind the most is the most obvious one.  That being Paranormal Activity, the first one at least.  There's something about how the film is structured and edited that just screams PA.  This film, in its climax, is a little more violent and bloody than PA ever will be, but it's clear this film was patterned after that series and its success.  I think it's fine if you take inspiration from a very successful series, or even borrow elements from it.  How many vampire films did we get right after Twilight came out?  It's gonna happen when something is popular, it's inevitable.  In the case of Twilight, though, many of the vampire related films that came after it were considerably better.  Found footage horror films are far more misses than they are hits, so it's increasingly difficult to find one that is as good, or better, than the first PA film.  The problem comes when the PA series itself is as creatively stagnant as it is that you want to see others try something different instead of repeating the same stuff you've seen a thousand times before.  And that is the main flaw of this.  It's content in repeating what others have done instead of blazing its own path.  Or even if you're gonna shamelessly ripoff another series, then at least put a little more effort into your scares, something this film is completely devoid of.  There's some jump scares here and there, but that's just laziness to me.  Here's the thing that made the first PA so great, they knew how to build tension.  I've said this a MILLION times since then, but the more that film went on the more uneasy things got.  You were dreading what was going to happen because you knew it was gonna be worse than what you had already seen.  That's something SO few horror movies get, that it's revealing another side of Paranormal Activity's intelligence, the first one of course, and not the terrible sequels.  This film doesn't get the tension and the suspense right at all.  For the most part this really is just a boring movie to watch, there's no suspense.  And that is what is needed most in this type of film where you're saving everything for the last 15 minutes.  I will say that the climax of the film was decent and suitably bloody, but it doesn't really do much other than remind you of how much better this could've been if more effort was put into it.  Perhaps the filmmakers did put in an effort, I don't mean to disregard their work...but it's clear that their best wasn't good enough.  And these guys did a pretty good segment in the first VHS.  Nothing extraordinary, but enough to make you think they'd do something better than this for their first full-length feature film.  Just skip this movie altogether and rent REC.  Now that's a fabulous found footage horror film.  It doesn't get any better than that.",

During their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, they explore the sights, party, and do all sorts of other things like any newly married couple would do on such a special occasion. During their last night in the country, a cab driver convinces them to go to a club with him, and during the intense partying, they black out and remember nothing of the rest of that night.\n\nShortly after they come home, it turns out that Samantha is pregnant despite all their attempts at birth control. Despite this unexpected event, the couple is happy to be expecting their baby and begin making the arrangements as any responsible parent would.\n\nBut, as time goes by, Samantha begins to change, and not in ways a pregnancy would normally change a woman, or her symptoms are far more severe than what most other women would experience. Her mood can suddenly go from happy to furious (Like when a car accidentally backs up into her and she smashes multiple windows in her rage), she develops cravings for raw meat despite being a vegetarian, seems to develop telekinetic powers (Which at one point she uses to murder a group of annoying teenagers), and also seems to get super strength as well from this baby inside of her.\n\nNow, her husband (Who is obsessed with holding a damn camera for every fucking event in this film), Zach must figure out what is really going on with his wife and their baby before it's too late for him, for her, and even other people. Slowly he begins to unravel the horrible truth of what really happened that night and what is really growing inside of his wife, all while other people are injured or killed in the process of the horror.\n\nWhat really kills Devil's Due is how damn boring it is. This mostly has to do with the fact that the film seems awfully content to be a generic brand of horror as it has absolutely no ideas of its own. If you've seen Rosemary's Baby along with virtually every other demon possession film, and pretty much any found footage film, you already know exactly what is going to happen and you will not give one flying fuck as any of it happens because any sense of tension, terror, or suspense is automatically negated.\n\nI would be hesitant to call this an assembly line horror film, but instead it feels like a bad bargain bin version of a generic assembly line horror film, making the experience all that much more miserable to sit through.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the direction is terrible. Even by the standards of found footage films which require a lot of camera shaking, dropping the camera, and various other things which can get annoying at times, Devil's Due has absolutely horrendous camera work, which only helped to ruin any sense of atmosphere as well as it became difficult to see much of what was happening because the dipshit characters either filmed at bad angles or dropped the fucking camera constantly. When I have to constantly crane my head to follow the camera to see where the hell it's going, something is desperately wrong.\n\nWhile I felt that the actors tried their best, they could do very little with their roles thanks to the horrendously generic and derivative script which feels like a horrid combo of a bargain version of Rosemary's Baby (For those who thought that film was too slow and needed an abundance of jump scares) combined with the film-making quality of the atrocious Paranormal Activity 2 & 4. I never cared about any of these characters and due to the generic nature of this film, it becomes abundantly clear very early on who is going to live and die and what happens. See? Can you blame the actors for not giving good  performances? What the fuck were they supposed to do with this shit?\n\nAlso, the film is certainly not scary and comes with all the annoying tropes of modern horror films. There's a lot of jump scares, stealing from much better sources to coat tail their successes, dumb characters with little to no development, tired ideas, and more. I was never scared, never creeped out, nor did I even feel any sense of dread or menace from the atmosphere because the atmosphere and tone are very lousy in quality. There's nothing here to satisfy most horror fans, and will only serve to please people who find jump scares frightening.\n\nDevil's Due is yet another lousy found footage film and another lousy demon possession film that has no creativity, energy, scares, good acting, quality storytelling, good music, or really much of anything going for it. Unless you're really hard up for a bargain version of Rosemary's Baby for people who don't have the patience or taste to appreciate that film, you won't find a damn thing in this film. Avoid it at all costs, as it cannot even be salvaged as trashy entertainment.",

            "content": "(4 Stars) Devil's Due is a huge surprise: a pseudo-found footage movie about a devil cult... and it's actually GOOD?!? Yeah, I still don't believe it, but it does so much right where other movies that look like this have failed.\n\nHere's the main reason why it's a good movie: the newlyweds (Allison Miller and Zach Gilford) are actually likable people. I don't really see them \"found footage acting;\" I see them as two happy people starting a life together. They aren't \"douchey guy\" and \"dumb girl who gets possessed,\" like every other movie out there in this genre. We take likable characters for granted in horror.\n\nAnd it's not exactly a found footage movie. It pulls a Chronicle (great handheld-camera based movie) and mixes security footage with consumer cameras. There isn't an \"editor\" who put all these clips together; you're just watching a story unfold in front of you.\n\nI think the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) know that these found footage movies aren't scary or convincing at all. They were with The Blair Witch Project, when everyone thought that was real, but that novelty is gone. So they set out to make a dramatic thriller with horror elements. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm watching a horror movie, and that's great.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect. The resolution is crappy due to a ton of convenient things that would have to happen for the cult and extremely incompetent police work. The climax is a little reminiscent of every found footage movie. And like I said, it's a dramatic thriller more than horror, so you might not be scared as much as you want to be.\n\nBut I hope people don't mistake this one for complete crap, like the very closely titled The Devil Inside. Devil's Due stands out among the sea of sludge and it's worth at least a rental.",

            "content": "It's extremely difficult to make a solid horror film nowadays. The movie follows Zach and Samantha McCall as two newlyweds heading to Santa Domingo for their honeymoon. Of course the over sensitive husband wants to document their entire lives as they begin their journey on becoming a family. They are given a gift of an adventure cam so they can continue to document things without the need of holding a handheld camera. After what seems to be a wonderful vacation the two are approached by a taxi driver who leads them for one last hurrah to celebrate their trip. You find out this becomes the biggest mistake of their young marriage. When they return home Samantha finds out she's pregnant and things to start to become a little strange for the two. Not only is the pregnancy itself of concern but Zach feels as if his new family may also be being watched. You soon find out that Samantha's behavior has changed drastically and she has become the vessel to a child no woman would want to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCinema (and certainly the horror genre) has become over saturated with the cheaper film making process known as 'found-footage. It's a struggle to see how the increasingly convenient camerawork that continues to capture poorly shot scenes and set pieces can still be taken seriously. Scenes that frame a conversation that moves the plot forward with an eye rolling revelation are the most bothersome, especially when wondering, \"Why would you be recording this?\" Then there is the irritating money shots while characters fight for their lives. Of course we need to see it, but again, in the back of your mind you're always thinking, Surely it'd be easier to survive or escape if they'd only throw the camera. While its first half promises to take an alternative route to what we've become accustomed to in this sub genre while sticking to the rule of an excited, expectant couple wanting treasured memories, it's not long before those aforementioned questions begin to rear their ugly head. It descends into a muddled supernatural mess by throwing in CCTV from supermarkets, car parks, strangers' camcorders, police interviews, and most bizarrely the mysterious cult keeping tabs on the couple to assure another little Satan is delivered safely. Conducive in its linear approach to a narrative we can simply understand, it fails in its delivery significantly. Leaving you to pose another question. Whose supposed to be putting all this crap together???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two leads give strong, committed performances, Miller in particular. They are the film's only saving grace, but, when the script progresses from their obvious love of one another to wanting to secure jump scares alongside special effects, Devil's Due loses that impressive emotional impact initially built up early on. None more so than, when at a family gathering, the camera is unbelievably given to children running around the house playing hide and seek. From then on, it no longer feels interested in building up to a terrifying tale. This is, or rather supposedly is, a horror film. It becomes increasingly obvious it's more concerned in impressing with stunt work or set pieces, with the pyrotechnic-filled conclusion sign posted well in advance. We're then treated to an unnecessary post credit sequence offering something glaringly obvious. Devil's Due, like most found footage entries, falls flat in its cringe worthy execution and refuses to stand out from the crowd. The only thing it does deliver, aside from disappointment, is predictability.",

After the last two Paranormal Activity films, you could clearly see that the genre had overstayed its welcome. With Devil's Due you have a generic film that simply isn't scary and it fails to really grab your attention in terms of horror elements. The found footage genre is overdone, and with a film like this one, it's clear that there is nothing left to offer the genre. The cast are good, but it'[s a shame that the film's material doesn't gel together, and in turn becomes forgettable. Devil's Due is never scary; in fact it's silly in the way it tries to do so. You know exactly how this film will turn out. The scares are nonexistent, and the film's story just suffers from a lack of genuine thrills and good writing. If you want a great horror film, you won't find it here. This is a predictable affair, one that we've seen in far better found footage horror films. Devil's Due has the misfortune of coming too late in the game, and the result is a train wreck of a film, and it's unfortunate that the story is bad because the cast are quite good here. I think it's a shame that the film's story goes nowhere, and it never realizes its potential of being a good horror film. Maybe if they wouldn't have made a found footage style movie, and reworked the film then maybe this film would have been much better. However, it's just boring, uninteresting and it never is a worthwhile film to watch. Personally, I'm surprised that I was able to finish this, as the film lacked in originality and truly memorable, terrifying elements, which makes the horror genre so good.",

Because someone out there really likes it, and who am I to judge.

I was too busy watching films that deserved my attention compared to this..................valiant attempt at a January horror masterpiece.  So I was fortunate to have a copy of this left for me on my kitchen counter via redbox.  I'll be sure to leave that person an absolutely wonderful thank you card for this...............gracious gesture.\nAnyways, the plot is very..........good.  I mean, someone being possessed is an idea that certainly isn't going out of style.  It's been months since I've seen one, and let's just say that I've been dying for a possession thriller.  \nYou want scares.........good.........because this movie has a butt load of them.  Are they my kind of scares?  No........but that doesn't mean they aren't awesome.  Say you have a 3 year old who accidentally walks in on this........my GOD.  That would terrify the hell out of them.  So make sure you tuck your kids in so they don't interrupt this....................fright fest.\nSo uh..............oh yeah..........stuff flies around and hits people!  I've never seen a possession movie do that before!  Granted I've only seen about 10 movies in my life, so there may be one out there that I don't know about.  But wowzers, was it ever cool.\nSo that uh..........that about does it.  I didn't see any plot holes, cheap acting, void of entertainment, typical cliches, predictable elements, or lazy writing.  So if I were to rate this movie..........I would give it.............a fair score.  Because that's the nice thing to do",

They live in a palatial home decorated by Laura Ashley, with a dog that's obviously the brains of the outfit. Zach has some non-descript high-powered job that allows him ample free time to assemble flat-pack furniture and work his way up from slip-ons to lace-ups, and Samantha is in college studying something-or-other ('cos people who go to college are smart, right?). An over-inflated sense of entitlement compels these hateful imbeciles to compulsively record every vacuous utterance and bodily function that emanates from their gurgling blowholes, but is hidden under the excuse of starting a \"family history\" (nicely shoehorned, found-footage device).\n\nOn the last night of their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, the newlyweds lose their way back to their hotel, although this pair of mouth-breathing simpletons would probably get lost on the way to their en-suite. Anyway, they accept an offer from a very dodgy complete stranger and willingly follow him off to the dodgiest slum in Santo Domingo, where Simple Samantha is drugged and impregnated by a satanic cult (or something like that). When they awake in their hotel the next morning with no memory of what happened or how they got there, Simple Zack decides to completely ignore the video camera that's been recording everything that's happened to these two morons since the start of the movie, and instead puts the whole affair down to a hangover.\n\nOn returning to Casa del Simpleton, they are overjoyed to discover that Simple Samantha is with child. When her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic - for example, scarfing fistfuls of raw mince straight from the freezer section of the local supermarket, or hunting, killing and devouring a pack of wild deer - Simple Zach chalks this behaviour down to hormones (women, eh?). Had her index finger started speaking Bible verse in a demonic voice, this fool would probably have shrugged and thought, \"That's awesome, dude.\"\n\nDevil's Due is a dumb, dumb movie that doesn't work on any level. It has the aesthetic and appeal of a bad student film. The found-footage gimmick necessitates a constant \"Oh, you're miscarrying? Hold on, let me just grab the camera,\" that turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. It is unlikely to satisfy the most undiscerning fan of horror. The gore isn't that gory, and the bizarre choice of using an annoying \"interference glitch\" means that the film's few genuine shocks are well-signposted. During the film's climax, I was more distressed by the destruction of the delightful furnishings and fittings than by whatever grisly punishment was being meted out either of our two idiotic protagonists. Nevertheless, it was probably very cheap to make and will sell enough tickets at the box office to justify a sequel. And that is really scary.",

It has a decent enough build up, solid enough performances and weird goings on and the despite the slightly over the top ending being a bit love or hate(or WTF?!), the build up to it is good.

Literally everything, I kept thinking \"turn that off at the dinner table, you prick!\", or \"Your not doing anything special, why is it on?\".

It was nice to find myself actively rooting for these two to make it out of the predicament ok. That said, the two leads really are all this film has going for it. It follows every possession film cliche in very obvious ways (at least it doesn't rely as heavily on jump scares as you think it would, although the film is never ever scary). The only good parts in this film are the deer scene and the ending. It also doesn't help that the film is kind of scattershot(however it doesn't rely on shaky cam all that much, so that's nice). I do love Radio Silence (the name of the group that put this film together), and they clearly have some talent but Devil's Due, while not particularly awful, isn't really any good either.

            "content": "If there's one bit of knowledge I could scream at every single person in the world this time of year it's this: NEVER GO SEE MOVIES IN JANUARY. It's a dumping ground off all the movies the studios didn't want to release in the previous year or have no better time to release the rest of the year. Looking at the chart on Rotten Tomatoes there are only one or two movies released this year that have a score above 50%. So far this year we've had the Asylum-wannabe Legend of Hercules, the horrendously unfunny Ride Along, the hispanic bore-fest Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, the Godfrey-Hoed 47 Ronin, and coming up we have the doomed I, Frankenstein (which I'm sure will follow in the footsteps of Dylan Dog and Priest as being a not too bad, but horribly cliched movie that ruins a great premise) and That Awkward Moment where men act like assholes... like every other comedy these days. So Devil's Due already has that going against it, let alone the fact it's yet another found-footage film and that it seems to be a remake of Rosemary's Baby. However, does it manage to scrap it's way to excellence despite these handicaps? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. No.\n\nDevil's Due is the story of a newlywed couple who finds themselves expecting after the wife is impregnated on their honeymoon by a mysterious cult. The next 9 months quickly become a nightmare as they're plagued by the wife's unusual violent outbursts, telekinesis and lust for blood. The conspiracy deepens as they seem to be followed everywhere and people in their lives seem to disappear, leaving the husband on a desperate search for answers (filming all the way).\n\nFound-footage/Mockumentary is a style of filmmaking that has exploded into the horror community and very slightly into other genres, mainly through the independent movement. Found-footage is absolutely dirt-cheap to make and they turn regular horror movie profits, which is why studios love them so much. Many horror fans despise them for being slow and anti-climatic with terrible acting and effects. My argument back is that most horror movies have terrible acting, a good chunk have shitty effects, and for the first 50 years of horror the movies were slow-paced. I actually like a few found-footage movies, like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, and to a certain extent Paranormal Activity 2. While I had great experiences viewing them for the first time they all have no re-watch value. Chronicle, which isn't horror, but still a film I thoroughly enjoyed, is probably the only one I would go back and watch again for the purposes of actual enjoyment. Mockumentary's a film-style I can respect if a) it's just a style and their are no in-story cameras (Chernobyl Diaries) or b) if they have cameras in the story and use them properly (Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity). Devil's Due doesn't fall into either of these, with a myriad of inaccuracies that on their own are the nitpicks of a film nerd, but combined create a lack of believability in the story (which is the whole point of found footage). There are tons of camera angles that shouldn't exist, but do because the director said so. The cameras all look the same with maybe a filter thrown on, despite being radically different models. The husband even mentions that the tape is gone despite the fact the movie is clearly shot in digital HD. If you're going to be found footage, make the effort to be found footage. There was no reason this movie needed to be found footage other then the fact that the writers couldn't come up with anything original and scary enough for the studio to put more money into it.\n\nNow since we can pretty much ignore acting or effects and just assume they're shit, lets go to the scares shall we. The most important part of a found footage movie are the payoffs of all the build-up and suspense the relatively slow paced rest of the movie creates. At least thats how it's supposed to work. Devil's Due is slow paced alright, letting us watch the marriage and honeymoon of these fairly boring protagonists. I understand the theoretical purpose behind this as it's intended to get us invested in these characters, however it's completely ineffective as the only defining characteristic the guy has is that he likes to film stuff and while the girl actually has character and is interesting to watch, it doesn't matter since she gets possessed and becomes the antagonist. Let's contrast this with Rosemary's Baby, where Rosemary is in a similar situation, except she has her faculties the whole time and it isn't until the end where she loses it. The mother here goes bat-shit insane half-way through the movie and we might as well be watching The Exorcist from that point. Well except for the fact that the Exorcist was scary, and this movie is inept at building any tension or suspense to make it's frequent jump-scares anything more then cheap tricks. The film relies almost entirely on jump-scares and the rest of it's fear tactics involve breaking a window, eating raw meat and a hilarious scene where a bunch of kids get thrown around like a scene out of Chronicle. It's hard to describe why there appears to be no threat here and yet there is in movies like Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch, but rest assured you have nothing to be scared of when watching this film except for when you look at your watch and discover just how little time has passed.\n\nA colleague of mine who I frequently disagree with on movies stated that this movie is nowhere near as bad people make it out to be and that it's actually worth a trip to the theatre if you've run out of December releases to see. While I think it's true that this movie is not the worst thing ever made and that it doesn't deserve the 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes it has right now, it's nowhere near worth the current $12 movie ticket price. If anything this movie is just blatantly mediocre and with a different director it could have actually been an interesting take on the devil baby storyline. As it stands though, there are plenty of movies far more worth your time if you're interested in these themes, but if you really are curious about this movie then just wait until it hits Redbox. If you do want a devil pregnancy story then I recommend the slow but effective Rosemary's Baby or even the first season of American Horror Story and if you want a found footage movie then check out if you haven't already The Blair Witch Project, the oft forgotten The Last Broadcast, and if you don't want horror then Chronicle. Before I resign my keyboard for this review I would just like to emphasize that you should really hold off going to the theatre until February as odds are your viewing experience will be less then pleasant. Thats not to say all January releases suck but there certainly is never an Oscar winner among them.",

            "content": "January 17, 2013\r\n \r\nEver since \"The Blair Witch Project,\" the \"found footage\" style of filmmaking has become inextricably linked with horror movies. It's with good reason, I suppose, since the purpose behind the technique is to lend the film a raw, realistic atmosphere, and when something feels more realistic, it often feels scarier.\r\n \r\nBut after so many examples, from the interminable \"Paranormal Activity\" series to \"The Last Exorcism,\" the method simply can't have the same impact it once did, and in the case of \"Devil's Due,\" I'm not convinced this manner of presentation was even necessary. Then again, the entire production doesn't seem necessary.\r\n \r\nA movie like this practically embodies the word \"derivative.\" It borrows so heavily from other movies, including the ones I already mentioned, that it almost seems deliberate. There's not one fresh or original bone in its body. And yet, it's not a train wreck, or even badly made. Perhaps at a different time across the cinematic landscape--say, 15 years ago--\"Devil's Due\" might have been more effective and only comparable to the superior \"Rosemary's Baby,\" at least as far as demonic possession movies go. But now, in 2014, there's nothing about it that makes it stand out and we quickly grow bored with it.\r\n \r\nThe story follows a young newlywed couple, Zach (Zach Guilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller), during a horrific experience following their honeymoon to Santo Domingo. On their last night there, they get lost and are picked up by a seemingly friendly cab driver (Roger Payano), who takes them to a secret underground party. Because Zach likes to record everything with his video camera (here's where the found footage comes into play), we witness everything candidly, even if he and Sam don't. After they get drunk and pass out, they're taken to an ominous stone chamber, where religious signs and symbols grace the walls and floor. (It's not clear who was recording them or holding the camera at this point, but never mind.)\r\n \r\nCut to Zach and Sam's hotel room the next day and they both have massive hangovers and aren't exactly sure how they got back. Nevertheless, they return to their quaint suburban home and Sam discovers she's pregnant, despite her claiming to \"take the the pill religiously.\"\r\n \r\nFrom here on out, strange and creepy things start to happen. Based on the genre, and because we're smart enough to know way in advance where the plot is going, we can pretty much check these occurrences off one by one: Sam develops bruises on her body but is unable to explain where they came from; an ultra sound of the baby causes technical glitches on the monitor; Sam, who's a vegetarian, impulsively tears open a package of ground beef at the grocery store and begins to eat it like a rabid animal; and she experiences sudden nosebleeds and spikes in strength that give her the power to break windows and throw people across the room. There's also the issue of the creepy guys who watch her from across the street.\r\n \r\nGiven the movie's title, not to mention the Bible verse that opens the film--\"Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come...\" 1 John: 2:18--it's pretty obvious what, or who, is gestating inside of Sam. But does the movie put any kind of original twist on this premise or offer any new insight into the underlying idea? Not really. It's all standard horror fodder and the movie dishes out all the usual conventions, such as the family dog suspecting something is awry (somehow dogs are always the first to know); or a priest (Sam Anderson) sensing an evil presence and bleeding out uncontrollably. You get the idea.\r\n \r\nIf you've seen any demonic possession movie before, \"Devil's Due\" will not seem like anything new. But unlike some of its brethren, it's not particularly scary, thrilling or really all that interesting. For its mere 89-minute runtime, we patiently wait for something gripping or frightening to happen, but because every scene feels like a retread, it never does. The plot rolls out exactly as we expect it to, which makes it something we bear instead of enjoy.\r\n \r\nI mentioned the movie isn't badly made, and it isn't. On a technical level, it's competently shot and put together, even though we question the narrative purpose behind the found footage approach. Aesthetically, I know what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish, but how did they want us to interpret it from the world of the movie? Did they want us to think someone took all the footage from the various cameras that recorded the events and spliced it together?\r\n \r\nIn any case, we're probably not supposed to think too hard about it and just accept the movie's presentation as a device to make it more tense and suspenseful. And I'd be willing to do that had it actually been tense or suspenseful, but it's mostly bland and no new ingredients have been added to the mix to spice up this particular horror sub-genre.\r\n \r\nIt feels wrong to write this, but it's sometimes a shame movies like \"Devil's Due\" are so cheap to make (it reportedly cost $7 million to produce), because if they had higher budgets, perhaps the studio and filmmakers would make more of an effort to do something different with them to better ensure audiences got the best bang for their buck. As it is, \"Devil's Due\" barely give us a tap, let alone a bang.",

            "content": "Demonic possession has been the most popular theme in the horror genre as of late.  Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring, Insidious, and the list goes in, have all been the talk of the cinema at one point or another.  Devil's Due takes a unique approach by neglecting to incorporate ghosts into the mix unlike its brothers and sisters.\n\nIf you have ever heard of, or viewed Rosemary's Baby, it will ring bells and reveal where this take on possession received its inspiration.  Is the former a bad place to learn from?  Not at all.  The problem lies in the fact that the 1968 version is a far superior film. And not just a far walk home from work.  I'm talking as far as Canada is from Japan.  Walking distance, no plane.\n\nThis found footage take on Rosemary's Baby did have some things going for it at the start, but it all went away as the film progressed.\n\nA happy pair of newlyweds, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) go to Dominican Republic for a classic honeymoon get-away.  Everything looks wild and exciting, until a strange cab driver convinces them to try out a club nearby. Zach persuades Samantha that one more drink will be fun.\n\nThe two end up drugged, and forget everything that happened. Viewers witness the camera picking up blurred images of creepy Satanic appearing rituals, as the couple are fast asleep.  Once back home, Samantha reveals that she is pregnant.\n\nJoy surrounds the household, until the baby waiting process starts becoming very unusual for Samantha. Nose bleeds, and knock off your feet pains can occur at times for any future mother, but developing a carnivorous appetite,  violent aggression, and telepathic powers are certainly not normal.\n\nDevil's Due did a good job with casting.  The two leads are easy to like, and both know how to act.  Zach is a television star, known mostly for his role in Friday Night Lights.  He has appeared in films such as The Last Stand, Crazy Kind of Love, and the upcoming The Purge 2.  Miller is also mostly known from television, appearing in Terra Nova and Kings.\n\nBoth have potential to be in bigger and better movies, as they do have the talent.  As good as it is to have focus on the characters, I cannot say I was entertained by how long it went on.\n\nIt was simply happy family chatter, that added nothing to the plot. Zach is a cocky, funny guy who means well, while Samantha is a more laid back, sweet woman who lost her parents and grew up in foster care.  They love each-other very much.\n\nI described the first forty minutes of character development in a ten second read.  Zach demonstrates bravery and determination to save his wife, but that is expressed later on in the plot.\n\nIt never built up anything particularly special, minus the usual you would expect from this sort of film.  People being dragged and tossed by an unseen force is just not amusing anymore.  It has been done in Paranormal Activity and Quarantine already, no need for more of that.\n\nNothing was scary or creepy.  The jump scares, with the exception of one that caught me off-guard, were terribly obvious, and poorly concealed.  A scene or two did have a cool, or humorous effect, standing out as more memorable than the rest.\n\nOther than painfully phony coughs by the priest (Sam Anderson), the happenings in the church led to an entertaining few minutes. When Samantha is walking through the grocery store, make sure to keep your eyes on the bystanders.  Their reactions made me smile.\n\nThe two parts I mentioned above were far more interesting than the climax and final few moments. Predictable, boring, and done before countless times.  Not to mention the severe usage of plot holes in order to make this film progress conveniently.\n\nWithout spoiling anything important, here is an example. A surprise party is thrown for Samantha, but she feels tired and goes upstairs.  A child wonders up later, looking for the dog I believe. She wonders into a room, and gets scared off by a creepy, possessed looking Samantha.\n\nDoes she go downstairs and make mention of this?  Did no one else hear the loud pitched screams of terror?  Is Zach going to question Samantha about it in the morning? Nope, explaining things would be difficult I suppose.  A young child would surely run down crying, and make a big deal about it.  The plot holes revealed in the last scene of a interrogation room are much worse.  Asking yourself, \"How?\", can be expected.\n\nFound footage is far from my favorite type of film. Thankfully, Devil's Due managed to do one thing right. Instead of Zach carrying a camera around constantly, the film makes use of security camera's when in public, and cameras are placed around the house.  It is clever, and makes more sense when you think about it.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film brings nothing new to the table, or anything worth watching again.  The majority of the acting is strong, but the characters themselves are not memorable or special. Scares may come for people who have never watched a horror film, or jump at their own shadow, but the experienced fans will walk out disappointed.\n\nIf this is next on your list, I would advise waiting until it comes out on Netlix.  And even than, ignoring it would still likely be the smartest decision.  This demonic possession phase has run its course.  In all honesty, the genius \"Devil Baby Prank\" used to market Devil's Due is scarier and more entertaining than the actual film itself.\n\nSuperpower Film Scale: 1.5/5\n\n1: Villainous Waste\n\n2: Careless Bystander\n\n3: Hero unaware of powers\n\n4.  On the verge of greatness \n\n5. Heroic film\n\nStandout acting hero: Zach Gilford & Allison Miller",

It is essentially Rosemary's Baby retold through the found-footage format.  As an avid found-footage horror fan, I enjoyed it, but others may not.  It mixes together elements from various found-footage films, particularly the Paranormal Activity series, and it never really pushes the genre in any new direction.  I also found the believability of the \"found-footage\" conceit to be somewhat tenuous during certain shots.  Also, the husband who films everything is extremely cheesy and annoying, and I longed for something to kill him off.  Still, Devil's Due manages to become creepy during the final third of the film and is worth a watch for found-footage fans and those who dig Satanic horror movies.  There are far worse Satanic found-footage films.  Believe me: I have seen way too many!",

            "content": "\"Devil's Due\" is definitely not a well constructed movie. Despite it being very unoriginal, I still went in with hopes and felt I would enjoy this film very much. The film is very predictable and repetitive, the story unoriginal, the scares were not even close to being startling, and the ending was extremely anti-climatic and opens up the door for a sequel; that is, of course, not needed. I could literally predict everything that was going to happen, what line of dialogue would be said next, and how it would end. The film is filled with cliches which become very annoying. Some of these are the dog growling at the baby in the stomach because it is to represent evil inside, while another one with the dog is where they edit the footage at the exact time when the dog is barking at the camera and they raise the volume to purposefully try and scare you. This is something I get offended by because it shows that they do not have confidence in their movie and the \"real scares\" that will come along later so they try to do a cheap scare like this to guarantee to themselves that the audience will jump at least once. The film is repetitive because we go from the mother showing us that something is wrong and she is being taken over by a supernatural force and then everything is okay. Then back to something wrong and then everything is okay. It gets to the point where I was sitting in my chair thinking: \"Okay we get it, something is not right. She has a demon or the devil in her. Move on already.\" My final gripe with this film is that the characters are so unbelievably stupid. The things that happen in this film, I can tell you no sane human with even a shred of common sense would do most of the things these characters did. Two good things I can say that were good was the acting and the special effects near the end of the film when things start going horrible but unfortunately that is all I can say positive about this film. Very slow build up, stupid characters, unoriginal and repetitive, predictable, and very anti-climatic with virtually no pay off at the end. \"Devil's Due\" is definitely a perfect example as to why January is known as the month of terrible releases. If you do want to see it, wait for it to come to a dollar theater or for a friend to get it and watch it at home. Otherwise, skip this film.",

Ok so the premise of the movie was good, although it's basically taken from Rosemary's Baby but found footage style, no real big scares, Overall it was mostly just the stages of a woman's pregnancy with the odd \"weird thing\" happening to her, it wasn't as good as Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones even....Nothing interesting until the last 7-10 minutes, the camera is so shaky in this movie you get motion sickness, it's jumping vertically, horizontally like someone spinning around on a fair ride. There are also camera's staged in the house (like paranormal Activity) WHY not film the movie normally?? The same style applies to this movie like the other movies.

This brings us our first lesson. People who have a fetish for filming their own tedious existence are a beacon to Satan and his demons. So if your partner is one of those dump the fucking weirdo.\n\nAnyway back to Zach and Sam the unfortunate young couple in this film, we see them get married then go on their honeymoon to Dominican Republic.\n\nLesson two, never trust a taxi driver in the Latin America, if the taxi is full of rosary beads or Jesus dolls they are definitely Satan worshippers.\n \nOur couple end up in an underground nightclub, get wasted then wake up in their hotel room, typical yanks three tequilas and they are shit faced. So they return home and low and behold Sam is pregnant. Cue unprovoked bouts of violence, tiredness, sleep walking and a scene that puts Sam top of the FBI suspect list for who killed Bambi's mum. Add in weirdo's stalking the couple, and their house looking like pagan ritual site.\n\nLesson Three, we get the catholic priest who seems to know an extraordinary amount about Satan and Satanic rituals. Which let's face it only happens in horror films, as most priests are more interested booze and children.\n\nSo all in all yet another crock of shit horror film, that will no doubt make a decent profit as it look like it cost about $65 to make and spawn \"Devils Due 2 - Shit returns\" and \"Devils Due 3 - Seriously you mugs are still watching this shit\".\n\nIt says it all really when the Labrador is probably the only convincing actor in the film.\n\nFinally Lesson four, don't watch this shit, you have been warned.",

Sure, found footage started out surprising like Cloverfield, and the first couple of Paranormal Activity's and Chronicle was a different take. But now, it lost its energy and is becoming the same thing over again and filled with cliché's of people carrying cameras during a terrifying scenario. \n\nDevil's Due is about a newlywed couple Zach (Zach Gilford) and Sam (Allison Miller) going on a honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Until they visit an underground club, and they both wake up the next day after passing out. They arrive home, and Sam finds out she is pregnant which they are happy for the start of a family. Until she is slowly transitioning with possession like effects and mysterious people are secretly keeping them under surveillance. While her baby could be the antichrist, and Zach tries everything to save her.\n\nThe plot felt like it borrowed some concept like 1968 Rosemary's Baby film but in a found footage format. There was no thrills or scares that can keep the movie engaging. It was boring and slow that it was hard to care about what was going to happen next in the movie. The cliché of the main character carrying a camera during uneventful scenarios was not as believable. \n\nThe movie felt like a bad amateur style filmmaking abusing the concept of found footage. It really looked like it when there is no sense of excitement anymore. Devil's Due is horrible and it is showing that found footage concepts have run its course.",

This movie, however, is refreshing and doesn't rely on gore and cheap shocks. It's a clever piece of storytelling with some perfect glimpses at evil. There were also some great uses of SFX towards the end.

A superb feature from Radio Silence and I for one am looking forward to seeing what they do next.",

It was definitely a bit more jumpy but I guess not that scary as I thought it would be.  I was pleased that they typical storyline wasn't a typical family moving into a spooked house plot like most horrors have been based on.  This was certainly a complicated pregnancy lol.

When the scare scenes of the movie happened, it was absolutely worth every minute!!  The action scenes, found footage, and scares were way more superior than the Paranormal franchise by far!!  The cast were great!!  If you like scary movies with awesome scare scenes, that I highly recommend that you check this out!!  If you want more scare scenes throughout a horror film, than you should look far away from this movie!!  This is absolutely a must-see if you want to see some creative scares!!",

Starting off you get to know this couple, Sam and Zach who have great chemistry together, they take a trip to the Dominica Republic for their honey moon. After a night of partying they meet up with a taxi driver who takes them to some underground party and that's when the film gets really interesting. The films main problem was that it wasn't scary. Thrilling at times, and even creepy, but not scary. The acting is actually very good with two likable leads, but I think the film would have been better shot the traditional way rather than FF. Lots of weird crazy stuff happens throughout, especially towards the end of the film like most FF films. Overall, the film had two great lead actors, and it had a crazy finale, but I was never really scared and I kinda wanted more. The film does end in a way to where they could do sequel, which I highly doubt will happen due to poor reviews, I guess we will have to wait and see!",
