These are just some of the themes that are exposed through the story and are handled without making everything a cliche'.\nThe animations are a pleasure to watch as well as, thanks especially to the catalysator of the story, Baymax, there is a great touch of humor that is not only the way to make less serious the drama that Hiro, the protagonist, is leaving, but will be also the resolutive key for the events to get resolved.\nI loved very much the setting, the town of San Fransyoko, a nice balanced mixture of San Francisco and Tokyo. \nA perfect movie that will leave some suspense! The plot seems to be obvious but it has a nice twist that, although can be figured out, is not crystal clear until the very end.",

These people are adults in this movie yet they can't tell someone's acting a bit crazy or fishy not just by a science fair?? But by long hours working with the person who brought them to school and all? I find this plot so funny to me. But I feel like there was a genius behind the plot and that was Baymax. He knew yet his only goal was to help all of them face grief and loss which he programmed himself to do. I feel like to me everyone knew who it was but they were just having a goofy good time to make everyone else feel better. There's just a smart hidden plot in this movie that I'm not getting that I only focused on the main plot.",

            "content": "Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.\n\nHowever, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.\n\nSure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The plot is neither great nor very believable but I don't think having a great plot was the purpose of this film.

            "content": "Summary\nA lonely 14 years-old robotics genius, Hiro Hamada, loves building his own robots to defeat other robots in street fights in San Fransokyo city. His older brother, Tadashi, is concerned about Hiro's future, so he decides to take Hiro on an engaging tour of his university's robotics lab. There Hiro meets Tadashi's genius friends and falls in love with the robotic program. In order to get accepted into the program, Hiro designs a new type of nanorobots (microbots) to impress the program's director, Callaghan. During the presentation of the inventions, there is a tragic event that leaves Hiro immersed into a deep depression until he finds Baymax, a personal healthcare companion designed by his brother, who seems to leaven his sadness. After a bunch of funny and mysterious events, Hiro finds out a shocking truth about the presentation's tragedy. It was not an accident, but it was produced by Callaghan to steal Hiro's microbots. Out of rage, Hiro decides to upgrade Baymax\u00b4s functions turning him into a fighting robot, and gathers his brother's friends to form a group of \"superheroes\". What apparently starts as a mission to find out the truth behind Callaghan's mystery, turns into a selfish act of revenge from Hiro. However, in this revenge process, the group discovers the heartbreaking reason behind Callaghan's decisions. Late in the film, and after putting rage and hate aside, Hiro and Baymax save Callaghan\u00b4s daughter by getting into it the portal, but while doing so, Baymax gets stuck and is not able to come out of the portal. After a few months and several tries, Hiro rebuilds Baymax and gets his robot friend back.                                       \n\nAnalysis\nBig Hero 6 is a touching and enjoyable animated movie that conveys friendship, love, adventure, action, and superheroes while promoting an anti-violence message. This film helps viewers to realize that violence is never the solution even when it appears to do good. Focusing on Hiro, he is filled up with so much anger and a deep desire for revenge against Callaghan for a valid reason, which pushes him to turn sweet Baymax into a murdering machine. However, at the end of the movie, he chose to forgive and even help the villain. The movie encourages people not to choose violence but to do good in everyone's life. Also, the movie shows us that love comes along with sacrifices, sometimes these sacrifices are meaningless but sometimes they are huge and heartbreaking. As we were able to see at the beginning of the movie, Tadashi sacrificed his own life to save someone's else life who happened to be the villain of the movie, or when Hiro sacrifices his robotic best friend to save Callaghan's daughter, even when Callaghan was partly responsible for his brother's death. Additionally, this movie portrays the importance of friendship in a person's life. It is wonderful to see how Tadashi's friends and Baymax help Hiro to recover from depression after his brother's death just by offering him their friendship, time, love, and advice. Big Hero 6 illustrates how a well-intentioned friendship can help you to move on and even become a better person.\n\nCritique/Recommendation \nBig Hero 6 is one of the best Disney movies produced. Despite of it being a little bit predictable towards the end, the movie works out really great thanks to the charism of its characters, the exciting action scenes, and its effective emotional content. All characters are memorable, especially Baymax the most lovely and cute robot ever seen on screen. The villain of this movie is a well-developed character based on a complicated background story, which makes it easy for viewers to feel sorry for him and experience empathy.  The script and dialogues are great, creating a unique storyline. This movie entertains not only kids but adults too. Last but not least, the 3D animation is fantastic and skillful.",

The heart of this film is the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, Hiro's brother's nurse robot. The film really delivers on that relationship and does well with the subject of loss. The supporting characters are unique and interesting. The animation is the quality that you would expect from Disney. The voice acting is also well done with Ryan Potter as Hiro and Scott Adsit as Baymax being the standouts. A highly recommended movie, go check it out!",

            "content": "When I was in 10th class and this movie was announced, I had no intention of seeing it, because I haven't seen the last 5 movies. That's how much I lived under a rock. By the time I learnt it doesn't have any prequels the movie was long gone from the theatres. So I finally watched the movie when it came on TV and damn this was a movie I'd have loved to see! Later on I got to know this is based on the Marvel comics, so technically this is the first Marvel movie I have ever watched (because I live under a rock, remember?).\n\nThe reason why I liked Big Hero 6 so much is because of Hiro Hamada. I have always been interested in robotics and have participated in a robot combat competition myself. Other than that I was preparing for JEE so I was as such very much into science. So right off the bat we begin from a relatable protagonist. Tadashi was also a very nicely made character. When both Hiro and Tadashi go to his college my focus was on how nicely they both talk. It actually feels like they are physically there, as Hiro looks around and Tadashi gives remarks as he gives Hiro a tour. When he shows Baymax to Hiro the part where Hiro thinks he just made a duct tape shows how natural their behaviour was. The other characters were also very interesting, although I don't remember their names anymore since I watched it so long ago.\n\nThe movie has all kinds of emotions that make it appealing to the audience. It will make one laugh, cry, angry, excited, scared and awestruck. The heroes, villains, story, plot twist, emotional conflicts and even the little details scattered throughout the movie have all been placed very well. Just watching the hero-villain fights didn't let me be seated. Baymax is so cute. The Stan Lee cameo in the end was also unique.\n\nOverall I'd say the message of this movie is the most important aspect about this movie. A hero, who has lost his brother who was his only family and has gone into depression, is brought back to high hopes with the souvenir that his brother left him. His brother's friends were there to help him, his step-mother was supportive of him and overall everyone around him was always wanting the best for him. This is what finally allowed him to be the superhero. His emotional conflicts, whether he should entirely act on his feelings or take a calm and collected approach, whether he should kill someone or never harm a person, whether he should use his powers alone or assemble a team, all of this was in his hands. He did everything he hoped will make his brother proud.\n\nI enjoyed this movie so much that later on I showed it to my sister and recommended to all the children I met. This is what a movie should be like. It has a good story, memorable people, character development, conflicts, emotions - everything needed to make a good story. These are the most grounded heroes I have seen in any animated movie. I really hope it gets a sequel. I can't have enough of it.",

In other words, it really wasn't original besides the robots aspect. The superhero concept was painfully child oriented, the twist villain was terrible, and the robots besides Baymax were ridiculous and completely unbelievable. The whole child genius thing wasn't great either. The writing was the biggest let down, and the film could have been more emotional considering the circumstances - it was no Up or WALL-E. Furthermore, the plot was predictable, especially the ending and what happened to the brother. However, Baymax was a fantastic character, the animation was brilliant, and there was some good humour in the first half. The second half was definitely worse and things seemed to get increasingly silly as the film went on. It's an acceptable film, but it's very far from the best animated picture.

It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.\n\nNow for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas  it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.\n\nAs for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together.

But overall, a great animation which injects American Disney with modern culture and Eastern flavour.",

Younger kids will enjoy it more than adults, but I can see adults at least enjoying the film. My one complaint. Characters. Yes, Baymax and Hiro were fine, but it isn't very believable that the college kids that have never really fought are all of a sudden great fighters and can take down the microbots that easily. Hiro and Baymax are believable. Baymax is the robot who can fight because of the chip. Hiro doesn't do much without Baymax, but he took off the mask by jumping off Baymax. That's believable. I guess Go-Go I could see doing good in the fight because she probably took her wheels or skate things out for rides and got good at riding them. Then there's germophobic, neatfreak Wasabi. There's no way on Earth he's gonna fight great. Then comic book lover Fred. Fred sits on his butt reading comics all day. He's not going to be a great fighter. I don't think Fred could have done 20 push  ups. But at the same time, it is the suit that does all the work so I'm torn on him. Outside of that, it was a great film and it was very enjoyable.",

But the execution dipped the films quality. It has many cliches to its already somewhat predictable story. The pacing is extremely weak and inconsistent.

They're each decidedly human, even the cute inflatable robot whose personality is dictated by a memory card. Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph. Unfortunately, the greater plot runs a bit generic, its well-worn twists and turns telegraphed a mile away, so those quirks and design touches are leaned on quite often. It's well-made, good natured, unique in a very crowded crossroad of genres, but too complacent and vanilla with its storytelling. Given a little more ambition, a sequel could do really well.",

Of course, the relationship between Hiro and Tadashi's robot, Baymax (Scott Adist) is even more important. Without it, Hiro may not get past what happens to his brother. Baymax is such an endearing character. Everything from the voice work to his actions to his design is charming. You can't help but love him. The rest of the voice cast is great. It includes strong work from TJ Miller (Fred), Jamie Chung (Go Go), Damon Wayans Jr. (Wasabi), and Genesis Rodriguez (Honey Lemon). The animation is top notch and the sound track is great. The twist when it comes to the antagonist is well done and really adds to the emotional impact of everything that happens. The action scenes were also much stronger than expected in a film like this.\n\nWeaknesses: It can take a little long to get into the meat of the story, as it's about half an hour or so before Hiro and Baymax begin to team up.\n\nOverall: I ended up liking this way more than I expected. It's a wonderful, charming movie that does almost everything right. There's a lesson to be learned, a character arc for our protagonist, lots of action, a cool twist, fun characters, and more. I want to go out and buy this immediately. Incredible.",

It was an interesting work that destroys the fixed stereotype that it is disney animation for children anyway. In recent Hollywood, except for the exception of \"Chappy\", roughly the robot is called \"cruel monster\"I think that I treat it as.\n   About this movie, I want to tell you something. Baymax is so cute! Looks are very soft and people who see him be healed definitely.\nAnd this movie is beautiful picture so everyone is attracted by it. I love it, so I have seen this movie for 3 times and I almost perfectly remember this story because this movie makes everyone wants to see again. \n   Before I saw the Big Hero 6, I thought this movie is just friendship story of a boy and robot because I was fooled by a preview of this story. But I think I was fooled in a good way because the robot fights the enemy with weapon. Additionally, it flies! It's also hero story! And the characters in this movie are unique. Baymax is fat, and his stride is very short and cute. And kindness as a care robot. For example, when Hiro feels sad or bad, Baymax cheer him up. Sometimes Baymax hugs him to make happy. Everything lovely! The main character of this movie,Hiro. He is only 14 but he has a great brain but sometimes he got angry as a child. And then, he organizes \"Big Hero\". This team is consists of 6 people. Each characters are very unique and strong. \n   First of all Honey Lemon. She is a Chemistry genius. Medicines her make, is help them. Second, Gogo Tomago is a very tough and strong girl. She always chews gum, and she can do anything by herself. Third, Fred is always joking around and manga geek. He raises the mood of the team every day. Last, Wasabi is a big powerful boy. But also he is smart and his fighting skill is the best in the team. \n   After all, science is only a means. The robot is the same. It is only means.\nThe thought of the maker and the person who uses it makes it good or bad.Come and have children watch this movie.Please look at the endrol until the end.\nThere is a good thing.",

            "content": "This movie directed by Chris Williams and Don Hall and is Marvel comic. The movie includes elements of emotion not only comedy and action. The setting is a fictional city \"San Fransokyo\" mixed Tokyo in Japan and San Francisco in the U.S.A. There is a boy name is Hiro Hamada, and he is a robotic prodigy. He has an old brother go to the technical college name is Tadashi and Hiro admire him. However, unfortunately, Tadashi was dead suddenly because fire accident happened at the College and he tried to help the famous robotic professor of his college and also he admired. Hero was very disappointed that he quit robotic work. One day Hiro finds a strange junk, so he opened it and there was a big robot. It was made by Tagashi, and the big robot is Bay-max. Bay-max is a nurse robot that protect people have hurting heart and body, and it tried to heal him little by little.\n     I think one of interesting points of the movie is setting because there were a lot of Japanese elements like three?dimensional sign board. In Japan there are many kinds of three-dimensional sign board, for example, sign board shaped French fries of McDonald's and sign board shaped crab of a famous crab specialty restaurant in Japan. Also, sometimes these are moving or flashing. These are something particular to Japan, and we can see only in Japan. Of course, San Francisokyo was based with symbolic design of San Francisco. \n     In addition, I think Bey-max is also point we should pay attention to. He is very cute, after all. It says that the shape of a Japanese bell was used his face as a motif, also the directors thought of the cute robot because they were inspired by cuteness of Japanese electronic rice cooker. Therefore, we can enjoy that how is Japanese culture. \n     As I wrote, there are much detail in the setting and characters of this movie, so adults can enjoy the movie by these points not only children and I rather want adults to watch the movie. Some people have wrong thought that Disney movie is only for children, but they may guess it is not by the movie. I think it may be good that parents watch the movie with their children, and have a good time to find interesting points together because it will be learning that touch different cultures for children.                        Every time we watch this movie, we can find interesting points we didn't notice before, so we never get tired of the movie. That is the strongest point and is the best compliment for movies I think. I promise that many people can enjoy and feel something by this movie. Did I make you feel like watching Big Hero 6? If so, you must watch it!",

When we see who sees the responsibilities of today's technology, to make they are safe for all  we see we value the invention rather then the profit in what we make. When we see we can make technology see things we don't see to not have it when it counts. When what we don't see we wish technology was there to see to steer us a direction we ought to be seeing.

When we see technology has its strengths and weaknesses to only improve on both. When what we once though impossible, we see possible when we connect the right technology to it calculation to change the world what we now can see is possible.

The film Big Hero 6 shows the life of a few kids who become superheros with the power of their brains.  As Hiro Hamada starts the life of Bot-Fighting, he realizes his potential as he visits his brother's \"nerd school\" and meets his smart friends.  They all are developing new inventions with new technology that we would like in our world today.  \n\tWhen tragedy strikes Hiro's life he discovers a mystery concerning his new invention of the microbots.  Teaming up with his nerd friends, they create their own superpowers using their new technology.  And don't forget Baymax, the big and puffy, personal healthcare assistant.  As friends, they figure out who stole Hiro's idea and the story behind it.  This mystery in a sci-fi world shows the power of friendship and teamwork.  The fun plotline and development of characters attracts to children, families, and maybe some scientists.  Big Hero 6 is a must-see movie for everyone.  \n\tThis movie is very well animated and has amazing graphics, making it feel like you are soaring over San Fransokyo on top of Baymax.  As for the character development, Hiro learns to cope with a loss and learns that the help of friends can make things way easier.  The technology ideas make you super excited for the future and the inventions it brings.  This movie is also filled with action, causing you to sit on the edge of your seat in certain scenes.  People who wouldn't like this movie would be the old people who startle easily with action.  The action and intensity of Big Hero 6 makes it fun for children and people of all ages to be engaged and excited, but not enough to be too scary.  \n\tThe directors Don Hall and Chris Williams did a fabulous job with this movie.  It is Disney after all, so it has the potential of being very good and turned out phenomenal.  The movie Big Hero 6 was very cute, had some mild action and fun for all ages.  It just might surprise you how well done it was.  With the cool characters that are extremely smart you can find some way to connect to the plot.  If I were you, I would turn on Big Hero 6 right now, because you will not find many better movies, especially to please your whole family.",

This is all very fast moving, even for a kid's film and whilst it is admirably decently animated, Big Hero 6 doesn't create too much depth as to what it is trying to achieve. A generator of sympathy, meaning the bad guy is essentially non threatening at all. It's also a shame that genuinely quirky and interesting characters like Wasabi and Freddie didn't get a whole opportunity to explore their potential as much as they should've, giving warm and relieving addition to their futuristic suits. This being said, Big Hero 6 is solid to entertain, the chemistry between Baymax and Hiro is humble and charming and will please as a family movie. Just don't expect anything too meaningful, it often gets too caught up in sad moments that it forgets the environment it is set in isn't that harmful at all.\n\nB\n\n64/100",

I guess it shouldn't be surprising because Disney have done that often in movies before, like Lion King and Bambi, but for some reason it did take me aback. It was effective though because it really makes you understand what Baymax needs to become for Hiro and I did get emotionally invested through it. It's actually got big hints of Terminator 2 about it in that the kid's guardian, protector and best friend turns out to be a machine who in turn, almost becomes human. \n\nIn the second half of the movie it turns into more of a generic superhero thing. I'm still not quite sure how Baymax managed to get that chip into his hand at the end without either shutting down, or turning into destroyer Baymax. But for me it's a good thing he did or this movie would have got 1 star for bumming me out. Baymax is actually the star of the show as the poster suggests. He's funny and loveable, especially when he's running around in the warehouse. \n\nIt's a good movie. I won't be in a big rush to watch it again but I'm glad  I watched it once.",

His beef isn't with them; Considering his motivations, it seems like trying to destroy the kids is horribly counterintuitive. Eh, I guess you gotta have conflict somehow, but, overall, I still liked the movie.",

The scene where the brother of Hiro had died in a fire had made me feel emotional in the inside. The idea of calling the city San Fransokyo was just genius to me.\n\nAnyways, I adore most of the characters and they are well-developed in my taste. Baymax was especially my favorite because I found him to be very humorous and a fun character. I would like to have my own Baymax who could do all of that stuff. \n\nThe action was just amazing and I LOVE action stuff. At least it's not a musical Disney movie where you have to deal with the annoying musical numbers and what not. Big Hero 6 is just perfect. \n\nIt deserves a 5 out of 5 and it was worth watching it again. I do hope they would make a sequel, because I would love to that one.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first Marvel film from Disney that didn't just build into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I think the cast of characters made for a really great animated flick and I also think maybe Pixar is on the outs and Disney Animation is making for a HUGE comeback!\n\nHere's pretty much how the plot breaks down: Hiro Hamada is a smart boy with an older, also smart, brother named Tadashi - both with the penchant for building robots. Tadashi is the one who designed BayMax, a robot meant for at-home healthcare and medical assistance. Hiro takes up the challenge of preparing a new technology for Tadashi's robotics school in the hopes of being accepted (he invents nanobots that are controlled through mental electrical impulses), and during an \"accidental\" fire, Tadashi is killed. Turns out, someone broke in and stole the nanobots, so Hiro works together with BayMax and Tadashi's school friends to stop the \"man in the kabuki mask.\" None of this should be spoilers - all details from the trailer.\n\nBig Hero 6 dealt with a lot of really intense themes pertaining to relationships and that's what makes up the majority of people's lives growing up and you see it A LOT in this movie; heck, it's the driving force for the main character, Hiro Hamada. Hiro goes through a lot of change over the course of the film - you see him start out just fighting robots in alleys and stuff and it takes the loss of his older brother (not a spoiler, it was the in the trailer!) and pretty much changing his whole life around for him to cope with it and feel proud of his intelligence and actually do something with his gifts instead of clean out shady gambling rings.\n\nI think this movie has a lot going for it, culturally. We've got a very diverse character set (departing from the comic inspiration) in a diverse, but relate-able setting in San Fransokyo (San Fran + Tokyo; not just Tokyo as in the comic) and themes and plot points that you wouldn't expect from a kids movie (but seem to find their way into more and more these days). I'm actually really proud of animated films that are starting to realize that kids are a little more clued into the world around them; it's the kind of film that gives the audience accountability and doesn't patronize or condescend and that's a really respectable way to make films in general, let alone films for the most impressionable sect of the population: the childrens.\n\nAnd now, of course, let's talk about BayMax - easily the centerpiece of the film, and a total home run at that. He seems so tactile and real, it's crazy! There's just an incredible way in how he's animated and brought to life, despite being this blank white balloon of a robot (probably the hardest thing to make for people to relate to ever). His and Hiro's relationship is essentially the foundation of the plot to the film, almost in a Terminator 2: Judgment Day kind of way with the street-smart kid teaching the robot how to act less like a robot and more like a friend. BayMax is a great character that we will probably see more of in the future.\n\nThere was a lot of intent and focus in the direction on feeling, whether it be the literal sense of touch or emotional depth and I think that directly correlated with the story very well as Hiro was sort of forced to gain control of his reaction to his brother's death and come to terms with his responsibility to do his best to continue Tadashi's work and be the best self he can be. I think they would have felt inappropriate in the MCU though, even if this was a live-action take on the comic so I'm glad Disney and Marvel are making sensible choices with their source material in adapting it to the big screen rather than just trying to cram it all together in an obvious cash-grab. Looking at you, Sony. What with your three-villain Spider-Man films and your rumored Aunt May solo film.",

'big hero 6' is an uninspired insipidity that courts every contrivance in the book: grieving orphan, counterfeit deaths, predictable twist on the villain. it's a tragic departure from any new-minded witticisms we should expect in the horde of comic-book films. a creepy talking lump and the ambivalent, unsightly landscape is again in evidence of this.",
