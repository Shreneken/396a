Its quite a thought provoking film. I thought the topic was handled quite well, infact it felt a bit like a documentary film at times, more than perhaps a 'full blown drama' film. I liked the music played at the end - it gave it a haunting feel. I would recommend this film, although if you prefer quite high action/'busy' type films, then this one may be a bit slow and not to your liking.",

It was very fascinating to be able to look into these issues from such a genuine point of view. From the inside out, and not from above through hard facts and statistics.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this movie was very restrained.

Mother Midori (Machiko Ono) would be just fine with her son Kieta attending a public school, but father Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) won't settle for anything less than the best school for his son. Parents and teachers alike watch the children play together, wonderfully oblivious to the numbers pinned to their chests as their personalities are scored in the distance.\n\nAs much as he professes to love his only son, Ryota is keeping score, too, making sure his child measures up to his standards. Daily piano lessons are a must, and young Keita takes baths alone to build up his independence. Ryota's grooming his son to take on the strict habits of his own life that he believes have brought him success as an engineer, and a prestigious elementary school is the logical and proper next step. A call from the hospital where Keita was born derails Ryota's plans for perfection, and new blood tests reveal that Keita is not his real son.\n\nWill Ryota and his wife exchange Keita for an unknown child that shares their blood? The questions looms heavy over the film, but writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda (Nobody Knows) balances this horrific situation with a sustained, light touch and a perfectly balanced performances. The simple piano score and modest camera work take away any imposed dramatics and let us observe the six human beings whose futures must be decided. There's no rule book for this kind of thing, and each character has a different idea of what's right.\n\nFull review at Drama-MAX",

            "content": "cinegeek.de \"Und ich werde sein Vater sein\" - so lautet der japanische Originaltitel, übersetzt man getreu mit google. Den internationalen Titel verstehe ich nicht. Hirokazu Kore-eda, dessen Filme sehr, sehr gefühlsbetont sind, aber auch phantastische Fabeln bieten, entwirft hier ein Szenarario, dass unsere Herzen brechen wird! Sechs Jahre, nachdem eine Familie ihr Kind gross gezogen hat, erfahren sie: Das Kind ist nicht von ihnen- zumindest nicht biologisch! - Die Eltern Nonomiya versuchen den sechsjährigen Keita an einer Privatschule vorzustellen. Sie hoffen, ihrem Jungen dadurch einen besseren Einstieg ins Leben zu ermöglichen. Der Vater beschreibt Keita als ruhiges Kind, den Misserfolge wenig störten. Keita käme eher nach der Mutter. Zu Hause feiern sie seine Aufnahme an der Schule mit einer Torte. Kurz darauf aber erhalten Ryota und Midori Nonomiya einen Anruf vom Krankenhaus: Keita wurde nach der Geburt vertauscht. Ihr eigener Sohn wuchs versehentlich in einer anderen Familie auf und heisst heute Ryusei. Keita ist das Kind der Saikis. Die Saikis kommen aus einem anderen Milieu. Ryota Nonomiya ist erfolgreicher Architekt, Yukari Saiki Elektrohändler. Beide könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein! Sie vergleichen ihre Familien-Fotos: Keita, streng herausgeputzt, Ryusei ganz vergnügt. Beide Familien stehen vor einem Dilemma, beiden wird Leid zugefügt werden... Like Father, Like Son ist so subtil und schnörkellos erzählt - vielleicht ist das der Grund, weshalb Kore-eda in der zweiten Filmhälfte einen dunklen Schatten auf seine Figuren wirft. Es wird nicht explizit gezeigt, wohl aber offenbaren die Beteiligten hier auch ihre negativen Seiten. Ich denke, dass das notwendig ist. Kaum vorstellbar, welch harter Schlag diese Situation für Eltern bedeuten würde. Hart, aber auch lohnenswert, denn was bedeutet letztlich Elternliebe? Dazu haben wir die schönsten Arthaus Filme aus Japan ausgesucht für die Seite unserer Videothek cinegeek.de",

            "content": "The Cannes-Jury-Prize-winning drama Like Father, Like Son, from the marvelously talented Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda, tells a really straightforward tale of a pair of families in crisis. It's a regular Greek tragedy, in fact, but Kore-eda very interestingly circumvents emotion that'd be unapologetically oozing out of an American version of the same story. Two couples had the sons switched at birth, and for six years they've been gleefully unaware that they have been raising children who biologically belong to someone else. But only once, and barely, does any character in the film cry.\n\nMaybe Kore-eda is commenting on his country's stoic nature. More likely, he's interested in exploring the dynamics that develop when a insulated family unit gets disrupted. In any case, his seemingly indifferent approach allows the viewer to assign emotion where and as much as he or she sees fit. It makes the film easy to admire from this perspective because it ought not feel contrived. The problem: it forces the viewer to focus almost exclusively on the machinations of plot, which resolve themselves in an utterly predictable way. In other words, the destination is a little dissatisfying, but the journey will warm your heart.\n\nThe two families in question are the Nonomiyas and the Saikis. The former, Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) and Midori (Machiko Ono), are wealthy and have raised the well-behaved, quiet Keita, who gravitates strongly toward his adoring mother. Ryota doesn't have much of a connection to him, which makes this conundrum a little more cut-and-dry than it is for his wife or the other couple.\n\nMeanwhile, Yudai (Rirî Furankî) and Yukari Sakai (Yôko Maki) struggle to make ends meet. They have three kids; their eldest, Ryusei, is the one at the heart of the difficult situation they face. That said, their concern seems to be more for how much money they'll get out of the hospital after they settle their lawsuit. But don't mistake them for negligent parents (the way Ryota does). They care deeply for all three, and what Yudai can't provide his family in money and things, he makes up for in quality time. His interest in the lawsuit isn't self-serving. He's just a practical man without much time for etiquette or social one-upmanship.\n\nRyota, though, is unquestionably the film's focus, as he struggles with both being a father and a son. His father, who we meet in one of the film's most telling and surprising scenes, never flew kites with him. Life was business, and that philosophy served Ryota well academically, professionally, and financially. But he doesn't know how to raise a kid, how to let go and have fun with your son, how to teach him life lessons, or how to express love. And what's worse is that because he sees himself and his family above these people that he's suddenly forced to have a relationship with, he can't learn anything from them as parents. It isn't until he takes an irreversible action that he lets go of that prejudice and realizes he's a very imperfect parent.\n\nSeeing as it's a Kore-eda film, it should come as no surprise that Like Father, Like Son is full of expert performances, including those given by the two children. And Kore-eda's direction, though restrained and mostly personality-free, exudes confidence in his actors and his screenplay. It's a well-shot, well-cut movie that recognizes the best way to tell this story is to simply let it unfold unfettered.\n\nThat's precisely what what Kore-eda does, and while I occasionally found myself wishing for something unexpected, I can't fault anyone involved in front of the camera or behind the scenes because they deliver on exactly what's promised. Like Father, Like Son is a lovely movie that says no to anything capable of disrupting its fragile dramatic bubble. And while part of you might long for a surprise or two, a bigger part admires that the bubble never pops.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/like-father-like-son-review/",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of director Kore-eda (Maborosi, After Life, Nobody Knows) and his often poignant slices of Japanese life.  Crucially, he often begins his screenplays with a premise or set-up that he then follows through more or less logically and realistically to its appropriate conclusion.  His previous film, I Wish, focused on two young brothers who are separated by their parents' divorce and how they arrange to transcend the space between them.  Here, more dramatically, two couples discover - six years later - that their sons were switched at birth and the film focuses on how they resolve this problem (i.e., do they choose to exchange their children or keep the boys they've raised, although not blood-related).  But Kore-eda uses this premise to focus in on one of the fathers, Ryota, a career-minded and emotionally constricted absent dad who has failed to forge a close relationship with his son. The unexpected event therefore allows him a chance to start again - or does it?  It also highlights the age-old question of nature vs. nurture as we are invited to decide whether the boys' contrasting personalities reflect the personalities of their real dads or their adopted dads (who are also contrasted by being nouveau riche or on the poorer side). A lot of food for thought and some beautiful moments but also colder and more reserved than we often see from this director, likely due to the problematic central figure.",

            "content": "A baby swapping takes place at a hospital, but the error is not known until several years have went by. We follow a family dealing with the issue as it's revealed.\n\nThe plot feel as new and original as it feels like a parent's nightmare to me. Just as important - it's not the ideal situation for a child either. The plot is delicate and very plauseable, and it reminds me a lot of the directors \"Aruitemo aruitemo\" in several ways. The silence and the slow pace. The story line develops supersmooth and it's always very realistic.\nIt looks nice and we have many contrast on screen. The rich and the poor among others, but first and foremost the act of letting go and the act of obaining. Solid performances and slow dramaturgy at it's best. Sadly it's lacking the entertainment part and it's not the most sentimental piece I have seen. Mildly provoking film, stil beautiful and warm.\n\n7 out of 10 light bulbs.",
