    "summary": "Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), a 16-year-old cancer patient, meets and falls in love with Gus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a similarly afflicted teen from her cancer support group. Hazel feels that Gus really understands her. They both share the same acerbic wit and a love of books, especially Grace's touchstone, \"An Imperial Affliction\" by Peter Van Houten. When Gus scores an invitation to meet the reclusive author, he and Hazel embark on the adventure of their brief lives.",

            "content": "The Fault in Our Stars is about a young teenage girl named Hazel who has been diagnosed with lung cancer as well attends a cancer support group but doesn't like to go, her mom makes her go. While in /that support group she fell in love with a boy named Gus, his cancer made him lose his leg, but he beat cancer... although he thought. \n\nHazel was portrayed in the book as a girl who always wears a breathing tube, short Ish hair and depressed. In the movie she was pretty much how I pictured her besides her hair was a lot shorter, and she had some real sass to her. \n\nI recommend the movie over the book just because I'm not the biggest fan of reading, because you get more deals watching them, in my opinion. I also like the movie better because you can hear how they sound, and you can feel when they're upset or just the tension. \n\nOne thing that was different in the movie from the book was that Augustus Waters' parents did not let him take Hazel Grace Lancaster downstairs unsupervised to watch \"V for Vendetta\u00a8. Also, Hazel never lets a little girl try her oxygen at the mall. Hazel's need to be connected to her oxygen tank always is made apparent in the film. However, the scene in which she is explaining her tank and what it does to a precocious kid named Jackie is cut out for time. But with those parts being left out I didn't really notice, and it didn't have me change my thoughts on the movie, I still really it and id watch it again. \n\nFor this reason, I recommend this movie: This story is relatable, and I think it gives hope to kids to find love and never give up. Like how Augustus put the cigars between his lips but never lit it to give it power, so he had the power and control. This story also gives us a look at what cancer can do to people, and how it affects their lives and family's.",

            "content": "The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, I have read the book and watched the movie The Fault in Our Stars directed by Josh Boone. The story is about a girl with lung cancer who meets a boy who changed her life for the better, it is a beautiful romance full of humor, tragedy, symbols, and metaphors. I recommend the book over the movie because it is more poetic and detailed. \n\nIn the book I imagined hazel to have short shoulder length hair and because of cancer appear to look a little chubby (on page 9 she described herself to have chipmunk cheeks, I read the first chapter fast, so I pictured a different description than she was explaining on the very same page.) I think reading the book gives it a better experience because the reader gets a chance to be more imaginative and create the world in their mind. \n\nIn the movie before getting on the plane Gus shows up to Hazel's house in a limo saying, \"where we \u2018re going, we \u2018re going in style.\" in the book Hazel and her parents drive to Gus's house and overhear Gus and his parents fighting this shows me that the director found the fighting unnecessary to the overall story which I disagree with because the fighting plays an important part in leading up to the scene where Gus tells Hazel he has cancer which is what he and his parents were fighting about for this reason I recommend the book. \n\nIn the book, there is a part after they go to Amsterdam when Gus is starting to get sick (because cancer) and his siblings and their kids come to visit and both Hazel and Gus are telling jokes about how attractive Gus is and I think it is a shame that it was not in the movie because I think it is one of the only times where Gus is happy and joking around with Hazel even though cancer was making life harder for him, That short happy moment changed the feel of the story for his last few days instead of seeming like he had completely given up on life because of this I recommend the book. \n\nThank you for reading my review, please enjoy and read The Fault in Our Stars by John Green.",

            "content": "Imagine being a prisoner of cancer, but then by the grace of fate, you find yourself falling for some amazing guy you meet who survived thyroid cancer and seems like he quotes romantic Shakespeare literature in every right moment. Well if you can't imagine it, don't. The Fault in Our Stars \u2014 based on a best-selling novel written by John Green directed by Josh Boone can swoop your teenage dreams off into a blimp in space leaving you feeling gutted. While the film did an astounding job capturing the hearts of hopeless romantics \u2014 viewed by a majority of the young adult audience, it failed to capture mine. Now before I crush any desire you might have to see this film, let's dive into the very aspects that truly encompass the film. Meet Hazel Grace (Played by Shailene Woodley), a 16-year-old girl who is a patient with cancer and views herself as a grenade that will eventually explode. Therefore, she copes with her terminal illness whilst projecting her dark-cutting humor onto the world. Hazel attends a cancer support group which she dreads, but Isaac thankfully shares the same discomfort. Little does she know she will meet her star-crossed lover, Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort).  \nFor starters, the characters in the film were very hard to relate to. However, not because of the blatant fact of the film revolving around the reality of their short-spanned lives due to cancer, but a lot of the character's dialect felt forced and over-rehearsed. It was a true disadvantage in trying to connect with them. Like so, in the scene where Augustus confessed his undying love for hazel over their dinner at a restaurant called Orangee. He Quoted directly: \n\"I am in love with you. And I know love is just a shout into void and oblivion is inevitable and we're all doomed and that one day all of our labors will be returned to dust and I know that the sun will swallow the only earth that we have, and I am in love with you.\" \nThis direct quoted line from Green's novel was so unattractively forward and corny I practically cringed in my seat. The whole thing sounded staged and almost too good to be true. It drew me back to those nostalgic Disney films where princesses fall in love immediately after meeting some prince 5 minutes ago. Fortunately, I must give credit where it is due, the videography was seemingly easy on the eyes and well-executed. The gentle yet intimate closeups of the characters almost allow us to empathize with the very same emotions the characters endure. The screenplay did feel familiar to The Spectacular Now \u2014 a melodramatic romance flick about an unexpected romance that blooms between the undecisive and non-goal-oriented Sutter and shy Aimee. Hence, The Fault in Our Stars and The Spectacular Now are both written by screen players, Scott Neust\u00e4dter and Michael H. Weber. That isn't the only thing in common, Shailene Woodley also plays as Aimee. She takes on these female clich\u00e9 roles so well \u2014the audience can easily indulge in the film due to her outstanding performance. Although she hasn't received as much recognition as a female actress for the films she has starred in, she has had great amounts of success.  \nOverall, I appreciated the role she Played as Hazel Grace. Her performance outshined all the characters in the film.  \nNow, I know you've been dying to hear whether I bawled my eyes out. I confess, the stone-cold critic has cried! In the scene where Hazel reenacts Augustus's eulogy at his \u2018Pre-funeral,' I couldn't hold the droplets from pouring out of my tear ducts. I could practically feel the emotion of having to lose someone you love, and make no mistake, Shailene owned that scene. (The soundtracks didn't help either). Every soundtrack suited the scene, setting, and emotion \u2014 not one song took away from this meticulous 2-hour film.  \nWith that being said go see the film. It'll have you pouring your eyes out while also fawning over this dreamy unrealistic boy that surely swept the cute and smitten Hazel off her feet. While it didn't do the book much justice with its direct quotes and misplaced sceneries and lack of character development for Issac, Hazel, and August's parents it wasn't a TERRIBLE movie, just not as great.",
