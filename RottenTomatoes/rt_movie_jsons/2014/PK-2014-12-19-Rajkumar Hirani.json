            "content": "I really liked this movie as long as it wanted me to like it. In the beginning we are introduced to an unnamed alien who has come to earth to see what life on the planet is like. But then his remote gets stolen and he has to learnt to adapt to the lifestyle of humans.\nHe is very confused about the way humans live. He can't understand the purpose behind clothes, money, language, gestures and finally, religion. And that's where I have a problem with this movie. Don't get me wrong. I'm not gonna talk those \"why is only one religion being talked about\" arguments. Rather my problem is why is religion being given so much emphasis? If I were to make this movie, I'd focus more on the people's lifestyle, which is exactly what the movie was going with and occasionally tries coming back to (like the condom scene).\nThe songs, the acting, the colour palette, everything about the visual and audio was fantastic. The scene in which Jaggu wants to come out of jail made me pause the video so that I could laugh properly. The problems come up in the second half, where the sense of humour suddenly finishes and it starts turning more dramatic. The serious scenes don't hit the same way as the comedy scenes do. After all, we are watching a movie about an alien adjusting to earth's lifestyle. It should have a lot more humour than a grim, gritty feeling.\nIt was fun to watch, but I don't see myself watching this ever again. I know it won't be as funny on seeing the second time. And that's why I'd only recommend it to you if you aren't the \"religion good\" type and can actually see a movie with an open mind, because nowadays a lot of negativity is being spread about this movie.",

Khan's superb performance escorts this film, and the stories and interludes between the characters are very interesting. Leaving aside the logic, absurdity is the other side of religious culture. Tearing apart the veil of religious and political rule by gods and ghosts, personal belief is the real God.",

Some comedy sequence 'Condom drop', 'Stone God Money Machine', 'Dancing Car' will never be forgotten from my brain.\n\nThe director beautiful gives us a underling theme & social commentary about religious misconducts while also providing a masterful entertainment piece to laugh, perfectly balanced as everything should be( pun intended)\n\nOne the greatest movie from Bollywood with classic sub-plots of romance,comedy and entertainment.",

Some sensibilities were challenged, sure, namely my general distaste for song and dance sequences in films where they're nowhere near necessary. But it's Bollywood. What else should I have expected? I will say that what really ended up surprising me the most was what the film had to say about human mechanisms like faith, understanding and tolerance. Don't let the film's cooky exterior fool you — it muses on these themes in a surprisingly meaningful and apt fashion, even conjuring up a few genuine moments of pause for the audience throughout. Again, a lot of this really felt like a cultural adjustment for me at times, but I do understand and sympathize with the appeal overall.",

However, the final blowmind it's kind of weird and gimmicky.\nBut, without a doubt, the worst of the movie is the souds made in some situations, wich becomes they ridiculous. One can think that is charming, but really is a little cringe.\nIt's important to say that the dance and the songs are great and completly worthy to watch.",
