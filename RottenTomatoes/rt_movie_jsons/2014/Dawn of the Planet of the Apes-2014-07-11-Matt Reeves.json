Meanwhile, a small band of human survivors emerges, which forces Caesar -- as leader -- to grapple with the dual challenge of protecting his people and re-establishing a relationship with the remaining human population -- the latter being Caesar's secret wish.",

The story drive for Caesar is so powerful and riveting. He holds his family and apes dear whilst dealing with internal conflicts. Conflicts that stem from a territorial and power struggle between the apes and the humans. We see a mirrored conflict on both sides. Koba's character developments as the antagonist and his motivation is believable and really engages the viewer. Caesar must prove himself more than ever now, as he must either keep the peace or fight to protect his apes. Both from the humans and other unexpected conflicts. Incredibly emotional and nuanced drive for the apes as a whole.",

            "content": "As someone who really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, expectations were high for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. And apart from a rushed ending and the underdeveloped human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't disappoint and is just as good. It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlight, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe they were done by computer is testament to how good they look. The soundtrack is haunting and rousing with no dirge-like tempos and it doesn't feel overbearing either, even with sound with as much authenticity as here. The script also impresses, it's very intelligently done and has a lot of tension and heart. What impressed even more was how simple and nuanced some of it was, like when the apes speak they only need to say a few words and it still feels like it's saying a lot, a couple of times even a sideways glance brings more impact than you'd think. The story takes a bigger and somewhat bolder approach than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and this is an instance of it working very well, especially with the visceral action sequences which are very tense and look terrific and in the incredibly intense and emotional final act. It's compelling stuff where you feel compassion for and identify with every step of the way with Caesar and his family. Matt Reeves' direction doesn't make the mistake of being overblown or lethargic, there is at least a sense that he knows what he's doing. The acting is solid, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are charming leads and Gary Oldman while criminally underused still gives a spirited performances. But other than the special effects the other highlight is the characterisation of the apes, which is just superb especially for Caesar(who is by far and way the most relatable and most compelling character in the entire film), Andy Serkis never fails to amaze me. All in all a really well done blockbuster, although the human characters do not register anywhere near as well as the special effects and the apes characterisations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" is an excellent movie, but by taking up this franchise, Matt Reeves took it to another level. Caesar ended the last movie as an anti-hero, but now he's a leader who thinks rationally. Ten years have been passed and the apes built their community. Compared to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Caesar is Leonardo. He's still a character in constant evolution, and his relationship with the humans is what drives the plot. Also, another ape that has a deeper development is Koba (he was used as a guinea pig in plenty of labs and hates humans), and if Caesar is Leonardo, he is Raphael. The apes are even more protagonists than in the first film, but again, the human cast is not generic, has personality and helps to move the plot. We have two main human characters: Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the leader of the human resistance, and Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the leader of the human team that has to work on the apes' area. I won't say anything else because I would enter in spoilers territory. The action sequences are even better than the ones from the first film. They're better filmed, tenser and even more touching (helped by the superb Michael Giacchino's soundtrack); the epilogue prepares the public for an epic final battle, it makes the audience look forward to the next film and promises that it'll be big. Imagine if it wasn't, it would be a big disappointment.",

            "content": "They had us in the first half, not going to lie. Though I was really happy with the direction this film immediately went for in creating a soft sort of post-apocalyptic world for humans and apes to get along in, I wasn't exactly sold on the approach that this film took. It was just under an hour of nobody trusting nobody, blunders being made and guns being waved and while it was certainly wrought with tension, it was the stressful, unpleasant sort of tension because both sides and all the stand out characters on both sides (except Carver, He was just an idiot) have such believable and pitiable motivations and social predicaments that the idea of conflict between them (something I knew was eventually going to come) seemed completely undesirable. With the plot moving so slowly at the beginning, it was slightly agonizing to experience. However, there was enough interesting character dynamics (Caesar and Malcom, Caesar's son's apprehensions, Koba's stirring hatred, Maurice with everyone but especially Malcom's son) and visually resplendent world building to keep the film going until Koba does the fateful deed. After that, the film blooms fully into it's singularly unique, compelling, tragic, chaotic and almost operatic identity. I think it was the only right decision the writers could have made to have the apes strike first. After the first film we have sort of been conditioned to see the humans as the enemies of the apes and what with the enormous arsenal and testy nerves of the human colony, it seemed that the oppression of the apes would soon come again. It was exactly the development the Caesar and the apes needed, a conflict, betrayal, a villain in their midst to drive home that the apes are not intrinsically better than the humans. The moment that Caesar realizes this, lying wounded in front of his son, brought low by the betrayal of his own kind and humbling himself by returning to the home he had moved on from is a powerful moment and what I think the entire film was leading up to. Caesar and Malcom both realizing the worth of the other's kind and acknowledging each other as friends. On a big picture scale, the apes trilogy is using it's second installment to level the playing field between apes and humans to set up the climax of the third act, but it does so in an explosive and poignant way. I think the flavor that this film has that most science fiction action films do not is a feeling of tragedy. Not tragedy in the sense of failure, but in the conflict and mistrust between and within the apes and humans that inevitably will lead to great strife. This film has action, drama and heart but each of these is given a vein of tragedy. Thankfully, it is the kind that is epic even in it's laments and drives some hard hitting questions home as the apes become smarter and stronger. Heck, not only do they talk a lot more, by the end they were speaking in metaphor while beating the snot out of each other. It may sound odd, but that kind of thing is what I think the apes movies are made for. Another significant advancement\u2026 have I mentioned that this movie is very good as a sequel? Paying homage, carrying themes over from the first installment while giving the narrative further believable direction and a wider focus? Well now I've mentioned it, and the greatest thing about it is the increased inclusion of the best character in the series: Maurice. Maurice already has the advantage of being an orangutan which is makes him cuddly and imposing at the same time, but he also gets the singular honor of being the good friend to the main characters and since not as much attention is given him, he is not tarnished by a lesson needing to be learned or a flaw to correct. He's just pure awesome. When he turns his piercing eyes toward Malcom's family and utters his one word in the film \"run\" I got chills. He's just a peaceful, understanding presence and he's the only one who gets along with both sides (something I wished could've happened for everyone) and when he had to, he grabbed that ape and showed him who's boss. I love that kind of character. I was genuinely concerned when he got shot but was relieved to see that he just shook it off like the bad-A he is. Such good stuff.",

The middle film in his trilogy sees the imperious Andy Serkis reprising his role as Caesar in a post-apocalyptic world, where most of the human race has been wiped out by Simian flu (yes, it's more topical than it was on its release date). Caesar clashes with fellow ape Koba over the way in which to approach the human race leading to a split amongst the colony, and resulting in civil dispute. Weta digital's visual work is nothing short of remarkable, and the communication between the apes is staggeringly realistic. Serkis is the star, as he his throughout the franchise (utter shame on Oscar for not recognising his work) and the way the physical performances of Serkis and co combine with the special effects to give you a world in which you truly believe everything is real, deserves the highest of praise.",

They didn't seem to gesticulate enough to convey the emotion the lines were meant to have and so the subtitles just didn't match up for me. I think they improved the CGI on the apes but did so at the cost of doing rather poorly on the herd of deer and the bear in the opening scenes. I loved the heel turn of Caesar's lieutenant, the overall plot and the film score, which was top notch. This entire series seems set to grow in critical acclaim as the years go by.",

            "content": "Pros: The set up that Rise made for Dawn pays off so well in this movie. I think that this is the most underrated movie sequel of all time. This movie is better than the first because the stories are very different.  The first one is the creation of the ape's civilization and the second one is about Caesar allowing humans into his civilization but it starts a war.  In this movie, Caesar has a new family and he has a wife called Cornellia, A son that is grown-up called Blue eyes and another son that was born at the start of the movie being Cornelious. This movie also has the most interesting villain in the trilogy being Koba. I also like how they made an ape the villain instead of humans. Koba is such a compelling villain to the point where Caesar's son Blue eyes was questioning him. He believed letting these humans into their society was wrong because he was tortured by humans to the point where he even lost an eye. He eventually shot Caesar thinking he was dead but the family of humans he let into his civilization saved him. The action in this movie such as Koba invading human territory to try to kill off the last of them was entertaining and the action was great. He even puts Apes like Maurice and Luca in a cage because they were too loyal to Caesar. I like how when Koba was invading Blue eyes wasn't fighting because he realized that Koba was wrong.  It was pretty sad when Rocket's son Ash died because he was struggling to kill humans and he was still loyal to Caesar. That moment where Caesar returned was epic when Blue eyes came to help save Caesar. The emotion when Caesar was watching a video of him and Will when he was young was quite emotional especially when he was in the same house. When the final fight between Caesar and Koba happened it was a pretty good fight and that moment where Caesar defeated Koba and walked in to reclaim leadership was awesome. I think that the conflict between humans was pretty great because the family that visited Caesar wants apes to live while Dreyfus wanted apes extinct because the apes are spreading a plague that has made humans almost go extinct. The humans in this film are more interesting at least the important ones are and I do like Dreyfus and Malcolm and to me, Malcolm's family and Dreyfus are the only important humans.\nI have nothing negative to say about this movie and this movie got even better when War Planet of the Apes came out.\n\nCons: I only have two problems with this movie. I think that other than Dreyfus and Malcolm, the rest of the humans aren't interesting. The other problem is that there is a plot convenience when Caesar gets shot and he happens to heal really quickly to fight Koba.\n\nThose two flaws are very minor snd kind of nitpicks. I'm gonna give Dawn Planet of the Apes an (A)",

The scene showing Dreyfus crying with the photos of his family contrasting with Ceasar desperately hoping for his wife to recover from disease and the apes and humans pitted against each other, with Koba leading the charge, another amazingly detailed character, someone who unfortunately was lead astray by only focusing on the bad side of the humans growing heavy lack of trust for everyone around him, once Caesar's best friend, now mortal enemies.

There are plenty of scenes where things have potential to escalate and the atmosphere is tremendous. Serkis is once again fantastic. We feel even more for Caesar this go around as he now has a family and gets turned on by a friend. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s heart breaking. The movie builds and build to some special moments that are worth it at the end. Judy Greer (Cornelia) was also one of the stronger acted apes. Jason Clarke (Malcolm) and Keri Russell (Ellie) both gave very good performances as the compassionate and understanding humans. The world feels realistic and I love the various takes on fatherhood, similar to the first one.\n\nWeaknesses: Gary Oldman (Dreyfus) felt super underutilized. He\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a great actor who could\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve been a strong addition to this franchise. Especially when we got shots of the character\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s kids being gone. But he doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t really do anything. Kirk Acevedo (Carver) was also way too generic. He played the typical jerk who ruins everything by being a dick and it never clicked. It felt like he was trying too hard. \n\nOverall: An improvement on the first film. They take what made that work and expand on it, while giving us a lot of suspense, plot twists, and emotions.",

This movie suffers the same problem as the previous movie. The male lead is not good enough to carry the movie. No offense to James Franco or Jason Clarke. Both of them are miscast. Oldman's character mopes around for two hours and doesn't really do much. What a waste of a great talent. None of the human characters are memorable. They're background noise. \n\nThe only interesting interaction is with the boy and Maurice, but it never goes any further than that. They missed an opportunity to have Maurice see the boy as a son. Maurice could have then told Caesar that he didn't think the humans were all bad. At the end, they could have had the boy die and it's affect on Maurice. \n\nMaurice is never developed beyond being Caesars friend. In fact, the spotlight is only given to a few apes. Even Caesar's wife is nothing more than Caesar's wife. It seems a lot of character development was cast aside for an action movie. If we got to know who these other apes were, we would actually care what happens to them. But like the humans, most of the apes are just background noise. \n\nKoba is shown mostly as a usurper, but he makes a good point. The humans are clearly testing their weapons and we see they have tanks and rocket launchers. Once they get power, they may want to attack the apes. They should have had Koba tell Caesar and have it play out exactly the same. But the way they did it looks like Koba wanted the throne. \n\nNot as good as \"Rise\". Makes a point to say that there are defects in all societies, but the message is overshadowed by all the action.",

It also probably  helps that the apes look very realistic. The human actors though are kind of generic who become for the most part unmemorable, but not necessarily bad.

The CGI effects help rather than hinder the performances of the \"apes.\" Andy Serkis (Caesar), Nick Thurston (Blue Eyes) and Toby Kebell (Koba) -- together with their animators -- pull off brilliant performances. The cast of human characters almost rival their ape counterparts, which includes the great Gary Oldman, but the sometimes phony performances of Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell hampers this somewhat.\n\nNonetheless, \"Dawn\" is an impressive follow-up to \"Rise\" and begins to establish a setting for the original \"Apes\" movie, starring Charlton Heston. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns and consistently suspenseful. \n\nSPOILER ALERT: One complaint I initially had was the manner of Koba's death and how Caesar seems to give in to an elitist attitude that deems to judge an ape (as anthropomorphized human) no longer worthy of being called an \"ape\" (as anthropomorphized human.) Essentially, Caesar here falls into the same trap as his human counterparts, as well as Koba, that condenses that sentient life worth saving to a particular type of sentient life. For Koba, this is exclusively apes that serve his every whim. For many of the humans, this is exclusively themselves. Disappointingly, for Caesar, only that life that meets his standard of morality (which is indeed a  comparatively generous one) is worth saving. However, I am informed that Koba's breathing is heard toward the of the credits and that Caesar's character has not been morally resolved after his attempted execution of Koba. I have yet to see the sequel: a resolution to this moral conundrum may yet emerge.",

            "content": "When watching \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\", I couldn't help but compare its opening moments to that of \"Dances with Wolves\". When the film starts out, the audience is subjected to watching a series of nearly dialogue-free moments from the apes. Instead of the expected din of gunshots and explosions, we watch the primates display their use of sign language while spending time in the culture the culture of the apes while learning about the environment/community that the apes have set up and how it compares to the society of the humans. The comparison to \"Dances with Wolves\" is a bit inevitable for me, but I compare the two films in the best possible way. Just like with \"Dances with Wolves\", the audience is able to learn about the characters and the environment that they are placed in right off of the bat. So little action really happens in the first few scenes, and yet so many ideas and emotions are conveyed that I would much rather prefer this steady build up as opposed to action right off the bat; it's a more realistic, earnest approach to a movie such as this, and it's one that I don't feel as though we see enough of.\n     After the mesmerizing opening, this movie kicks itself into high gear-in a large part due to the impressive acting. Just like with \"The Dark Knight\", the characters are so well written with so much thought put into them that I tend to forget that I'm watching intelligent apes blow everything up. This is a rarity that works as both a sci-fi thriller and as a a resonant drama. These characters are so believable-and dare I say relate able that I would enjoy these characters whether they were apes or not; they work that well. Let's face it: you can tell you've made a good movie if even the antagonist's motives are understandable.\n     Another part of this movie that had me pleasantly surprised was its collection of realistic CGI. I know that this isn't a popular opinion, but I found the CGI to be incredible-especially by 2014 standards. As time goes on, the film industry finds itself growing more and more in the department of eye catching visuals, and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" marks a large step forward for the special effects category. Not are most of the details beautifully realized, but the CGI itself is able to play itself into the story without becoming too much of a nuisance. The filmmakers seem to know this as well. Several times, the camera will pan across a battlefield depicting a skirmish or battle, and there were hardly any moments in these battles that I would depict as \"fake.\"\n     That's not to say that the CGI is the only thing carrying this film. (It isn't.) Andy Serkis returns as Caesar, and gives it his all as usual. Meanwhile, Jason Clark shines as Malcolm as both actors represent sides fighting for the title of dominant species. It's with performances like these in which I can't help but admire the amount of effort put into the acting; especially considering the fact that 75% of the actors were either reacting to nothing or playing the role of a primate. Even the words spoken by the actors sound something like how one would expect apes to talk if they could. But here's the thing: not all of the characters have equal emphasis placed on each of them. Gary Oldman is also in this movie, but what could have been a great character played by a great actor can't help but get lost in the midst of all of the other characters. And he's not the only one; with acting as great as this and characters as well thought out as this, it's a bit of a shame that they're kind of forgotten about towards the end. This doesn't ruin the film entirely, but it does come off as a bit of a disappointment. \n     On a lighter note however, this movie also displays an innovative build of tension. Some may not have enjoyed the \"slow first half,\" but the characters combined with the looming feeling of doom slowly-almost unbearably-build up to an entertaining and intense second half that is all I could've hoped for. Not only does this build up lead to an epic second half, but the second half itself also offers an (SPOILER) amazing shot of a tank shooting at the enemy in a 360 degree angle with the audience in the tank's perspective witnessing the effect of the weapon. (END OF SPOILER) \n     All in all, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is not only an epic sci-fi adventure, but also manages to be an effective drama in the process. I highly recommend that you watch this movie whenever you have time. (Preferably with your friends.)",

            "content": "You would think that the decline in quality of the original 5 \"Apes\" movies, each one lower-budget and worse quality than the one that preceded it, would give filmmakers pause, but since 2001 we have endured 3 awful s/prequel/remakes. \u00a0 And yet these films do well at the box office, and are generally well-reviewed.\n\nIf this were the \"Transformers\" series I would care that much, but the original \"Planet of the Apes\" is indeed brilliant.\u00a0Based on\u00a0Rod Serling's\u00a0adaptation of\u00a0\u00a0Pierre Boulle's novel\u00a0La Plan\u00e8te des singes\u00a0, it was released in 1968, and features zero CGI. \u00a0Instead it featured real\u00a0actors doing \"acting\" while wearing make-up and simian-looking prosthetics. \u00a0These devices were considered advanced at the time, but now appear rather primitive:\n\nStill how scary-looking is that? \u00a0Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans used their costumes to enhance their performances, to\u00a0give them an \"otherness\" that they employed, but also had to overcome in order to create full characters. This is the opposite of what Jack Nicholson said about his role as The Joker in 1989's \"Batman\", essentially to\u00a0\"let the costume do the work\".\n\nThe tension between artifice and reality is something\u00a0CGI erases. \u00a0While this makes for more realism, it also seems to infect movies with\u00a0a slackness when it comes to\u00a0developing stories and characters. \u00a0Critics praise CGI and forget that a realistic wink or tear does not a character make. This was the case\u00a0for the second\u00a0remake of King Kong, of which A.O. Scott said:\nThe sheer audacious novelty of the first \"King Kong\" is not something that can be replicated, but in throwing every available imaginative and technological resource into the effort, Mr. Jackson comes pretty close.\nNovelty and technology can't sustain a movie for 3 hours, characters and narrative can. \u00a0Inexplicably Roger Ebert\u00a0called Kong II\u00a0\"A stupendous cliffhanger, a glorious adventure, a shameless celebration of every single resource of the blockbuster, told in a film of visual beauty and surprising emotional impact.\" \u00a0 Roger Ebert is a wonderful human being, but I find his writing unmemorable. \u00a0A.O. Scott seems to specialize in plot summaries. \u00a0Plot summary + apologia that this is a \"spirited\" movie that isn't perfect = A.O. Scott review.\u00a0\n\nDespite my griping, I too wanted to see chimpanzees on horseback firing machine guns (I'm only human). \u00a0I found that it was just not as thrilling as what the original \"Apes\" movie did for me: imagine a world where humans are no longer the pre-eminent species, where it's payback time for the creatures we have abused for millenia. \u00a0 Jerry Goldsmith's eerie modernist score helped create this sense of unease - so different from the crash, boom, bang of near-constant violence in \"Dawn\", which has a strange calming effect on me because it seems to be in almost every movie now, and signifies that the good guy is going to win. \u00a0The other parts of the score could have been used in\u00a0a life insurance commercial.\n\nSpeaking of good guys, did Director Matt Reeves have to make ape-leader Caesar into an absolute saint? \u00a0Consider the strategy in the original \"Apes\" franchise. \u00a0Caesar is a killer, but you understand his rage as he sees his enslaved ape-brothers stun-gunned, and watches his kindly guardian, played by Ricardo Montalban, die in order to protect him. \u00a0 \u00a0I go to movies to see people who are worse than me, not better.\n\u00a0\nRecall the harrowing last scene in \"Planet of the Apes\" with Taylor and Nova\u00a0about to enter\u00a0into the Forbidden Zone after seeing the ruined Statue of Liberty:\n\nFinal verdict on\u00a0\"The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\":\"You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!\"\n\u00a0\nPostscript: \u00a0 \"Planet of the Apes\" features one of my favorite opening scenes in movies, Charlton Heston, the spaceship captain is smoking a cigar on the bridge, recording into his log before he goes into suspended animation:\n\"Tell me, though, does man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who sent me to the stars, still make war against his brother...keep his neighbor's children starving?\"\n\nPost-postscript: Really getting tired of seeing Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, trotting out his American accent in these trumped-up, square-spectacled Commissioner-Gordon-type roles.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Well Scott, here comes another performance capture movie starring Andy Serkis. It truly looks like he s playing another Sirkis animal!\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Sirkis is chimply marvelous in this role. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: It s been ten years since Caesar (Andy Serkis), the genetically modified chimp from Rise of the Planet of the Apes escaped into the forests of San Francisco. A lot has happened. There was an outbreak of simian flu that decimated humanity leaving only a handful of humans who were genetically immune to the disease. Meanwhile, Caesar has freed hundreds of apes from human captivity and taught them to communicate by sign language. They ve created an entire culture separate from the humans. Then, one day, a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo) in search of a hydroelectric dam happens upon a couple of apes and he shoots one of them.\n\nSCOTT: Caesar warns the humans never to venture into ape territory again. But the humans need to get the dam operational to regain electrical power. They send Malcolm (Jason Clarke), his wife Ellie (Keri Russell), and a few others, including Carver, to negotiate access to the dam. Caesar agrees, but only if the group gives up their guns. Carver hides a gun and threatens Caesar s infant son with it, causing an uproar that is only quelled by Ellie s willingness to provide medical treatment to Caesar s wife. Meanwhile, an ape named Koba (Toby Kebbell), who will not accept any peace with the humans, sabotages relations between the two groups by secretly setting fire to the ape settlement and attempting to assassinate Caesar.\n\nGREG: Scott, this was a much better film than 2011 s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. There were some real personalities here and some real conflict. We see two sets of characters at play - the humans and the apes. On the side of the humans we have Malcolm who wants peace with the apes. On the other side is Caesar who looks at the dam agreement as their one chance for peace with the humans. But both sides have their hawks as well. The humans have Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who is so mistrustful of the apes that he starts hoarding weapons. This, of course, inflames the ape Koba (Toby Kebbell) who has reason to distrust humans as he was the victim of experiments at the hands of human scientists. This creates a great conflict both between human and ape as well as between hawks and doves. Sadly, Keri Russell isn t given much to do here except  stand by her man.  And the female chimp (Caesar s wife) does little more than give birth and get sick. Apparently, the future is still male-dominated.\n\nSCOTT: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a complex film. Admittedly, it does have some of the telltale signs of a summer blockbuster - flying bullets, daredevil stunts, and plenty of explosions. But these superficial trappings of summer popcorn bely the true meaty core of this very measured and thoughtful movie. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes made me think, and it s been a long time since I ve had to really turn my brain on at the movies. First and foremost, this is a movie about the very real and very demanding challenges of resolving intergroup conflict. We learn that sometimes good leadership isn t enough. There must also be good followership in that a critical mass of people being led need to be on board with the vision of an effective leader. As you point out, Greg, we have peace-loving leadership on both sides but only a few bad apples can undermine all the good intentions.  \n\nGREG: The hero structure looks like (what we describe in our book Reel Heroes: Volume 1) a divergent duo. They start out as separate characters, opposed to working together. But with time, they form a bond. They work together toward a common goal. During this period they are buddy heroes. But in the end, they go their separate ways. Destiny has played its hand and humans and apes cannot be friends - war is their ultimate demise.\n\nSCOTT: Good call on the heroes in this movie being divergent heroes, Greg. I m beginning to believe that divergent hero stories are my favorite kind of stories because they provide two separate hero tales for the price of one. Often, the two separate hero journeys become intertwined in surprising ways. Last year s Philomena comes to mind, for example. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar and Malcolm are wise and well-intentioned, yet they are brought down by forces beyond their control that rage all around them. The joy of the movie is watching how our two heroes act on their virtuous characteristics, and how they respond to the treachery of their sidekicks. One of my beefs with this movie centers on the character of Carver. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes begins with Carver needlessly shooting one of the apes. He s a racist hothead who should never have been chosen to go on the expedition in the first place, and yet, inexplicably, he s chosen again to accompany Malcolm on the trip to repair the dam. Surely there are more even-keeled and reasonable alternatives to Carver. Yes, we need Carver s misbehavior to help add dramatic tension, but it stretched the bounds of believability for me.  \n\nGREG: I have to agree with you on that. I was really impressed with the quality of the CGI in this film. There s a point where Caesar and Malcolm touch foreheads and you cannot see any dividing line between them. Caesar s hair becomes matted down by Malcolm s head. It s simple amazing. And the full articulation of the facial features is wonderful. This is an order of magnitude better than the original Gollum character that Sirkis created for Lord of the Rings. The villains in this story are driven by their fear - the heroes are driven by their vision. It s a compelling difference to watch. As you point out, Carver is the bigot who cannot see past the limitations of stereotypes he s been taught. Koba, the hawkish ape, has been harmed so badly by humans that he cannot see past his pain. And Dreyfus is intent on saving what s left of humanity. He doesn t have the space to work toward a peaceable trust. This was an interesting collection of villains, with just enough depth to make them interesting.\n\nSCOTT: What I appreciate most about the heroes and villains in this movie is the fact that they exist on both sides of the dispute. There are ape heroes and ape villains. And there are human heroes and human villains. This film could have taken the easy route and made one side all good and the other side all bad, but it decided that nuance and realism were more important than the usual oversimplification we see at the movies. I also appreciate the complex motives that drive the villainous behavior. Besides the usual racist ethnocentrism, there is fear that drives both sides to aggress against the other. There is also the bitter memory of past oppression, which fuels Koba s hatred of humanity. And finally there is pure ignorance. The humans underestimate ape intelligence, and the apes underestimate human goodness. Again, this film really nails the genesis of intergroup conflict.\n\nGREG: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an intelligent and intelligently crafted science fiction thriller that examines the heart of war. At 130 minutes long, it tested my attention in places. However, it is the best of the Apes franchise and I give it a hearty 4 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this story are interesting and deeply drawn. The emotive power of Sirkis  Caesar was simply amazing and helped to tell the full story. The duo/divergent heroes is a pattern we ve seen before, but played especially well here. I give Malcolm and Caesar 4 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the villains were not as strong as the heroes. Carver plays the typical purely bad guy. Koba is at least given a decent backstory to motivate his hatred. Dreyfus as the leader of the humans will do whatever he can to ensure the survival of his people, but is too blind to see the larger picture. I wish the villains were as detailed as the heroes, so I give them only 3 out of 5 Villains. Movie:  Villains:  Heroes: \n\nSCOTT: Greg, we re on the same page on two of the three ratings. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a refreshing reprieve from the usual summer mindless popcorn fare that infects movie theaters. This film is a thought-provoking look at human conflict, how it begins, how hard it is to avoid, and how difficult it is to stop once it has started. Yes, this movie reeks of patriarchy, and once again the limited role of women in a Hollywood film is disappointing. Still, I enjoyed this movie very much and give it 4 out of 5 Reels. Our two divergent heroes are a joy to watch, not just because they time and again show wisdom and compassion, but because their journeys are arduous and realistic. Are they transformed by their journeys? Yes, and in profound ways. Caesar has certainly learned the true value of family and friends, and he pays a dear price for holding naive views of ape goodness and human trustworthiness. Like you, I ll give our pair of heroes 4 out of 5 Heroes. We disagree about the villains, Greg. Most movies devote little time to fleshing out the details of villains  motives and backstory. With Koba, we see the origins of evil; the past torturing of Koba may not justify his actions but it makes them understandable. The human leader, Dreyfus, also has a history and set of motivations that leave us understanding his aggressive behavior but not condoning it. The villains here are complex and fascinating. I m happy to give them a full 5 out of 5 Villains.  Movie:  Villains:  Heroes:",

In Dawn, the CGI is not only improved upon from it's predecessor but plays an even more essential role in the development of the Apes universe. Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, the leader of the apes, and he's better than ever. He is, hands down, the most talented motion-capture actor; in Apes, he and the production team are beginning to blur the line between motion-capture and reality. The film is now three years old and it contains what is still some of the best CGI I've ever seen. What makes this series so engrossing is watching the development of Caesar and his society go from what appear to be simple zoo animals to being almost exactly like the humans they are forced to coincide with; intelligent yet destructive. Howling to see the third.",

It makes the first one almost look fun. The simple beginning becomes so much in the next two installments, and despite being seriously tone-shifting, this movie was great.\n       Like I said in my review of the first one, these films are not cheesy. They're drama movies, especially the 2nd and 3rd installments, and while some like it create nothing but pure cinematic cheese, this movie is believable and realistic. That's largely thanks to Andy Serkis' motion capture suit performance that captures the right stature of an ape, and the impressive CGI. Despite taking a different narrative focus than the first film, Caeser's character shines.\n       Like I mentioned earlier, this sequel is different in a lot of ways: it's longer, more dramatic, and has a different narrative focus. All these things are great. It feels like a true drama film, with interesting characters and ones we care about and feel for. Despite not having the understanding for the apes the first one did, the apes were still great in the movie. Another thing the last one and this one did well is that they could have been painfully long and they weren't. By the end, we aren't bored, we're interested and want to see more. And the narrative focus is different. While the first film felt like it was about the apes, this felt like it was about the apes and the humans co-existing and getting past obstacles uniting them. While at the beggining I wasn't feeling this movie and wasn't liking it as much as the original, by the end I was satisfied.\n       Overall, this sequel is extremely different from the first, but is equally great. It has great CGI and the usual good motion capture performance from Andy Serkis, as well as dramatic and great storytelling. It has a lot to enjoy and is definitely worth seeing.",

While I admit it has a few minor setbacks, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an improvement over its already good predecessor. The special effects are amazing, in fact even better than in Rise. Never has a CGI ape looked so good. it mostly feels like actual apes were cast. Andy Serkis's motion-capture performance is amazing, even better than in the first film. The human actors are pretty good too. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Kodi-Smit McPhee seem committed in what they're doing whilst Gary Oldman pulls off another stellar performance. After all, you know what the polar opposite of that one nitpicky YouTuber says: \"Gary Oldman is always a win\". Toby Kebbell is a great villain, as he wants apes to be dominant because he accuses Caesar of loving humans and not giving a damn about the apes themselves. Drama comes first and action second. It allows more time for character development as Caesar wants to be a great leader whilst, like Clarke's character, he also wants to be a good father. I usually prefer a little more action but the build-up is pretty exciting and its ending foreshadows events to come. I hear War is very good, I hope so. Michael Giacchino's score is great as well. Emotional resonance is strong within this movie especially during a cameo via a camera from James Franco. It reminds people of the better moments during their past. Nostalgia, man, nostalgia. Utilizing cutting-edge technology with a great screenplay, DotPotA improves upon its predecessor without succumbing to the curse of the law of diminishing returns.",

As a result it's equally engaging, and the fact it plays off the first film means we're invested in the story as it cuts to the chase more quickly. From there things waste no time, and the film powers through with just the right amount of breathing room for key emotional moments and incredible action sequences that amaze as much as they hit you. In fact it really is a very impressive spectacle this time around, and looking up at the screen in admiration of Matt Reeves' work doesn't remotely mean you're out of the picture as the characters are all well-developed and the action furthers the story rather than detracts from it.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Where some of the delicacy is lost, the script winds up somewhat flawed - particularly when it comes to discussing the ever-present themes.\nVERDICT: 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is an impressive and engaging beast of a film that continues the franchise extremely well despite its occasional flaw.",

The film once again, as with the first film, shows neither side as the true enemy. You feel for the struggled of both sides with humans struggling to survive while being stricken with fear facing ape foes that are far superior to them, while the apes on the other side are shown with families and the desire to simply be left alone to their own society. Of course, peace cannot last for long in this universe. This is a story about betrayal, it is a story about Caesar becoming what he needs to be to lead the apes to victory and peace, it is a story about understand and the certain humans who know the truth and their struggle to convince the others. It's an emotional film with moments that, if invested enough into the apes, can bring on some tears. While the ending can bring on some chills.",

They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.\n\nWith \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" being a surprise in its own right, who would've thought that its sequel would not only be bigger, but improve significantly, while also creating one giant universe where apes can talk. Let's be real, the plot is ridiculous in hindsight, but this movie is as serious as can be. \n\nOne thing this franchise does extremely well and even more noticeably in this film is its use of CGI. Even if you don't like these films, one things that is unarguable is the CGI. Their motion capture and technology used in this film is breathtaking. In fact, it's a huge milestone in the movie industry. It looks amazing, realistic, and not for a second did I believe that these apes weren't real. \n\nThe story goes on a much larger, more grand scale, but it doesn't lose sight of what it wants to be, and it gives you more without going over the top. The story is amazing, interesting, and well written. It feels like there's no one clear solution, and it's basically survival for your species. The movie gives you this feeling of isolation and wilderness. The world is cut off, losing technology, and becoming into a post apocalyptic world. They really show the beginning of that here, while also allowing you to feel empathy for both sides. \n\nThe acting and voice acting performances are also phenomenal. Jason Clarke plays the lead human protagonist, and he is a very strong lead. He's the perfect bridge between the human and ape characters, bringing plenty of humanity to the table. It's easy to root for his character, while simultaneously wanting to support either sides. Whichever side you're on, his character wants to help and do what's right. However, the real star of the franchise is Andy Serkis, who has acted as one of the most memorable characters in recent film history.  Caesar is one of the most terrifying, relatable, and human like creatures we've had in recent history. His voice acting and motion capture is perfect down to the dot, and he makes this character his own.\n\nIn the end, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is one of the best films of 2014, and has made for a more than successful franchise.

            "content": "'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' was directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke and Toby Kebbell. Over a decade after the simian flu wiped out most of the worlds humans, Caesar(Andy Serkis) and his band of apes have grown immensely and become much more intelligent. Meanwhile, Malcom(Jason Clarke) and a band of human survivors ask Caesar for help to help humans survive. This creates a rift between both the apes, the humans and the relationships between both.\n\n? Very few sequels improve upon the stepping stones left behind by their predecessor. Only rare occasions like with 'The Dark Knight', 'Terminator 2' and 'Fast Five' do we get sequels that are infinitely better than their already brilliant originals. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of these uncommon occasions. Sure it has its flaws(some of which do carry over from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes') but it also fixes many and doubles the amount of drama and action that was there before. Pretty much everything is either improved or stays the same when compared to its predecessor. Nothing retraces its steps quality wise and that is very pleasing in today's movie climate.\n\nFor example, the story in the original was very well written and I congratulated the writers for that. Building of the success of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', they could have just slapped a story together to string the events along but they don't and I genuinely admire that. They still put effort into the story and give it meaning and impact. The themes of betrayal and being a father carry over to here which was nice but I would have liked to see something new and different. The ending here, which I won't spoil, is also really good and perfectly sets up 'War For the Planet of the Apes'. Overall, they could have just made a weak story and ending just to hurry up the action but they don't and they genuinely try to deliver a pleasing narrative.\n\nNext, there is the acting. I've said it once, I'll say it again, Andy Serkis deserved some love from the Oscars for his mesmerising portrayal as Caesar and I honestly feel its disrespectful they haven't given him one yet. Toby Kebbell was also great as Koba and he has a clear arc from point A - B. All the non-human characters in the film were excellently acted and wrote and were the standouts of the film. That said, most of the human characters were very weak and their acting wasn't too special either. Jason Clarke, for starters, was very weak as Malcolm and showed no joy, sadness or anger at any point in the film. I feel like Gary Oldman at least tried as Dreyfus but that was no match for how poorly written the humans were. I will say that's the main flaw of most of the humans. Most of them were competently acted and whatnot but none of them had any interesting motives or personalities and were all forgettable. None of them were particularly likable and they were all replaceable, both as characters and actors. That said, both the villains were alright and, although one of them had a pretty weak arc for me, both of them were pretty threatening.\n\nTechnically, this movie is flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the visual effects and mind blowing and even the costume/set design was brilliant. Matt Reeves is proving he's a world class director on a technical level and I am always amazed with the visually stunning work he pushes out.\n\nNow for the action... It's absolutely awesome! I thought it would be pretty hard to top the action in its predecessor but I was very wrong. I won't go into detail, because you really should see it for yourself, but I must describe ONE tiny segment of action that will have to make you see it. An ape... riding a horse... carrying an assault rifle... while jumping through flames. If that doesn't get you interested in this movie then I don't know what will. Aside from the action, this movie is also pretty damn spectacular on an emotional and dramatic level. This movie pulled at my heartstrings multiple times and must be commended for that. Colour me impressed. One thing I will say was pretty flawed about the movie was some of the dialogue which was unbelievably clich\u00e9 and could be predicted from a mile away. I must of said what a character was gonna say before they said it like 20 or 30 times in the movie because it was pretty damn clich\u00e9.\n\nIn Conclusion, this movie is dramatic, emotion, action packed, a visual treat and is well worth your time and money.\n\n8/10",

I really enjoyed the tension built up as the opposing ape and human societies are bought to the brink of war by acts of aggression on both sides. Indeed, it is unusual and refreshing to have opposing sides in a confrontation depicted as having populations who aren't just either all good or all bad. Real life if more nuanced than that and I like it when movies depict this. This bodes well for the future of this series and I am genuinely looking forward to the next instalment which I hope continues in this manner.

            "content": "In 2011, the Planet of the Apes series was rebooted with great success, resulting in one of the best films in the series. Three years on and a sequel \"Dawn\" has managed to continue this trend effortlessly, resulting in another brilliant summer blockbuster.\n\nDOTPOTA picks up a few years after Rise with the human race all but wiped out as a result of the deadly simian flu. In the years since the virus began to spread, Caesar's clan of apes has gone from strength to strength, having built a home in Muir Woods near San Francisco whilst the humans struggle in the city ruins. In the midst of the growing discontent, newcomer Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and his family (Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-McPhee) lead a team into the forests in a desperate bid to calm the tensions. Where the first film focused on build-up, Dawn goes to great lengths to employ tension, greatly raising the stakes in the process. It only takes one misstep from the humans or one error from the apes to ignite the fires of war and this is constantly emphasised through several close calls across the film's narrative. Yet despite the increased emphasis on action and a struggle for power, the film never forgets the emotion that made the first film so memorable; the highlight of these comes in a particularly heartfelt scene which ties Dawn with its predecessor beautifully. Mix in new themes such as the importance of family and mankind's reliance on technology and you have a plot just as engaging as the original film.\n\nThe new characters may possess quite a bit of screen-time but really it is Caesar (Andy Serkis) who is the star of the show; as the leader of the apes, he struggles to keep the peace amongst the humans and his own kind as well as being constantly at odds with the violent Koba (Toby Kebbel). On top of this Caesar is also bound to his family, which leads to even more emotion being conveyed. In fact the apes as a whole are given plentiful amounts of development this time around; it's a real treat to see how they interact and communicate through sign language throughout the film. The human characters are also well done; main man Malcolm may not have too much of a back story but Clarke nonetheless does a good job of picking up from James Franco; Malcolm also has a family at stake and it's this trait which provides another strong bond between him and Caesar. Gary Oldman is also great as Dreyfus; a kind of pseudo-antagonist and the de-facto leader of the humans. He wants to eliminate the apes from the picture but at the same time he only wants to save his own kind and rebuild the world, providing an interesting moral dilemma to his character. The only real drawback to the casting is similar to the last film; some of the human characters could have been much more memorable if they had more screen-time to develop and contribute to the overall plot.\n\nDawn maintains the reboot's brilliant use of motion capture with even more apes on screen at once and significantly more expression being shown. You can feel the emotions of the apes when trouble comes their way. A greater atmosphere is built over the proceedings with the often harsh weather and the overgrown ruins of San Francisco, perfectly complimenting the disaster that has swept over the planet. This goes hand-in-hand with the editing which is once again stellar, providing a clear view of both the emotion on the faces and the action in the setting. The music used in the film is often slow and sombre, giving off a sense of sadness that permeates the endless struggles of the characters, but it also finds time to emphasise the beauty of the more intimate moments, proving that although tension exists between man and ape, cooperation and harmony can rise again. If you were impressed with first film's technical presentation, Dawn won't disappoint one bit.\n\nEvery bit as good as its predecessor, DOTPOTA is one of the best films of the summer, pushing the story forward whilst going into much more depth on the ape characters. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice by missing it.",

However, it never strays outside of the safe (and somewhat boring, in my view) confines of the action film genre. \n\nIt's a great cinema-movie with its explosions and cool CGI, but it lacked the punch that classics like, say the original Planet of the Apes, have. There's definitely some social commentary going on here but it's hard to hear over all the shouting sometimes. \n\nUnfortunately, there's just something a bit too generic about this film where, um, most of the cast are people pretending to be apes.

This movie is much more than a simple sci-fi tale; the movie delves into topics that many other films are afraid to talk about such as, \"what does it mean to be human?\", as well as carrying political and racial undertones. Overall, this movie is far more than meets the eye, with a great cast, exiting action, interesting themes, and the best movie villain in recent memory, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is my favorite film of 2014, and is a movie that I will love and think about for years to come.",

        {
            "content": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the most unusual big-budget Hollywood action movies I've ever seen. For one, it opens with a virtually silent 20-minute sequence-one that catches us up with characters from the film's predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. There's also next to no action until the 90-minute mark. Up to that point, it's all character-building drama with a bend toward suspense.\n\nIt's also rather small in scope. As superhero movies continue to dominate the box office charts, you rarely find a summer movie that isn't about men trying to save the world. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes posits that humanity just might be relegated to a small quarantined area in San Francisco. Its leaders are simply trying to keep the community safe-not unlike their ape counterparts hidden deep in the woods outside the city. The small scale doesn't mean Dawn isn't without tension, however. On the contrary, director Matt Reeves does a rather incredible job connecting the dots between peaceful coexistence and inevitable conflict between these communities, and he does so by relying on themes that resonate and characters that live and breathe.\n\nCaesar (Andy Serkis, incredible) is still in charge of his tribe of apes nearly a decade after he secured their freedom in Rise. In the intervening years, he married, had a son, and taught some of his fellow apes-including the very combat-minded Koba (Toby Kebbell)-to speak. As the film opens, Caesar's second son is born, and when he's asked by another ape if he thinks there are any humans left out there, he asserts that they aren't so bad. But the weariness on his face is undeniable: for the sake of his family and friends, he sure as hell hopes there aren't any humans out there.\n\nAnd right on cue, one shows up and shoots (doesn't kill) a young ape. His name is Carver (Kirk Acevedo), and he isn't alone. On a trek to find and repair a dam that could restore power to their community, he's accompanied by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), his wife Ellie (Keri Russell), and his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), among a few others. Caesar is benevolent and tells them to leave and never come back, but Koba thinks he's being short-sighted. Yes, letting them go prevents a war between the tribes right now, but when the humans get what they want, they'll be a lot stronger and more dangerous.\n\nUltimately, the film is about xenophobia and how irrational fear or hatred of \"the other\" can lead to dire consequences. The San Francisco of this world is full of good men, good apes, bad men, bad apes, and a lot of fearful followers on both sides who are easily corrupted. Watching the shaky trust that develops as the good ones in each camp feel the other side out is both inspiring and a little disheartening. You want them to work things out, but a variety of factors-the worry and weariness they wear on their sleeves, the persuasive power of the rotten apples in their respective groups, and the film's status as a prequel-all speak toward a less-than-happy ending.\n\nThe film is also damn well-made. Reeves isn't a director who's showcased a consistent visual style yet, but if he ends up settling more on the side Dawn of the Planet of the Apes than Cloverfield or Let Me In, he'll have a long, very fruitful career. Of course, the special effects are spectacular. They were in Rise, and they're arguably more impressive three years later. But the gorgeous tracking shots, the smartly staged action, the mise en scene-it's all quite brilliant.\n\nThe human characters aren't what the film will be remembered for, but they almost certainly mark the biggest area of improvement when you compare this film to Rise. Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are solid (the latter could have a little more to do). Gary Oldman gives a classic great-actor-in-a-blockbuster-movie performance. The strength instead lies in the way the characters are written. Their motivations are always evolving, and their actions usually make some sense-a rare thing in a movie like this.\n\nThe series doesn't seem particularly concerned about catching up to the original Apes film anytime soon, and for good reason. What seemed like a throwaway cash grab for Fox back in 2011 has blossomed into one of the most thoughtful effects-driven franchises of all time. This film will be hard to top, but I can't wait to find out what these filmmakers have in store for us next.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/",

Taking off after the events of its predecessor, the world is now plunged into turmoil, with a deadly virus wiping out much of humanity and giving the ape population some pretty impressive advances in evolution. When a small community of human survivors have to work together with the ape army, to ensure human survival, soon both sides start to double cross each other, in a fight for leadership and survival. Dawn finally feels like were back in that magical science fiction territory, with a stunning looking post apocalyptic world, full of foliage, rust and some impressive forestry. Here we now have a solid cast of actors, Gary Oldman, Kodi Smitt Mcphee, Jason Clarke and Keri Russel are joined by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebell and Judy Greer, which makes the proceedings all the more magnetic. Rise done a great job building the digital characters, but seriously stumbled in terms of acting stature for the most part, and the cast do lend a huge amount of talent to some pretty run of the mill characters, at least in the human category. Which turns out working just fine as we will spend most of our time with our digital and furry counterparts, who have not only had a face lift but now have the entire focus. Reeves manages to make a sprawling and fun blockbuster, with some brilliant artistic design and inventive cinematography. The movie also has its fair share of flaws, the script is yet again weak around the dialogue areas, some actors are criminally under utilized and the final act does become a bit of a CGI feeding frenzy, however Dawn must be applauded for its ability to entertain, grip and be technically jaw dropping. It's hardly ground braking and it does lack the depth of other fantasy franchises, however Dawn will solidly entertain you for all of its run time, getting you excited for whats to come.",

            "content": "Interestingly enough, so far down the road in the Planet of the Apes series that it is only the original that stands before Dawn. Sadly, after Planet of the Apes, story line suffered greatly taking back seat to mere action and obligation to contract. What sets Dawn apart from the rest of the films in the series is the depth of story line carried via the relationship between Caesar and Malcom. The importance of this relationship as driving point of the entire film is made evident in the closing embrace between the two as heads touch in deepest sincerity as friendship is consummated.  As the original alludes to but Dawn brings home in droves, it's not man or ape that is bad or good but individual choice and the development of character that weighs heaviest in creating that which is honorable and trustworthy. As Malcolm's family connects with Caesar's, one can see the good in good. It is not that apekind is good or mankind evil but rather that each sentient being has a choice to be good or evil to use conscious will to determine the path one will take. Where is it that one wishes to focus? On trust and hope or fear and paranoia. Dawn is a great treaties on how humans or all sentient beings must make this most important choice. But it also touches on the point that even good must beware of the power of evil, for it is evil that usually derives from frailty and fear, and we must not feed into it that we must control it with compassion and honor, Dawn tells us all is not lost, but preservation of all that is good takes great control and discipline and service to the greater good not the self and certainly not the weakness of fear and paranoia. And this is what Caesar refers to after Koba has called him weak, for Caesar chides \"Koba weaker.\" Kudos to Reeves and the writers putting a bit of a twist on the tried and true to make something borrowed, new. Good stuff all around.",

            "content": "Andy Serkis gets top billing in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and not without good reason. It's possible that without his performance the movie might have been just another forgettable, big-budget Hollywood special effects prequel, but he makes the movie come alive in a way that from now on, he should no longer be dismissed as just \"that CG guy.\" After playing Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, and the big ape in King Kong he has cemented himself as the king of The Uncanny Valley.\n\nSerkis' performance brings unexpected levels of emotion and conflict out of a character created out of computer generated imagery. Caesar is an ape of very few words, but his face speaks volumes. It's an effect so beautifully done that after a while you stop trying to see the visual effect and start feeling for the character.\n\nThe performance builds on what Serkis created three years ago in 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When we met Caesar then, he was a lab monkey burning with distrust for the Homo sapiens who had caged him up in a science lab and fed him a drug to give him human intelligence. Now, 10 years later, he has grown more mature and more brooding and more thoughtful.\n\nThe story picks up 10 years after the previous film, the virus called \"Simian Flu\" has decimated most of the world's human population. Man has withered down to the bare bones, while the ape society has flourished in the Muir Woods outside of San Francisco. We see Caesar as the leader of the now tribal apes who have developed a primitive society not too far removed from those at the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThere is a dividing line, however. While the apes have evolved, there is a tense but festering hatred between the ape world and the human world. Both are on tenterhooks with each other. Man lives in the ruins of the cities while ape makes his home in the woods. The drama kicks off when the humans (who live in what is left of San Francisco) discover that their supplies are depleting and the only way to keep from running out is to start up the nearby hydroelectric dam - which unfortunately is deep inside ape territory.\n\nMisunderstanding begets misunderstanding. Man goofs up, and the ape's mistrust grows until - horror of horrors - they discover that man has a stockpile of guns. That only scratches the surface. There's a lot of plot in this movie, a lot of story threads to work out but the story isn't the most interesting element. The best thing about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the level of tension that director Matt Reeves is able to maintain. The earlier scenes are the best as we can clearly feel the lines drawn between the two sides and also the conflict in Caesar's soul as he questions his moral values. He finds himself at odds with his second-in-command, a nasty ape named Koba who is prepped for a violent conflict. The apes all seem like individuals, and despite the fact that most of them look alike, you can tell them apart.\n\nThose are the good points. This is a problematic film in many ways. It's too long; the message is repeated over and over; the dialogue is perfunctory, and the narrative moves uneasily back and forth between ominous dread and emotional leanings. It's an uneasy mixture that leads to an ending that is bittersweet when it should be knocking our socks off. The great tradition of The Planet of the Apes movies going all the way back to the 1968 original is that they always end with a punch in a gut. This one closes on a note that tries to be emotional and the result is painfully awkward. Director Reeves wants to have it both ways with the emotional and the suspenseful but he has trouble juggling both at the same time. The movie is a jumbled mix of elements that work meshed with elements that do not. It's a good movie that leaves you wishing for something a little more surefooted.",

I have been a huge proponent in the past of the gritty film genre, but here the setting is so bleak, you wonder why it even was billed as a summer blockbuster.  I can't quite figure out still if Malcolm is the best or worst part of the movie.  He and his family are really the viewer, they don't do much (since it is Caesar's movie) but the emotional relationship with Caesar is what shines.  I feel it has a lot of ups and downs.  Like clearly if Oldman's plan to blow up a tower to eliminate all apes were to work, why did like 90% of them survive, and he clearly knew that if the military were to come after.  I'll watch part 3, but I hope next time it isn't dreck to watch and the film remembers there is still some fun even if it wants to be moody.",

            "content": "A follow-up to 2011's reboot of a storied franchise, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' takes a look at what would happen to society if a deadly virus wiped out nearly the entire human race, leaving an overgrown wasteland that is ripe for the taking by another species. As is the case in the aforementioned 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes,' the film takes place in San Francisco, and things kick off when a band of human survivors stumble upon a thriving colony of apes, led by none other than Caesar (Andy Serkis). The crux of the matter is, the human who've taken refuge in San Francisco want to reconfigure an old hydroelectric dam in order to restore power to the ruined city. As one might expect, this is easier said than done.\n\nThere are a great deal of things to like about 'Dawn.' For one, the animation of the apes is top-notch, as they almost appear as lifelike as the humans they star alongside. Additionally, the language invented for the apes is intricate and intelligently designed, and the constant subtitles are not off-putting in the least. On the human side of things, Jason Clarke delivers the standout performance of the film as Malcom, the fearless leader of the refugees who must keep his comrades under control when emotions run high. Gary Oldman does not disappoint, either, but Keri Russell resurfaces in a role that is not all that memorable.\n\nWhile 'Dawn' is not an amazing cinematic experience, it does offer up enough high-energy scenes and keeps audiences entertained with a series of close calls and misinformation that swirls thanks to opportunists on both sides. Aside from the CGI and acting, the soundtrack that supports 'Dawn' is very fitting, and gives the film an extra boost. At 130 minutes, the runtime is not a major issue, but there are a few scenes that seem to drag on a bit.\n\n'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of the more understated sci-fi summer blockbusters of the past few years, but it's definitely worth a watch for the CGI and action alone.",

Then in the end, he tells Koba \"you are not ape.\" - Whhaaaaat? That completely undoes everything you just said about ape and human potential for good and evil!\n\nIn the end, nothing has changed.

            "content": "Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes\nPublished July 31, 2014 | By The Blue Took\n- By Bryan Stumpf\n\n \n\n\"His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As makes the angels weep.\"\n\nMeasure for Measure, Shakespeare\n\n \n\n\"I'm very ape and very nice.\"\n\nVery Ape, Nirvana\n\n \n\nWas I out of my damn dirty mind? Reviewing a talking apes movie for The Slaughtered Bird, the great movie web-site dedicated to all things horror?\nYet ten minutes in, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes proves itself a murky dark chapter in the Planet of the Apes saga, with moments more horrifying than anything I've seen in 2014 horror so far. Fully loaded with rain-soaked matted fur and apes with semi-automatics, it's clear director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) and writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver were gunning for a second installment \u00e0 la Empire Strikes Back for the Apes prequel trilogy.\n\nDawn opens ten years after the simian-flu from Rise of the Planet of the Apes has decimated most of the planet's human population. Rise's super-intelligent apes have established a peaceful, sustainable civilization, deep in the Muir redwoods, north of San dotpotatFrancisco, governed by alpha ape Caesar (Andy Serkis). Then, the inevitable altercation with humans, as a scouting team ventures into the woods, seeking access to a broken down dam.\n\nThe humans, led by Malcolm - played by unlikely yet likeable leading man Jason Clarke (Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty) - explain to the apes, if they can rebuild the dam, the few hundred survivors in the city can be supplied with life-sustaining power. The shaky negotiation of human and ape territorial rights leads to alliances and betrayals within both animal groups. While Malcolm empathizes with the apes, many of the humans, including the bullhorn-toting ex-cop Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), blame the primates for the millions dead due to flu-infection. And while Caesar cautiously decides to work with the humans, his chief lieutenant Koba (Toby Kebbell) gestures to the jagged scars over his face from torturous lab testing and cites \"human work.\"\n\nDawn's writers allow the characters to evolve in satisfyingly complicated ways. Your sympathies will be tested. Both humans and apes commit horrific crimes, each group seeking to etch out the new moralities in a post-pandemic nation. Further muddying the waters are huge stashes of heavy artillery, the machinery of the old world, providing a 2nd amendment-steeped allegory to the nation-building.\n\nHint: you'll be reminded of the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey, when apes discover dominance through weaponry, while picking through discarded bones.\nJ.J. Abrams disciple Reeves secures dominance as a director with deeply resonant scenes of apes standing atop rusting San Francisco cable cars and angry ape Koba perched, looming above a tattered Old Glory. With cinematographer Michael Seresin, Reeves choreographs impressive, sweeping action sequences - you won't forget the lengthy single shot with the camera firmly mounted to a renegade tank's turret. Reeves keeps the intensity pitched high, allowing for moments more shocking and disturbing than anything you'd find in typical summer movie fare. Yet with the hairy tapestry unfolding with such character-driven resonance, Dawn hews close to a nearly Shakespearean action movie.\n\ndotpota1With Serkis' second turn as Caesar, he cements his rep as the Lawrence Olivier of mo-cap acting. Caesar's every move and facial expression exudes richly detailed subtext, clearly demarcating a breadth of inner turmoil, from justified ferocity to quiet dignity to anguished near-surrender. It's time Serkis was nominated for an Oscar. Considering Kebbell's Koba stands toe-to-toe with Serkis' Caesar, matching and sometimes exceeding Serkis in mo-cap vibrancy, he too deserves award consideration.\n\nThe ape performances so overshadow the human performances, you pity Clarke and Oldman for their boringly human roles. And yet some blame belongs to the writers. Many of the human characters are more sketched than fully written. Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee, playing Malcolm's love interest and son, respectively, aren't given much to do other than look worriedly at Malcolm. And while the digital technology of the ape army will surely wow audiences, the technical mastery unfortunately makes the few CGI hiccups more noticeable - the effects supervisors could have spent a little more time on Caesar's baby and the CGI horses.\nYet the aping Serkis and Kebbell will dominate your two hours with Dawn. And it will come as no surprise that Reeves' team has been tapped for the next Planet of the Apes sequel.\n\nMost audiences will surely bow before Caesar, impressed by Serkis' haunting performance in Reeves' darkly intense narrative. To all movie-goers, I say brace thyself and hail Caesar!\n\nRead more reviews from Bryan Stumpf on theslaughteredbird.com\n\nFollow @bryan_stumpf on Twitter @StumpfFarm @AnnulmentFilm @CommuteScript @MercilessScript @WreckageScript & Facebook.com/MovieMalcontent /StumpfFarmProductions /SFP.GhostWalks /AnnulmentFilmwww.stumpfffarm.com",

I was so keen for this movie that I had to hold myself in or I would transform into an ape. So does the movie live up to my expectations? \nThis movie starts with a little predictable opening scene, broken news reports on how the world has entered a post-apocalyptic situation, an aftermath of the first movie. However when the movie really starts, you are thrown right into the action. From then on the story deviates from what you expect and tells you the story you didn't know you wanted, predictable it is not. The film seamlessly blends exciting action scenes (what is more exciting than an ape riding a horse with two machine guns, name one thing, I dare you) with the underlying moral themes similar to those found in the original and this movie's predecessor. Like a good sequel it expands the story, adds many new characters while developing the characters we already loved. It also increases the action and deepens the complexity of the narrative. The CGI and special effects are all of the highest quality, filming on real sets really has shone through and added to the spectacle of the film. Every ape looks fantastic. \nThere were many great actors cast as the main humans in the movie, I mean Gary Oldman alone makes anything impressive, but I am also a fan Jason Clarke. Not to mention that bald guy who looks like your typical dickhead in movies, Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Keri Russell. However, the real stars that steal the show are the apes. Toby Kebbell as Koba was absolutely fantastic, but the real outstanding performance, no surprise is Andy Serkis; Lord of motion capture. I honestly believe he could be anything he wants to be, because he surely exceeded as Caesar, just as excellent as Gollum if not better.\nSo did this movie live up to my expectations? It took my expectations and pounded them with its big ape fists. It was nothing I could have expected, an excellent sequel that transcends the previous film. The best part about it is that it's a planet of the Apes movie, apes are just awesome. Some small problems: I would've liked to see more of the world, I would've love to sit through a longer film, but that's just me, I would gladly watch hours of the planet of the apes and I have. I have no real problems with this movie and it is an instant favourite of mine. Very close to Phamtastic but alas no cigar.",

However, friction between the two species is increasing, and war is drawing nearer. However, the humans are not as hostile as the trailers suggest that they are, and both sides could be sympathized with.\n\nThis film had amazing special effects, and an interesting story. The acting was very good. Andy Serkis, in a motion capture suit, delivers a great performance as Caesar the ape. Gary Oldman is very convincing as a leader trying to sustain the human race. Overall, this is a film that I would recommend to fans of the Planet of the Apes franchise.",

When the humans led by Malcolm played by Jason Clarke go on an expedition to repair a hydro power plant because they are running out of Diesel fuel, Carver gets in a confrontation with two of the Apes & shoots one in a panic. When he returns chased by the apes, Caesar and the Apes tell Malcolm & his party to leave. \"Go\". When Malcolm returns he tells Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the talking Apes, and how they have to think about what they just discovered. Caesar shows up with all his Apes as a show of force to the Human survivors encampment and tells them there will be no war as long as they stay out of the Apes territory. Malcolm tells Dreyfus he must try and repair the Power Plant and wants to take a peaceful expedition to ask Caesars permission to repair the Power Plant. Unrest as Koda does not trust or like the humans causes conflict between the Apes and Humans. As the humans repair the power plant with the help of the Apes as Ellie helps heal Caesar's wife, Koda attacks the humans. When he returns he devises a plan to get rid of Caesar, and in the process starts the War against Ape and Man.

But it doesn't matter, because Caesar was amazing in this movie just like he was in the last movie. Toby Kebbell also does a great job in this movie. He plays Koba, a bonobo who hates humans a lot more than Caesar does. Their dynamic is what made the movie for me. This movie has everything from amazing action to political intrigue. One thing that the last movie did better was the portrayal of the human characters. In the last one, the humans were much more full fleshed and developed unlike in this one where they're simply present as a means to advance the movie. But, this was meant to be an ape movie and all the actors who play apes are marvelous in their respective roles.",

            "content": "Review for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes?\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story expands from 10 years after the incidents of Simian Flu. It's basically about the survival and getting back what humans lost and the up-rising of Apes. Apes are now more intelligent, tactical. I really loved the flaw of the story. Started with a adrenalin pumping sequence, then turned in to an emotional flaw then the intense and total epicness. The story had some minor issues and let the questions like what happened to the previous characters and some questionable incidents remaining. Yes, I saw how Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes ended where that Air craft pilot saw himself infected with the Simian Flu, but it would be great if they screen some more footage how the Simian Flu expanded around the globe. Based on ten year gap between the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 3 short movies which 20th Century Fox and Vice Media's Motherboard released. Some of the questionable things are touched by those short movies, but not enough for the general audience. Not gonna say more about the story due to spoilers. But I would strongly recommend to watch the 3 short movies which are at least touching the time gap between the end of 1st movie and this, before you go to the cinema. ( Links for the 3 short movies are below the end of the review ). Expect some awesome few twists in the movie too. \n\nACTING, CHARACTERS \n\nEver each actor who played  human characters did their job well. But I didn't see anything extra ordinary from the human characters except Gary Oldman, Keri Russell an Kirk Acevedo. Well it's obvious that they focused a lot about the perspective of Apes this time, which is a great thing. \n\nTalking about the Ape characters and the actors who played those characters, Andy Serkis stole every each scene he appeared in the movie as Caesar. He literally is the father of the motion capture CGI acting and it was an OSCAR winning performance. Andy again succeeded to portrait his character \" Caesar \" as a great, courageous, fearless, wise and inspirational leader just like in the prequel movie. And Koba is the 2nd most interesting character I found in the movie. At 1st, he looks like an arrogant, hot headed ape who hates humans more than anything. But he is more than meets the eye. He was a bad-ass character and Toby Kebbell ,the actor who played the character \" Koba \", did a marvelous performance by acting as a stupid ape and as a wise ape. Nick Thurston played the character named \" Blue Eyes \" Caesar's son, did an impressive performance. Apes had lot more character in this movie. We can feel like they have their own characteristics and attitude. And need to give the credit for Terry Notary who was the movement choreographer of the Apes. Director Matt Reeves handled the characters very well and it's something amazing to see from a director who is not a veteran. And so glad and faithful that the sequel which comes in 2016 of the franchise is in his hands.\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS, ACTION, 3D\n\nI can undoubtedly say, this is the best CGI I saw in a live action movie so far in my life. Apes were so realistic that we can't even imagine that, those apes are not actual apes, but played by humans. The expressions of the creatures are well captured and crafted. All credit goes to VFX Supervisor Joe Letteri and his crew in Weta Digital in the Visual effects company behind all this unimaginable creation. Cinematography of the movie is mind blowing. Action sequence very well choreographed and loved the camera angles which built the intense superbly. Use of 3D could be much more better,yet the depth was solid. Not essential to watch in 3D.\n\nIn a side note, the aspect ratio of the movie is 1.85 : 1. Which is short in width than an average asset ratio of a movie ( 2.35 : 1 ). That kinda bothered me at 1st because I wanted to experience the movie in a big scale. But after few minutes , That was forgivable because,we barely notice that with the excitement and the curious we get from the movie.\n\nSCORE\n\nMichael Giacchino's composing was one of the best thing I experienced in the movie. The score succeeded to ignite the intense, action, emotional and adrenalin pumping sequences through-out the movie.\n\nPROS (+) AND CONS (-)\n\n* Some unanswered questions (-)\n* Aspect ratio (-)\n* Visual effects and everything else (+)\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nThis movie is totally an ape movie which focused a lot about the perceptive of Apes yet it makes us realize, how humans become animals and animal become better than humans. And one of the greatest sequels ever made and I got almost everything I wanted to see in this sequel despite the questionable things I mentioned above. And make sure to watch the 3 short movies I mentioned about ( Links for the 3 short movies are below the end of the review ).\n\nDawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a visually stunning, realistic CGI included, epic and inspirational movie that will remain in your most favorite movie sequels of all time. And so far, this is my most favorite live action movie of this year.\n\n* I also heard that the official prequel short novel by Gregory Keyes answered lot of unanswered things we notices in the movie. So If you want to be answered, do read that novel. It's available as an e-book too.\n\nMy rating 9.5/10\n\n* Spread of Simian Flu: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 1) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrtt37XzOY\n\n* Struggling to Survive: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 5) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxcTS7AUngs\n\n* Story of the Gun: Before the Dawn of the Apes (Year 10) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYCl7_bDbZs",

Then come humans armed with fear and hope. The conflict of emotions starts to carve its mark with the warring factions aim to achieve ultimate survival. The values of trust and compassion are greatly unearthed as the plot thickens. WETA works its magic frame by frame with the visual wonders. The well-defined performances prove that Andy Serkis (Caesar) and the gang can deliver along with the digital artistry. I'm happy that Jason Clarke gets good projects.

All can be forgiven if done the right way and this film does it the right way.  The motion capture and the presentation of the apes are spectacular in their own right; almost as if they are standing right there with the rest of the actors.\n\nThe human characters serve as a good contrast to the apes, which is much welcome.  Watching 2 hours of apes just wouldn't be the same.  Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and Keri Russell have the major human characters to follow.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes never brings the suspense or excitement, yet it is still a recommendable piece.",

            "content": "As an unashamed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films (which I once picked up for under a fiver), I am more than happy to enjoy this Sequel to the Reboot of the Remake of the Planet of the Apes. What's been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.\n\nThis is the eighth film in a franchise rich with possibilities, which has always reflected the concerns of society, from nuclear war, slavery and segregation in the 1960s and 70s, to the 21st Century concerns of animal testing, genetic engineering, global pandemics and our relationship with the environment, always with the chilling edge that comes from displacing humanity from its comfortable position as the planet's dominant species.\n\nAs a quasi-prequel to the first Planet of the Apes (1968), we get to see this process in action as we return to the titular planet (spoiler: it's Earth!) some years after the aforementioned pandemic which appeared as the end sequence of Rise, killing 90% of the human population. With no humans seen for some time, the thought in the now thriving society led by ape liberator Caesar is that the last survivors have perished, but a chance encounter on a hunting expedition reveals the truth.\n\nAn expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.\n\nCaesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.\n\nOur human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble - each has a family they would do anything to protect.\n\nThe real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad - in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.\n\nThe previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm's team, Carver.\n\nHe is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar's son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams \"I'm the arsehole who's constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy\" - which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.\n\nKoba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar's impressionable young son Blue Eyes.\n\nFor fans of the older films, there are plenty of nods to the continuity. Caesar's family, his wife Cornelia and son Blue Eyes, call to mind Roddy McDowell's ape scientist Cornelius, and the nickname 'Bright Eyes' given to Charlton Heston's astronaut Taylor in the original. This is not quite the same Caesar as in Conquest and Battle, both of which are mined again for thematic material, but like the reboot of Star Trek (2011), the time-travel elements of the story are flexible enough to allow multiple canonical continuities, the seeds of which were being sown as early as Escape, and ultimately enabled the hope for reconciliation at the end of Battle.\n\nWe also remember the dramatic \"No!\" - The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.\n\nThere's a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.\n\nHearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity's legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I'm going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I've already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.\n\nThe audience wants a fight, we've paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.\n\nWe know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it's hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.\n\nStill, all things considered, it's an entertaining film, but really not for those who don't subscribe to the sub-genre of 'ape films'.",

Performances are all on par with the past movies, powerful and engaging. This movie also had some of the best cinematography I've seen in awhile. The camera is smooth and steady as opposed to the frantic/shaky, can't see shit technique that unfortunately most action movies are now using. To cut it short, it's a Planet of The Apes film.

            "content": "I think it's official that I can't get into these movies. I will admit that the story was better in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes than it was in Rise, and the CGI is getting better. However, despite the improvements, I still don't feel engaged by the plot and the CGI animals still don't feel real. I'll get to my frustration with the story, but first let's talk about the special effects in this movie. There are several moments, like early in the movie when the apes are confronted by a bear, that I just feel like I'm watching a video game with really great graphics. The slower moments are the best, in fact any time they capture an ape that is posed in one position it looks amazingly authentic, but they haven't mastered the visual effect of the movement. And there are very few scenes where I actually believe the humans and the apes are part of the same world. I won't bother going into how odd it is when you think about naked apes running around which (in order to keep the PG-13 rating) have been given the Ken-doll crotch, because frankly I'm just fine with not watching 2 hours of monkey junk flopping around. However I will say that, and you can call me an ape-ist, but they all look the same to me. Aside from the orangutan and gorilla, I really struggled at times to differentiate one ape from another. They tried to fix that by giving scars and other quirks to some of the more prominent ape characters but I still struggled, perhaps in part because I was mildly distracted and disinterested in the story.\n\nSo now that I've worked my way back to that, let's get into my issues with the story. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a majority of the humans have died, and the remainder are desperately fending for themselves. Meanwhile apes have begun to thrive and build their own elaborate society. What ends up happening when these 2 societies collide is that a few good-natured people on both sides (who intend to reach a mutually agreeable peace) are constantly being undermined by someone behaving like a classic mustache-twirling villain. They establish motives for the villainy, but I can't help being extremely frustrated as every good deed is met with more manufactured obstacles. The story of how war is created probably isn't all that far off from things that have gone on in the real world, but I tend to look to movies for more escapism and I don't feel like watching the frustrations of real-life politics played out for 2 hours. It's a surprisingly smart script and it certainly sets the stage for a continuing franchise that will thrive, it's just not one that I'm interested in. They do too good of a job at creating likable characters and unlikable characters on both sides of the battle, and so I just sit there and think \"what is the end result I should be hoping for in this movie?\" By the end I'm simply watching things happen and I've completely checked out emotionally. For fans of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I think Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is even better. For those who aren't fans of this series, you won't find some masterpiece here that changes your opinion.",

The final duel at the end of the film exceeded all expectations I had of this movie alone. It is awesome to see the apes in action and they do pose as a frightening threat. The best thing about this film is how further sets up the trilogy and its sequel even better and makes it feel almost impossible to wait three years to see it. Each movie does feel like just another piece of the puzzle and when the third film hits theaters in 2017, it will be beyond epic. It is going to be the movie we've been waiting for since seeing the trailers to Rise of the Planet of the Apes and nobody even realizes it.",

Only one big writing point thats stupid; ''we didnt know they would be out there...'' Really? Muir Woods didnt raise at least a tiny alarm in their heads?",

            "content": "\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is a quality sequel in this rebooted series.  While the storyline and human actors fall far short of its predecessor (how can a few Australian no-names compare to James Franco and John Lithgow?), the film makes up for it with jaw-dropping visual effects.  In fact, this film might actually challenge \"Interstellar\" for the Best Visual Effects Oscar.  \"Dawn\" is performance-capture technique perfection, with the vividly real animal movements of the actors pairing perfectly with the detailed computer animation.  It is literally unbelievable - you would swear that these were real apes and, in a less competitive year, I truly believe that Andy Serkis would have been nominated for best actor.  The plot was a bit weak but serves as a good bridge between the ape escape at the end of \"Rise\" and the inevitable battle of the species (which we will hopefully see in the next film).  One of the biggest perspective-changing aspects of the film is the establishment that neither species are the good guys or bad guys.  By basing the conflict off of a misunderstanding, it is clear to see that they could coexist but have no choice in trying to eliminate the other.  The film sets a great tone with its opening.  I don't typically buy into the \"global news report opening sequence,\" but this one is a perfect recap of the previous story and puts the global spreading of the ALZ-113 virus into perspective.  In spite of the special effects and grand-scheme-concepts that this film adds to the series, the human acting is a mess.  Gary Oldman was completely underutilized.  He is the biggest name in this film and the writers even acknowledged that by giving him an incredible emotional moment, but then his character basically disappeared and didn't get another \"moment.\"  The same goes for Keri Russell, who isn't given a chance to use her acting chops, and the rest of the cast who just kind of exist to create a reasonable story.  I can't get over the fact that a ton of CGI apes have more personality than the live humans on-screen, but I mean that as a compliment to the apes more than an insult to the humans.  It feels like some of the script was hastily thrown together with repetitive scenes and a lack of intelligent dialogue.  When half of your movie is without dialogue due to ape interaction, you would think that the other half of the movie would be well-written.  Still, the incredible animation and apocalyptic San Francisco make those flaws hardly noticeable.  \"Dawn of the Plant of the Apes\" needs the rest of the series to make it a great movie, but its special effects would be worth watching even without a plot.",

It's been 10 years since the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and the ALZ-113 virus wiped out much of humanity, causing society to collapse. In San Francisco, a handful of survivors work together, but petrol is running out, and their only hope is to start up a hydroelectric dam, which will bring electricity to San Francisco, but the dam is in a community of apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis). A team of scientists, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) goes to negotiate with Caesar to work on the dam, even though Caesar doesn't trust humans. Caesar's second in command Koba (Toby Kebbell), doesn't trust the humans, and plans a mutiny. It's a very good sequel, and there's some brilliant action sequences throughout, even the motion capture is brilliantly convincing, and you'd never thought you'd engage with apes, but you do, and the way they communicate is absolutely brilliant. It sets the stage for what's to come, even though we know who wins.",

In fact, how the native Ape language came to be \nhand signs is revealed as being sourced from the Humans long ago. As \"Dawn\" unfolds we see a crazed example of balance in \nnature where every action has an equal an opposite reaction. An Ape family, which, in the beginning was\nperfectly balanced and strong suddenly enters a state of collapse (as if it is switching position with the\nleft-over humans who, heretofore, were the ones living in a state of chaos). Like a strange brand of contagion\none group that had been in dire straits now celebrates newfound hope and the Apes begin to fall into disarray\nas they begin a violent assault against the Humans that had wronged them 10 years earlier. In the end, \"Dawn\" \nrepresents a point in time where a race to coalesce good forces against evil will determine the fate of\nall major life on Earth. Matt Reeves does a reasonable job of directing \"Dawn\" and \nwhile this film is aesthetically pleasing and always hints at anti-Darwinism, \nit underscores the inherent violence that permeates the human race and anything\nthat humans touch. The land of the apes is a lush, beautiful place where daily tasks \nare meant only to provide survival of the family and sustenance for the home. This \nenvironment is contrasted early on by the impoverished \nsurroundings that the humans take up residence in. While the Simian population comes across\nas intelligent, cohesive, and vibrant, the struggling human population finds itself on the\nbrink of extinction, functions chaotically, and reacts rather than acting rationally. This film immediately grips the viewer. The dire straits of the remaining population is \nimmediately grasped. The Apes live in the heart of a land where humans are in search of \nresources that can save them, but murder has stepped in and created an immediate rift between\nthe two groups : so now the question is how the humans can take control without dying in the process, \nbecause the Apes do plan to kill them if they should ever trespass into their world again. Like a foolish teenager in a slasher horror flick, the humans are just too hard-headed to \nkeep away. Venturing into the forbidden zone again, the Apes discover their trespass and \nhilarity ensues (if you want to call it that). The pain of the Apes' past dealings with humans (and the human fear of the Apes) is palpable \nbut at the same time displays fright and amazement in single moment are apparent. The humans\nrealize that things don't always fit into a neat little box in life. After all, these Apes can \ntalk. It's clear to see why the Apes want nothing to do with the presumptuous attitude of many \nof these left-over humans; and while the hope of viewers is that the goodwill can overcome the \nomnipresent ignorance of these left-overs, it seems almost certain that it won't. \nFrom the start the humans are always first to threaten, first to kill, and were the root of the \nplague that has nearly destroyed all of humanity and disfigured or killed many Apes. As dissension, mistrust, and human loathing start to tear at the very fabric of the Ape community, \nCaesar's control of his world becomes threatened. Infighting follows as frustations boil over. Still, amidst the factions that are fighting there are small relationships based on friendship and\ncaring that start to bud between some of the humans and Apes, underscoring the reality that\neven in real life there are those who are good and those who are bad and that we have to be deliberate\nin order to differentiate between the two. Some humans and Apes befriend each other. Other Apes covertly return murder in kind to their human\nadversaries, and the question of which is truly the intelligent race is really never decided.\nIn the end we never really know who the savage is, who more brutal, or who is more inhumane . . . \nUs or them. It's a question that we already should know the answer to. This effort is as good as any other in the series of \"Ape\" remakes that I've seen. \nA good watch with thumbs up 8-)",

Dawn does not deserve a 90% rating!\nI was stuck for starters in the small fact that an enormous hoard of apes had been living in the forest for 10 years and nobody new about it!\nThe drug research company is still operating after producing a drug which set off the apes escaping from 'gaol' and living in the forest. This never reached the papers? Oldman's character never heard about a hundred apes living in the forest or the story of apes getting smart? AND, the apes were allowed to remain in the forest?\nThat aside, the story lets down the wonderful effects.

An Oscar Nomination is well deserved. All of the Apes were well developed, as there was something behind every ape. Especially Caesar, who Andy Serkis just BLOWS everybody's mind, with a performance that is Oscar Worthy. Serkis has gone from just a motion capture guy, to one of Hollywood's most reliable and best Actors working today. The Villain is well done, and the performances are unbelievable. Along with Serkis, Gary Oldman gives a masterpiece, Jason Clarke is great, and Keri Russell is good too. The only under developed characters here are probably the Boy, who they don't really explain very well, and some of the Apes. Overall this sequel is better than the original, and Dawn exceeds everyone's expectations with an incredible film. This has been a good Summer Box Office.",

In acting, motion capture, cgi, story and themes, it just raises the bar from everything the first movie did, and does it better.  Andy Serkis is incredible, along with Toby Kebbell, both taking motion captured performances to the level where awards should be handed out for acting. The direction from Matt Reeves is terrific, especially the battle scene with the tank with the rotating top. He got the best out of both apes and humans, while capturing the scale of the city and forest habitats both to their utmost. All in all Dawn gives you everything you could ask for in a sequel, while furthers the story in a direction that set up an awesome third movie.\n4.5 Beards Out Of 5",

The apes look amazing and there face expressions and mannerisms were excellent but after hearing all of the hype, I was slightly disappointed with the whole pace of the film. I loved what the director done with Caesar's character and the relationships with the various apes and humans was interesting and a joy to watch. I couldn't help but thinking that the movie might have been better if the director would have got some top class actors to work alongside the apes, but thats just my honest opinion. Anyway, the whole humans against apes concept was well put together and I couldn't wait for the Caesar vs. Koba showdown, which didn't disappoint. Its definitely a must watch for all movie goers and I can't wait for the next instalment which has been built up to me a major blockbuster like this one. Great!\n\nRound-Up:\nJason Clarke, who plays Caesar's human friend, has a unique style of acting which isn't for everyone's taste. He has a distant screen presence which can easily make you forget that he was in a film. He's starred in movies like The Great Gatsby, Lawless and White House Down but I doubt that anyone can remember him in those films. He's also got a role in the new Terminator Genisys movie so he's obviously a actor that's in popular demand at the moment. Personally, I would have cast Gary Oldman as the lead in this film because it could have done with some emotion and depth but judging by the movies takings, it didn't really matter who played the lead. Andy Serkis has become the puppet master when it comes to playing CGI characters. His amazing movements and mannerisms as Gollum and King Kong, really made those movies great and with the new Star Wars and Avengers in the pipeline, there's no turning back for this unique actor.\n\nBudget: $170million\nWorldwide Gross: $709million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about an ape colony fighting against the humans to save there humanity. 7/10",

There's much events that can be predictable, much slow action sequences and the characters are mostly terrible.\n\nThe main issue I have with this movie is that there's no clear main character, the movie kept changing focus, and I guess that's the point but it feels stupid. There's also too much focus on the apes and too little on the humans, it's understandable but I want more focus on the humans. More on the characters: there's no chemistry between them and it feels dumb and awful. Another flaw is that I could predict almost every main plot detail in the movie, much more than in Rise of The Planet of The Apes. I also expected a greater soundtrack from Michael Giacchino, who gave us the awesome soundtrack in \"Star Trek\" (2009) and the TV-show \"Fringe\". The action is just as the soundtrack: less impressive and less unique. The movie does in fact have some great moments, it do raise even more ethical questions than the previous movie. It also does a great job when it comes to illustrate what no knowledge results into. The movie is also emotional powerful, and the CGI is spectacular. It's much clearer and detailed than in the previous movie. Not flawless though.\n\nThe opening scene is exiting and the first act is totally superior over the second and the third. They are predictable, slow and less entertaining. The ending however, could have played out much better. The previous movie was much about science; this however got a more basic tone about survival and coexistence. It's too boring for my taste.\n\nDawn of The Planet of The Apes gets a 6.8/10.",

            "content": "God, making Caesar the center of this franchise was the best decision the filmmakers could've made. He's such a captivating presence throughout both movies, and this movie definitely does justice to the potential he showed in the first one. When Koba shot Caesar, I was so shocked, and I thought it was so ballsy of them to kill him off. When it was revealed he didn't actually die, I was slightly disappointed, but I was mostly glad, because the movie (and likely future installments) wouldn't be as interesting without him.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the movie is that for the first half and large portions of the second half, there isn't a specific good guy or bad guy. I mean, we're supposed to root for Caesar, but we're supposed to root for most of the human characters too (minus Carver). Koba is obviously the main villain, and the movie needs one, but in all the big battle scenes, you're torn about who to root for. Watching the humans kill the apes is painful, and it's equally painful to watch the apes killing humans. Everyone is innocent. All this senseless violence is thanks to one greedy, sociopathic ape (Koba), and he's the only truly evil character. But are all the other characters good guys, then, or is EVERYONE a little to blame? Gary Oldman's character, Dreyfus, certainly reacts rashly, and refuses to listen to Malcolm. Sure, Koba is mostly to blame. But so are the other apes for so blindly following him, and so are the humans for striking back without hesitating, fueled by preconceived notions that are seemingly being confirmed for them.\n\nAlso, the action and direction are just awesome. Though you can't really root for anyone in the all-out war in the second half, it's still fun to watch the great action sequences unfolding before your eyes. I particularly remember two great camera sequences: first, when Koba takes over a tank and the camera remains level on the tank as it spins and destroys everything it points at, and second, the tracking shot when Malcolm walks through a building, hiding to avoid the apes running around with weapons. The second one especially is extremely tense, the camera tight on Malcolm as he wanders through hallways where an ape could seemingly jump out at any time.\n\nThe earlier sequences, and the first half in general is a little boring, mostly because there isn't a ton of time to develop the severely thinly drawn human characters, but that's hard to avoid. Thankfully, even the earlier scenes are imbued with tension, because you just KNOW the ape-human relations are going to explode, but you don't know how it's going to happen. I kinda sympathize with the filmmakers, because it's a little hard to develop the characters beyond the specific purposes they serve without the movie being bloated. Jason Clarke is decent in the role, but he doesn't really have a personality, and Keri Russell's character is even worse off. There are a few tiny touches, like with Alexander's drawing and the nice little scene when Alexander and Ellie bond, but it's not enough to make them really compelling beyond being human archetypes to interact with the really interesting apes.\n\nBut those relatively boring scenes at least serve to make it more shocking when the violence really begins. It's clear that Koba is tricking the two men when he plays dumb and dances over to them, but it doesn't make it any less shocking when he suddenly grabs a gun, fools around for a second, then ruthlessly kills one man, stares the the other man in the eye for one spellbinding moment, then kills him, too. It's tense and disturbing, and though the movie isn't as constantly entertaining as a summer blockbuster like Edge of Tomorrow, it's emotional and thoughtful and exciting.",

They live in peace and raise their families. Until a small group of surviving humans, led by a man named Malcolm, stumble upon the ape's home in an effort to fix the nearby dam that will turn San Francisco's power back on. Can Malcolm and Caesar work together and keep the peace between their two groups, or will all out war erupt between them?\n\n2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes turned out to be a great surprise for me when I saw it in theaters. I went in assuming that they would mess up with the subject matter and it would result in a goofy movie. However they pulled if off and it turned out to be a fantastic movie with great acting from James Franco and Andy Serkis. This one wasn't ended up being not quite as good though and felt a little underwhelming. You should still see it though.\n\nEvery great thing you've heard about Andy Serkis' motion capture work is true. The man is phenomenal. Not once during the movie did I think, \"that's a man behind all those movements\". Of course the CGI helps, but if something doesn't move like it should, then all the CGI in the world won't help.\nOf course Serkis wasn't the only motion capture actor to work on this. Toby Kebbel, Nick Thurston, Karin Konoval, and Judy Greer (yes that Judy Greer) all delivered great work and disappeared into their ape characters.\nLest we forget, there were human characters in this movie too. Gary Oldman is seen little unfortunately, but he does have some good scenes and touching moment when we find out whether or not the dam did what it was supposed to.\nJason Clarke does a decent job replacing James Franco as the lead. His presence isn't as memorable though and neither is his character for most of the first half of the film. Which is a problem almost all the human characters have. You really end up caring more about the apes anyway, so the fact the humans are kind of forgettable doesn't ruin the movie. A more solid human lead could have still helped the movie a bit more.\nFringe and The Walking Dead's Kirk Acevedo shows up too and he played a pretty good jerk and ends up being the most memorable.\n\nTo me this movie didn't really feel like the \"Dawn\" of anything. Some stuff happens, it gets resolved, and in the end it feels like not much has changed.\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It just felt very much like filler to connect Rise to whatever the next one will be. 3D was pretty pointless as well so I would say pass on that.\nAlso I may have missed it, but when does Malcolm learn Caesar's name? Between when they first get chased off and when Malcolm returns, I swear none of the apes say call him by name so he had no way of knowing. Just something that bugged me a little. It still had some cool ape fight moments, top-notch CGI, and great ape characters. Some slightly more memorable human beings could have helped, but overall a decent follow-up. Fans of Rise will still want to see this one.\n\n7 Reels Out of 10\n\n \n\"If we go to war, we could lose all we've built. Home. Family. Future.\"",

The ultimate takeover ultimately does not occur in this film, making it a bit of a letdown and taking away some tension.  Even so, as a post-appocolyptic vision that's not so post, it's interesting to see humanity struggling to return to normal and apes rising.  It's an interesting chapter in this strange story.  I'm amazed how what was essentially a b-movie concept managed to be taken so seriously.  There are moments of true emotional resonance in this film, as well as some spectacular action pieces.  Suffering from prequelitis, it left me a little let down at the end, but the ride there was good enough to forgive it.",

On the other side of the woods, at the guarded tower of the ruined city lives the small population of humans who are genetically immune to the deadly ALZ-113 virus which wiped nearly 90% of the human population. The humans need access to a hydroelectric dam located at the ape's territory, which could provide long-term power to the city. So they visit Caesar's territory to seek help in their quest and the story continues from there. Fantastic visual effects, story, direction, acting and emotional depth that will make you want to cheer for both species, especially Caesar and his gang. Humans help the apes in several instances and the apes return the favor as well. Overall solid, good film in Blu-ray, not to be missed! Happy New Year everybody!!",

You become enveloped within the Apes' society and evolution, and you may even find yourself rooting for them at some points.

            "content": "As I have said time and time before in my reviews I often either have huge expectations for a film or I have no opinion whatsoever and go with the flow. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was another film I had very big expectations for. Growing up I remember the films being played via VHS over and over again by family members and the TV series we used to watch as well, so my love for talking human acting apes started a very long time ago and after seeing the prequel back in 2011 I have very much been waiting to see how the apes actually take over mankind.\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes did not disappoint me one little bit, from its opening scene's and beginnings where we learn that the human race is dying out due to what is known as the \"simian flu.\" To the very last scenes I was on the edge of my seat, I was sucked so hard into this universe that I couldn't find one thing wrong with the film apart from a few slow scenes and a little CGI mishaps other than that I can honestly say I loved everything this movie gave.\nThe story takes off about 10yrs after the earlier prequel \"Rise of the planet of the apes\" as I stated earlier the human race is slowly being wiped out by a simian flu and now Caesar and the other apes he released from the science labs live in their own world in the middle of the forests. They have fire, they have school they even have written word but most beautiful of all is their use of sign language. It's amazing to see. Now I know it was all CGI at its finest but I could not help being sucked in t the gorgeousness and loving nature the apes had amongst themselves and the way they have grown. Down the way a bit a tribe of humans who are immune to the flu have formed an army to survive. What they need though is power and the only power source near them is in the middle of the Apes new homeland in the way of an old power dam. A pact of peace is proclaimed so that the humans can get the dam restored but of course there are always though who are against diplomatic solutions and do what they will to destroy any chance of peace being made on both sides.\nI'll say it one more time in case you haven't heard me but I absolutely loved the movie, if you let yourself get taken away in its beauty this film will definitely please. There are so many things going on in the background and of course we can all say the movie is actually some kind of great metaphor for the battle we are facing currently whether it be our environmental war or even wars between nations but if you can ignore all that this film stands out on its own as its own battle.\nNow in saying all that I actually went with my partner and whereas we usually agree on films we didn't on this, his first reaction was laughter and his second was the fact it was just so (as he put it) \"hokey\". He didn't enjoy the film at all in fact he found it laughable, he couldn't get over the apes behaving so human. What I found out afterwards though was that he never grew up with the apes as a child, he never seen the prequel so he had no expectations apart from my own which left him very let down.\nIf you know the Apes I believe you will love this next adventure and if you don't know them then you may not. Either way I think it's worth seeing. The session we went to was filled with kids under 15 dragged along by their parents I'm sure. I don't feel this is a film for the kids at all there is a lot of adult subject matter which I personally believe kids will find very disturbing.\nIt was so close to getting a perfect score from me just those few slow scenes and a little sloppy on some of the CGI in a couple of small scenes.\n4.5/5 BanShee Screams for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\nX\n#dawnoftheplanetoftheapes",

            "content": "Having only recently just watched this much hyped film, I think some of the praise it gets is slightly over the top. The film takes place ten years after the events  of Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe cast of that film is missing presumably dead after the virus which turned the apes into smarter than average spreads across the world killing hundreds of thousands of people, only those naturally immune survive.\n\nThe action takes place in San Francisco and nearby woods, humans go into the woods looking for a dam which will supply much needed energy, unfortunately the apes lead by Ceasar (Andy Serkis) have actually created a home beside the dam. While Ceasar  is willing to let the humans do their work and be on their way his second in command Koba wants revenge and all out extinction of the human race for the way apes were treated in the past.\n\nFirst things first this film looks amazing especially the apes and the characterisations of the apes, the use of sign language and some human speech is truly original. The humans who include Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell unfortunately have very little characterisation outwith surviving and doing right by the people in the city. Though Oldman does have one brilliantly handled scene amidst cliched leader scenes.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Andy Serkis who has created a truly original character to go along with his Gollum character from the Lord of the Rings, and it will be a shame if he is overlooked come awards season.\n\nDrawbacks of this film include some ropey CGI effects, the sub-plot of koba starting a war between two species is very much in the style of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country hence done before, though these are minor quibbles. \n\nOverall this is an entertaining film, very much an original take on the mythology with some drawbacks , though these drawbacks do not take away from the experience.",

The mise-en-scene gives us a real feel of a post-apocalyptic California, but we can still recognise areas from the previous movie that are significant to Caesar, for example his home. \n\nThis is a must see film.

It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity, and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco, Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family, Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out, Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who, along with the rest of his crew, races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat, and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead, he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower, making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile, the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community, which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam, which is located on the apes' land, Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly, thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and a few other key allies, Malcolm succeeds. Still, his truce with the apes is a fragile one, and just when it seems that the primates and humans have learned to coexist in peace, a shocking act of betrayal threatens to spark a war that will determine the dominant species.",

This time around, though, the movie is very different in both theme and setting. Rise was a techno-thriller commenting on society. This was more of a post-apocalyptic tribal film.\n\nThere is an opening montage that is a rehashed version of the closing credits for the previous film, and we are then confronted with the worlds ten years later. The apes now have a society, and Caesar is their leader. They soon encounter a group of human survivors, and there are many complex political machinations that ensue (reminiscent of the first Mission Impossible film).\n\nThe apes seem far more interesting than the humans here. While not exactly one-dimensional, the humans lack the interesting relationships established for the apes from the previous film. The shift in tone, while fresh, made the movie fit the mold of many human-survivalist movies, although I will give credit to the filmmakers for giving the apes the screen time they deserved.\n\nWhile still an entertaining movie, it falls short of Rise.",

It's almost as if you could watch an entire movie based purely on the apes style of living and rise from primitive culture to something humans might have survived in.  What's great is as the movie progresses, so does the apes understanding and evolution.\n\nWhile Gary Oldman and Keri Russell add the star power in subdued supporting roles, Jason Clarke stands out as the lead human actor with compassion, smarts and reasoning to at least be the guy you root to succeed.  \n\nThe story really does have a war-like mentality about it.  You can see the chances at peace failing as underhanded tactics and backstabbing are put into play by the apes.  Both sides, apes and humans, are lumped into the same category.

As amazingly human as the apes were in the first film, they are even more so this time.  \"Dawn\" deals with many real-world human issues and struggles like foreign relations, xenophobia, and war.

Fast forward now to Dawn of the planet of the apes. I must say that the series is really moving in an impressive manner. Almost everything about this film is an improvement from the first, which is saying a lot. The story is a great and logical continuation from the first, the acting/cast is amazing on all parts but particularly in our returning protagonist, Caesar, played by Andy Serkis, who in my opinion is an extremely underrated actor and deserves an Oscar. The effects are absolutely unbelievably incredible this time around. There was one point where the camera zoomed in to Caesar's eyes almost in an eyeball to eyeball perspective and if I hadn't already known it was CGI, I would have had difficulty believing it was. The emotion throughout is well placed and  extremely effective, especially in the area of the interactions of the apes within the film. All in all I'd say this is easily one of the best films from 2014 and it's well worth adding to your home collection.",

A drastic improvement over \"Rise\", which itself was a decent experiment gone generic. This is an emotional rollercoaster that left me on the edge of my seat, jaw dropped (not exaggerating here). It compellingly delivered a message that is relevant to us right now: there is good and evil in all species of the Earth and that we must overcome our own nature to be selfish and violent in order to do good for this world and eachother. While war is a part of our nature, we must still believe that there can be peace and that we must look beyond ourselves to find it. Great story, impressive visual effects, and convincing acting overcome some two-dimensional characters and slightly forced moments. That aside, it is the best movie I've seen this year so far. This is proof that summer blockbusters can be deep, compelling, and intellectually thrilling as they are viscerally.",

            "content": "Spoilers!!!\nThis movie has enough plot holes in it to drive a truck through. First off, there are a bunch of Apes by our dam! They don't kill us when we shoot one of them. They show up in force and say they don't want war but they'll fight if they have to. Why at that point would you persist with the dam idea? Everybody is dead, so there are probably other dams. Maybe a bunch of solar panels laying around? Other generators or fuel sources?\n\nNope. We have to go for the dam that has a bunch of dangerous apes around it. Also, if they already have fuel for cars and generators, why do they have to wait for the dam to work so they can start powering their radio transmitter. Power it off the Generators.\n\nSecond plot hole: They've survived for ten years. Wouldn't they have some kind of organization and administration in place to where they wouldn't all just start chaotically yelling and arguing to the point where their \"leader\" has to get a bull horn, and barely succeed in stopping a riot. Come on. These people have been living together and surviving for 10 years.\n\nThird big plot hole. Why bring the crazy jerk dude with you on a peace keeping mission to fix the dam? Did he suddenly develop a brain tumor and was a real nice guy before, but now they're just realizing he's a reactionary idiot who's going to start a war?\n\nFourth big plot hole. The bad ape walks into the middle of the camp with all of the apes there, and shoots Ceaser in plain sight, and... nobody notices. Ahem.\n\nFifth big plot hole. The human camp is gearing up to attack the apes, but when an ape shows up in their perimeter they don't kill him, and in fact let him get close enough to disarm and kill them.\n\nSixth big plot hole. Hey, let's put our armory with all the guns not behind these big safe reinforced walls, but outside of our defensive complex, so they apes can go their first, arm up, and then attack us.\n\nSeventh big plot hole. Ceaser has led them through thick and thin. When the apes realize he's alive and that the bad ape killed him, wouldn't any of them come to his defense?\n\nEighth big plot hole. The apes get guns and learn how to use them, and yet the guns seem to have 24 hrs. clips that just keep shooting for every shot. There is no real indication of them learning how to release a clip, load another, and then chamber a round before shooting again. Not only do you not see them ever reload, you never see them carry any ammo, through they fire on automatic continuously.\n\nOutside of the many plot holes, the characters are never really well developed. There are plenty of slow moving parts in this film where you could have really gotten to know the humans and apes. I have a fairly good memory. I just watched this film, and I can't remember any of the humans names.\n\nCompletely blown away RT has given this a 91 critic, 90 audience. To quote Zoolander: \"Is everyone taking crazy pills?\"",

            "content": "Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is one of 2014's best movies and also acts as a marginal improvement over its predecessor. This film takes place after the events of its predecessor where Caesar and his Apes are now living in a peaceful life away from civilization. When a band of humans arrive and Caesar gives them a chance to fix the things that the humans need distrust and tension soon starts to rise between Caesar and his second in command Ape Koba and soon the Apes will lead a war against the human race which will determine who belongs to earth either the humans or Apes. I remember watching the premiere of this film with my parents in the cinema and I seriously enjoyed it a lot even though I watched it for the second time at home on my DVD it still blew me away and seriously this is one of 2014's best blockbuster movies to date and also the best in the Planet of The Apes series since its predecessor. Ok let's get on with the review. When I said that there are so many things on why I consider this to be a true masterpiece its because this film has all of the things that every blockbuster buff wants. One of the film's stand ups or highlights is that the film not only acts as a marginal improvement over its predecessor but also acts as an expansion to its predecessor and we get to focus on the perspective of the apes instead of the humans. In Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes the film is focused on the humans while in this film we get to see more of the apes from their point of view throughout the film and it gives the film a very smart feel. The other good things about this film is that the movie's pacing is outstanding the first half and second half focus on drama while the third half goes into action territory until the intense climax and it never gets boring at all. The other highlights of this film is that the movie has loads of scenes that are extremely memorable and well achieved(The opening scene, Koba killing two humans, Koba shooting Caesar, Apes attacking the city, Koba riding a tank, Caesar vs Koba and the intense scene where Koba kills Ash). Also the cinematography is ace and the editing is gobsmacking plus the soundtrack composed by Michael Giacchino(Mission Impossible III)is perfect and it gives the movie a strong emotional feel that is touching and very dramatic at the same time. Also the screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback is amazing and I love how the film seriously surpass the original in many ways. The other highlights of the film is that the movie has loads of superb settings I love the woods where Caesar and the other apes stay along with the city that the apes destroyed. But the true main highlight of this film is the themes and tones along with the acting. I love how this movie keeps you interested from the beginning until the end and the themes about Humans and Apes are superb and it makes you think about whose side are you on and who will win I just adore it a lot. Also I love how how we get to hear Caesar talk more often compared to the first one and I love Koba's appearance as well and he gets to appear in every scene of the film. Now the acting is the second highlight of this. All of the casts did a very good job with their performances in the film. Gary Oldman did a superb job with his performance in the film as Dreyfuss. Jason Clarke did an outstanding job with his performance as the main character Malcolm while Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell did an outstanding job with their performances in the film as Caesar and Koba. Director Matt Reeves did an outstanding job with his work on this film and he seriously created a stunning film that has a lot of action and drama. Overall Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a stunning and well achieve film from start to finish  and one of 2014;s best films ever made. This movie get a 10/10.",

            "content": "\"How much like them we are\"\n\n10 years after the events of 'Rise of Planet of Apes' got over, the events of 'Dawn of Planet of Apes' follow. We saw that some virus originates causing an epidemic called simian flu spread across the globe during the closing credits of the previous installment. The same events are show in the opening credits of this one. Most of the humans on the earth's surface are wiped out and few who are alive seem to be somehow immune to the virus. While the apes lead by Caesar have established a new home in the forest and growing in population day by day. The group of human survivors need a dam to be back in operation so that they get electricity but the problem is it lies close to the ape territory. And there the differences on both sides start to begin.\n\nCaesar played by Andy Serkis(motion-capture) is definitely my favorite character from both Rise and Dawn. His character is well written and Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job. Despite knowing nature of Humans he still is sure not every human is bad. While in the other camp of humans, people are panicking as the apes are smarter than ever and feel threatened. Gary Oldman isn't at his best but does his job. But its Jason Clarke as Malcolm who is more likable. The bond between Malcolm and Caesar that slowly and strongly develops is one of the strongest points in the film. Also other positive includes, the tension that builds up on each side on the slightest doubt against each other.The CGI and motion capture is also top notch. The post-apocalyptic environment is quite haunting and effects on apes are damn good. Its doesn't not look perfectly realistic but still one of the best works in recent times. \n\nThe weak point of the film is it gets quite predictable and towards the end turns into routine action flick filled explosions and more CGI. Also some plot advancements might not make much sense,but its bearable. The ultimate point of film in my opinion is that no one perfect on either side, which is the main cause of misunderstanding. Humans are always feel threatened when they see something far advanced while apes are afraid of humans destroying their species like they destroyed earth. One point where Caesar says \"I always think ape better than human. I see now, how much like them we are.\", kept me thinking about our nature for quite some time.\n\nDawn is way different movie compared to Rise. So if you liked the first one because it featured a playful pet-ape Caesar than don't expect same thing here. But still despite its flaws Dawn of the Planet of Apes is strong movie with good intellectual and emotional depth. Only if they did not make it feel like a blockbuster action flick in the second half it would have been pretty much better\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]",

However, there are notable flaws with the film particularly surrounding the script.\n\nAs was the case with its predecessor, there is the attempt to evoke emotion through the use of personifying monkeys and apes. As with the first film, there are points in the film (as there were in the first) in which I would find myself groaning out loud, with the director trying to play the 'look at the cute animal and become attached to them' card. Entwined with were some unoriginal underlying themes which felt mashed together to churn out the final product. Combine this with the dystopia in which the movie is set, and the film felt like it was the lion king meets lord of the flies meets 1984. Originality is by no means the hallmark of a good script. However, for me the script was just so obviously unoriginal and shallow, and in attempting to be profound and intellectual, it enhanced the script's weaknesses.\n\nDespite the lack of depth in the story, the CGI is outstanding. It is an easy watch, and not engaging in the mechanics of the script too much should provide for a couple of hours of entertainment.",

Starring Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell, and Kodi Smit-McPhee, this is the sequel to the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which began 20th Century Fox's reboot of the original Planet of the Apes . Visual effects are extraordinary, story smooth and flowing, direction mostly very good, acting of the humans was average, \"apes\" were amazing, and touchy feelings and emotional depth comes as a package. A lot of people agree with me, knowing that the movie grossed over $707 million worldwide.\n\nThere is no wonder that after the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, director Rupert Wyatt commented on possible sequels: \"I think we're ending with certain questions, which is quite exciting. To me, I can think of all sorts of sequels to this film, but this is just the beginning.\" I think that is a perfect idea, and screenwriter and producer Rick Jaffa also stated that Rise featured several clues as to future sequels: \"I hope that we're building a platform for future films. We're trying to plant a lot of the seeds for a lot of the things you are talking about in terms of the different apes and so forth.\" Really looking forward for it.\n\nIf you want to see  a very good science fiction movie, to be involved in the story, while not missing on emotional charge and action sequences, find some time to watch this!",

            "content": "Wow. There have been several times that I loved the first film in a series, waited a few years for the sequel, disliked, and then forgot about it. This is not the case.\n\nAlthough I personal like Rise of The Planet of The Apes a bit better, this movie is close second. It's excellent. Not just as a summer movie. Not just as a sequel. But as a film. It is an incredible movie. Also what it does is so unique, it not only makes you care about both sides of a battle, but it gives a whole new outlook on the war that began it all in the Planet of The Apes trilogy.\n\nThis movie really avoids a lot of clich\u00e9s. A few inevitable ones pop up, but it is really quite unique. The acting on the \"human\" side is decent. The characters are not incredibly developed, but they don't have to be. They have enough development and are not annoying. You care about their situation. Gary Oldman has a surprisingly small role, but a pretty good one. But the real star is obviously the apes. Andy Serkis and the team of motion capture actors are mesmerizing. The effects are great.\n\nThe movie also has a lot to say about the human condition. I won't ruin that.\n\nThe movie also had a lot of moments that really made me care and it was quite unpredictable\n\nI cannot think of another case of a series that was rebooted three times and on the third time got it right. TWICE!!!!\n\nI was worried when a friend told me the movie was clich\u00e9d and stupid...it is not so. Even if you are excited for this movie, it will still exceed expeditions.\n\n\"Apes Strong Together\"",

Other supporting actors like Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman are commendable in their roles.\n\nThe character developments are predictable, but intriguing.

            "content": "As a sci-fi fan this movie was one of those must-see movies for me. I have to say that I was not having the highest of expectations on it though and I also have to say that my expectations was more or less met. To me this is a mildly entertaining movie but it is certainly not a great movie.\n\nThe special effects with the apes are very good indeed. The apes look very much real and I was surprised at how much emotions that the special effects people managed to get into their facial expressions. The human actors also did a quite good job...within the limitations of the script of course.\n\nHowever, the previous movie felt reasonably new, fresh and original (although it was fairly predictable) while this movie just feels like a rehash of some fairly standard, thirteen on a dozen, post-apocalyptic story with some apes thrown in to make it stand out. I really do not understand why so many people seems to think so highly of this movie. It is the all too common catalogue of stupid behaviors and sadly enough the apes seems to have inherited plenty of stupid behaviors from the humans.\n\nIt starts of with the usual scared-trigger-happy-idiot-shoots someone. In this case an ape of course. How many times have that boring excuse for kick starting the story been used? Then it pretty much goes on. The only mildly intelligent people in the town seems to be the Malcolm and Dreyfus. The two morons wasting ammunition on firing at a old car and drinking Whisky as well as the original idiot who tried to hide a gun deserved to be shot.\n\nThe only somewhat intelligent part was when the captured apes turned over a bus and took a bunch of their adversaries with them. The movie was indeed very predictable. The only thing that elevated the movie above the level of downright boring was the fact that half of the characters were apes and, luckily as I wrote, those special effects were very well done.\n\nThe blurb from Twentieth Century Fox states that \"...both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.\". Well yes I guess that you cannot say that this is a downright lie but it is definitely a bunch of hyperbole to sell the movie. Come on, we are talking about a very limited group of apes, badly decimated as well, against the rest of the surviving humanity, which obviously have some modern facilities left and a war that is more or less just assumed will happen.\n\nA mildly entertaining movie but certainly not a great movie.",

            "content": "Yes it seems to be official, Gary Oldman is apparently in everything!. Much like the ALZ-113 virus he gets into everything and...errr kills it? no wait, analogy misfire here.\n\nFollowing on from the first reboot of this classic franchise with this new cracking title we now see the results of simian flu as its wipes out most of humanity across the globe. Only pockets of people who are naturally immune to the disease are left to try and rebuild whatever they can from their former existence as the dominant species on Earth. In the mean time Caesar and his ape companions have evolved further living in a big Ewok village just outside San Francisco, they don't want war but will fight if they have too.\n\nRight first things first...holy piles of elephant dung this movie looks good! and when I say good I mean sumptuous. The first shot is a close up of Caesar's glaring eyes as his pack stalk prey on the hunt. To say this image is haunting is an understatement, you'd think it was an actual person! in fact I don't even know if it was CGI! (probably was). This first sequence sets up the rest of the movie clearly showing you the effects have been pumped up vastly (they're on steroids) and we are now easily on terms with Kubrick's space odyssey. That's not to say director Reeves doesn't know this...oh he knows and he takes full advantage with some very familiar sound bites that hark back to the beginning of man in that little space flick. You can hear the same type of choir usage in the opening sequences and in the end with heavy orchestral beats hammering it home just in case you're a bit mutton. Yes its not exactly original or very subtle but it certainly sounds epic and works well. As the apes swing through the thick mist swept trees and foliage bearing down on their kill you can't help but be mightily impressed. The whole thing looks and sounds like something that should be from Arthur C. Clarke's seminal sci-fi novels if adapted now...its almost too good looking for this silly franchise.\n\nThis is not the only epic shot or sequence within the movie, the emotions expressed by Caesar and various other ape characters is pretty darn amazing. People are saying Serkis should get an Oscar for his performance but admittedly I really don't know where he ends and the CGI blokes take over. The general movement of the mammals is very very good but lets be honest here, there are many dancers and performers that could probably do that. What really impresses is the CGI work on the fur, wet fur especially and everyday movements  and emotions in the ape faces. There are times when you think you're watching a real chimpanzee it looks so good, Koba especially looks very realistic with his mottled skin. The large orangutan is another highly realistic looking creation as are the gorillas. Some chimp characters are more obvious than others strangely, mainly the lead characters like Blue Eyes don't look as good, the female apes aren't as good either, Caesar on the other hand looks the most human (I guess that makes sense). Is it me or does Caesar actually look like a bearded Charlton Heston in this flick??!\n\nNot only do the apes look good the locations and sets look tremendous too! The ruined San Francisco looked...real! it genuinely looked like they trashed the place for the movie. Its within Frisco that most of the big action takes place too and again I can't deny it looks very grown up and very real. This is most definitely not your average summer blockbuster affair for the scroats oh no, this is a proper science fiction tale with gritty visuals. Is there anything more terrifying than seeing a bigass rampaging crazy chimpanzee upon a charging horse wielding a big assault rifle?? Let me rephrase that, is there anything more terrifying than seeing a crazy bigass chimpanzee upon a charging horse wielding a big assault rifle...and it knows how to shoot the thing quite accurately!!! Especially when the chimp in question is Koba who lets be honest...is a scary looking motherfucker. Oh...where did they get all the horses??\n\nOn one hand the battle sequences are viscerally exciting and pretty brutal with lots of grand slow motion shots of certain apes looking both macho and intimidating. On the other hand I couldn't help but feel uneasy at the entire thing, here I am watching all kinds of apes getting blown to shit and mown down by automatic gun fire as if it were 'Saving Private Ryan'...but with apes. Should I be enjoying this? I felt sorry for the apes and didn't really enjoy watching them die like humans...I know how that sounds but animals are different to us in movies, don't like to see them killed. I guess feeling sorry for the apes was the idea as most had been forced and tricked into a grisly war. \n\nIt did make me chuckle a little bit at the start though, the humans in Frisco could of easily wiped out all the apes in a matter of minutes seeing as they were all tooled up, game over. The apes only had spears at the time, plus the main lead human character could of spoken to Caesar right there and then instead of encouraging trouble by disobeying the apes line in the sand ultimatum. Why didn't they ask the apes about the dam right at the start when they had the face-off, perfect time, instead he goes off later into their village pissing them off even more. I also must ask how many apes there actually were! I know in the first movie many escaped from the zoo and test facility but Jesus there are apparently hundreds upon hundreds of them! Most get killed in the Frisco siege yet there are still tonnes of em', a literal army of apes, did seem a bit implausible even with ten years of breeding.\n\nLets not get ahead of ourselves though, this isn't a cheap action flick with cheap moments of gun totting cheese...OK there are one or two moments of convenient cheese, but not much. On the whole this movie delivers in depth levels of powerful human qualities such as leadership diplomacy acceptance wisdom authority loyalty and honour...with CGI monkeys. The gamut of emotions we see Caesar dealing with against the humans from anger and spite, to realisation of his own kind and finally acceptance that his apes are not better than humans after all is incredibly poignant. Of course on the flip side we see all the negative aspects of the human race played out via Koba.\n\nIt does all seem very much like a science fiction movie...which it is, but when you look into ape (chimp) behaviour its actually quite an eye opener to see that they can be quite vicious to one another. Some of the facial expressions you see displayed by Koba are very accurate which is pretty daunting. I will admit I didn't totally enjoy the very end as it seemed too much of a weak acceptance by the apes for pending war, I'm sure the remaining humans could easily speak up for them seeing as what happened was only confined to a small area. I did enjoy the fact there weren't any cliched baddie human characters for once but unfortunately Reeves seemingly couldn't resist an over the top setting for the final battle.\n\nEnd of the day this does feel a bit like yet more filler or padding for the real focus of the franchise which is all out war between humans and apes. I do kinda feel they could of gotten to that point already instead of stretching it over two movies. But truth be told this is a rip-roaring science fiction adventure that not only betters the original by a good country mile, it also manages to be one of the best science fiction movies to come along for some time (yes its even better than all this comicbook fluff).",

            "content": "It's been four years since \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" director Matt Reeves last cinematic outing, \"Let Me In\" - an English-language remake of Swedish director Tomas Alfredson's vampiric coming-of-age film. While there will always be film aficionados who insist the original take of a film presents its truest form, I felt Reeves' reboot wrought a more kinetic, more universal telling of the tale and that Reeves had created an instant classic of the horror genre. My respect for \"Let Me In\" was immense.\n\nOver the decades, Reeves has paid his dues in Hollywood and his career has veered from comedy (\"The Pallbearer,\" an early and soon-to-be infrequent outing by \"Friends\" star David Schwimmer) to helming one of the first features to bring the now largely defunct \"shaky-cam\" (thank goodness) effect to big screen - his clever, if Dramamine-required, alien-invasion film \"Cloverfield.\" Capable of delivering both drama with sensitivity and visceral shock, Reeves seemed an excellent choice for this latest installment of the \"Planet of the Apes\" saga.\n\nUnfortunately the material he's been given to work with isn't of the same quality as Alfredson's wholly original horror concept or enough of a pure action-fest like \"Cloverfield\" to let one overlook the general mundanity of \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'\" story. How possibly mundane can a planet of talking apes be? Aside from the fact that these simians have now been performing their grunt-speak to audiences for over fifty years (Maurice Evans' buttery, upper-class mannerisms notwithstanding - what planet was he from?), that novelty remains fairly fresh.\n\nBut it's \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'\" screenplay that comes across as flimsy as Linda Harrison-as-Nova's\" deliciously hung rags. If one were to take away the apes as players (which would be a waste as they are miraculously rendered CGI creations), stripped of tooth and fang, \"Apes\" would be left with an all-too-human and all-too-cliched story.\n\nThe film revolves around the \"stop the madness\" efforts of a good-hearted human survivor of the simian-virus apocalypse and the now imperially seated Ceasar of 2012's \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\" These two suffer fools, villains and rebellious children as they toil haplessly to bring peace to opposite ends of an inter-species battlefield. The CGI action is exciting, but the behind-the-scenes powerplays of their shared struggle - however novel on the Darwin spectrum - feels too familiarly packaged.\n\nThe screenplay, credited to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Sliver, makes the writers sound less like science fiction visionaries than a preachy team behind a Vietnam-era anti-war film. There's a decidedly \"retro\" feel to the futuristic war film, with the camouflage-clad ghosts of Audie Murphy and Dennis Hopper lingering somewhere just out of sight.\n\nThe story trudges along dredging up far too many plot points from Shakespearean-aspired royal dramas; I'd recite the litany of cliches but I don't want to spoiler-ize anyone's fun. Gary Olman, who once shone in the sun as a lean, English mad dog, now seems comfortably settled into playing roles of the flustered heavy (and I still think he applies the same touch to his American accent.) He's ostensibly the leader of one of the last tribes of humans, but his nervous fidgeting makes it difficult to believe he would be put in charge of much more than a AA meeting.\n\nThe cast of largely unknown actors doesn't help either. Though capable, they never bring any real fire to the screen, although lead Jason Clarke works tirelessly at his angst. Unfortunately, the human cast is frequently emotionally upstaged by computer-generated apes, that in itself a scary accomplishment which may, indeed, portend the fall of mankind.  Or at least the Actor Guild of America. On the other hand, I never know exactly what praise to lavish on human-marionette, actor Andy Serkis. Certainly dancing around in leotards glued with styrofoam balls for the roving eye of a computer to map can't be easy, but the question is how deep does one's Stanislavsky have to run?\n\nBut the film's real problem is its script, and its by-the-numbers roll call of devices. Without the apes, I imagine the plethora of well-intentioned, but tired war movie cliches would have \"Apes\" garnering far less praise than it is receiving. And those hokey-ending lines gravely spoken by the defeated peace-makers ... Where have I heard them before? \"I thought we had a chance,\" says Clarke. \"So did I, my friend...so did I,\" intones the moribund chimp. It's almost a pity that all the battling that has come before falls into a pile with those oh-so heavy lines, which ring as outdated as a throw-away bit of hippy schtick from \"Easy Rider.\"\n\nOf course, the action fans may not notice these overwrought grarnishes, as they have been rewarded earlier to a fiery finale of two foes battling it out, swinging on an exploding skyscraper, as the inevitable flames lick at their feet, er, paws. While \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" will certainly please the action crowd with the most technologically advanced simian set pieces yet, it's ultimately a pretty routine and not terribly clever affair. Invoking the film's catchphrase, \"Ape not kill Ape,\" I would proffer, \"Ape not make Sequel.\" Though I'm sure \"the heavies\" will triumph again, man.",

However, beneath all the excitement and intensity, there really isn't anything hugely new about the story. It is essentially the first film's storyline infused with higher doses of thrill.

            "content": "The movie achieves what an ideal wholesome entertainment film could ever achieve but with a cast of motion captured actors portraying Great Apes. There is a smooth balance of drama, emotional content and terrific action sequences. There exists a archetypical villain, a righteous leader, the conflicted son, a flourishing and prosperous society and then there are the humans who are nearing extinction. The premise is ripe for conflict and promises an exciting conclusion.\n\nThe movie has high ambitions and this is made clear early onwards when it begins with a terrific hunting sequence of the apes and the introduction of Caesar, the protagonist Ape from the previous film. He has remained the leader and now commands a legion of Apes as his followers with whose help he has built a flourishing Ape society who are remarkable learned to read and write within a span of ten years. The setup is incredible for a film and yet so simple in execution with no exaggeration so as to make this seemingly impossible scenario less believable but instead it is totally acceptable to our logic. \n\nThe conflict arises when it comes in contact with a group of surviving humans, whose first action is to shoot an ape in presumed self-defense. The actors give a convincing performance but they are consisting of the stereotypical variety for a survival flick: the skeptic, the optimist, the pragmatist and then there are the rest of the expendable cast who are not given any significance and rightly so. The human and the ape leads are the emotional centre of the film when they explore the feelings of community, future, peace and most conspicuously trust, which is simultaneously in loads between the two protagonists but lacking between the rest of their kind.\n\nThe film contains special effects like the opening sequence involving a hunting scene, the standoff between the humans and the apes near the colony entrance, the final climatic duel and explosions all in a grand destructive aesthetic to create awe. The most important aspect of the film perhaps is the motion capture and how Apish and Human the CGI Apes feel - we empathize with them whole-heartedly while anticipating their evolution into the flawed human-like being that is their inevitable destiny. \n\nFor a reboot of a classic sci-fi franchise, this exceeds anyone's expectations and delivers a consistent balance between emotional overtones, intelligent narrative and destructive potential that many summer blockbusters all in lack holistically. There is definitely scope for another one with the same exciting caliber.",

We meet a group out of San Francisco, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a good and noble individual, and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), another good man who just wants his people to be safe, but is perhaps a little more willing to let the ends justify the means.\n\nFrom the film's opening close-up on Caesar's eyes to the final frames of the story, the apes are front and center, and WETA Digital has pushed performance into a whole new realm with the work they do here. It's one thing to pull off one or two characters like this, but to lean as heavily as they do here on the digital team to bring to life dozens of characters, and to have them all register as fully as they do here, is a remarkable accomplishment. Add to that the idea that so much of this was shot outside, on real locations, and you end up with something that destroys any boundaries in terms of what can or can't be done at this point.\n\nThe script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Mark Bomback is about what violence does to communities, so while it is indeed an action film at times, and there are some thrillingly staged sequences that director Matt Reeves has imagined, I found myself actively rooting against any action in the film simply because I cared about all the characters enough that I didn't want to see any of them, human or ape, end up in harm's way, and it's obvious from early in the film that things are not going to end well. Once a human community, led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) comes into contact with Caesar's apes, tragedy seems inevitable, and it's awful to watch it unfold.",

So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise. \n\nThis isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects! \n\nThe original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate?  \n\nFor me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a \"trailer\" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending. \n\nMy favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends. \nThis film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting. \n\nReviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I burst into tears the moment I saw Ceaser direct this family who saved his life to his old home, where he was brought up. In addition, it was really touching when seeing Ceaser take the camcorder and watch his own video in the past, the one when he was taught to speak and learn vocabulary. (Oh my my! Tears fell down immediately!) It's rather sad that Coba betrayed Ceaser and killed his own 'people (apes)'. However, it's good to know most are still conscious of telling right from wrong (if that's also what they're capable of doing/feeling). Overall, I enjoyed the second one, and I'm sure there'd be a third one (sigh, wars).",

It's a story not just a race against human and apes, but it is also a story of trust, betrayal, revenge, and new created friendships. There is something magical bout this film that I've been looking for a very very long time. The dramatic musical pieces timed the film very well in terms of it's dramatic and epic proportions as the story progresses. I'm telling you this will eat your hearts out as it is a very heartfelt and heartwarming film I've seen in years. This sequel  is just beyond expectation as this is a must watch and a spectacular cinematic experience that movie goers and enthusiasts have been hungry for a one great film. A+ film 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "After the surprise hit reboot of the \"Planet of the Apes\", it is needless to say that expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? Yes.....on every level. Andy Serkis leads the crew as ape Caeser, who attempts to prevent all-out war between humans and apes, while human Malcolm, portrayed by Jason Clarke, does the same on the other side. The CGI in this movie is the highlight, making everything look incredibly realistic. Rather than using just pure effects from a computer, the director has opted to use motion-capture with his actors to make everything look all the more realistic. For the main ape role, Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture (tell me Gollum was not amazing), is the perfect choice and makes the movement and actions of his animal character look unbelievably real. It's not just Serkis though and new addition to the cast Toby Kebbell, who plays angry ape Koba, who has had a bad experience with humans unlike Caeser, rivals Serkis in how realistic the actions can be made to look. The use of motion-capture really adds to the film. When you see Koba riding a horse and jumping through fire, it looks like a real ape riding a horse and jumping thrgh fire. The humans fare just as well, being portrayed as equally sympathetic characters rather than people who just wish to kill the apes, as parallels are drawn between the humans and apes. Jason Clarke's Malcolm acts as the Caeser of the humans, wishing only to protect his family from the horrors of war while Gary Oldman's Dreyfus parallels Koba, wishing to eliminate the other side ultimately to protect his people and believing that apes are just animals. The tone of the movie is very dark and gritty, showing the difficulties of living in a post-apocalyptic world. One of the best examples of this is when Dreyfus charges a battered iPad and sees a picture of his dead family. You really empathise with the character here and realise that he is not just a villain, creating a strong emotional moment. The soundtrack is also excellent, adding to the dark atmosphere and amplifying the emotional as well as action-packed moments. One of the most interesting things the movie opts to do is have no speaking for the first 20 minutes or so of the film, giving a really interesting insight into the culture of the apes and how they live. My only gripe with the movie is how much the ending sets up part three and does not tell a full story. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited for the next one but it sets it up so obviously at the same time. In the end, however, \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" is still an excellent film with an amazing cast (especially Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell for their incredible motion-capture work) and amazing effects and atmosphere and makes extremely excited to see what the next installment in the franchise will bring.",

That peaceful time is broken when Caesar's and Malcolm's groups collide in the woods and it leaves an ape wounded by a gun shot. Even though Caesar and Malcom both want to keep the peace, a rising tide of anger and mistrust between members in both clans (humans- Dreyfus(Gary Oldman) and Apes- Koba(Toby Kebbell)) result in all-out war. Just with the beginning part of the movie you can see a relationship form between Malcom and Caesar even though they may clash with each other they ultimately want the same thing and that is to protect, build up, and enlighten their communities peacefully.\nIn the website on Plugged In it says \"Caesar repeatedly stresses that the only way to find a fulfilling and happy future is to turn from conflict and focus on building a family and a loving home-something he strives to do with his own mate and two little ones. That sentiment is reinforced when Caesar finds an old video of his deceased human friend Will who embraces him as a young ape and welcomes him into his home.\"\nDawn of Planet of the Apes is a great movie action packed movie especially if you want to see an Ape riding horseback. Also the film doesn't really tells us but you kind of see how in this setting how apes and men are similar down to their cores.

Also it focuses more strongly on human characters, leaving the apes with much less personality than in Rise.\n\nThis movie jumps WAY into the future as well. The simian virus (which was only touched on in Rise) has killed most people in the world, and Caeser now has a small army of genetically evolved apes. This creates a completely different story and environment, and instead of focusing on the struggle of the apes it focuses mainly on the struggle of the surviving humans.\n\nPersonally I prefer Rise to Dawn, but that's just my opinion. They are both fantastic movies.",

            "content": "A treat for the eyes, a story to compel and a main actor to mesmerize, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has everything necessary to be one of the most intelligent and emotionally challenging summer blockbuster for years. In a rare exemption of the fact that sequels are less thrilling than original movies, the second installment further builds up on the moral issues raised by its predecessor and adds up a much engaging action to the story.\n\nTen years after the killer virus almost erased humanity from planet Earth, small groups of survivals are trying to re-build the human society, while apes are slowly evolving and building their own civilization. When both societies confront distrust and tension escalate within the masses. With two main characters from both species trying to build bridges between humans and apes, the story is a smart and challenging entertainment whose emotional complexity is stunning (given the fact that it is considered a summer blockbuster). \n\nHuge part of the emotional value of Matt Reeves' delivery is provided by the character of Ceaser, brilliantly played by Andy Serkis.  A leader, a husband and a father of civilization, he is no different than some great men part of the human history. Andy Serkis' ability to mesmerize with his facial performances, with his morally look of the eyes and his overall central presence on the screen are no surprise to those who remember him from Lord of The Rings. This time, however, he has to depict a leader, a leader that has a vision going beyond the understanding of ordinary people and apes. His terrific performance makes him almost human and compensates for the fact that his counter partner Jason Clarke is no match for James Franco's performances in the first movie.\n\nIn conclusion, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is a must see summer blockbuster. Not for its visual effects and action sequences, but for its story, emotional load and unforgettable performance by Andy Serkis. After this delivery and the first movie the bar for the third one coming in 2016 is raised almost to an impossible to reach level. We have to wait and to hope that it would be matched.",

            "content": "I didn't care much for \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\"  At the time when I saw it, I was definitely much snobbier about my movie taste but after revisiting it, I still could not quite bring myself to enjoy it all that much, but had a greater appreciation for it.  Origin stories aren't always the thing for me.  Sometimes I actually prefer a sequel, we already know all the characters, and the protagonist is already the fully formed character, we don't need to spend the first hour watching them become who they really are.\n \nIn \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" Caesar is already a highly intelligent ape, we don't need to spend the first half of the movie watching him become that, we can get right into the action.  I always have trouble with the premise of \"Planet of the Apes,\" I know there's lots of smart apes, but there's way more smart humans with weapons... just shoot the apes!  That's why the final scene of \"Rise\" doesn't work for me; watching apes take down a human army is absolutely insane to me... JUST SHOOT THEM, don't let them get near you, shoot them before they get there.  Done.  Movie over.  So because of all that, I did not expect to buy into whatever the plot of this new installment was, but I was delighted that instead of a world domination or takeover movie, they went with the classic \"Pilgrims & Indians\" plotline from movies like \"Pocahontas\" and \"Avatar.\"  The humans want peace with the Apes, so they send over some people to make peace and everything is working out just fine but due to some misunderstandings, the hot-headed generals decide to ignite war.  Classic plotline; it never gets old, people will always be drawn into a story like this because it teases you with peace and then frustrates you with the inevitable war that will happen near the end that could be avoided if there was better communication.\n \nI remember when \"Rise\" came out and everyone was screaming for Andy Serkis to get an Oscar nomination for his motion capture performance as Caesar, the leader of the apes and scoffed at the thought, but now I can't help but agree that if the pool of Best Actor candidates isn't so great this year, why not throw him in?  I'll tell you why not, the Academy would never tarnish their snobby name by nominating an animated monkey from a summer blockbuster for Best Actor (prove me wrong, Academy).  Caesar is infinitely more interesting and complex as a character now that he is grown up and acts as a cautious but never vengeful leader of the apes.  Sometimes his gruff slow-talk can get to you but that is honestly the only complaint I have about his performance.  He is commanding, respectable and when he stands on two legs with his chest puffed out, you know you would do whatever he asked of you unless you want your head torn clean off.\n \nThe humans are actually the characters that aren't given much to do.  Jason Clarke gets to be the main peacekeeper and delivers the best work possible but in a role like this, his potential is limited.  I believe we will see a great role akin to what he did in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" someday soon, because he has the chops, no doubt.  Keri Russell is great actress, so it's too bad that she really doesn't get to do anything more than just be the unit's pretty doctor and Clarke's love interest.\n \nI was worried about the Gary Oldman character going into this movie.  I know Oldman loves playing the villain, and wants to get back to doing that after playing good guys in the \"Dark Knight\" and \"Harry Potter\" films, but my worries were calmed upon meeting his character.  He is not the hot-headed general that just wants to kill the apes because he can, like Stephen Lang in \"Avatar,\" but rather a worried human leader who is backed into a corner when Apes come knocking on his door.  We probably get the most depth from Oldman's character, we learn about the pain brought upon him by the Apes' virus, how he lost his wife and children; there's a great moment where is able to look at old photos of them on an iPad when power is finally restored to the humans' refuge and he breaks down in tears.\n \nFor a big summer action movie, this works as a bit of a slow burn.  There really isn't a big action setpiece until the final act but there is so much tension throughout, that I did not really mind.  I was on the edge of my seat watching the political structure of the apes' society be tampered with.  And kudos to the animation designers on this movie, because the creature design is so distinct.  You never get confused about which ape you are looking at on the screen because they are all just unique enough to tell apart.\n \n\"Dawn\" really was the most surprisingly good movie of the year for me, at least so far.  The story is pretty worn and clich\u00e9 but it still worked fine and there are two characters that I haven't mentioned that also fall into that frustrating clich\u00e9 category as well but this movie really works and did a great job at expanding the world of this franchise.  I don't know if the next installment can top this one.  It really was a tight blockbuster.p",

But in 2011, Rupert Wyatt made a film called Rise of The Planet of The Apes. I loved the film it was really well done , with a very hard hitting story about retaliation and freedom. Now in 2014 we've gotten the sequel , Dawn of The Planet of the Apes. Now with having new director Matt Reeves , I didn't know what to think because I loved the first film and what Rupert did with the apes. But when the movie came out of course I had to see it. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes out does Rise of The Planet Of The Apes by a long shot. Instead of telling a story of retaliation and freedom. This is more of the battle for survival. 10 years after of the events of Rise of the Apes. Most of the human race has been wiped out , and the apes have made there own civilization and are living in peace. Until one day a human named Malcom  (Jason Clarke) gets in the way of the apes and just wants there people to be in peace with the apes. This film , like I said is really well done. Andy Serkis gives one of the best visual performances i've seen ever since Gollum from Lord of the Rings , and he was Gollum. Caeser is one of the most well developed and one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in the movie. Daw of the Apes did what transformers should've done. It makes the apes the main characters , not the humans , you come here to see the apes and what there doing. Theres not a lot of action in this film but when the action goes down. It really goes down. (APES RIDING ON HORSES). The human cast is really good as well. Jason Clarke gives a great performance , as does Gary Oldman. But the real scene stealer is an ape named Koba , played by Toby Kebell. He was the villain of the movie , but he was a lot more than that. Just like Caeser he has his reason of why he hates humans. I am really glad to say that this is one of the best films i've seen this year. It's either this or X-men.",

Current events parallels abound--the war on terror, of course, and also Ferguson--but this is pretty timeless stuff (or at least 20th-century-and-beyond timeless). Distrust, othering, admirable but dangerous allegiances to tribes and families and races, need for resources, access to arms. Ideals are compromised by the compromising situation. It's powerful, potent, even profound stuff, and it's masterfully executed. An extraordinary script, moody direction, beautiful, appropriately overcast photography, a score from Michael Giachinno that feels like distant thunder rolling in. Seeing this level of moviemaking is rare. Seeing this kind of operatic ambition in a summer blockbuster is rarer. This is a movie that is deliberate and grand, explosive and atmospheric, political and personal, over-the-top and contemplative. It's an action movie that relies on character and ideas, that has the audacity to make its audience read subtitles while apes sign to each other. It's another amazing installment in what may be my favorite franchise--a compelling genre movie that is smarter and more socially conscious than probably almost anything we'll see during awards season.",

This takes place years after Rise and by now Caesar and the rest of the apes have established a civilization. Humans are almost gone and the few humans left want access to a dam so that they can continue to have power. However, there are tensions between both the humans and the apes especially with Koba as he wants an all out war between the two species. \nPros: \n\tThis movie is visually stunning. The apes look like real apes and not just cgi. \n\tThe movie is well directed. There are scenes where there is really nothing going on but the person watching the movie can feel the intensity and it almost seems like you are in the movie. \n\tThe movie is not predictable like most movies. \n\tThe acting is great. \n\tOne does not have to watch Rise to understand this movie. Meaning that this movie can stand-alone. \n\tThe movie has a deeper message than just what you see. I see many historical references and I also see the concept of racism exist in this film. \nCons: \n\tIt takes a huge time jump from Rise and it would have been nice if it connected better with Rise and offered a bit more explanation of what happened after Rise especially with a few characters. This however does not lower my score at all as it feels very minor when I watched it. \nConclusion\n\tDawn of the Planet of the Apes is an extremely great movie, which was well acted, well directed, and well written. It is a must watch for all movie fans. I highly recommend watching this in theaters as the intensity just jumps, however I can see this also being a great experience on Blu-Ray as well. \nRating:\n5/5: Phenomenal",

            "content": "When 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' arrived in theaters three years ago, it was met with great critical and commercial success.  It was smart, had clever direction at the hands of relative newcomer Rupert Wyatt, and was exciting enough to appeal to the summer movie crowd.  A sequel was inevitable - as Hollywood just can't help but go the route of the sequel anymore.  However, when Wyatt decided not to return to the director's chair, attention turned to Matt Reeves (Let Me In), an up and coming director with some nerd credibility.  Anticipation built, and the first previews started showing up promising action galore.  But would this just be more of the same from the first one, rehashing themes with new characters?  Or would this be an epic follow-up on the level of some of the great sequels of our time?  \n\nTen years after the viral outbreak, Caesar (Andy Serkis, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey') has taken his serum-enhanced followers into the forests of northern California, where they have built a peaceful society.  When a remnant of humans shows up in their territory, calamity soon follows.  However, a human named Malcolm (Jason Clarke, 'White House Down') convinces Caesar to give them a chance to restore power to the survivors via a hydroelectric dam in the apes' territory.  Anxious to trust humans despite his kinds' mistreatment at their hands a decade earlier, Caesar allows it.  However, while power is being restored, a zealous ape named Koba (Toby Kebbell, 'The East') has plans of his own.  Soon a showdown between the apes and humans seems inevitable, even though Caesar and Malcolm both work to avoid it.   \n\nLet's just get this out in the open - there are some major plot holes with this flick.  The spoiler-free ones include the apes' ability to utilize firearms with precision with absolutely no background training (which fortunately didn't turn into an anti-gun tirade) and the ability to repair a hydroelectric dam that has been dormant for a decade in mere hours.  That's really the tip of the iceberg.  One could pontificate on the development of ape society, but it would be a circular argument that focuses too heavily on the serum from the first film and evolution of society.  Now, these aren't the odious plot holes that permeate flicks like 'Green Lantern' or even 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', but it's kind of disappointing given the amount of goodwill exhibited with the first flick (even though it had a few minor plot holes as well).  Plus, the marketing of the movie was kind of deceiving.  It presents this film as action packed, but this film is a slow burn and when the action finally heats up, it almost seems a little too late.  Necessary, but a bit frustrating.  \n\nWhile the first movie featured few memorable performances aside from James Franco, this film seemed to step up a little in that category.  Clarke, Keri Russell (August Rush), and Kodi Smitt-McPhee (ParaNorman) make for a fine human side to the story, but the multifaceted Gary Oldman (Lawless) is all but wasted here.  The real draw once again is the performance capture roles.  Serkis once again proves that a performance can be truly wonderful, even when an actor is never seen in the flesh on screen.  He commands the screen as Caesar once again, and Kebbell is decidedly vile as Koba.  Their movements were clearly well-studied, and the wizards at Weta Digital have once again made the apes so incredibly lifelike that their work deserves due credit.  Also, it's nice to see the care that has been taken with the cinematography in this film.  Cinematographer Michael Seresin (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) avoids the use of the shaky camera technique and really gives the film a great feel.  And composer Michael Giacchino (Star Trek Into Darkness) has crafted a score that is quite apposite in this film.  \n\nCritics and those who were able to see it early compared this film to 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  They were sorely mistaken.  While this film certainly has emotionality to it and really utilizes the slow burn effect, it never really feels like it has anything compelling to offer.  It never really ups the stakes, and almost feels more like merely a setup for part three.  Maybe having the third part will complete this part much the way 'The Bourne Ultimatum' completed the storyline of 'The Bourne Supremacy'.  But despite Reeves' confident direction, this film feels more like an achievement in special effects than an achievement in storytelling.  It's nice that they didn't take this in a truly clich\u00e9 direction the way many had feared, making Caesar a revolutionary type.  But it never seems to elevate him to more than a commanding presence with a heart for peace.  It'll be interesting to see where the series goes from here, but hopefully it's in a more crowd-pleasing direction.",

No one showed any surprise at the apes turning up, even though their existence was to be kept secret - no one batted an eyelid at them riding horse -  what? humans couldn't manage that after ten years? and a tablet works after ten years? I can't get one to work after six month's inactivity....\n\nSo, yeah - disappointing, didn't live up to the hype and considering we know how it all ends, is there any point carrying on with it?",

As the tension grows between this two species, shit happens (No spoilers) and war breaks out, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes shows its splendour.\nThe action scenes are exciting, but there is also a very powerful drama about the past of these characters, that make for some really moving scenes.

It is just a spectacle of brilliant SFX and motion capture, without any of the story or soul that made Rise such a delight. Disappointed that they would let the original director leave and bring this guy in for the 3rd in the series. I guess like the 1968 trilogy, Apes is doomed to have the first film standalone from substandard sequels. Criminal waste of Gary Oldman didn't help.... That said, the film received an ovation at the theatre I was in, so it probably struck a chord somewhere. Just didn't plumb the potential of the story they started in Rise...!",

This film was almost on the same level, except that it perhaps went slightly over the top in certain areas where action overwhelmed the proceedings a bit too excessively.

In the meantime, this film settles for setting the table on the next motion picture and leaving viewers unsatisfied and no resolution.  Unfortunately, this waters down each parcel of the 'Apes' masterpiece just a bit more.

As a surviving human community exhausts their last fuel supply they seek an alternative source of power in the form of a dam, the two sides meet and are forced into war by the actions of a few loose cannons. It does not choose to answer any questions the audience may have about the missing 10 years, such as 'what happened to the astronauts?' because the answer is obvious, likewise, it does not choose to engage in complex subplots and does not diverge from it's core narrative which allows for better characterization.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes is unique among blockbusters in that it has inner beauty. The apes are brought to life with awe-inspiring CGI, coupled with exceptional motion-capture and voice acting, the English language is clearly very difficult to reproduce with an ape's vocal chords, you can hear the stress and harshness of every word, signing is preferred by the apes which produces long absences in dialogue that contribute to the film's gritty and earthly tone. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does not compromise for action and visual effects; the film is superbly written and emotionally impacting. The movie acts more like a bridge for a sequel to document the evolution of a new \"Planet of the Apes\", but it successfully pulls you into their world and easily merits its own existence.",

If you ask the general movie goer (who sees mostly big budget blockbuster films) and you ask them who Serkis is, they might actually know, but not use his actual name but rather just Gollum. Gollum being the role that brought Serkis fame throughout all of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films.\n\nNow the interesting thing about Serkis is that most of his motion capture roles are universally praised by both critics and fans alike. Many will even say that some of them are Oscar worthy even. However, the Oscar nomination never comes and we are left to recognize Serkis' talent on our own (which at the end of the day is probably more important). As you can probably tell by these first two paragraphs, I am a big fan of Mr. Serkis and he has delivered yet again in his second go as the mighty Ape leader, Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe film begins and ends with us staring into the cold and threatening eyes of Caesar, neither time can we differentiate those eyes from that of an ape or human. Serkis' use of his eyes are what makes his portrayal of Caesar as good as it is. He is able to express so much emotion through them and say exactly what his computerized ape-like body is thinking and we feel that. We are able to see the anger and frustration that Apes have with humans based on past experiences. We are also able to see Caesars' nagging sense that not all humans are bad also based on his past experiences being raised by a \"good man\" and the inner conflict he is wrestling with throughout the film over how to balance his loyalty and trust between both apes and humans.\n\nWhat are we to take from this film? Are we as humans not as developed and advanced as we think we are? We witness two intelligent species that claim the other is flawed and really a sub-species compared to themselves, but we watch as both sides make the same mistakes that will eventually lead to the potential downfall of either one. Perhaps we have not developed as a species much since we evolved from apes all of those years ago but the film also shows that we have that capability for progress. It also shows how capable we are for complete self-destruction based on our tendency to turn on each other in time of chaos. When conflict arises, we too often turn on one another so that we can survive instead of working with one another collectively to solve a problem. Now you think I'm gonna try solve that crisis? Please....I've got Breaking Bad to re-watch on the 'Flix.",

Great films capture the best of all genres, and that is exactly what Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is able to achieve.",

Thankfully, everyone involved was fully aware of that and delivered another smart blockbuster with a lot of vital commentary on the futility of war and violent conflicts. The film doesn't want you to pick a side too easily as hostility between the last remaining humans on Earth and the intelligent apes arise. There are decent and bad characters on both sides. This makes for an interesting ride, as the conflict spins more and more into chaos and there is little anyone can do against it, after a point of no return. Once again, the CGI is incredible, thanks to great motion capture acting and the accompanying special effects. Thankfully, the human actors are en par, especially Gary Oldman only takes two short scenes to make a strong point for being one of the best of his generation. The gloomy atmosphere, the great cinematography, it all adds up to an intelligent and pretty damn entertaining continuation of the story. If there is one complaint it would have to be that the ending is merely a cliffhanger for what's next in part three. But at least we all have something to look forward to.",

Taking place directly after Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the film sees the United States wiped out by the plague seen in the first film. The apes have formed their own colony in a forest, while only a few humans are still alive. A group of humans in California are attempting to bring power back to their community, which causes a few humans to unexpectedly encounter the apes.\n\nThis film is on the same level as the first: a well-developed film, though it is also a little better. Andy Serkis, the king of motion capture, returns as Caesar, who has now formed a colony of apes, where he acts as their leader. Serkis, as well as the other actors depicting apes, is fantastic. You actually believe that you are watching an actual ape. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Gary Oldman wonderfully support the film. Oldman's character is an interesting one, since he's neither a hero or a villain. He's simply fighting for something that he believes in, while he's trying to protect those he cares about: the surviving humans.\n\nMatt Reeves, who takes over from Rupert Wyatt, brings a different scope to the film, making it grittier and darker, which perfectly adds to the film's tone.\n\nThe film slowly weaves into the original Planet of the Apes, while it proves that summer films can still rely on interesting characters and a great story, not just stupid characters, repetitive computer generated effects and dumb story. Job well done.",

An uneasy truce is upended by Caesar's second in command, the scheming Kobo, who wants revenge for his perceived mistreatment and sets about tricking the humans into a violent conflict. The CGI is simply phenomenal and certain shots have a photo realistic quality unseen in many other films and with the legendary Andy Serkis (Caesar) and the impressive Toby Kebbell (Koba) at their performance capture best, the film balances a fine line of spectacular set pieces, proficient plotting and sombre storytelling. The humans play second fiddle but Jason Clarke is great as the \"good man\" Malcolm, whilst Gary Oldman is his usual gifted self as a paranoid and emotional military leader. From the private to the primate, \"Apes\" continues the hefty issues raised by its predecessor and the audience will continue to enjoy the profound topics that affect the planet. 8/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

It's not necessarily better than Rise (the 1st ape film) but it's pretty much the same as the 1st. You get the same thing here, great special effects with effective story telling. But this is not an explosion filled popcorn flick but more of a slow burn adventure drama. Some may get bored but there are some things to be enjoyed with Apes 2. If you liked the 1st film then you should like this one as well. I dug it.",

The story telling is magnificent and you are able to see the bond between the Apes and how they live and how they are trying to survive. the human story as well is more than sub par thankfully. It builds up slowly through out the movie at a good pace and is in my opinion, the best of the series.",

Both films are prequels to 1968's \"Planet of the Apes\".\nAlthough I didn't go ape-shit for this film, I found myself mesmerized by the performance from CGI motion capture and visual effect. Absolutely believable. This evolutionary leap makes the original look like a puppet show. There is brilliance in simplicity: how the apes communicate to each other through rudimentary sign language and their thought process.\nThe plot had Shakespearean themes: family conflict, loyalty, betrayal. All leading up to a climatic conclusion. I felt more sympathy for the apes than the humans. That's true cinematic magic. It raises the question of who's the real animal.\nDarwin was right when he said we are decedents from apes. Humans share 98% DNA with our hairy ancestors. I wished the film made a definitive proclamation of this scientific fact, but I suppose Hollywood didn't want to ruffle any feathers with its religious audience. The film is science fiction, after all.\nMonkey see. Monkey like.",
