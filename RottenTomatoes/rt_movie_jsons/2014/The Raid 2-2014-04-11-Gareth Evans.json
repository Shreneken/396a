And it's like the first one - the action scenes are one of the best I've ever seen and that bathroom scene? Oh gosh, my breath. It's just too cool of a movie to not love even when I'm not entirely sure that plot worked, but whatever, it's a Raid movie, I wanna see some fights and there are a lot of 'em, and I mean - a lot. Even though the pacing isn't the best and the quiet moments should've worked better when the next action scene plays out, it's better than the previous one and the movie is once again on the top. I wanna see Netflix's adaptation to this because I absolutely have no clue how are they going to pull this material out.

The film is saturated with the cultural commentaries on the fine line between corrupt police and the criminals they pursue, but Uwais is different.  He is an idealist and a real good guy in this dark, dark world.  Visually stunning.   Cinematically masterful.  The acting is great.  The music is compelling.  The action and fight choreography are ahead of their day-this is a genre leader.  This is extremely violent and is subtitled.

Iko Uwais and Arifin Putra have a thrilling relationship and again the film gives importance to a dialogue that seems trivial. I confess there was a moment when I was a little confused with the alliances, who is on which side, and my experience wasn't as immersive as the one with the predecessor. The final act is an \"arena mode\" of a videogame, and the last scene is an example of how to use the ambiguous ending (and made me wanting to see a possible, or not, The Raid 3).",

The story still is nothing special, it might have benefited if there was a little more of Rama having to balance his undercover investigation while trying not to get caught. Maybe if it was given a bit more suspense it would be more of a thriller instead of a flat out martial arts maulfest. Not that I'm complaining, I knew what this was and I was completely fine with what the movie gives us, namely more brutal, unflinching, bloody action. Having said all that, the story isn't bad, it just never gets to a point where you're on the edge of your seat because of a situation the main character is in seems unwinnable for him. But the action will definitely excite most action loving people and watching this with a group of friends is a lot of fun. It's the kind of movie you'll talk and reminisce about from time to time because of the impression it leaves. Every martial arts movie we watched since is getting graded by \"The Raid\" scale. And that's the only \"problem\" with this movie, it's bloody violence kinda makes other action movies pale in comparison. Sure, there are a lot of other brutal movies out there, but this one really is fun",

Now this is a fine plot but it's somewhat repeating the same or similar plot to the first and that is my biggest problem. The film also includes to many characters and tries to focus all on them for two and a half hours and it doesn't give enough time for the protagonist to develop and because of this I was losing interest in the film. The film makes up for it's incredible fight scenes. They are so absurd and creative that you can't help to watch them. This is a film I would recommend it mostly because of the fight sequences.

Evans' direction is riveting for a massive 150 minutes of brutal, gory violence. His editing is pretty intense and makes the run-time not feel so daunting because you keep getting cut to the next mind blowing stunt sequence or intricately choreographed action combat. The hand to hand combat is so fast and deadly that these actors could have easily died making The Raid 2. The kitchen fight with dual knives is as dangerous as the car chase. Evans' script is pretty interesting as he frames a complex crime narrative of rival gangs warring as the police try to uncover corrupt police officers in the meanwhile. He layers a wild story all around these insane fights.\n\nMatt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono's cinematography is pretty with neon lights and moody alleyways everywhere. I think it's amazing how they film on the sides of cars or in small spaces effortlessly by appearance. They clearly thought out every shot in The Raid 2. Joseph Trapanese's electronic and industrial kind of score is crazy. Kumalasari Tanara's make-up makes all the bloody knife wounds and 12 gauge blast wounds look real. The Raid 2 is so well made, I was stunned the entire time I watched it.\n\nIko Uwais' lead role as undercover cop Rama is incredible as he is so fast and intense as a fighter. Arifin Putra is the perfect scumbag as Ucok. Oka Antara is great in the car chase sequence as Eka. Alex Abbad kills it as the villain Bejo. Ken'ichi Endo is cool as the Japanese crime boss Hideaki Goto. I liked the old man Tio Pakusadewo as the Indonesian crime lord Bangun. Cecep Arif Rahman is so cool as the fast assassin with killer knives. Julie Estelle is awesome as the hammer girl. Very Tri Yulisman is funny as the baseball bat assassin. Yayan Ruhian is my favorite as the elder assassin Prakoso.\n\nIn short, watch The Raid 2 if you liked The Raid and action movies. It's something else.",

Unusual for movies to start like this but it felt great to see the film makers carry on the story legacy. Plot is simple and needs to be because with such a strong foundation, the choreography was sublime and right from the start you are on the side of Iko Uwais. A legendary martial artist in his own right, he really shows off his talents in Raid 2. Each fight was so well planned that it was seamless from one scene to the next. The attention to detail and realistic moves didn't repeat themselves at any time. Most movies reuse scenes or recycle kicks/punches, but not here. The time investment really shows and Iko is a man of few words, but his actions and expression make you accept him as the hero instantly. Hats off to the film makers, choreographers and to Iko Uwais. This is a must-see movie and a great sequel to the first. I hope they will do another! 5 stars all the way!",

The Raid 2 is no doubt entertaining as heck in the action department and making Rama go after the higher-ups in this crime syndicate makes for a mostly engaging undercover-cop action thriller.  I have to wonder though, did this really need to be 2 and a half hours long?  The pacing technically never drags, per se, but by the end of the movie I thought 2 hours would've sufficed.  I also wasn't a fan of how this sequel ended.  I was hoping to at least see Rama reunite with his wife and son, but instead it just...ends.  Oh well.  Overall a very valiant effort that is strong enough in its own right.",

            "content": "The Raid 2 is a film that takes you by surprise, because it starts mere hours after the first film and yet is a totally different style of movie. The first Raid seemed to be a lot of action with a minimum of plot in order to string all those fights together, while the second one is plot-heavy and it uses the action to accentuate the story. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the change in pace, but this type of plot-driven script is much more my style, and so I liked this movie more than its predecessor. The early scenes don‚Äôt do the greatest job of establishing the story, though. I had some confusion and felt like I needed an explanation at times in order to understand who was who, and what everyone wanted. Once I was on board for the story (which felt a little like The Departed) I found it to be an exciting film, and I was riveted as each moment seemed to bring another twist or betrayal into the story. The action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and display insane amounts of skill from the fighters. I tried hard to shut off my brain during these moments, because a number of questions do come to mind. It‚Äôs difficult not to notice how the bad guys coincidentally don‚Äôt have any guns when the hero enters the room without a gun, despite the fact that they kill plenty of other people with guns in other scenes. There‚Äôs also a moment in some of these fights when something switches for me and I almost start to laugh. After an intense fight drags on for several minutes, I just can‚Äôt fathom that two people could even remain standing, let alone still be doing complicated back-flips and bouncing back up after crashing on their spine. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúsuspension of disbelief‚Äù things that I can only push so far. Still, I have to acknowledge the talent that goes into making a fight scene with that kind of complexity. I was fully on board for the story of The Raid 2, which is surprising. I don‚Äôt typically enjoy movies that focus heavily on organized crime, and gang-related drama. But I appreciated that there was a cop in the middle of it all that gave us someone to root for and worry about as the danger became more intense. I would have loved it if we saw more of his police work as he was infiltrating the gang, and saw how he worked to gather information from them. The ending left me feeling like he failed (to some degree) because he didn‚Äôt get away with anything to expose the corrupt cops. That being said, I liked seeing how he utilized his place in the organization to keep tabs on them all, and I appreciated the conflict he seemed to feel when his two employers are pitted against one another. There‚Äôs some interesting complexity to this story, and I think it‚Äôs one that would reward a second viewing. Considering how much awesome action they sprinkle throughout the film, The Raid 2 will be a fun one to watch again.",

Massive props to Gareth Evans, I tip my SnapBack off to you sir! So in this sequel we follow our sole survivor, Rama, who must go undercover in order to protect his family from his new hardcore reputation that is making him popular in the criminal underworld. I'll start with the negatives, the first half was an absolute drag. This did not need to be 150 minutes long, at all. Could've easily established the power hungry Uco, who has major daddy issues, in a solid 20 minutes as opposed to an hour. So the long runtime and slow paced first half are my only complaints. This, as an action film, is absolutely insane. The Indonesian Terminator from the predecessor has now been substituted by a hammer wielding deaf girl, a well aimed baseball bat wielding guy (who can kill by hitting baseballs with insane precision...) and the ultimate blade wielding badass since Blade himself. That kitchen fight sequence was savage. The choreography was perfection, I've never shouted \"YEAH! STAB HIM!!\" so much. Evidently, watching this is releasing my inner murderous personality. The action set pieces were creative, from decimating prisoners in mud to a frantic car chase in downtown Jakarta...majestic. Some technical excellence from Evans, who performed such a great tracking shot that consists of going through 3 different cars in a chase scene. The use of blood and gore is ridiculously insane, great makeup effects. Even the no nonsense dialogue was insanely savage. Did I mention this film was both savage and insane? Remove the first half, and it's perfection...but we can't so it shall get a decent rating instead. So much more juicier than the first!",

Seeing that having a larger budget allows Evans to take the story where he wanted to go with the first. No longer confined to a single tower block he takes it to the streets, quite literally. \n\nIt's starts immediate where The Raid finishes continuing the story, tying off a couple of loose ends and heads directly into undercover territory. Rama, our surviving protagonist gets sent to prison in attempt to unfold the criminal underworld. Again, it's been done before but not quite like this, not in this style. \n\nEvans wanted to make the first film in a prison setting and this one fulfils his ambition. Giving us probably one of the best prison fight sequences since Jackie Chan's Prisoner. Like much of the rest of the film, and as expected; it's fluid non-stop action with so much happening but Evans manages to keep focus and not make a visual mess using incredible angles and shots. \n\nHis use of rolling cameras and long takes are both daring and impressive. It really puts you into the fight like being a fly caught up in the commotion. This is especially noticeable during the in-car fight and car chase. Instantly reminding me of John Woo; and during the prison brawl, there's a long take that scoots around the whole set trying to take in as much of the action as possible. \n\nThere's some interesting characters brought in, and a welcomed familiar face from the first. The siblings, baseball bat-man and his sister, hammer girl. Uco, the man Rama attempted to get close to is good and has an uncanny likeness to Brandon Lee. If there's ever a film made about him, Arifin Putra should definitely take the role. \n\nBut it's Cecep Arif Rahman's assassin that steals the show. Having that looming, sinister and silent presence. The ultimate showdown being a bloody and almost exhausting 6 minutes of absolute glorious martial art cinema. Again, with Trapanese heightening score and Evans great use of shots the film is worth watching just for that epic finale. \n\nThe action is there, less of the firepower and more of the face-to-foot style with the added extra of cars, bikes and gangsters. The opening actually reminded me of a scene from Scorsese's Casino. It's actually more artistic this time round, almost poetic, especially the conclusion of the nightclub scenes; making it bloody beautiful. \n\nIt's definitely another good example of a sequel being better than it's previous. It's more polished, crafted however maybe a little more fleshed out which makes it drag slightly. But apart from that, fans of the first, and fans of the martial art genre should not be disappointed. It's again, of the best martial art films ever made. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 10\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a prefect sequel and again, getting to the top of it's genre, especially with that last battle. \n\n92% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

With no expectations whatsoever, The Raid Redemption became a sleeper hit both with the audience as well as the critics with none having a clue of what hit them. The dynamics have changed now and people tend to expect and compare from which very few attempts hit the mark. \n\nThis story starts from where its predecessor has left off with Rama (Iko Uwais) is getting debriefed at an unconventional location. A police chief coerces Rama into going undercover to both unearth another corrupt cop and also to take heat off from him and protect his family. Rama infiltrates the syndicate run by Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo) a wise patriarch through his hot blooded son Uco (Arifin Putra). He has to struggle to keep his identity a secret, discover the secrets, collect evidence and miss his wife and newly born son. When Uco comes up with his own agenda, can Rama survive?\n\nSince this story is out in the open world and not constrained within an apartment building - it is both good and bad. The innovation to excel within its limitations is where the original made its mark but in the open world - it is just as any other movie. The director tries to squeeze everything into it like the prison riots, car chases, modern gadgets along with its famous punches and kicks. He even brought back his Mad Dog Yahan Ruhian in different role with a completely different look. Everything looks like they should from a technical stand point but many things doesn't add up from dramatic and emotional point of view.\n\nThe original had the relentless pace, even before the previous action set piece is concluded a new one is already midway. The same cannot be said here as it invests in a bigger story, more characters and their development which doesn't seem to be the director's strengths - leading to a bloated runtime. Its plot drivers are riddled with holes like what happens to the injured guy who will be taken away for treatment in the beginning, Rama is seen extremely struggling with an injury and a moment later he is fighting off dozens of bad guys without a sign of the injury and many such continuity issues. Bringing the story to the open world also introduces us to a long list of characters like the 'Hammer Girl' who is similar to Gogo from Kill Bill, the baseball bat guy, Uco and his father, his Japanese friend/rival and his son etc. where most characters get uninteresting in a short-while.\n\nWith the element of surprise gone, the sequel struggles to compete as a regular action movie.",

            "content": "This seems to be my season for watching challenging films. I'll be the first to admit that martial arts/action films is not my favourite genre. I never even saw CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON for that reason. So, it was with a huge grain of garam that I chose to watch the Indonesian film, THE RAID 2.\n\nAs the title suggests, the film is the sequel to a story that saw rookie Jakarta policeman, Rama (Indonesian traditional martial artist/actor Iko Uwais) take on that city's underworld. THE RAID 2 begins, apparently (because I never saw the first one), hours after its predecessor ends. In this installment (yes, THE RAID 3 has already been announced), Rama is informed by the city's anti-crime and corruption boss that he had only cleaned up the inconsequential scum in the criminal pond. The big fish are still there swimming around. Rama is asked to go underground to infiltrate one of Jakarta's two crime families with the goal to ultimately wipe out both groups. Of course, Rama is not too keen on that plan so soon after his first foray into serious crime busting but he has no choice. If he doesn't act now, the lives of his wife and infant son will be at risk by the family he dissed in the first film.\n\nSo Rama says goodbye to his wife and goes to jail for - get this - two years. Now that's commitment! And this is no ordinary jail either. There is hard core and then there is this place. Within minutes of his arrival, he is set upon by 20 angry inmates, whom he quickly subdues with his rapid-fire punches and high kicking acrobatics. This feat grabs the attention of Uco (Arifin Putra), who is the imprisoned son of the boss of the targeted crime family, and the two of them soon form an alliance of mutual need. Rama is \"in\".\n\nTwo years and a spectacularly choreographed mud fight later, Uco, who is already free, comes to pick Rama up from the jail. He offers Rama a job in his father's organisation and for the next 90 minutes it's basically one bloodfest after another with Rama taking on the minions of not one, not two, but three crime syndicates. (Wait! Didn't the anti-crime guy say that there were just two groups controlling the city?) Meanwhile, Uco has ambitions to take on more responsibility, though his father, Bangun, thinks it's too soon. Uco is too hot-headed and Bangun thinks his rashness will only lead to their demise. Unfortunately for Bangun, Uco forms an alliance with the head of the third syndicate that is seeking to change the criminal landscape in Jakarta. As each player jockeys into position in this all-out turf war, Rama finds himself in the middle of it all and must pull out plenty of tricks from his bag of martial arts manoeuvres to stay alive.\n\nConsidering I don't really like this genre of films, I've got to say that it wasn't too bad. The martial arts choreography was top notch. There is one scene at the end of the film between Rama and a character known as \"the Assassin\" (Cecep Arif Rahmani) that is like watching a master class. These two men are amazingly agile. Rahmani is apparently a trainer in the Indonesian martial art of pencak silat. One of the weapons the practitioners of this art form use is a tiger claw-shaped blade known as a karambit. In the film, the Assassin attaches one of them to each hand and turns feral. You definitely don't want to be on the receiving end of one of those babies!\n\nAnother enjoyable scene is the car chase through Jakarta. If you have ever been there, you know that the streets are never that empty. They surely had to shut down huge sections of the city to film these scenes but it was worth it. There is great action and great photography.\n\nThis is not a perfect film by any means and the plot does have some gaping holes in it. Maybe it's just me but it seems a bit far-fetched to think that one guy can singlehandedly bring down a whole crime syndicate let alone three. And the business about Rama's family being in mortal danger never seems that apparent. But if you're prepared to suspend all logic and reason (like seeing snow in Jakarta's streets), and endure a lot of blood and gore for 2-1/2 hours, you're in for a good time.",

An early prison riot scene is startlingly harsh, as the roving camera hurtles between mud slathered combatants. The virtuosic camerawork mares well with the high energy plot and the over the top violence, a kitchen set showdown and a dizzying car chase sequence are among the best action set pieces seen in modern cinema. \n\nWhile it's a visual feast to experience, it has its flaws. I wanted to love this movie, but with a plot that's a bit superfluous and a little on the long side, the pacing issues are really detrimental and the film just doesn't possess the same charm from the original. \n\nRunning at 150 minutes, the jaw dropping action sequences are worth it in the end. Remaining stylish in a blur of insane brutality, The Raid films are unquestionably on a whole other level to anything else in the action genre.",

            "content": "Very few films have surprised me when it comes to their sequels, as well as this film has. Some movies in my experience rarely live up to their original precursor films. Studios throw hundreds of millions of dollars to produce massive trilogies that rarely pan out in terms of storyline, and are often bloated massacres (Harry Potter, and that awful Hunger Games series come to mind). However, 'The Raid 2: Redemption' exceeded my expectations at every turn.\n\nThere have been so many advances in this film, when compared to its first independent and low budget brother. I praised the original for its simplistic, catch-the-bad-guy storyline, but they really focused on telling a much broader and in-depth story this time around, that massively improves upon the first, lending more to the characters and their overall story. If you just look at the run times of both films, the Raid 2 is longer by nearly an hour, and by no means slower in pace. There are certainly better dialogue and delivery this time around, and it actually lends to the original by going further into the lives of the characters in the first film and connecting to the original right away. Every character gets a bit of background and that really adds to the overall experience. The main character, Rama (Iko Uwais), returns to action for a completely believable reason and it doesn't seem forced. The multi-layered and multi-lingual Uco (Arifin Putra), is aggressive, driven, and downright evil at times. His father running his corporate mafia, Bejo the conniving criminal and his influence over others. Even the homeless assassin Prakoso, (Yayan Ruhian who played 'Mad Dog' in the original) has enough storyline to make the viewer actually care about what happens to him as he fights through a sad and violent life. The Raid 2 is a massive improvement just in terms of storytelling alone.\n\nAnother huge improvement was the advances in action and choreography in the fight scenes throughout Raid 2. I am by no means a martial artist, but I have a lot of respect for those who commit themselves to this kind of art form, and it shows with the sheer number of characters who excel their respective styles. The number of action sequences are frequent, and only broken up by moments that lend to the overall story. The muddy gangland fight notably stands out as one of the best choreographed brawls I've ever seen, and if you focus on the background, ever single fist thrown and kick landed looks real. The debt collection scene has one of the best hallway chase sequences I've ever seen with its twisting and obscure camera angles. One of the hardest sequences in terms of choreography was probably the hallway scene between Rama and the brother / sister duo of 'Baseball-bat boy and Hammer girl' (Very Tri Yulisman and Julie Estelle respectively). The final knife fight sequence in the kitchen shows off the proficiency of one of Uco's henchmen; Eka (played by Oko Antara) and his skill with the Karambit; a curved, cat-claw type of blade. Whereas, the first film mainly focused on Iko Uwais's abilities to stun with his skills in Penak Silat, the Raid 2 really focuses on more than one character's ability to fight. There are several other players that lend to this film's action and it really shows in every scene.\n\nJust on a final note, yes this movie is bloody and gory. There is a bit of overkill in that respect, which takes away from some of the action. Most of the violence has a lot of post production FX in terms of the blood you see and it can look a bit silly at times. Of course there has been a growing trend for gore in the action genre (mostly inspired by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez successes), and of course this film is no exception. The blood flies in ridiculous amounts and for me it loses some of its action credit that way.\n\nYet, this is a spectacular sequel in the overall scope and sequence in direction and editing by Gareth Evens, the choreography of the actors themselves, and even the use of 'free to use' licensed music from none other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, this movie is bigger and better in so many ways.\n\nDo not miss this film.\n\n3.5/5",

            "content": "Released like a bat out of hell in 2011, Welshman Gareth Evans Indonesian set Iko Uwais starring actioner The Raid can now in the years following its legacy be classified as not only a cult classic but also an undisputed action classic that gave the genre a kick (and a gas canister filled fridge) where it needed to be kicked and set the standard for adrenaline racing thrills that many Hollywood wannabes lack. With The Raid's standing in the genre now well and truly set this larger follow up had hype a plenty that was justified with a great reception at its Sundance premiere and now in general release fans of the first can now make up their mind as to how this crime/action epic stacks up to its loved predecessor. After sitting on my thoughts for a few days now I finally feel confident in expressing my particular thoughts on what could be the year's most memorable movie.\n\nThe Raid 2: Berandal (which stands for Thug or Thugs in Indonesian) is a massive step up in scope and territory for not only its writer/director in Evans but his cast which features the stars of the first entry Iko Uwais and everyone's favourite Mad Dog Yayan Ruhian in a new role as \"The Assassin\" plus a raft of new members. Evans clearly buoyed by the success of his first Raid entry has here created a crime opus that is not dissimilar to some type of Scorsese/Tarantino piece filled with biting violence and equally snarky comical moments and scripting. It's a brave move by Evans to create such a piece around the action that made the first movie such a breath of fresh and often blood filled air and at times sadly it does feel like there is more exposition here than was needed that stops the movie from being a full on borderline perfect action tale. To pick faults with ambition is a petty thing however when so much of the Raid 2 is above and beyond anything you have seen or are likely to see in the future both near and far.\n\nThe scope and vision spoken about earlier appears so frequently throughout this movie that it almost could be taken for granted but what watchers of this film are privy to is a film that boasts action set pieces that defy logic to be bigger and better than the one before all culminating in what can only be described as one of the best car chases of recent memory and a kitchen set 2 man fight that is all types of amazing (the cinema audience I sat in with was well and truly up on their feet and clapping by this moment, and in truth most of the movie). To mention merely these set ups though is taking away from all the previous entries which in any other movie would be enough to make it a must see. Credit needs to go to Evan's and his star Uwais who have shown considerable growth since the first outing with Evans showcasing an incredible vision as a director which well and truly sets him up as one of the most unique and talented working today while Uwais should be proud of his growth as an actor that should set him up in good stead to have a long a hopefully great career in the genre.\n\nThere are pacing issues in this film and despite not possessing the original films unique charms and set up along with the firsts complete out of the blue appearance for many, The Raid 2 is still seriously jaw-dropping stuff that a cinema full of clapping, cheering and at many times wincing audience members can attest to. Evans and Uwais have yet again raised the bar for what we can expect from them but one feels there far from finished and the movie world is all the better for it. After this particular cinema experience you'll never look at an action movie in the same way along with your everyday claw hammer, baseball or box cutter.\n\n5 muddy prison brawls out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "After the disastrous raid on Tama's apartment building, the rookie SWAT unit member Rama (Iko Uwais) meets with Bunawar, a police officer that was assured honest by his brother Andi. After sending Rama's fellow survivor Bowo to receive medical attention and executing Wahyu, Bunawar invites Rama to join a clandestine anti-corruption task force which seeks to expose police commissioner Reza's backroom dealings with the Bangun and Goto gangs. While Rama initially declines, he agrees to join them after learning of his brother's murder by Bejo and the imminent threat to his family. Rama assaults the son of a politician who opposed Bangun's criminal family, earning imprisonment alongside Bangun's son Uco. Rama, under the alias Yuda, saves the mobster's life during a prison riot. Bangun subsequently hires Yuda when the latter's prison sentence ends two years later. As Yuda, Rama proves his value to the organization and earns the family's trust while rifts grow between him and the unreliable Bunawar, who withholds information from him. Meanwhile, Uco grows increasingly discontented with his father's lack of faith in his abilities and placidity towards the Japanese, desiring to take on a larger role in the mob's operations...\n\nWhile \"The Raid: Redemption\" was by far one of the most craziest and violent movie experiences I have had in years, it still had an intriguing storyline with a SWAT team trying to get out of a building filled with criminals. \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is not as high octane action driven as the predecessor and maybe that is partly the downside of it. The second one is more character driven, but at the same time a bit more \"boring\" than the first one in comparison. I personally don¬¥t think that the high-energy plot and over-the-top violence in the second one reaches the heights of the first one. \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" feels just like an excuse to make another film to ride on the wave of the first one. I felt less interested in this story with Rama going undercover to expose corruption and gangland oppositions. At times it¬¥s confusing with all the characters and you sense a feeling that director Gareth Evans wanted to cram in everything he had in his head. Joey Magidson of the website Awards Circuit wrote that he \"appreciate(s) the directing skills on display in The Raid 2, but at a certain point, all of the fighting and killing nearly got to be too much for me. I'm recommending the film, but not in the same way as the last one.\" He added that while it is \"creative enough to be worth a recommendation, it lacks the originality of the first flick\" and concluded that \"The Raid 2 will delight genre fans, but might not impress to many others.\" My opinion as well. I reckon that despite there¬¥s some sort of ballet like beauty in the hyper-violence and martial arts brutality we see, I simply can¬¥t condone this sort of extreme violence as in this case we are too far off from being comic like and too close to being realistic. Yes, Gareth Evans has showed us how great he is in creating unique action choreographed sequences with outstanding camera-work, but if the storyline fails the rest makes no sense in my book. And \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" has a messy and not that of a great storyline. My conclusion is that \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is simply not as good as \"The Raid: Redemption\".",

Started well: solid setup and background and the plot development seemed to be going well: devious, efficient criminals, cops in a predicament. Looked like we had a decent, gritty, realistic cop-drama on our hands. \n\nThen it all fell apart.  First the plot started developing holes. Things started to seem contrived and implausible, and I kept thinking \"But surely they should do (that)\" and \"How is that possible?\".\n\nWorst of all, it suddenly became a martial arts movie. You know, the silly, over-the-top, very unrealistic, impossible-moves, impeccably-choreographed stuff. It started with one cop vs about 10 bad guys (and the cop winning of course), and then seemed to happen every chance the director got. It got to be so excessive, I was laughing (hey, maybe it was meant to be a comedy...). \n\nNot only were the fight scenes gratuitously plentiful, silly and contrived, each scene went on and on and on - they seemed interminable. I started fast forwarding through them after a while.\n\nBy now the plot had left town, as the fight scenes were there to carry the movie, leaving the movie an empty shell.\n\nThe Raid 2 is better than the first one, but not by too much.  Plot is better, and stays decent until almost the end.  Much grittier and more plausible than the first one.  Almost Scorsese-esque in its grittiness and twistiness - reminded me of The Departed and Goodfellas.\n\nPlot wasn't perfect though - a bit jumbled in the beginning and there are moments towards the end where things don't totally add up, but the plot-holes weren't major.\n\nSo, just when you're hoping this is is going to be a serious crime-drama, unlike The Raid with its comical fight scenes, the laughable fight scenes start up again.  Sporadically at first, then gathering in frequency until the last few scenes of the movie just lurch from one outrageous fight scene to the next.  As in The Raid, each fight seems to go on forever, and the best thing one can do is fast-forward through them.\n\nSo, while for about the first half of the movie it looked like it was going to be more serious than The Raid, it ends pretty much the same as it.  It's due to being grittier for longer that The Raid 2 is better than The Raid.",

            "content": "After watching The Raid: Redemption, it would be fair to say that I flipped out. It completely blew my mind and I feel like it's going to be one of the films that maintains its specific place in my love of film a long way into the future. The way that Gareth Evans staged and shot each sequence, the way that the action just built and built and built, the way that it so deftly wove in story threads while never once sacrificing the absolute balls-out pacing completely blew me away. It was the second of a double-screen movie night with a friend and we had just caught Safe House beforehand and seeing such a predictable, Hollywood action film immediately beforehand probably made The Raid hit even harder, but there is no denying the sheer volume of carnage that The Raid delivers.\n\nComing into The Raid 2: Berandal, I wondered how Evans was going to replicate the feel of the first film, how lightning was going to strike twice and whether the limited location feeling was going to have diminishing returns the second time around. Which was my first mistake, because Evans clearly hasn't gone to Hollywood school of repetition. The Raid 2 expands so much on the previous films that it completely dwarfs the scope of not only its predecessor but most action films that find their way onto the big screen.\n\nImmediately after The Raid, Rama is on a mission to put the people responsible away for their actions. But after discovering that he has only seen the tip of the iceberg, he decides to go undercover to find the men behind them.\n\nInitially it's a bit of a struggle to get us into the actual story. The first few scenes of the film are intercut in ways which are a lot more compelling on their second viewing, but on their first it's a bit of a strain to actually realise what's going on. New characters are thrown in with little or no introduction, characters we knew are removed within the opening moments and an entire roster of bad guys are thrown at us and our main character with intricate and difficult backstories and roles within the structure of the film and the fictional structure of the crime families they inhabit. But after we get to know these characters and settle into their roles, the film is as gripping as its original and builds to some scenes which may even top those of the first. The original Raid had an incredibly streamlined, often too-streamlined, story which was really just signposts to tell the characters which way the action was supposed to go. Here, though, the story is incredibly dense, detailing a crime empire in a time of crisis, the rise of an outside contender for the crown and of course the undercover cop story which sets it all in motion. But Evans very clearly has an eye on what makes the story and its characters tick emotionally as well, as the scenes take on a more textured feel than they did in the first. During The Raid you wanted Rama to win because a) the landlord was a total dick and b) because he was such an absolute badass. Here, you just want him to come out the other side alive so he can maybe see his wife and child one more time. There's a beautiful scene which nails this idea, and it's a shrewd inclusion by Evans who realises that we need a real connection to this character if he's going to pull us through the whole film. Once again, while the dense story can make this a struggle occasionally on first viewing, seeing it again makes the film hit even harder and I'd definitely recommend watching it more than once. The resolution of the film is incredibly risky as well, and you can definitely feel the independent nature of the films coming through as it resolutely cuts ties to ongoing characters and storylines while setting up an entirely new scenario for a possible upcoming third film. One of the best things about both films is the way that Evans clearly isn't holding off on executions for the sake of franchise. They are conclusive and brutal in the way their characters are dealt with and it makes the entire experience more rewarding as a result. \n\nIko Uwais is back as our main character Rama, and it's great to see that he's able to do a hell of a job when he's given a lot more to do. In the first film he was just a rookie cop who could kick ass, and the role didn't require too much more of him than that, but here he's given a huge task in the roles he's required to play. He's undercover and constantly in a dangerous situation, but he's also a husband and a father, and a man of principle who knows that even though he's working for the wrong people, he's doing the right thing. There's a moment after a brutal fight scene in a restaurant where Rama realises the ramifications of what he's done and Uwais absolutely nails it. If there's only one more Raid film to come, I can't wait to see what else this guy can bring to the big screen in the future. Yayan Ruhian made a huge impression in the first film as the Mad Dog henchman of the big bad, and he makes an equal impression as Prakoso here, creating a character just as frenzied but twice as layered in his trio of brilliant scenes. I like that they found a way to bring him back in The Raid 2, and his presence instantly adds something fantastic to the film. The two big new players here are Bangun and Uco, the King and the Prince of the Indonesian crime empire, and they both bring fantastic new energies to the film. Tio Pakusodewo plays Bangun, the patriarch of the crime family, and he imbues him with the world-weary quality of a man who has been doing this too long, and he has a gravitas which suits his position and gives the film's world a realistic quality to ground the more fantastic elements. Arifin Putra is a real find after watching the film, and his frustrated, selfish, entitled Uco is a horrible, fascinating character. He's a child with a private army and one of the more unnerving things about him is the fact that he has so much power in combination with such little common sense and so much ego. Putra is entirely committed to the role, and one scene involving a karaoke bar and a pair of prostitutes is particularly horrifying thanks to his performance. He and Uwais make a great pairing for the film, and the way these two very different men behave is a constant source of intrigue throughout.\n\nBut really, the star of the film is Gareth Evans, as he was with the first. The style and ingenuity that Evans brings behind the camera is mindblowing, and the way that he attacks every scene like it's the last one he'll ever shoot is incredible. There is always a new angle, there's always something new to try out, always another way to push the limits even further. There are familiar elements within the story, a car chase in particular which is a mainstay of the action genre. But the electricity Evans hits them with makes it feel like you're watching something completely revolutionary, and really, you kind of are. There are moments where I legitimately could not put together in my mind how they made the shots happen, and of course there's the fact that Evans and his fight choreographers have invented seat-belt-fu. It's an absolute tour-de-force of direction and I can't imagine the kind of world-shattering event Evans would be able to create with the budget backing of an Avengers film for instance.\n\nBut maybe it's the distance from the studios that has made The Raid's two films exactly what they are. Without having to satisfy producer's notes or answer to a higher power has allowed Evans and his team to spread a huge canvas and on it they have painted an intricate, intelligent story which at once challenges and thrills, as well as completely demolishing the playing field setup by the bigger budget action players. The Raid 2 is a mammoth achievement and despite its flaws it creates an incredible experience for its viewers to undertake. If there is a third, can it get here soon please?\n\nDefining Scene:\nIt's between Koso's nightclub brawl and the karaoke sequence, but I think the nightclub takes it by a badly broken nose.",

            "content": "Carnage blows off its steam. Here's my take on THE RAID 2: BERANDAL.\n\nOnce there was a little film called \"The Raid\" which promised grit and no-nonsense violence. Most of the scenes were set in the interiors of an almost abandoned apartment building in Indonesia. And boy, never did I abandon any single shot.\n\nNow, it's a larger savage arena set for its sequel- \"THE RAID 2: BERANDAL\". By picking up the story two hours after the first film, Welsh film maker Gareth Evans expands the world of crime and corruption through a definitive look at predator and prey chase cycle.\n\nWith its flair for pencak silat and camera motion, the fight scenes look grand and effortless. The actors led by Iko Uwais make every blood bath bearable with every skilled punch and twist of their hands.\n\nWhile it consumes time to expound a bigger story, the meshed world has made sense through revelatory acts- with the conflict between gangs and generations adding its flavor. I like how the editing style achieves the gripping effect of its simultaneous fight scenes. As a result, it leaves me wanting more.\n\nOne thing that I wish Viva Entertainment Corporation (the film's local distributor) has done is putting English subtitles instead of dubbing it. The message and pure intention will still be sent across to its viewers in spite of its foreign language.\n\nThe reality of the underworld blends well with the cockiness of Indonesian martial arts. True enough, this is my kind of a substantial action film.\n\nHammer and baseball bat. The field of graves. Knives and guns. 4.5/5 folks!",

            "content": "On the heels of \"The Raid: Redemption\" comes the aptly named \"The Raid 2,\" which is a sequel only in that it features the same main character and the same style of gritty, in-your-face (and then some) martial arts action.  Writer/director Gareth Evans, who made both films, wisely takes his story in a far different direction, perhaps knowing that it would've been a cheat to cover the exact same ground and produce a replica of the first movie (a la \"The Hangover Part 2\").  It's a gamble that pays off, even if there technically isn't an actual raid in the sequel.\n \nIt also seems that, with the sequel, Evans took the opportunity to address some of the criticism of his first movie.  While \"The Raid: Redemption\" was about as simple and straight-forward as you can get, \"The Raid 2\" is a far more complex piece of work.  The former told the story of a police raid on a drug dealer-owned tenement building; the cops clashed with the crooks for an hour and 40 minutes, and that was about it.  It was an exercise in pure, unadulterated adrenaline, an action movie in the most basic sense of the word.  The latter, on the other hand, is a sprawling crime drama with echoes of such films as \"Eastern Promises,\" \"The Departed\"-and therefore \"Infernal Affairs,\" the film that inspired the Scorsese movie-and \"Donnie Brasco,\" just to name a couple.  There is far more emphasis on character and plot this time around.\n \nDon't get me wrong; when the action occurs, it strikes with just as much visceral ferocity as the first movie; but whereas \"The Raid: Redemption\" was, at its core, a collection of fantastic action sequences strung together by the barest of bare-bones plot, its follow-up tells a much more complex story, punctuated by elements of tragedy as well as bone-crunching fisticuffs.\n \nThe film picks up immediately where its predecessor ends.  Rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais) is one of the few survivors of the brutal raid on the drug dealer's tenement building.  Almost immediately upon his exit, he's swept up by a shadowy police unit and offered a job going undercover.  His superiors want him to infiltrate the organization of Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo), the most powerful gangster in Jakarta; the ultimate goal is to take down not only the criminals, but also the corrupt cops that are in bed with them.  (It was these high-ranking police officials that were instrumental in constructing the raid in the previous film.)  In order to accomplish this, Rama is first given a new identity as \"Yuda,\" a career criminal, and thrown in jail in order to get close to the gangster's imprisoned son, an arrogant, hot-tempered young man named Uco (Arifin Putra).\n \nThe funny thing is that the prison sequence is only the tip of the iceberg.  Unlike the previous movie, which pretty much took place entirely in the tenement building, \"The Raid 2\" spreads its action throughout numerous locales in Jakarta.  There is a savage prison riot, yes, in which Rama earns Uco's trust by saving his life from a rival gang, but from there, the movie's just getting started.  Uco recruits Rama into his father's criminal empire, and it's there that things begin to get really paranoid and chaotic, especially with the emergence of Bejo (Alex Abbad), a young criminal who has his sights set on becoming the new dominant crime lord of the city.\n \nAlready this is far more complicated than the first movie, and that's only a brief snippet of the plot, which becomes more layered and labyrinthine as the movies goes on.  Even so, the movie is still easy enough to follow, and there are more than enough action sequences to keep the genre fans satiated.  This time around, there are just longer scenes of respite between the martial arts set-pieces.  And not surprisingly, the set-pieces are breath-taking; Rama is as proficient a fighter as ever, using his hands as well as any available object in the environment as a deadly weapon.  As always with this genre though, you just need to overlook the trope that the bad guys attack the good guy one at a time rather than ganging up on him.  You just have to accept this and move on.\n \nIs \"The Raid 2\" better than the first movie?  Yes and no.  It's certainly a far richer film than the original, and I'll never complain about increases in plot and character development.  It's probably safe to say that it's a more satisfying film-going experience (speaking in general terms) as this one touches on far more emotions than simple exhilaration.  There are some genuinely touching sequences in this movie as, predictable as it may be, Rama begins to develop feelings for Uco and Bangun.  It's a bit of a clich√©, but the characters earn these moments.\n \nBut there's definitely also something to be said for the original's simple, straight-forward approach.  And given its no-frills mentality, the film logically zipped along at a brisk pace.  The sequel is almost an hour longer, and as riveting as its action sequences are, I couldn't help thinking that some of the film could have been trimmed.  At times, I got the sense that Evans may have bit off more than he could chew, particularly with one character's death early in the film.  It's meant to have a meaningful impact, and initially it does, but it seems to have been forgotten by the movie's end, and it's never really given any sort of closure.\n \nSuffice it to say, neither film is perfect.  But even so, they make for a highly compelling and kinetic story, and it's an interesting case in which two films in a series are very alike yet also very different.  And, perhaps even more surprisingly, they're both highly successful and entertaining films.  Going back to the \"Hangover\" franchise, I suspect this is what Todd Phillips and company attempted to do with \"Part III,\" but couldn't pull it off.  It's a tricky feat, to be sure, but Evans accomplished it.   \n \nAnd supposedly there's a third entry in development.  I don't know where they're going to go from here, but it seems that poor Rama just can't catch a break.  And, thus far at least, the action movie genre is better off for it.",

            "content": "Well, that was unpleasant. Wait, let me take that back. It wasn't COMPLETELY unpleasant. There were many good points. They just couldn't make up for the parts that were not. The camera work is good, the production values are quite high, and the action choreography was EXCEPTIONAL in every way. But let's be honest, when making an action film in general you have to at least attempt those items as a bare minimum. When making a sequel to The Raid, you had better darn well be amazing. Granted, this movie excelled in those areas, but let us return to my initial statement.\n\nThis movie was hard to watch. Let's begin with the least offensive matter, the dubbing. When you translate a film for a foreign audience there are a few items you should have on your checklist. Does the dubbing sound like it is happening in the same space as the character and is blended well instead of laying on top of the sound track like a dead elephant? OK, so The Raid 2 missed that one. Are the voice actors even TRYING to sound like they are feeling the emotions of the characters? Missed that one, too, huh? Did you bother trying to find more than one voice actor to overdub every single person in the movie? No? Just got some hobo from the parking lot to sleepwalk through every male character's dialogue? Good enough. Ship it.\n\nItem Number Two: The story. It makes little sense and the characters are nearly all idiots to a one. Characters and motivations are so thin I could have used them as tracing paper. It feels as though, in spite of the film's two and a half hour run time, that another hours' worth of story was hacked out with a dull axe. I understand that plot and characters typically take a back seat to the action and the emotion of the moment in these movies, but it can, and has, been done far better. In The Raid 2 plot threads and characters show up without explanation or seeming connection to ANYTHING merely to facilitate introducing new victims and locations for the next increasingly violent fight. Which brings me to my final point.\n\nThe violence. More specifically, the gore. OK, this is a martial arts film. There's gonna be a few fights. They need to feel real and they need to look good. This movie's got that in spades. Every punch, every kick, every action taken by these incredibly talented and hardworking people has impact, weight, the fights are amazing...EXCEPT. They go WAY too far in the gore department. You've heard of the term \"Torture Porn?\" This is \"Gore Porn.\"\n\nIn the first Raid film there was gore, but it seemed to come as a result of the situation and not the other way around. Here it seems as though the fights were designed around how to best present the most disgusting visuals. Now, I have long been a proponent of showing the consequences of violence in movies. Dumbing down shootouts in American action films to where a gunshot is no more inconvenient than a puff of smoke coming from a bullet wound, just to get a PG-13 rating, is insulting and it removes all impact of the action and therefore removes all stakes from the story on a sub-conscious level. When violence occurs the audience needs to feel like there is actual weight to the decision to harm another human being. But here? The movie practically revels in the opportunity to horribly torture, maim, dismember, burn, and gut every single person in a fifteen mile radius. When a man holds someone's head on a hibachi until his face peels off on the cook surface, and then the camera lingers on the oozing results, you have to ask what the rationale was other than being shocking or disgusting enough to evoke a reaction the script and the actors seem incapable of getting otherwise. In another scene our hero smashes an assassin so hard in the mouth with a baseball bat that the bat stays imbedded in his shattered, mushy, and dripping skull as his body goes limp.\n\nIn short, if you want an amazing martial arts movie with mind blowing fight scenes, and realistic violence and gore based around a decent story, watch the original Raid. If you want Kung-Fu \"Gore Porn\" (pencak silat, actually) where a woman shreds ten guys to pulled pork with a pair of claw hammers, watch the sequel. Just don't watch it while you eat. Or before. Or after.\n\nAs a side note, I was constantly confused by the random appearance of firearms. If access to guns is so easy, then why do all of the thugs use clubs and knives? I know this is a martial arts movie and a gun would end the film pretty darn quick, but at least in the first Raid there was a REASON guns fell out of use after the first act. when outfitting your baddies for a gang war you might want to head over to the local black market gun shop, guys. The machetes don't seem to be cutting it.",

            "content": "Following on straight after the events of the first movie we are back alongside Rama as he is once again lured into another mission, or should that be used in another mission. The last three members to survive the tower block raid are seen here together again, albeit briefly, as Rama is now wanted for an undercover job. Expect betrayal, blood, broken bones and a whole load of very similar looking characters.\n\nRight away this is the problem with this sequel, the plot, its meh. The whole reason why the first movie was so explosive was the excellent story. A special team of elite cops enter a tower block in the slums of Jakarta to bring down a crime lord. They start at the bottom and must work their way up floor by floor taking out scum, the whole premise was solid, tight, tense and claustrophobic, the perfect storm. This sequel sees Rama going undercover to expose a corrupt police official (Reza) who is tied in with criminal gangs, this means getting friendly with a crime bosses son (Uco) in jail and working for the enemy (Uco's father Bangun). \n\nThings get complicated when another crime Boss Bejo, obviously wanting power and control, teams up with Bangun's son to try and start a war against a rival Japanese crime syndicate, this act being against Bangun's will. The only reason for this mainly being Uco wants to show his father how strong and dependable he his, to prove himself. The other reason being Bejo thinks the Japanese are trying to sway Reza against the Bangun syndicate. Jesus I had to think about that just writing it! and this is the problem, the plot is really convoluted in my opinion with characters coming out of the woodwork. I've not even mentioned the betrayal twists involving gangs killing their own and then faking reprisals to kick start this war, not to mention corrupt police gangs  and undercover cop twists on top!\n\nI genuinely had some trouble following what was going on from scene to scene, so many characters all kinda looking the same whilst scenes popped up outta nowhere with little reasoning (Prakoso the assassin I'm looking at you). Its only later on down the line I realised what that previous scene had been about and why, I had to rewatch scenes and read up on sections. It is good that the continuity is there from the start, they had the same two actors from the last movie briefly and it all smoothly crosses into this story which was cool. Alas at no point did I ever really feel the same adrenaline shot that I did for the first film, this could of been any action movie, its a generic plot that's been done before many times and I was actually bored periodically.\n\nOf course the movie is all about the fights, this is the movies forte, its reason for being. Does that disappoint? errr...kinda, in all honesty it did in places yes, let me explain. There didn't actually seem to be as many fights in this film, probably because its not set in a confined space, what there was became so outrageous and so long I again found myself getting bored. Yes the first movie had awesome fights that were ridiculous and long but this movie does seem to go that little bit further. You still have tonnes of faceless henchmen getting their asses handed to them on a plate which is standard procedure and fun. But the boss fights almost become a parody and just go on and on and on, the main fight towards the end in the kitchen especially. I realise that's because both characters are highly trained fighters in their art but you get dizzy watching this shit, the director just doesn't know when to stop, less is more guy! \n\nThe blood and violence is sky high I might add it really is, non-stop bloodbath of epic proportions. Yet again I have to say its too much, less is more, there comes a point when the blood and gore is so extravagant that it loses all impetus, it becomes dull and non-engaging. I really found myself yearning for some good old fashioned fisticuffs that didn't involve various weapons that naturally result in gallons of claret everywhere, and I really disliked the assassins with their specific weapons. Seriously Evans are you trying to be the Asian Robert Rodriguez here? well don't, it ain't a good move. Don't any criminal gangs use guns in this world? would be easier.\n\nWe all know what this movie offers, you know what to expect and it certainly delivers on that. I can't complain about the violence because the movie is all about pure violence...and a traditional practice involving mental, physical and spiritual development but anyway. My main issue is the fact it just feels like a run of the mill action fest that offers nothing new (accept another look at a newish martial art). The first movie worked really well because of the cracking story, setting and close quarters action, this has none of that, its just a gangster flick with lots of stereotypical stuff in it. Hell even the car chase looked crap, you can clearly see the cars are going quite slow with high speed sound effects dubbed on top. Yes it looks good, yes the fights are impressive when not drenched in blood and yes its a solid achievement for an Indonesian production...but it lacks the quality of its predecessor and just left me numb and weary.",

Starting almost immediately after The Raid ended, Rama (Iko Uwais) is put before Jakarta's anti-corruption task force chief Bunawar (Cok Simbara), who asks Rama to join a secret anti-corruption task force to expose police corruption involving Police commissioner Reza (Roy Marten) and his dealings with self-made gangster Bejo (Alex Abbad) and Jakarta crime lord Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo). To get close to Bangun and Bejo, Rama goes to jail, and there he befriends Uco (Arifin Putra), Bangun's son. When they're released, Uco invites Rama into the inner-circle of his father's crime syndicate, and soon Rama finds himself taking on the whole mob.

The choreography is less creative and spectacular, but more interesting to me (rather than the repetitive fighting style of the first film) due to the stand-out supporting cast, especially the \"Hammer Girl\". Still, the film overcomplicated itself by a \"sophisticated\" plot full of twist-and-turn - way too sophisticated for a pure action film (\"SPL\" did a much better job with a more focused and intense story). The film was also over-cast - too many potential characters (Ryuhei Matsuda's \"the Japanese\", Yayan Ruhian's Prakoso) yet too little time for them to shine (despite the 140-plus-minute length of the film, quite long for a pure action film).

This is probably due to the fact that the primary  focus of the movie is set up on the action scenes ,that are the main element of the movie.Still, the story is sustainable enough to get us through without complaining because of the awesome realization,great pace , amazing action sequences and stylish characters.The Raid 2 is a great action show case and  is indeed memorable. for its action.If they should be one reason for you to see it,this is it:the action.You won't find better than that.\n\nThe raid two is recommended for all action fan and is definitely not for the fainthearted.Enjoy!",

It's a recycling program for stories, a short configuration, and very hard to follow. But the bottom line, on these terms, is that the story simply doesn't matter. It was just filler filler awesome filler filler awesome. That's the entire pattern of the movie. It didn't have to make sense. The fight scenes were so intensely brutal and riveting, you were just tapping your foot waiting for the next fight scene and the wait can almost dilute your attention span. But it's so worth the wait at the end, although I won't argue that the film should've been better edited and tighter. It did fail in trying to be complex, but I didn't care. It was like an action pornography and I love it for that. Also I much prefer the gun fu to the kung fu. More is more with the hand-to-hand combat. Also liked who I call Batman, MC Hammer, and Captain Hook. Easy for me to remember out of the dozens of characters in this movie. In all seriousness though, this kid, Rhama, should be the next Jackie Chan. He's a fighting machine. Epic pressure cooker of violence, and it only ramps up as the movie goes on.

He goes to prison and befriend one of the crime bosses sons Uco (Arifin Putra). Before long Rama starts climbing the ranks and gets to the bottom of the conspiracies started in the first film. The movie has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen on film. Some fights go on and on and its a credit to the choreography.

In The Raid 2, the Everton* supporter hits the back of the net again, and proves he's capable of more than just well shot action. All I can say is, I can't wait for his hat-trick! Just keep 'em coming Gareth, because you're my shining light, my new John Woo!\n\nRaid 2's story starts shortly after where the first movie ended, and quickly dives into a much more involved plot. We've got mob family issues, a secret police force hunting corrupt cops, and a third-party trying to start a war. At first it takes you by surprise, especially if you're expecting more of the same straight forward action delivered in the first film. But the story grows on you, and there's a lot more at stake in this sequel.\n\nMatt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono, who photographed the first film, certainly seem to have enjoyed the increased budget, broader story and more expansive locations. Because this is a really slick-looking film. And while it's much longer than the first film to incorporate the more involved story, there's still the same great action, and as the movie builds to a conclusion, the set pieces become more and more elaborate, violent and exciting.\n\nWhat can I say, I'm now a big fan of Gareth Evans' work. He's a Jack of many trades, and master of them too. He writes, directs and edits, and has a really keen eye for action and how to present it to the audience. The Raid: Redemption was the best action film I'd seen in years, until The Raid 2 that is!\n\n* Everton Football Club, England.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you saw The Raid: Redemption, and expected more of the same from the sequel, get ready to be disappointed! This is much more plot driven, and is 49 minutes longer. Expect more dialog, and a more layered plot. It does have just as much great action as the first film, but it's more spread out, an it takes a while to get to the all action finale. This movie is rated R because, well, it's incredibly violent!\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis film looks amazing, and will work best on a theater sized screen. At home, a HD viewing on a huge TV is the way to go. Watching this on anything portable would be silly!\n\nBest Moment:\n\nI first thought the set piece involving all the martial arts action along with a car chase couldn't be topped. But then I saw Cecep Arif Rahman and Iko Uwais fight in the kitchen, and I changed my mind!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/the-raid-2-2014/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

This film is watched for one reason: The legendary fights. Gone are the days where the bad guys take turns fighting one by one in favor of a full blown brawl. The fights are realistic, the hits are brutal, the takedowns go from \"Oh!\" to \"S#!@\". It truly is a brutal spectacle. I watched the dubbed version, which was thankfully dubber a heck of a lot better than the first, which made it more manageable. But, like I said, the story does drag a little bit.

Much better stylistically and narratively than the first film, Evans cranks up the throttle on the action from the very outset of the film and rarely lets up.  For two and a half hours this film redlines and doesn't give its audience a release from the tension and pressure the film provides.  As a viewer you are wiped out when this film ends.  The film is visually magnificent and Evans work with his cinematographers Matt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono is immersive.  They successfully make the viewer feel as if they are in the room as Rama (Iko Uwais) kicks ass.  Evans also edits the film with help from Andi Novianto and what they do here is great work as well.  The staging and choreography of the fight scenes are so well done that the camera seamlessly captures everything.  The only major issue I have with the film revolves around a single plot point, the killing of Rama's brother.  A major character in the first film, Andi (Donny Alamsyah) is killed early on and the entire thing is glossed over.  It weakens the entire narrative.  Couldn't they have made it a major part of the narrative and wouldn't it have driven the film further?  I just didn't care for this choice.  Other than that, this film is so damn good.  Please take the time to watch it and please, American studios, do not remake this into an American version and ruin it.  Thanks!",

That being said, the story presented here of warring gangs leaves Rama out of the picture for large portions of the middle of the film and relegating him to supporting star status. I like almost everything about this movie but I think a tighter focus on Rama and his role in this larger drama would have made this a tighter, more focused, and ultimately even more satisfying film.",

Almost unbearable for non martial arts or action lovers, this high-energy action delivers more of what made Redemption a cult movie within its sub-genre.\n\nOnce again the story follows the young and dedicated police officer Rama (Iko Uwais) whose past from the initial raid of the infamous mob building is still endangering his life and the life of his family. Challenged to go undercover and to capture the highest ranks of the Indonesian mob, Rama has to go through another, much longer hell.  Facing a task that is more complicated more demanding and with slim chances for survival, he has to climb the underworld ladder amidst a mob war. This is probably the most important improvement of Gareth Evans' sequel. If the first movie was claustrophobic martial arts mayhem, The Raid 2 is actually a successful attempt to build up a credible, dark and engaging story. This could be considered a major step in making the movie a more accessible delivery for the non-martial arts/action movie fans. In addition to this, Evans keeps Rama's character simple and the fighting sequences brutally minimalistic. Add up the rock solid and focused performance of Iko Uwais (whom I would be pleased to see in a Hollywood production) and The Raid 2 could be considered to at least match the level of its predecessor. \n\nIf there is one flaw in The Raid 2, this would be the fact that the \"originality\" element. The first movie benefitted from a terrific concept and the obvious move towards a more conventional story has its minor negative effect. However, this was a logical move and made the sequel as interesting and captivating as the original delivery. \n\nIn conclusion, The Raid 2 provides what it promises: more of the same. The fans of the sub-genre would be absolutely delighted with it while neutral movie-goers would probably find a way to go through the 148 minutes of fighting mayhem due to the simple and engaging story!",

And without the tension of the first movie's claustrophobia, a lot of the fights are just lots of random people getting beat up in big open boring environments - the sort of anonymously flavored martial arts hijinks that populate the less inspired movies in the genre. Many of the side characters are laughably cartoony (the bat and hammer duo in particular), which'd be fine if it weren't for the movie's lofty dramatic ambitions otherwise. I much prefer the austerity of Redemption's characterization.\n\nA lot of the smaller fights are super badass, of course; despite it overstaying its welcome, the kitchen knife showdown was a treat, escalating ceaselessly for minutes on end, very intense physicality, nice.

However, without the tight confines of the Raid's building, the sequel doesn't really have anything holding it together and keeping it from going out of bounds aesthetically. To keep things interesting, perhaps, the film introduces a bunch of flimsy video-game boss type enemies with unique weapons and traits. These characters all work for one of three feuding criminal factions, and it's the story of this gang war that really sits at the heart of the film. \n\nThe father-son dynamic driving that conflict is good, and it would have made a good film. But the film still wants us to feel like Rama is the protagonist, even though he is thrown into the situation on a flimsy pretext without clear motivations. Even that could have been a neat narrative tactic, but ultimately the structure falls apart because it so often feels like the crime feud only exists to set up the extended fight sequences, as Rama fights his way through a series of quirky martial artists who work for one or another of them to get to the top, just because that's how these movies go. \n\nBut while it isn't as tight and subtle as The Raid: Redemption, it's plenty more ambitious, and it's totally gorgeous to look at. The unique color schemes and staging go a long way towards selling the paper-thin enemies Rama fights - the subway fight, the baseball fight in the big warehouse, the nightclub, and especially the mud prison riot are awesome and memorable. It doesn't hang together as a film as well as the first one, but there's still plenty here to enjoy; maybe even more, if I'm honest.",

I liked the way that the storyline continues from the first movie and the new characters were a great addition to the franchise. After watching the bonus material on the DVD, I was astonished to see that this epic movie was made by an English guy. I just hope that he doesn't sell out and start going all Hollywood. Anyway, I don't think that you will ever see action like this in your lifetime and it really does put people like Jackie Chan and Jet Li to shame. A Great Watch!\n\nRound-Up:\nI'm really surprised that this movie didn't make more money because they should have got more money from the Asian audiences. Maybe they didn't like the fact that it wasn't made by an oriental director. Anyway, if you have seen the the movie in this franchise, the main character goes undercover to take down the corrupt cops and crime bosses. After spending 2 years in jail to try and get close to a crime bosses son, he ends up working for the mafia. From there the storyline gets manic because there is internal corruption which he gets involved in. Although the movie is nearly 2 and a half hours long, there is enough action and drama to keep you entertained.√Ç¬†\n\nBudget: $4.5million\nWorldwide Gross: $6.3million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic action movies about a cop who goes undercover to take down corrupt cops and mafia bosses. 8/10",

            "content": "\"THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER...\" \n\n- 'The Raid 2' is the 2014 sequel to the martial arts crime action film 'The Raid: Redemption' from 2011. The movie was written and directed by Gareth Evans (The Raid Redemption, VHS 2). Iko Uwais reprises the role of rookie agent Rama. The film continues where the first had ended. I must confess I felt the first half was a bit long-stretched, and in comparison to the first film you will need to pay close attention. But again, all action scenes are truly amazing: the brutal fights (especially in the second half) will make your jaw drop! I really like this franchise. This is the perfect example of what a true action film should be like!\n\nAfter the events of the previous film, rookie agent Rama (Uwais) and his fellow survivor Bowo deliver betrayer  Wahyu to Bunawar, the chief of Jakarta's anti-corruption task force. There Rama is asked to join the team and agrees to a dangerous undercover mission to take down Jakarta's gangs. Our hero says goodbye to his wife and kid and is put in jail, where he must get close to Uco, son of gang leader Bengun. After saving his life during a prison riot, Rama (who calls himself Yuda) becomes friends with Uco. After two years of imprisonment, he gets free and is asked by Uco's father to become part of the gang. \n\nNow fully infiltrated, Rama learns that Uco has made a pact with Bejo, leader of the Goto gang, to start a gang war. Doing so Uco could prove himself to his father while Bejo benefits from the chaos. To stir things up, Bejo's sends out 'the assassin', hammer-girl and baseball bat man to kill some important businessmen. When things go horribly wrong, Rama seems to be the only one who could provide a solution. But can he handle a whole army of thugs, trained assassins and merciless gang leaders?",

In gang movie terms it's nothing particularly new; ageing bosses, upstart footsoldiers, precocious sons and corrupt cops abound. \n\nThe Raid 2's success is in successfully mixing the plot with the hyper-real, ultraviolent action scenes of the first film. And there's no shortage of sequences that'll have you sucking air over your gums like a plumber giving an unwelcome quote. And just to add extra spice, Evans throws in some comic-book-esque characters, from a machete-wielding enforcer masquerading as a tramp to a deaf female assassin who uses hammers in ways that would give Oldboy nightmares.",

There was no story in it, but a game style of presentation which focused mainly on stunts and I had seen better than that. For a sequel to that, I mean this movie was no chance to complain about in any level. The story, stunts, performances, direction all were top notch and easily can surpass to grab the title for 'this year's best martial art/stunt movie'. I had no expectations before a watch and after a watch got so excited for having it.\n\nAfter completing somewhat a successful rescue mission that took place in a tenement run by a ruthless gangster, now Rama is assigned to a new undercover operation. Temporarily says goodbye to his regular life and to his wife. To get in a position it takes months of hard work and he successfully makes into one of the members of the gang that he's after. Soon the ideas vary like to initiate new techniques to rule the underworld makes crack within the mob family. So the clash happens randomly to take over the top position from one another. In between the cop's role and the final stand brings the result to this story with plenty of awesome stunt sequences.\n\n     Worth to spend our time for this 150 minute long movie, especially if you are the greatest fan of the mixed martial arts then you got a solid reason to go for this. For every 10-15 minutes there is one stunt sequence, all I can say is it was very well patterned in a decent story. Yes, the story was not a brand new, it was what we have already seen many times in the Japanese Yakuza, Hollywood, European et cetera undercover cop stories. But to see the new cast from the new region of the earth's surface it was fantastic. I have not seen many Indonesian movies, so probably this could be the best movies from there to the international standards. This country should take cues from this movie to make consistent from now on like what Tony Jaa's movies did for Thai movies. \n\n''We may be after the same thing...\n...But I'm not going to follow the path as you to get there.''\n\n     Regarding the undercover cop theme, the lead character Rama was not the superior, but individually, many characters had produced incredible equality by exhibiting breathtaking stunt skills. Truly to say Rama vanishes in between all these guys. He's used only for the opening and the end portions, that's it. So that means this movie is beyond his presence that will definitely surprise the viewers. The gore was very strong, focused too deep details like ripping skin, breaking bones, smashing heads, hammering. Definitely there is going to be another sequel and my expectations rose high for that. There should be no 'I missed it' or 'not seen yet' in the mouths of movie fanatics because it is a must see.",

Now I love the first movie, but if wasn't the type of film that I thought demanded a sequel.  Nevertheless, I was happy to hear about this and went out of my way to see it.  The fighting and action in The Raid 2 are all masterfully choreographed.  You fully experience every bone that gets emphatically snapped and every haymaker punch landed, and you feel it right in the pit of your stomach; I lost count of how many times I cried out \"oh shit!\" while watching this.  It is also extremely well shot, so you get to fully appreciate all of the hard work that these martial artists put into this.  Now I also want to touch upon the difference between this and the first one: more focus on the story, which is not something I necessarily agree with.  The first one gave you everything you needed to know in the first ten minutes, and then threw you into the relentless action without giving you any chance whatsoever to catch your breath.  This gives you a lot more depth to the story, breaking it up into set pieces instead of one mostly continuous action scene, but at the expense of your time.  A full 150 minutes is really pushing it for an action movie of this ilk, and I felt myself getting restless at a couple of spots.  I prefer the first one to this for that reason alone, but still, if you want to see some truly impressive fighting sequences that aren't afraid to get gruesome, you needn't look any further.",

It's law enforcement. It's taking down the underworld. Not mortal combat. Take a gun and shoot for crying out loud.

            "content": "The Raid 2 is a daring action achievement and terrific entertainment! \n\nMost of the time, sequels never seem to reach the heights of the original. Not only did this do The Raid: Redemption justice, it did it with much more style and flair than I expected. Iko Uwais cements himself as one of the best martial arts actors around today and I'm definitely a fan. \n\nRama (Iko Uwais) barely escaped with his life after the events of The Raid: Redemption. The criminal element and corrupt cops he battled in the original strike back hard by going after his family as payback. It becomes painfully clear to Rama that he and his family will never be really be safe until he eliminates the upper upper echelon of the crime syndicate that now wants him dead. To do this, he must infiltrate their ranks by befriending the son of a king pin (Uco played by Arifin Putra) and gain his trust before exacting his revenge.\n\nThe story is a bit more ambitious this time around, but is not overly complicated. All of the elements of the original are once again on display. The choreography is again, excellent; the fight choreography of The Raid: Redemption and this sequel are the best I've seen since the IP Man movies. The soundtrack is pulsating and sets the tone well for the action scenes very well. For a 2.5 hour long movie (I was shocked when I saw it was this long at the start), this was very well paced. At no point did it lull or meander and there was enough of story to keep me intrigued. I also enjoyed that the dialogue wasn't horrible (unfortunately that isn't always the case with many action movies) and wasn't over the top. \n\nIko Uwais (The Raid, The Man from Tai Chi) is once again Rama. He's clearly a really talented martial artist and proves that the original was not a fluke. Unlike most action stars, he actually has a strong on screen presence and is also able to carry an emotionally subtle scene. But what I love about this sequel the most is is how creative and memorable the villains are. I loved Alex Abbad's performance as Bejo! He's the kind of memorable villain you've seen before, but with a few tweaks that make him seem fresh and new. He steals just about every scene he's in and takes this movie to another level in my opinion. Julie Estelle and Very Tri Yulisman (unknown actors to me) shine in some fairly unique action scenes (let's just say they are very creative with a few hammers and a baseball bat). \n\nLike the original, the action is non-stop and looks very believable. There are no clearly visible phantom punches or anything that looks staged. It definitely looks like these guys are actually beating the bleep out of each other! I couldn't have been more entertained. Honestly, the fights so thrilling at times I couldn't help but spontaneously applaud and were so gruesome at times I couldn't help but laugh. If you went into this for action, they made sure you were not going away disappointed; believe me when I say that. \n\nThis movie oozes cool. Whether it's the brazen subway battle, the amazingly shot prison yard fight (especially the lead up to it which featured some great camera-work) or the impressive car chases (which reminded of The Matrix: Reloaded a little) there's a lot to love. They were all filmed with such style and flair that I was reminded of Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies; kudos to the director Gareth Evans. Evans doesn't over do it with the the artsy slow motion or scene staging, it's just enough to keep it from being cheesy or over used. I will definitely be looking for more of his work (more on that to come). \n\nIt's not all perfect however. The drawback of this sequel is that in it's attempt to be be more daring, it does succumb to some of the usual genre pitfalls. The bad guys never seem to have the guns when they really need them (this was brutally obvious a few times) and at times the bad guys attack one at a time, one after the other, etc. When they do have the guns, they seem to miss a lot of point blank shots. But hey, it's an action movie, so none of that is surprising really. But one thing I just couldn't look past was the return of a character who died in the original. I get making that move in different film series, but to bring back a character that already died in the same series without any attempt to alter the character? That's a no go, at least for the sake of continuity. Apparently this is a common thing in Asian cinema, but it's something that's hard to look past as it was a prominent character from the original. Having said that, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film, not for a second. \n\nThe Raid: Redemption and The Raid 2 are setting a new standard for martial arts films. If you're an action film aficionado, be sure to watch this, you won't regret it. There is already a rumored The Raid 3 that will star Tony Jaa along with Iko Uwais. Um, where do pre-order my tickets? As for as I'm concerned, The Raid 3 can't come soon enough!",

It's a bit convoluted and a tad vague on characters introduced but I feel this might be intentional on director Gareth Evans part. He says he wants the 3rd and final film of the trilogy to start 3 hours before this ends and I feel he might be filling in some of the blanks with this (well at least I hope).\n\nI personally think it's the equal of the first film and applaud Evans ambition. Rather than peddle out a pale re-run like say Die Hard 2, Evans has subscribed to the Christopher Nolan play book of how to make sequels and taken his first film somewhere entirely different with it's follow up. It's more epic, more explosive and yes nearly an hour longer than the first film but for me the running time is not a problem and it flew by. As long as you don't go in expecting more of the same you'll have a blast, as with the first film a strong stomach is recommended as this is incredibly violent and gory somewhat more so than the original.\n\nIko Uwais as our hero Rama is developing into a real star and shows a level of charisma not seen so much in The Raid, he also again delivers with some of the most incredible fight sequences ever put on screen, a muddy prison brawl, a car chase with a punch up going on at the same time and one of the goriest and visceral fight sequences in a kitchen I've ever seen. Yes at it's length it's spaced out with dialogue sequences and maybe Evans isn't as good a storyteller as an action director but this puts to shame all Hollywood action thrillers of the last 20 years, it's the real deal and worth your attention.",

Like the porn studio (the topless female and the shadow sex), and the homeless assassin played by Yayan (even though the symbolism of the snow scene was beautiful).

All we care about is the martial arts itself. What makes this movie so good is that the action felt real, and it was with a little CG (blood, guns, etc.). The actors are actually hitting each other with natural high speed, but they were trained to hit light so they wouldn't hurt their opponent(s).   \nTherefore Raid 2 is a must see action movie.

            "content": "The Raid 2 \nThis film is literally an ultra-violent undercover cop actioner that stands alone as a clever display of martial artistry at its flat out best.  It's a solid compliment to its predecessor Raid: Redemption however the choreography in the first installation still edges Raid 2 out by a slight margin. Continuity wise The Raid 2 continues exactly where Raid: Redemption concluded. Easily this movie has a strong international cult following for a martial arts spaghetti film fundamentally built on smash mouth action, incredible stunts and brilliant camera work. Raid 2 gratuitously gives the feel of the 70's and 80's martial art flicks by the Shaw Brothers-the grainy presentation, obscene amounts of blood, guts and the extreme breaking of limbs. \nRaid 2 felt like a seamless continuation of a larger saga that was separated into logical segments in order for the audience to digest every fight scene. The main character tries to give a dramatic performance but the camera angles, ill-timed music and the awkward pauses just show mixed emotions. He doesn't emphasize if he is emotionally exhausted, angry, powerless, desperate or numb to the corruption he has witnessed. There are certain acts where he does voice his feelings but the timing makes his acting feel strained.\nThere are glimpses in the jail bathroom scene when the main character nicely stifles the camera with his facial expressions and anticipation of survival. But I guess since he survived impossible odds in the first installation, he seems nearly invincible in this film. Of course, the main character does get thrown several beatings throughout the film but you don't fear for his life. One major flaw is the main character supposedly assaults a rival gangs son and instantly he's accepted into this multi-million dollar generationally governed crime syndicate without digging deep into his background.  The main character is not tested, initiated, or investigated by the family and he has full access into every facet of crime business that the family owns. \nThe villain fails at an attempt to establish a hierarchy by dogmatically telling the main character about his worthless position in the pecking order. Basically, it was a wasted scene of misdirected childish anger and it just wasn't believable. However, there are several scenes where this movie soars into the stratosphere with perfectly choreographed fight scenes such as the nightclub and the muddy yard fight. The best fight scene is the car chase, the timing is ridiculous and the danger of multiple elements going horribly wrong are displayed in such a way that you'll want to witness a train wreck. \nIn conclusion, Raid 2 takes a ride on the wild side and banks on its core audience being blown away by the extremely violent but meticulously choreographed fight scenes. The plot is tastefully one dimensional; it's the typical betrayal and power flick lacking blindsided twists. However, that's completely acceptable because the Raid installations give a respectable nod to the traditional Shaw Brothers shooting/directing style when it comes to expressing martial arts on the silver screen.  It's visually jaw dropping to watch.",

I would like to see it split, with more palette cleansing scenes and not such an abrupt ending. At the end the audience must feel similar to the protagonist: out of breath and exhausted.

            "content": "\"In prison you'd be wise to pick a side. Loners don't tend to last long.\"\n\nThe anticipated sequel to Gareth Evans' Indonesian film, The Raid, lived up to expectations thanks to some fantastic action scenes and well choreographed fighting scenes (amongst the best I've seen on film). Iko Uwais is back in the lead role as Rama and the film picks up only a few hours after the events of the first movie. If you thought Rama was off the hook after fighting his way out of the building infected with criminals, then you were wrong because this time he has to go undercover and infiltrate the criminal underworld. In order to do so, first he must go to prison and win the confidence of Uco (played by Arifin Putra), the son of one of the most important Indonesian mafia bosses. Evans takes his time setting up the action and although the first hour and a half does contain some entertaining action sequences, it is nothing compared to the final 90 minute of the film. Uwais may not be as convincing as a dramatic actor, but he shines in every action scene he's in. I wasn't sure what direction Evans was going with this film at first, considering it had a rather slow build up, but once he got that out of the way there was plenty of room for fantastic action sequences. Unlike most Hollywood action films, Evans doesn't use so much editing and allows the action to flow uninterruptedly. There was too much shaky cam at times, but the fighting sequences were so well choreographed that it was impossible not to be in awe. My heart is still pumping really fast after those intense action scene, but be warned this film is not for everyone: there is a lot of graphic violence. At times I felt like I was watching a Refn film, less stylized of course but with a heavier narrative story. I was blown away with the second half of this film, but I did find the first half a bit slow and confusing. I only got to watch the dubbed version so that may have affected my overall experience with the dramatic scenes, but the action was perfectly executed.\n\nI'm sure there won't be any other movie coming out this year that will top the action sequences in this movie. Evans knows how to deliver action and in the first Raid he was just getting warmed up because in The Raid 2 he delivers plenty of highly choreographed fighting sequences. Uwais is a star, but in this film we also got to meet plenty of other dangerous characters. Yayan Ruhian had played Mad Dog in the first film and he's back for the sequel but as a different character. An odd decision, but it was fun to get to watch this actor once again. The three villains Rama has to face off are also interesting. Of course all we know about them is that they are good fighters (there is no need for character development here). They have no name, but we identify them by their weapon of choice. Baseball Bat Man (Very Tri Yulisman), Hammer Girl (Julie Estelle), and The Assassin (Cecep Arif Rahman) who all prove to be worthy adversaries. The film is two and a half hours long but it is justified because the action scenes are done really well and there are several interesting characters as well. I didn't think I would enjoy this film as much as the first one considering I liked the constraints and tight spaces that the building provided in the original, and although here we have several locations, Evans still manages to direct the action in enclosed spaces such as inside vehicles, hallways, kitchens, and alleys. The film is ultra violent and the martial-arts action is unlike anything you've seen before. It may be too extreme and brutal, but it is great filmmaking nonetheless.",

            "content": "\"One of the best martial arts movies EVER !\"  \n\nThis film does absolutely everything right. It takes the frenetic energy of the original, contained within the twenty-story drug den in which it took place, and lets it loose across the urban sprawl of an entire city teeming with warring crime syndicates, corrupt police officers, and the civilians often caught in the crossfire. No longer contained to just one address, the fight scenes in \"Raid 2? cover car chases, cramped subway trains, muddy prison yards, night clubs, and city streets, and every action set piece hits all the right notes. Every punch thrown and bullet fired is made even more effective by the fact that all of the action is done practically. In an era where so much of the action that we see on screen is dominated by the CGI-centric explosion extravaganzas of Michael Bay and the like it's incredibly refreshing to see highly trained stunt professionals being pushed to their limits to deliver a collection of the best action scenes in modern memory. Much of this work is shouldered by the film's lead, Indonesian-born Iko Uwais, the returning star of the first \"Raid\". Uwais is reminiscent of a younger Jet Li or - dare I say it - Bruce Lee; moving with such self-assured speed and practiced precision that every move deserves multiple looks to take in all the details. The comparison to Lee is bolstered by \"The Raid 2?'s finale, which plays out like the final gatecrashing act of \"Game of Death\", in which our hero has to slug his way through opponents of increasing lethality. Unlike \"Game of Death\", \"The Raid 2? lets us see our villains in action almost as often as our hero, and it's a credit to Evans as writer/director that each of these characters is absolutely dripping with charisma and cool. There are no wasted characters here; we love every hero and love to hate every villain.\n\nThe script is, with few exceptions, always on-point. What could have simply been a straight-forward action flick with minimal plot to carry us from one action set-piece to another is instead a mad whirlwind of conspiracy, murder, and double and triple-crosses, steadily ratcheting up the tension to the film's explosive conclusion. From a technical standpoint, the impressive cinematography matches the action stride-for- stride and, looking back, there are a dizzying number of wildly choreographed long-takes that put every nuance of the environment, characters, and action on display. Combine this with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and some absolutely superb practical makeup effects accompanying every injury, no matter how small, and \"The Raid 2? is the complete package. With a third film already in the works, making this a trilogy, Hollywood has been put on notice: Gareth Evans has arrived; he's just dramatically changed the landscape of action films and shows no signs of pulling any punches.",

The first was an innovative piece of pulp with a modest budget and a daring vision; the next, sequentially, cranks up the story to something of an action epic, and shows off some technical prowess that's destined to influence the way upcoming filmmakers approach the direction of action. While I myself thoroughly enjoyed the original Raid picture, I found myself more involved this time around and more beside myself with its variety of fights and set pieces.\nAs with the last one, take my praise with a grain of salt, as the carnage, at moments exceeding the indulgent tendencies seen in the works of Hillcoat or Refn, will only be digestible to those who adore and appreciate the guilty pleasures of exploitation; now, as for that latter demographic, get your hands on a copy and strap yourself in for a wild night of bone-shattering, bat-bashing, hammer swinging mayhem.",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption was one of the most incredibly awesome action movies that I had ever seen, but The Raid 2 completely and utterly eviscerates the first film with a baseball bat and a couple of hammers. From the very first action sequence, I was thinking to myself \"This is the best action sequence I've ever seen,\" and every consecutive action scene that followed just got better, and more violent than the previous one. There are so many different kinds of action sequences, as well. You want the best car chase ever filmed? Here you go. You want the best prison riot scene ever? Got you covered. Do you want to see a dude with a baseball bat and a chick with a hammer beat the unholy shit out of countless goons? What is this, amateur hour? Of course, we got all that and then some!\n\nThe Raid 2 not only ups the ante in terms of the action sequences, but it also has a better grasp on story and characters than the first film did. Rama isn't just some generic, faceless hero like he was in the first film. I actually cared about him and his family this time, which is more than I can say for the first film. The villains were much more memorable and threatening than the one in the first. My favorites were Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl. (Yes, those are actually their characters' names on IMDB.) The story this time isn't just, \"Oh, well now we have to go up a bigger building\". It's actually a lot like The Departed, only with much better action scenes.\n\nI was so enraptured by The Raid 2 that I didn't even notice that I was 10 minutes late for work, so I had to rush out after the kitchen fight. So I still haven't seen the last 10 or so minutes of the movie yet, so I don't know if it completely jumps the shark in the last 10 minutes, but even if this movie physically came to life and bit both of my arms off, I still would have given it 5/5 stars. The Raid 3, let's see what you got now. \n\nUPDATE: Finally finished the movie. Yep, still 5/5!",

            "content": "We have reached the zenith, the apex, the absolute peak of action films with this movie right here.  This is the type of movie that, if enough people watch, would absolutely revolutionize the genre as we know it.  There's no doubt in my mind about that.  If the first Raid was great, and it was trust me, then this film absolutely raises the bar to unattainable heights.  It's to the point where it's almost pointless to watch other action films from this point on because it's obvious that they will not reach this level of expertise.  I realize I just finished watching this movie no more than 14 hours ago, but I don't think there's any shame in admitting that this is a masterpiece of genre filmmaking.  The main complaint with the first film, at least from my point, was the fact that there was literally no story to it.  There was a moment with Rama and his brother where they talked about how different their lives had turned out, and, if you read my review, then you know I tuned that scene out.  Because of that, while the film was certainly a technical masterpiece, with some of the best editing of any action film you will ever see, it all could feel a little pointless.  But this simpler approach to the first was mostly due to budgetary reasons.  Since the first film was such a massive success, $15 million made on a $1 million budget, they could get a bigger budget to make the film Gareth Evans and his team had originally intended on making.  It's clear that Gareth Evans is one of the most promising filmmakers in the world at this moment, his short in VHS 2 being among the best horror shorts of all time.  Of course that implies that his best is yet to come, which may very well be the case, but I think this is going to be highly regarded as his masterpiece.  Ambitious in scope and execution, the film's story certainly borrows from many classics, The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Departed, among many other crime classics.  So the story itself isn't exactly the most inventive you will ever see, but it does offer a complex, sprawling, multi-character epic about revenge, corruption, honor in the place where you least come to expect it.  It's not a great story, nor is it even the best one, but it is effective at getting you invested in this world.  This is a dirty world, where murder, corruption, and greed is the way of life.  The story sees Rama being sent undercover to sniff out dirty cops that are working with the biggest gangs in Jakarta.  Things, obviously, start getting complicated as he starts working with Bangun's group and he sees how Uco, Bangun's son, and his ambition completely destroy everything his father had built for decades.  That's about the simplest way I can put it, because it is a story with many twists and turns and, again, while familiar, it is effective and you're completely drawn into this dirty, gritty world.  Reminds me very much of something that Tarantino would do.  Borrowing from your influences to create your own distinct world.  It still feels very much like Gareth Evans' vision and not just paying tributes to the films he loves  This brings us to the meat of the film, which is the action sequences.  First things first, much like the first film, the action in this film is fast, hard-hitting and utterly brutal.  Biggest difference on that end is that this film is infinitely more bloody than the first one.  Hell, this might even be THE most violent (and bloodiest) film of the year before all is said and done.  There's no doubt in my mind that, it also some of the best deaths in film history that you will ever see.  Perhaps best is not the right word, let's just say clever.  But I'll put any death in this film up against any horror film in existence.  So, because of that, I think this film won't really make its way into the \"mainstream\" as much as you'd like.  Not that I have a huge problem with that, since the violence does give the film an edge.  It may turn people off, and with good reason, but I think the fact that it is so violent adds a touch of realism to the proceedings.  But I digress, much like the first Raid, this film is beautifully choreographed and masterfully edited.  I don't know if Gareth Evans is self-taught at editing, but if he is, then this man should teach classes at film schools.  THIS is how you edit together an action film, there's a certain smoothness to the editing that makes it look as if it's one really long shot.  The scene with Mad Prakoso in the club is a perfect example of this, if you can point out where they edited two different takes together, then you deserve a medal because it's really hard to pick up.  The fight scene with Rama and The Assassin, as he's plainly known, in the kitchen is another incredibly bloody scene, particularly with how Rama dispatches of the Assassin by slitting his throat in the most brutal fashion.  While it happens very quickly, the film does show you the knife slashing his throat and it is incredibly violent.  There are also many broken bones, shattered faces, dudes being dropped on their heads, MELTED faces, cuts to the back, hammers to the end, someone trying to rip someone else's jaw from his mouth, faces blown away by shotgun blasts, people going headfirst through their car's front window, car crashes, etc, etc.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  The film offers so many highlights as far as action goes that going through all of them would take me forever.  That's another thing, all of the action sequences offer something memorable.  But it doesn't ever become numbing, surprisingly enough.  They just keep raising the stakes that you're just going along for the ride, loving every second of it.  As far as MY personal favorite scene of the film, it'd have to be the climactic fight scene with Rama and The Assassin.  It might not have been the most technically challenging scene to pull off.  That would either be the muddy prison yard scene, the Hammer Girl train scene, or Mad Prekoso's scene in the club, but for the sheer brutality, the Rama/Assassin scene is my favorite.  But that's like asking a parent to pick their favorite child.  You love them all equally.  Same thing applies with the action in this film.  I love all of it, and it's not all martial arts.  There's a mix of gun play, weapons, car chases, and martial arts to make this complete package as action goes.  As far as action choreography, both martial arts and the more traditional stuff like gun fights, this is a step ahead anything anyone else can offer.  The choreography is absolutely out of this world, that's a masterpiece in and of itself.  This film needs to be shown in film classes all around the world as to how successfully make, and edit, an action film.  Seriously, no other film has combined martial arts action with crime drama the way this film has.  And it's likely that no one ever will, not even Gareth Evans himself if this series was planned out as a trilogy.  And that's another thing, how do you top what you have accomplished with this film?  If you've seen the movie then you definitely understand my question.  If anyone can do it, it's Gareth Edwards, Iko Uwais, and Yayan Ruhian (both Iko and Yayan did the fight choreography).  That's not to disregard the directors of photography, the costume designers, the producers, and everyone that's part of the crew.  But those three are the most important when it comes to the creative aspects of the series.  I still have my doubts but I will trust in their abilities to, somehow, find a way to top themselves with The Raid 3, if it ever comes to pass.  I rented this movie but now I plan t buy it the next time I can.  It's THAT great.  This might one of the best action films I have ever seen, there is no doubt in my mind about that.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, due to the ultra-violence, but this is a action/crime drama masterpiece and, hopefully, it will come to be known as such in due time.  MUST-SEE FILM.",

I'll be honest, I was really disappointed. I wanted to love it, but I didn't find myself enjoying it, nearly as much as the first film. The first had a lot of simplicity. It's story was just about surviving, and it was awesome. There may have been cliches and almost too much action, but it was short and to the point. This film is the exact opposite. It goes for a much larger scope, which I anticipated. What it ended up being, was just another boring and not as fun action movie. This movie focuses too much on characters that I didn't care for, forgot about after two minutes, or just didn't need to be there. There were so many characters that I started to lose track. The story was a lot larger as well and focused on gang rivalry. I kept having to play back scenes to figure out if I missed something, because I kept getting confused throughout this movie. Everybody else seemed to love this film. I don't know what I was missing. I was confused by the story and bored by many of the characters. I do like the character of Rama, but there isn't even enough of him and I didn't even understand what he was doing. The only character I cared about was Rama, and all of the extra characters made me bored and I didn't care if they lived or died. In the first film, it mainly focused on him, which made me like the movie more, and it just lost focus. The realism of the original film decreased within this sequel. Ok, it wasn't that realistic, but what I mean is that characters used guns when necessary and melee when it worked as well. In this film, no body seemed to have a gun. They just all fought melee for the sake of looking cool. This film wasn't terrible, even though this review is making it out to be. I did still enjoy the action, and I did like the car chase scene a lot. The action was still very awesome, and I also loved the final act. It felt more like the first film, and I grew excited. Then all of the sudden, the movie just ended. I didn't expect it, and was disappointed that there didn't seem to be a huge outcome. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it just left my brain puzzled. And I didn't even mention the run time... THIS MOVIE WAS 2 AND A HALF HOURS LONG! This was way too long. That's probably why there felt like less action, because it was overtaken by dialog and exposition that bored me to shit. I'm not a man, who wants brainless action, all of the time. I want to care for the characters. I want to be interested in the story. I wasn't this time. And the action didn't save this movie completely. I wanted to like this movie, like everyone else did, but I didn't. I came out of this movie, confused an annoyed. I don't recommend this one, but maybe I'm just not normal. Maybe, I'm the only one who didn't like this movie.",

            "content": "Blistering barnacles and thundering typhoons!! I have not seeing this much of hand to hand combat action after The Raid Redemption (2011) and this bone breaking second installment is fantastic. It packs a heavy and a lethal dose of adrenaline for the action movie lovers and that much of a does come seldom with effectiveness. Just like the first movie Raid 2 starts off calm and quiet and gradually builds its plot while becoming bloody and violent from floor to the ceiling.\n\nRaid 2 picks up from the end of the first movie. Rama (Iko Uwais) who is a cop in the Jakarta police force sent undercover to discover evidence of a large crime syndicate. To do this he must commit a crime and get himself in prison and get close to a son of an underworld boss who is serving sentence. While his initial undercover plan last a few months, once in prison he realizes that the game is uglier than expected.\n\nRaid 2 is exactly two and half hours long. And by the look of it it's an insane long for an action flick. But once the action hits the screen and plot starts to reveal the viewers will forget the clock entirely. (or maybe the clock got smashed in to pieces by all the punches and kicks). Not like the first movie which totally takes place in a 20 story drug run apartment Raid 2 hits the streets. And it hits the prisons, night clubs, subways and even road sides like action madness. And this has elegant looking yet blood thirsty bunch of villains and the most wanted element of a thumping action movie, car chases. Imagine all this combined with the sheer amount of punching power of the first movie. It's definitely bigger and better and this is something seldom I can say about sequels.\n\nI must keep a note about the action of Raid 2. It is obvious at a glance that it's natural and performed on location. As this is rare in movies these days the action choreography and pulling it off in such a brilliant way is truly commendable. And the viewers can actually feel the awesomeness of a pure combat with long action sequences and that's mind blowing. There is a high chance that you might miss lot of details in one viewing so just as I did maybe you have to pause, rewind and replay to catch them all. It's lightning fast!\n\nThough Raid 2 is violent and gore it is not violent up to the extent of unwatchable insanity. Therefore most viewers should be able to digest it. And violence is not the real thing to be worried about. It's the ample amount of kicks and punches and forever panning camera movements. If you manage to get through them and survive the cracked walls and shattered glasses Raid 2 will be one of the best action movies you have ever seeing. And this movie will go to my archives of repeat watch worthy action movies and believe me when I say this there is only handful there already (Including The Raid Redemption).",

            "content": "The critically-acclaimed and wildly popular foreign film, \"The Raid\" was a massive success -- critically acclaimed and wildly popular amongst many moviegoers both American or non-American. So why not make a sequel? Who didn't see this coming? You know, I'm surprised to say it myself, but I was not a fan of the first iteration; for a film that was almost 90% action, the fight choreography was not inventive and extremely repetitive. Well, with a sequel now out receiving huge rave once again, I had to give this soon-to-be trilogy a second chance. \n\nNow one would immediately think that before seeing \"The Raid 2\", they'd have to watch its predecessor. You're absolutely wrong. The only snippet of story the first iteration has is the beginning 10 minutes of the film. The rest is a knuckle-bashing frenzy. So for a film that is positively reviewed despite being a senseless action flick, one would probably think the sequel wouldn't take any risks and emulate the same formula. What ain't broke, don't fix, am I right? But I'm proud to say that \"The Raid 2\" not only takes a huge gamble to attempt to portray a compelling crime drama coupled with mixed martial arts action, but it succeeds in doing so. \n\n\"The Raid 2\" is almost a completely different film to its earlier iteration and it's all for the better. For instance, the cinematography -- its gorgeous, done with purpose, and expertly shot. In times of silence and even in times of lightning fast flurries of kicks, elbows, and punches, the film is stunning to look at. Perhaps the greatest change though is how the entire film caters to its core story of deception and violence. Before? Pff, I wouldn't even be able to tell you the story of the first cause there was hardly ever one. Here, the story works which then is followed up with what everyone's looking forward to -- the martial arts action. It truly delivers especially because the story's tension elevates it to such greater heights than its predecessor ever did. Is there as much action as the first? No, but quality is better than quantity, and boy it's like eating a filet mignon here instead of a cheap steak from Denny's. The fighting choreography still remains somewhat the same from the first but because of the narrative and the camerawork, it carries much more weight and better pacing. \n\n\"The Raid 2\" was world's better than the first. From the arresting story, to the beautiful camerawork, to the action, I thoroughly enjoyed my time. No longer will this soon-to-be trilogy continue on to be a mindless action franchise. It's won me over.",

This one has more of a plot than the previous one and I have to say, it almost gets in the way of it sometimes, making it a tad overlong. But oh boy, there's more than enough action to satisfy the previous film's fans. As usual, you will feel every kick, blow, cut, bone-breakage, etc. and of course, the effect is oddly exhilarating thanks to the great choreography, sound design, cinematography and editing working all in harmony.

Here with a run time of 150 minutes, the proceeding get draggy. Of course throw in a cliche plot of a gangster movie about two warring families, undercover cop, emotional family ties & an ultimate betrayal. You never actually care about the characters.

Moving away from the tight corridor focus of its predecessor, The Raid 2 is a full-blown crime epic, spanning years, and in the process, churns out some of the most blistering, unbelievable fight and action sequences I have ever seen, and that too on a $5 Million budget. If your heart is not racing continuously during the final 30-45 minutes, then you are already dead. In short, Gareth Evans has schooled Hollywood with this sequel, and I will be lucky if I ever enjoy any of the CGI-laden Disney superhero films again.

The corrupt politicians and cops are after him and his family. There is only one way to get himself out of danger. He has to go undercover and infiltrate the biggest crime family in Jakarta.\n\nRama is being arrested so that he can come in contact with Uco, the son of crime boss Bangun. Right from the start it becomes clear Rama is being used by the special police force. Instead of being held captive for three months he has to stay for over two years.\n\nWhen Rama gets to leave prison he seems to have made friends with Uco, who takes him directly to his father. Rama, going by the name of Yuda, is now part of the Bangun family. Yuda becomes Uco his right hand and together they try to win over the city with all the associated risks. Meanwhile Rama tries to find out who is good and bad to secure his own life.\n\n \n\nWith The Raid 2 Gareth Evans tries to improve on every aspect the original movie was packing. In a way it is more of a remake than a sequel. The fighting sequences, the characters, the cinematography and the storyline are all more complex in comparison to the original. Unfortunately this does not work in its favor.\n\nThis time the storyline plays part in more than one location. From the prison to the office of mister Bangun and from the streets of Jakarta to fancy clubs and diners. Evans tries to improve upon the main site that was used in the original Raid: one big building. However it was the simplicity of this one site that made the original work. This is the main problem The Raid 2 has, it lacks simplicity. The storyline this time is a lot harder to follow. It is unclear who is fighting who during the fighting sequences, so you will find yourself just paying attention when these sequences arise since the rest of the story is inferior to it.\n\nBut to be honest, the first movie was not praised due to its great storyline. It is all about the fights in these type of movies and fighting sequences is what The Raid 2 does best. Even better than the first movie, The Raid 2 relies on great cinematography to capture the fast moving action. High angle shots, slow-motion and gritty colors produce phenomenal man to man combat scenes.\n\nSo the story is not all that great, and due to trying to be a more complex movie it fails to reach the same level the first movie did. The story is too complicated, the characters try too hard in being 'less flat', so everything regarding the plot is all over the place. However, the story is not what most viewers watch The Raid 2 for. It is all about the fights, and that is what The Raid 2 does incomparably great. Films like these share a lot with dance movies like Step Up. Most of the time the plot is awful, but the moves are great. Saying The Raid and The Raid 2 are just about the same as Step Up would not do these two fighting movies any justice, since the cinematography is a lot better here but there are a lot of similarities to it. Within its genre The Raid 2 should receive a high praise, but taking all aspects of this movie in to consideration it has a lot to improve upon.",

In fact, most of it was an elaborate insight to local gang wars and very story oriented, and I dare say, even occasionally boring. \nHowever, then the second half begun and the dominoes that had been carefully stacked began to collapse. The second half of this movie is exhilarating to say the least and well worth the wait. All the action also has more meaning to it because of the thought out story and build up. Whether its in a kitchen, or on the train, or in the streets, every action scene is once again incredibly choreographed. \nWhile it doesn't have the tension or urgency of its predecessor, it makes great use of its larger scale and introduces quite a few well developed characters. However, trimming some of the lengthy introduction and foundation to bring the running time below 150 minutes would have made it better. I would say that on the whole, it's on par with the first part and was glad to read that Raid 3 had been announced",

            "content": "Judd:                In 2012, The Raid: Redemption was released. It was a movie with an Indonesian cast and a Welsh writer/director, the action was all close up, lauded for its grizzly gore and non-stop action. The plot was simple, a SWAT team becomes trapped in a building as they try to flush out its mob owner and his gang. Running at 101 minutes the movie was the perfect mix of action, blood and just enough story to keep it moving.\n \nAfter the success of the first movie director Gareth Evans returns to Indonesia for The Raid 2, where everything is definitely bigger, but not necessarily better. The run time has been expanded by an extra 50 minutes, and instead of one location, there are fights in every conceivable local in Indonesia; prison, subway, rice patty, street and restaurant to name just a few. This time around Agent Rama is tasked with fishing out dirty cops working for a local mob boss. To infiltrate the mob, Rama must befriend the boss' son, an ambitious fellow who feels neglected and underutilized by his father. One convoluted thing leads to another and Rama finds himself in the middle of a three-sided mob war.\n \nThe action scenes are phenomenal and extremely well choreographed. Evans knows why people are coming to see this movie. Actor Iko Uwais is ridiculously fast and the camerawork, while slightly shaky, features the up close fighting like in the original; however, not quite enough. This is why I was surprised that the runtime was bloated to over two hours with a plot, while convoluted, is your standard Shakespearian son crosses father affair. The acting is nothing to write home about, though Arafin Putra and Alex Abbad manage to set themselves apart and command a presence the other bodies didn't seem to have. In fact, because the movie is subtitled and the characters are so interchangeable, it took me about half the movie to keep them all straight in my head.\n \nCinematography was also lacking. I would think that after investing the time and bodies into an intricately choreographed fight sequence, you would want to show the action blow-by-blow. I understand that a wildly quaking camera is a cheap and effective gimmick to hide shoddy staging, but I don't think that was the reason here. It felt like Evans wanted dynamic shots too complex for a dolly, but couldn't afford the steadicam.\n \nIt's unfortunate that Evans served as writer and director and, due to the success of the first, probably had carte blanche. The film suffers from excess. Some are saying it's an excess of violence and blood, but for me the excess came from its grand story that was never compelling. Judicious editing could have trimmed at least 30 minutes off and brought the movie down to a manageable 2 hours. The same day I saw The Raid 2, I saw Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a movie that is also nearly 150 minutes long. The difference between the two is that the story carried Captain America and didn't act as fodder to get us to the next action sequence. Ten actionless minutes can feel like an eternity when you don't care what's happening on screen. \n \nJudd:                **  1/2",

Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan revolutionized the genre with their own physical commitment to their martial arts; with Chan breaking almost every bone in his body, just to perfectly enhance the pictures quality. Now In the current era of film one of the prime examples of \"cool\" fight scenes is fights such as Neo against agent Smith. While visually impressive, obviously almost the entire fight was achieved with computer generated effects and wires which instantly diminishes the admiration I can give to that film for the effort simply is not there. However, in 2011 director Gareth Evans brought to movie audiences everywhere a small independent film, made with just $1.1 million, The Raid: Redemption. While the miniscule budget certainly affected the look of the film it in no way hindered the actual action itself, which required more thought and creativity from the entire film crew. Iko Uwais absolutely nailed all of his matial arts fights and overall did a stellar job. My only problem with that film was the monotony of some of the fights due to all of them taking place in the same location and the uninvolved story that was compacted with dozens of clich√©s. Three years later Evans is back with The Raid 2: Berendal which absolutely annihilates the first film in every single way for not only is The Raid 2 one of the best films of 2014 but it has now taken the top spot for my favorite action film of all time edging out Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It's almost as if Gareth Evans read my review for his previous film and corrected every fault in the film that detracted me from the experience. Evans fixed my first problem being the lousy story, by actually creating a very compelling undercover cop, rival family, godfather type narrative that finds our main hero Rama stuck right in the middle of. Every fight felt integral to the plot this time around and had real suspense rather than just extending the run time like the previous film. Monotony also dies with this new film for Rama is constantly moving from different locations; to a prison to a karaoke club to a highway to a Bejo's hide out, there is an insane amount of locational and chorographical variety. I cannot find a single thing wrong with this picture which usually never happens to me and in fact this film being 2hr 30min long was indeed too short for this movie; I actually wish the film was 3hr 30min long, I just didn't want this movie to end! Instead of reflecting on the films negatives I will state my favorite fight scene in the film, that being when Rama is facing four of Uco's men inside a very small car with dynamic chorography, Evans you are truly a master director to pull that off with such style. The Raid 2: Berendal is one of the best action films ever made for it combines masterful fight scenes with a great story which is a formula hard to pull off in the action genre. Iko Uwais is our generations new Bruce Lee and Gareth Evans is our generations John Woo for this film is simply a perfect movie.",

Easily comparable to classics such as Enter The Dragon, The Raid 2 is a masterpiece that will be entertaining for years to come.

            "content": "The Raid 2 is simply one of the greatest action movies of all time period. When the first Raid came out two years ago, for many people who saw, they claimed that it was one of the best action films to come out in a while. With a great response from critics and audiences, director Gareth Evans finally was given the chance to make the film he wanted to make which was supposed to be the first installment was Berandal, which is now The Raid 2. I loved the first film, but it had problems in the story, dialogue, and characters aspect. However, The Raid 2 takes everything that you loved about the first film and increases it by a million, and offers a more interesting story, interesting dialogue, and more interesting characters. The action scenes are in my opinion, some of the greatest action scenes I've ever seen in my life. There is no shaky-cam, it is perfectly filmed action scenes with wide angled shots that are better than most action blockbusters nowadays. Everything that was a minor complaint in the first Raid, The Raid 2 fixes all those mistakes gives a much more improved film. The film's length time is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but never does the film feel like it's dragging on. Heck, the film could have been 3 hours long and it would have been fine. Gareth Evan is a director who knows what he's doing, and is now is becoming one my favorite directors. With only a 4 million dollar budget, The Raid 2 is better than most 100 million dollar blockbusters and that's saying something. Unlike most action movies nowadays, The Raid 2 offers compelling characters, an interesting story, magnificent tension, and fantastic action sequences that I have ever seen. The Raid is one of the best films of the year, and for me it's a contender for being the best film of the year. I highly recommend this film to everyone because it is simply phenomenal.",

It is sprawling, complex and a bit slow at times.  What it has in common with the first film is incredible fight choreography, which is even better here.

            "content": "BLOODY (!) BRILLIANT! \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is absolutely stunning! It's a stylish, masterfully crafted, visual assault which crushes the action film bar set by \"Raid: Redemption\". \n\nUnlike its predecessor, \"the Raid: Redemption\", which largely succeeded due to its thrillingly simplistic \"fight or die\" premise, \"Berandal\" has a much more ambitious structure featuring multiple plot lines and several, well developed characters, including two of the most memorable villains in cinematic history. While this departure from formula might have been a recipe for disaster (think about the \"Die Hard\" franchise for a moment), Gareth Evans pens an engaging and intricate crime epic. Moviegoers will recognize elements of \"Infernal Affairs\" and it's US adaptation - \"the Departed\", as well as \"Heat\" and \"the Godfather\". \n\nWhile the emphasis on narrative elements In \"Berandal\" may result in a longer running time, it doesn't result in less action. Instead, the action sequences here are FAR more elaborate than those featured in \"Redemption\". In fact, they are some of the best ever filmed! One of the film's early action sequences - a fight in a prison yard - is full on directorial bravado. Evans' does a perfect job building up to the violence with stylized tension. Time slows, the music is electric, rain drops thunderously clash into a pool of water, and then BAM! Amazingly, much of the mayhem is captured in one long take. Later, in the film, there is an incredible car chase which might very well be the best ever shot! Ultimately, the film's action sequences build to a relentless pace with each action sequence being more exhilarating than its predecessor. The penultimate fight scene is a fantastic seven-plus-minute showdown in the kitchen of a restaurant, which is the best ever shot.\n\nOver the years, there have been some wonderful action-crime dramas which have come out of Asia: including the aforementioned \"Infernal Affairs\", as well as \"Fallen Angels\". \"Breaking News\", \"SPL\" and \"the Chaser\". \"Berandal\" not only stands among them...it stands atop them. If your pulse isn't racing by the film's climatic fight sequence, it's only because it stopped from over-excitement caused by a prior action scene.",

See it!\" Such is the case for The Raid 2, the sequel to the Indonesian action film that melted faces with its inventive and brutal action. The original movie had a confined location, a gang-run tenement building, and a simple premise of reaching the top and nabbing the bad guy. When people weren't punching or shooting each other, the original Raid lagged, but director/writer Gareth Evans has solved the problem with his action-packed sequel. The world expands greatly, establishing the uneasy peace kept by powerful and warring criminal organizations. The plot ends up becoming something akin to The Departed meets A Prophet, following our hero cop from the first movie placed undercover to gain the trust of the criminal overlords and work his way up the food chain. When the action isn't cooking, you're still engaged with the story and the suspense simmers in clever ways. But getting back to the film's calling card, the action sequences are impeccably choreographed and edited, have a wide variety of locations for fun, and are bloody intoxicating. This is a movie soaked in adrenaline, and the action sequences will be hard to beat for the rest of the year. Evans finds ways to provide flair for his supporting characters, including a family duo that involves a deaf woman whose weapon of choice is hammers and a guy who prefers a baseball and a bat. The Raid 2 fires on all cylinders so well, so brilliantly filmed, that it puts just about every American action thriller to shame. It doesn't need to be as long as it is (pushing two and a half hours), and it takes a little while to set up the players, but this is even more of an entertaining rush than the original, because now we get a sense of what Evans and his team can do with fewer restrictions. When Evans gets to Hollywood, and he will, just make sure you give him all the money to do whatever he wants. \r\n\r\nNate's Grade: A-",

The violence is so gratuitous and the hero so well defined that empathy extends to laughing by the audience when the nasty guy gets his own baseball bat in-bedded in his head. Even a point blank shotgun shot that mushes a nasties head draws a laugh of \"yeah, you deserved that buddy!\" This was a fantastic film. The fact that it is in Bahasa Indonesia and Japanese and subtitled does not detract in the slightest! All I can say is bagus!",

The different components don't always gel (the whole film plays like an uneasy mix of \"Kill Bill\" and \"The Departed\"); however, they do, more often than not, play out spectacularly well on a scene-by-scene basis. Writer-director-editor Gareth Evans has a formidable command of the medium, even when his glee in some of the brutal, brutal violence is more than a little unnerving. It's horrifying, and watching it with a couple of howling dudes in their 20s on the row behind me made me feel a bit like I was watching a 21st century gladiator battle, but, for better or worse, it's hard to deny that this is some of the most spectacularly staged action ever put on film.",

But there are only a handful of sequels that completely blindside the viewer by successfully reconstituting the narrative landscape in a way that the first installment didn't even suggest was possible. The Dark Knight, Terminator 2, The Wrath of Khan and (gasp) Fast Five come to mind.\n\nThe Raid 2 is among the very best of this lot. The first movie introduced a brutally efficient, Energizer Bunny of an action star in Iko Uwais, giving him an 100 minutes to fight his way out of a single building.\n\nThis movie unleashes Uwais into a sweeping crime saga. Every single character is richly developed, the script - while queuing up glorious action sequences - is unexpectedly deep, and the scope is equal to anything a seasoned veteran like Michael Mann might produce. This is director Gareth Evans' third movie.\n\nBut what should land this movie in the history books is the beauty of its violence. Some movies have an act or scene of violence that makes them memorable. In this movie, every single blow is so creatively considered that each one - and there are thousands of them - feels shockingly original. If you can stomach the extreme violence (to put it mildly), you're in for an experience unlike anything you've had before at the movies.",

It's not a a good movie, but it has the best action scenes I've ever seen. But then again.. That's all that the movie is. Because there's no characters, no story, and most of the action scenes are there just to be there and have bad choices made all around.\nThe movie starts off where parts of the mafia were in the fields threatening a guy and then shooting him. What's the reason for the scene? There's none.\nWhy are there scenes where people have tons of guns and suddenly when the main character attacks they don't have any guns and take out a knife to fight a martial arts master who has already killed a ton of guys before him. Because I guess handfight vs guns can't be made as interesting. There are 2 characters who use really strange weapons, a thin and weak looking white girl who dual-wields hammers, and an asian guy who uses a baseball bat and a ball, and he uses his bat to hit the ball so that he can kill people by hitting ball with the bat, and he only has 1 ball so after hitting the ball he always has to go and pick it up.. Lovely.. Do these 2 characters have any logic behind their fightstyles? Not really. Does it look cool? I guess so?\nBut now I'll get into the thing that makes this movie fail hard. The dramatic death scenes are for characters that I literally knew nothing about, and were on the screen for 1-4 minutes before the death scene happened. The way the story was told was worse than the room, because I didn't know anyone and they hoped that ''Oh he was in that scene and he was a important guy''. Case and point. The gang the main character joined into, has the ''right-hand man'' of the boss. He was in 1-2 scenes and than he gets his own car chase scene, where he tries to save the main character (After the main character saves him from death.). Because I had barely seen him before, I didn't understand who was the good guy either, because the cars themselves looked the same, and I had no idea who the good guy was.. But there were explosions. The only thing that showed me that he was a good guy was that the guy who was in the car next to his, had a shotgun and they were 1-2 meters apart and he kept missing.. Guess he's a important character than? xD .. Then after the guy manages to save the main character, he drives outside the city into some city ruins and says that he's a ''undercover cop who did nothing wrong and didn't sin even though he was in the mafia'', and the scene was supposed to be sad and stuff because he died cause of.. umm.. Cause he was shot in the leg and hand in a previous scene (before the car scene)? And why did he drive outside the city when he could've gone into the hospital? Because y'know.. Obligatory death scene.\nThis movie ... Is quite something. It has tons of well directed action and gore, but the reasons, characters and story behind the action couldn't be worse. The characters weren't developed at all, and the whole premise behind this story was silly. And most of the choices in this were made not to make sense, but to look cool. Seeing those ratings i guess they succeeded? \nI really wonder why this movie has such high ratings. Was it because it's a movie where there's tons of people fighting in fast-paced action? I guess so. Was it fun for me to watch? Umm not really. Because this is a movie that you NEED to enjoy with your head shut down. I wouldn't really give this a high rating because it honestly doesn't deserve it, because it's already a really huge over-rated piece of.. But then again there aren't THAT many movies like this so I'm going to give this a 2.5/5. Average.",

Director Gareth Evans has a unique style when it comes to crafting an unparalleled action film. He truly comprehends the genre, and what it is displayed clearly on-screen. The Raid 2 may have a simple plot, but that's fine, for this type of film, the action is all that matters, and with this follow up, get an excellent blend of action with a few moments of layed back drama, just for you to catch your breath. Brilliant in every sense of the word, The Raid 2 raises the bar even further in the action genre, and will surely be a film that stands out among the recent films in the genre. I love films like this because it has some real action, real fights and it's nastier and grittier than your big time Hollywood production. You can clearly see that the film has a more \"real\" feel to it than any other film that has been released because it uses a simple idea, and uses straightforward, well choreographed fight scenes to thrill you. The Raid 2 improves upon many aspects that were apparent in the first one, bigger action, more fights, more blood, more gore, basically more everything, and it does it very well. This is a superior film, and also it has a bit more depth to the film than just a typical \"popcorn\" flick, there's some good acting here mixed with the exciting fights, and it's nice to see because in more mainstream action films, you have poor acting with lack of any truly memorable action. Gareth Evans on the other hands goes the opposite way, using simplistic ideas, with a well layered script and top notch action; he is able to craft a genre picture that is one of a kind. If you want a truly awesome action film, give The Raid 2 a watch, you will be glad you did. Not since The Dark Knight has a sequel been so good, and with that being said, be prepared to be wowed at the chaos that will be unleashed before your eyes watching this incredible picture. Hollywood take note, THIS is how you make an action film. What makes this even more awesome is that every fight scene is real, and it makes for a memorable and incredibly intense two and half hour roller coaster ride.",

            "content": "I was late to the first Raid, watching it only a few days before the second one came out, and I loved it. The story and plot were weak, but it didn't mater, because the action was so intense that it made up for all of it's shortcomings. This sequel promised more of the same, but with more of a focus on the elements that let the first film down. Because of this, The Raid 2 exceeds the first film in every way. Unfortunately, the things that make the sequel better are also its weakest points. The story is much more interesting, but is a little convoluted. There are more characters and story threads that link in with each other, but after a while you lose interest in some of them. Where the Raid 2 really excels however, is exactly where it should. The fighting is truly jaw dropping, and manages every time to up the ante. If the plot development had been paced better, this could've been a five out of five, but if action scenes weren't so good, this film could've been a two out of five. Even with its flaws, The Raid 2 is a marked improvement on the first film, and if there's a third instalment, I'm going to be first in line to see it.",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption was without a doubt the most spectacular action film of the past 10-15 years when it was released 2 years ago. It set a new level for action set pieces and installed something that has hardly ever been seen or will ever be topped. So when a sequel was announced many thought me included how can you outdo something that was already brilliant when so many sequels struggle to say anything new? For all the naysayers, they were given a roundhouse in the face for even questioning that it could not be done. The Raid 2 is not only better overall but offers greater action and a more human story. The end result is a grandiose crime action martial arts epic that is already an instant classic. With so few original fighting movies out right now and even more so originating from Asia, it's a breath of fresh air to see a movie throw everything including the kitchen sink at your face.\n\nI don't want to give the feeling that I'm sprouting hyperbole at The Raid 2 but this really is the most spectacular action film I have ever seen. It can be a little pointless to even say why it's so great since it will do no justice to actually seeing it. That's how awesome it is, that words can't even describe but I am going to anyway. It doesn't take long before we get into the first bit of action but it slowly builds the tension before it blows like a powder keg. Then you just allow yourself to be strapped in. It starts off in a bathroom stall then goes to a litany of various places, settings and locales. It's hard to say where it will exactly go next but that's what makes it so fun. The creativity used in fighting in specific locations was used brilliantly, using every bit of space available to make the best possible fight sequence. What I really loved was the calm moments before the storm. The music builds up with anticipation, everything is in slow motion, the characters have stern looks on their faces and you know shit is about to go down. Like a starting pistol to a race, the action is off to the races. It's frantic and pulse pounding, while leaving your mouth agape at what you have just seen. I have had my mouth open for long periods of time while watching it with the occasional holy shit peppered throughout. I've never seen fighting scenes so creative and feel like a heavy weight fight. \n\nIt's hard to find fault in the action but some may say that it can go a little long but this is the type of movie that needs elongated action set pieces. When it comes to movies and specifically action movies, you can have as much action as it would allow. But it doesn't mean that you should. Imitators will try to duplicate but they will always get it wrong. The Raid 2 includes countless action scenes because it can and it does it well. Of all the many action scenes, my favorites are in the end. By far one of the best action sequences ever as it raises the stakes and action with every defeat dealt to a bad guy. What I loved about it is that it played like a video game. You can't go into the next room until you defeat this guy. There are no health packs and it's done in one shot. My favorite fight scene is the battle in the kitchen between Rama and a man named The Assassin. It is by far the most brutal and tense and one of the best cinematic fights I've ever seen. It is heightened when The Assassin takes out his weapon of choice, two kerambits and wields them with razor precision. The most interesting characters are two who don't really say that much. Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man are so unique that further character development isn't really needed. It would only take away the mystery of their character. As you would expect the weapons they use are included in their name and the way they use it is so cool. I love it when there are characters with everyday weapons as their specialty. \n\nI can't recall a more gory, blood splattering, bone crunching film. This really goes all out with violence. I was like a kid in a candy store with all the mayhem. I couldn't wait to see the next death blow. Action movies today aren't that violent as they were before in the 80s since comic book movies have taken over the medium and a PG-13 rating with them. With that hitting the main stream, there needs an outlet for gory action films and this directly fits the bill. It harkens back to the John Woo films of old when they revolutionized the genre with blood and bullets. More adult audiences shouldn't be complacent when it comes to violence in action movies. They shouldn't settle for comic book fare even though I dearly love many of those movies with all my heart. But at the same time it all depends on how much it's marketed. Only so many people can see it if it's not out there as much as other movies. I felt like I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre near me. One aspect of the movie that I feel should be in more fighting movies is the gory fatalities that fall on a many doomed opponents. I thought I was watching Mortal Kombat, there should have been a 3...2...1...FIGHT before every clash. And there are many all throughout the movie delivered with head bashing aplomb. It's the equivalent of a cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae with nuts, whip cream and sprinkles. A gruesome fatality can make an excellent fight scene an all-time great. When it comes you can't help but jump out of our seat and yell god damn. It's hard not to get excited and feel involved in the action.\n\nWhile the story in the first installment was limited in many a ways, it didn't deter it from being a great movie. The same can't be said for the sequel as it has a more involved, emotional and captivating story to go along with the blistering action. Many new characters are introduced as well as the main character Rama who survived the excursion at the building in the first. As soon as he gets out he gets put undercover to fish out the corruption in his police department while taking down the violent gangsters that control the city of Jakarta. There are many ups and downs in the story, going in places you'd never expect. There is a clear and concise narrative that isn't hard to understand amid all the bloody mayhem and long running time. One negative I found and only one is that it got hard to follow in the beginning when they introduced the characters by pictures. I lost track of who was who, getting riled up from all the action but after going for a second watch it should become clearer. With a more human story, you feel for these awful characters more than you should. Like most gangster epics, there are some qualities you like in these horrible awful people. You can't help but feel bad for them and that's what makes it so engaging. You still obviously root for the good guy and wait for the bad guy to die but you just can't help but feel a bit sorry for them. It is often subtle with many nuances that would be easily caught upon repeat viewings. There is much depth here, more than you would expect which gives it that much needed extra weight to carry it along between the action. I could easily compare this to past crime epics from the likes of Scorsese and Tarantino. There are many aspects between them that feel like they are from the same ilk even though they are differences among them.\n\nThe amount of characters in here that stand apart among themselves is astounding. There are so many varied personalities that you could choose any of the main characters for a movie just about them. Everyone knows Rama from the first film as the rookie cop who took down an entire army but seeing him withstand all the corruption and deceit makes his transformation from cop to gangster that much more captivating. He risks his life to protect his wife and kid, away for god knows how long. But he always keeps his wits amid everything else falling around him. He walks a fine line between being a cop meant to arrest criminals and a man with nothing to lose killing all those who get in his way. Uco is the son of crime boss Bangun who takes in Rama. He is far less conflicting in who he is and is a certifiable psychopath. He is a true scene stealer as he tries to break out of his father's shadow to be the crime boss he always thought he was meant to be. Bejo as a crime boss was a really great character who stood out among the rest of them. His distinct style and cane wasn't the only thing that made him different. He has visions of ruling over the old guard that currently takes over the city. He does whatever it takes to see it through with calculating manipulation and devious cunning. The character that brought in the most emotional weight was Prakoso. It was hard to gather who he was at first glance but once the layers were uncovered, you see a genuine person with a tragic backstory.\n\nThe cinematography was beyond gorgeous. I loved the wide shots of the scene and then the slow pan toward the middle of the screen. Reminds me of the work from Stanley Kubrick. It really allows you to take in the background as it eases you into the dialogue of the characters. The scenery is so well detailed and constructed so as much attention is needed to appreciate it. It also helps that the art direction is great. The use of color made everything stand out and bring extra attention to it. It looked like at times like a moving painting. That combined with the lighting made the imagery crackle on screen. There are so many subtleties within the color and lighting, you feel like you're watching an art house film sometimes and not a gory action epic. It isn't that surprising considering Asian cinema has usually looked beautiful and more so in regards to American cinema. The close ups were also expertly used too. Being so close to the action and seeing every hit was mesmerizing. I hardly noticed the use of shaky cam. The soundtrack was especially intense which makes sense considering how insane and thrilling the movie is. I could hear a collage of genres from techno, classical and a distinct hip hop influence in the music. Most fighting movies have soundtracks with heavy bass and drums, giving the fights an added panache. But it feels more handily crafted here. It's the perfect accompaniment to the mayhem on screen. \n\nThere are many films that can only be directed by that one singular director. While it is the case here, I don't think there would be any person living or dead to even come close to reigning in this madness. This could only be directed by Gareth Evans who has quickly became the best action director in the world. Action films can be incredibly repetitive today especially that the style has changed drastically. You don't see that many knock-down-drag-out spectacles littered with blood and gore. Especially martial arts movies. It certainly doesn't help that there really isn't an Asian main stream star to crossover in America since Jackie Chan and Jet Li are getting increasingly older. Tony Jaa is popular but nowhere near the appeal of Chan and Li. The only martial arts movie that I can recall with main stream appeal and success was Kill Bill. Even though it was released 10 years ago, it is regarded as a classic. But between that and the Raid 1, there really hasn't been any new ground broken in the genre. Evans not only breaks the genre, he redefines it with a story akin to the best gangster epics and action that would rival Cameron and the Wachowski's. He has confidence that many don't have and it shows as he takes everything he can, mixes it all together and churns out brilliance. He has so much more on his plate that many directors but manages to pull everything together with seamless precision. It often moves quick but with a 2  1/2 hour running time, you can't be blamed for being a bit lost. That's why a repeat viewing is a necessity.\n\nThere's only so many superlatives I can unload on The Raid 2 without sounding repetitive. It is the new martial arts classic for the next generation. It may not be seen as much as it should or viewed as nothing more than a useless bloody gore fest but that is ultimately their loss. For those willing to take a cinematic journey like nothing that has ever been experienced before, it will stick in the front and back of your mind like a punch in the face. I haven't been this blown away since The Matrix and that's one of my top five favorite films of all time. It's as groundbreaking and thrilling just as The Matrix was, but it will take a slower path to immortality. Its cult status will grow and eventually be appreciated by many who have missed it the first time around. I don't think I have seen a more gorgeous action movie and I'm glad someone decided to mesh together drama and action that's shot beautifully with loads of emotional depth. But maybe it's better this way. Seeing unprecedented genius can be hard to handle the first time. It always takes a while for it to ferment and be appreciated by the masses who have altered their mental palettes. Five gory fatalities out of five.",

            "content": "After the success of last years The Raid, it was inevitable that Gareth Evans would give us a sequel. The Raid 2 however is different as it does have an actual plot, rather than one man versus the world. Our hero Rama (Iko Uwais) is back as the Indonesian policeman who is a master of Silat, an Indonesian martial art. Rama is recruited to infiltrate the gangs running Jakarta, and find out who are the corrupt police and politician's involved. It's a fairly standard gang warfare plot with power struggle issues and potential new bosses waiting in the wings.\n\nWhat we get now is all the action of The Raid, but with a bit more purpose and context. There are some massively brutal fights and battles, ridiculous amounts of carnage and enough bodies to make you want to open up a Jakarta undertakers.\n\nThe choreography of the fight scenes and the fluency of the fights are amazing, and something big budget films should look at and up their game. The only criticism is the same as all martial arts films, why oh why do the all queue up to be beaten up and killed? Just ambush the fuckers or turn up to a fist fight with a gun.\n\nThe running time is a little bit too long and some of the fights are totally unbelievable but apart from that it's a fantastic action film. Also look out for Baseball Bat Boy and Hammer Girl, an excellent double act you wouldn't want to meet in a Jakarta alleyway.",

Iko Uwais is so unbelievably skilled as a martial artist that I think I just sat, wide-eyed, in awe with my mouth hanging open for two hours. The fight scenes truly are like visual poetry. Evans does a brilliant job not just with directing and writing but also with editing. He really lets us see the action. Compared to the first one, the sequel has more story and it gets more epic, including an awesome car chase sequence. That said, there's something appealing about the simplicity of the first one. It never let up. Whereas, this one takes a little while to get going. Still, the final 45 minutes are through the roof. Love the collection of baddies and the body count is more insane than the original, with more gore and extremely violent deaths.\n\nThat said, it's important to note that these films are part fantasy. Evans sacrifices realism in order to follow the conventions of the genre, In reality, more characters would simply shoot our hero dead with a gun, instead of fighting him one at a time. But where's the fun in that? Likewise, some of the acrobatic fights (in the car for instance) continue to an absurd point. But again, that's part of the appeal. Like Scorsese said in regards to John Woo's ridiculous set pieces, they are poetic action films. It's a celebration of the genre. Simply put, I doubt I've seen better fight scenes in a movie than in Raid 2. And isn't that why one would watch it?",

The little humor thrown in (the two minutes of everybody talking in English at the business meeting lol) , the \"omg did that just happen\" and the constant smile you have during the movie.

(when you actually have to have an internal debate which one you liked better, it is always a good sign)  Honestly I think action movies are ruined because Welsh director Evans puts such a labor of love in these movies; the will to succeed and deliver exhilarating experiences people haven't had at the cine-plex or on their couch before is a wonderful refreshing site to behold.

Sure, a film like this will only hit hard with martial arts, action, foreign film and violence aficionados, but by god if it doesn't just hit that right chord inside you I don't know what will.\n\nIko Uwais returns as Rama, the cop turned undercover cop in the second coming to weed out his brother's killer and ultimately, a rat infested underground full of dirty cops and gangsters.  The plot is certainly over-the-top and pretty familiar with the certain tropes you'd expect from a gangster flick, but what Gareth Evans does correctly is he doesn't go too far outside the box.  He's not trying to rewrite any rules here.  You've got the son who wants to take over the business from a father who won't give it up.  Two warring factions.  One man stuck in the middle.  Clean. Classic. Bloody.\n\nThe action is top notch.  Granted, I will point out there were a few cuts that didn't quite gel as seamlessly during some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes toward the end of the flick and I'm almost sure some of the dialogue wasn't perfect on the subtitles, but let's forgive these small nuances.\n\nWhat Evans did with the first film and continues with the second is the authenticity of the sound and gruesome disfigurement of limbs during the fights.  Everything pops.  It was longer than the first.  I wouldn't go as far to say better than the first even though my rating is half a star better the second time around.  The video game mentality of having 'bosses' and 'mini bosses' that Rama has to go through just compounds the nerd inside me until I'm giddy in my seat with glee as body parts are broken and blood is spilled.",

Merely 2 years later and not only has he expanded on the story but hes also made a film an extra hour longer, more violent, intense scenes that will shock your senses and of course a proper narrative. Not that the raid suffered from being a basic film and not allowing you to breathe, but when placed in compareson with Dredd its narrative was extremely weak. Here we start of literally as the previous film left off. Rama's brother is killed and is then offered only 1 way out of the trouble he has mannaged to dig himself into, working as an undercover agent, who infiltrates a gang family and ends up protecting them, while missing his child grow up. As all this is going on there is also a couple of sub themes at play, one with a segment containing the fight coreogrepher of the film as a character out to kill people in order to pay money towards his child, this does add a bit more going on and is not completely irrelevant, but it could have been bypassed and the film wouldnt have really lost anything apart from a slight distraction. The film is glorious to look at, the sets and locations are wonderful and crisp. enviroments suit the tone of the scenes and battlegrounds and each action sequence does a good job of not being too much of the same, dawning a different fighting style or pace dependant on the surroundings. My one major grip with the film is that although the cinematography and fight sequences are wonderfully realised there are far too many points when the camera looks like it is being operated by someone with parkinsons disease. It literally jerks everywhere and at points not only does t become sickening but actually being able to tell what is going on half the time can be difficult, especially during a prison fight sequence which is tense but fucked if i know what was going on half the time apart from people just being battered sideways. luckily the inclusion of a lot more dialogue adds some weight to the madness and our characters have time to develop... kind of... see I understand the tortured character of Rama or Eke but there so busy trying to be a badass that they come off as slightly flat, not that your really looking for oscar winning performances here, their physical work does most of the talking but a bit more character development could have replaced a couple of fights and we would still have a lot to chew on. Oh and by the way, this film has one of the best car chases i have seen in a VERY long time. The raid 2 improves upon the original, everything is bigger in comparesson, yes it is a heftier chunk of meat to swallow but you will be left totally raped by the bombastic and violent images.",

            "content": "Whereas THE RAID: REDEMPTION was a pure action film with a serviceable enough story to maintain the relentless onslaught, THE RAID: BERENDAL is a sprawling mafia epic filled with captivating characters, an intriguing story and some of the greatest action ever put to film. THE RAID: BERENDAL picks us two hours after the end of the first one and follows our hero form the first film Rama and his quest to expose all the dirty cops that have been bought by the mob....Or so we are supposed to think that's the story. Rama infiltrates this crime family where he befriends the son of the mob boss and from then on we are following the \"bad guys\" and actually sympathizing with the son who only wants the chance to prove himself to his father.\n\nRight off the bat if you don't have a penchant for excessive and unapologetically gory violence do not see this film as there is (to quote director Gareth Evans) \"over an hour of action scenes. The first film was an hour and forty minutes but this epic spans two hours and twenty eight gripping minutes filled with unrelenting action and engaging crime drama. Gareth Evans set out to improve his first film and while we all thought he was only focusing on pumping up that action he (unlike many Hollywood directors) truly understood what makes a sequel worth the audience's investment rather than amusement. Any director can amp up the action of a sequel and all it a day but it takes a truly skilled filmmaker to know his material and take every aspect and elevate it to someplace few have thought it could reach. This film is so much better than it had any right to be and I'm sure fans would have been singing its' praises if it were two and a half hours of just action but now we have even more praise for the intellectual aspect. Like the recent CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER did with its' story and characters; it took the material and added tons of new cooler action but also reinforced the material that can truly carry or sink a film.\n\nThis is a fascinating film that stands alone as a crime epic, an action extravaganza and a worthy character drama. THE RAID: BERENTHAL not only includes some of the greatest action ever but thanks to Evans' treatment and care of the audience, giving them something more than just violence again, it is truly one of the greatest action films ever made. RATING: A-",

There are a good 10 or more large scale fight scenes throughout the film starting with a prison courtyard brawl which is ultra violent and sets the tone for the rest of the fight scenes to follow.\n\nThe final fight scene is by far the best movie fight of all time. It's 1 on 1 in a kitchen and lasts about 10+ minutes and all I will say is that is one of the most epic things I've ever seen.\n\nWill definitely be going to watch again!",

Fight scenes went beyond the norm, combining state of the art martial arts sequences, with some of the most interesting environments and creativeness imaginable.\n\n'The Raid 2' looks to follow this by venturing beyond the solo building that hosted the original. At first this appears to make the directors job easier, although I actually think it made it more of a challenge. Part of what made the first movie unique was its confined setting, where tension was easily built. Its storyline was also so linear, yet easy to follow, meaning all of their efforts could be put into producing the best action scenes imaginable. As many others on here have said, the first half of the movie definitely shows signs that the directors had more of an expansive story to focus on. Various characters were clumsily introduced, meaning that I found the first hour quite difficult to follow. There's no denying the action sequences were still good, although they seemed to occur randomly, and failed to live up to my expectations.\n\nThe second half however is something else. The final hour and twenty minutes or so will fly by faster than the highlights of a stoke v sunderland game. The story takes a drastic turn, which immediately clarifies how the rest of the movie will play out. The creative fight sequences that I loved from the first movie returned, and you are treated to some truly unbelievable action scenes. The final fight scene will likely leave you in awe, as it seems to go on and on and on, only increasing in intensity and drama.\n\nThe final half of the movie is what fully justifies its star rating, making the entire film well worth watching.",

Woohoo!)\n\nCar chase scenes seemed to need more tight editing. Every time we return to Rama's car, it feels like they were replaying their fights a couple of times. I thought the guy on his right was tied up with the seat belt, but no, the next time we see them he got tied up (again) during the fight. Nevermind the odd geography (who cares if they can transport themselves from south Jakarta to \nnorth Jakarta just though a tunnel and back, or drive in oddly empty otherwise jammed roads!) but the speed of things, the rush.. Just wasn't quite there. I DID solely go to see the Raid 2 to watch them ruin a bus-way station, and it was awesome!\n\nThere's a sense of too many story arc, back-stories, too many characters, too many names we can't remember. Too many for one movie. \n\nEverybody next to me was wondering who Reza was when the Japs mentioned that he was in Bejo's restaurant. I can see how the back-stories help, but by doing them, we lose focus of the main  characters and each story becomes somewhat underdeveloped. Hammer girl and baseball guy were one example.. Are they lovers? Siblings? Friends? Frenemies? (And where can one get a baseball bat in\n a non-existent baseball community in Jakarta? Nevermind, lets not nitpick.)\n\nI get the idea to use Indonesian sounding names but Uco? Bejo?? Can't the young master, son of a mafia boss be named something cooler or modern? Ah, don't nitpick.\n\nThe kitchen fight was superior than that of any other i've ever seen.\n\nOtherwise, the too ambitious movie presents a convoluted story and characters and felt somewhat unfocused. I did not get the same adrenaline rush as i did in the first movie, ie. remember that scene where Rama was hiding behind a wall and almost got killed by the sword that nipped his cheekbone? (Yes, notice the scar on his cheek, good detail!) I almost died watching that scene. But there, there's a sense that Rama won't die. Either because he doesn't, or because the scenes just weren't life threatening enough? I really don't know, but i was calm. And you don't want me calm during a life-and-death fight scene.\n\nOverall: great fights,  Convoluted mob plot with lots of pit holes, the 1st one was better, but I'm not saying this was not good. I'm saying go see it and you will enjoy the amazing action and \nfight scenes. 7.5/10",

And the villain is such a stupid man you almost can't believe it, ruthless he may be.\n\nbut I watched this film in part in the context of other action films, especially ones as of late.  Evans moves his camera and his actors fast, and edits himself.  Somehow though when the handheld camera ops move things and go handheld, it has purpose, it has drive, you know where everyone is in relation to one another, and there is not, far as I can tell, a drop of CGI blood spilt.  And it's not for the weak at heart.\n\nThis is bone crunching, throat slitting, gun blasting, car smashing, set demolishing and head splattering violence.  And I think a major point of the movie, in its theme as well as the physical nature of it, is this: you fight someone, or tens, or hundreds of people and kill many of them, it never ends.  The violence here is the thrilling \"Movie\" kind of violence that is fun, but this come a closer to a visceral mania and danger one might see in Peckinpah, as opposed to a Taken or James Bond movie.  And its with martial arts too.  Oh boy it is.\n\nEvans is indulging here, maybe more so in the story than the action, which is saying a lot.  I didn't expect to get majorly involved with the emotional life of the characters, but these are well drawn people on the whole.  Of course there are also the types, the strong willed but (with a code) fair crime boss, his terrible progeny, and sinister side characters.  These people are also here to accentuate the hero, Rama, who we are with every step of the way just for how deep undercover he's put into this crime family.\n\nAgain, nothing revolutionary with the story, but there is enough there - as there was in the first Raid - to keep a foundation for the action to spring from.  And Evans isn't fucking about here - this is action and fighting that is meant to push the envelope for what you can do in a fight, how far you can take the actors and stunt men until (or maybe it becomes) a cartoon springs forth, including a henchman - and henchwoman - who look closer to being in a Tarantino flick with a bat and hammers ready to kill. brutally.\n\nWe believe this main character as a person who really, actually, doesn't want to fight, but the situations he's put in... well, watch your head.   Or your arms, or legs, or neck, or feet, or most other body parts.  I believed he could do this, as in the first film, and it drove everything else to come.  And as just a regular actor he can hold his own, within the dimensions of the script as it is.  \n\nBut what do these never-ending cycles of violence portend? even the ending seems to indicate it just won't stop.  The Raid 2 plunges us through hard boiled genre fiction into a completely corrupt society And if you don't know how to fight, get out of the kitchen (no, really, get out, those two gentlemen have something they need to so).  The Raid is a superb example of what the genre can hold, and if it has imperfections in little moments it gets everything else so right that it's hard to carp.  Its that overused critical expression - jaw dropping.",

It's a shame because it looks fantastic and the fight sequences are some of the best I have ever seen but great action sequences don't make a great film. The original succeeded so much because it had a strong straight forward narrative. By opening up the setting to the whole city the sequel now feels convoluted and at times pretty dull. The are moments of awe and amazement, the whole prison sequence is superb, but as the film goes on and we get more and more action sequences and it eventually becomes, dare I say, boring. It's hard to describe, I was fully aware that was witnessing was some of the best choreographed action that I had ever witnessed, but because I had already seen it 16 times previously it began to grate on me.

So a bunch of friends and I descended on the theater to see the spectacle. \n\nIf you haven't seen The Raid: Redemption (The first movie) here is a quick recap: \n\nIn the Raid, a crew of cops storms an apartment building filled with bad guys, gangsters, drug dealers and kung fu masters apparently. The main character, Rama (Iko Uwais), is one of the cops and also a bad ass brawler. It takes about five minutes for the building management to go over the PA system and tell all the tenants that is they kill the cops they will get free rent for ever... Insane violence ensues. Rama eventually finds out his lost brother is working for the bad guys in the building and they team up to survive the fight. If you like hardcore action then this movie is for you! \n\nNow that we are on the same page The Raid two picks up right where the first leaves off. Rama gets inducted into a small unit trying to seek out the corruption in the system, they insert him into the prison system so he may get close to a mob boss' son, Uco (Arifin Putra). During a brutal prison riot he saves Uco's life and the movie instantly teleports us two years later. Rama is getting released from the slam and is picked up by Uco and brought to see his father. Rama gets hired as muscle and becomes part of Uco's crew. The plot from here out (like the first movie) is kind of cookie cutter.\n\n ********** SPOILER ALERT! Skip the italicized portion! **********\n\n\n Uco wants to take over the family business, his dad doesn't believe he is ready and too impulsive, Uco gets pissed and starts acting on his own, tries to take over the city, kills his dad and a bunch of Japanese gangsters then goes after Rama when he finds out he is a snitch. Everybody kills everybody. THE END. \n\nThe plot of this movie is not the reason to watch. The Raid offers some of the most hardcore and insane action put to film to date. The movie feels like a video game, each successive fight scene ups the ante in difficulty and brutality. It hurts to watch, even the most jaded person will be cringing a few times during this film. The choreography is intricate and intense and the Boss fight bad guys are interesting. Two of these are Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man. [No kidding, these are their names]\n\nUnfortunately, they don't delve into their past but I assume these two are a brother/sister assassin team. One of those a bit to close for coworkers, not \n\n\nI think the best thing I can show you for this movie is what they threw out. A few weeks before the limited release the production sent out a deleted scene for the movie. Watch it here. After watching that consider this: They cut that scene out of the movie because they didn't need it in the face of all the other insane scenes they left it.",

This is definitely one of the most gory movies I have ever scene, but it is sheer entertainment! I am docking the move slightly for there being an over-abundance of action as opposed to a developed storyline, but the action is extremely satisfying. There is barely a dull moment in this film, and it shows a darker side of human nature and mobster politics.

            "content": "So the Raid 2 just premiered at the Atlanta Film Festival....My mouth has dropped to the floor... Gareth Evans, director of the highly flawed Merantau and the Raid: Redemption, brings us the Raid 2, the vision Evans had originally wanted for the Raid.  Let me say this...this film not only exceeded my expectations, which were low due to the lower score, it shattered it.  So far, this is the best film I've seen all year, and it's truly a special film.  There's a reason 94% of the audience loved it.\n\nThe Raid 2 picks up just after the events of the first film and it's intense.  In the first shot, we meet this ruthless gangster named Bejo.  It takes one scene just to show how awesome and vicious he is, though he doesn't get his hands dirty in said scene.  You just know he's not a guy you would mess with.  I would discuss further on about the plot, but I firmly believe in the thought that I shouldn't give out any plot point.  I walked in with a fresh mind, and came out amazed.\n\nIf there was a problem I had with the first film, it would definitely be the dialogue and story.  The dialogue was really uninteresting, and very scarce, which made it impossible for me to connect with the characters.  The story felt more like a Die Hard rip off, which also threw me out of whack.  However, this film improves upon the first, especially in the story department.  The story can seem a little too convoluted at times, as many characters are introduced and it's tough to follow who's who, especially cause the language barrier.  But I love those types of films.  Makes me want to rewatch it more and more.\n\nI will purposely leave this review short, just cause if I continue to babble, I might spoil something.... So overall, yes, this is an improvement over the first film.  The story is more ambitious and daring.  The acting has been improved upon, especially by Iko Uwais, who doesn't rely on his skill of martial arts as much as true acting.  He brings depth to Rama as a whole and it he makes the character much more likable.  The dialogue is much much MUCH better than the first film.  Just think, Martin Scorsese making a kung fu movie and you have the Raid 2.  Looking forward to what more this team has coming for us.",

As you may imagine this is when bones become crushed, limbs snapped in half, throats slashed and the occasional head smashed against a wall. With the likes of characters named Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat man its clear things will get messy. The script is well known. Two opposing gangs break their lengthy peace when corruption begins flowing. The depth of the characters is complex and disturbing as they slash their way from one scene to the next. The fighting is a ballet of bone crushing madness that often goes from one sequence into the next without flinching or slowing down. \n\nGo into Raid 2 cautiously, the extent of the violence is raw madness in a world that deems it necessary. This movie will not be for everyone and soccer moms most likely need not apply. For me this is the type of movie that presented action like nothing seen and may intrigue the viewers in the best possible way.",

Everything was contained in one building, but the Raid 2 requires more drama and interesting characters because it is a sprawling and epic gangster film.\n\nUnfortunately Gareth Evans doesn't know how to handle characters and drama. Even if the action sequences are fascinating, the characters aren't. The tone often switches from hyper violent action film to intense gangster drama, and it feels like shifting without the clutch. \n\nI know there's a crowd for this film, because the critical community seems to love it.

I know it became this big thing for a short period of time. But I assumed and I still do that it doesn't matter so much. For all in tense and purposes its an action movie and that generally doesn't make a difference. But that's neither here nor there because now that iv'e seen the sequel I'm certainly going to go back and watch the first.\r\n\r\nOne assumes this starts off where it ends with 'Rama' (Iko Uwais) beaten but in tact, he's made an offer by a police officer to infiltrate a criminal underworld and weed out the corrupt police officer as well as take down the criminal syndicate. Things move quickly and at first with little information thrust into the prison and then introduced to 'Bangun' at a quick pace. It suits the film and makes sense, there's little time wasted at all. The story isn't the best, it's essentially a revenge film but it's the choreographed fight scenes and inventiveness that make this film great.\r\n\r\nEven saying that, the story isn't bad. It plays out well and some of the actions and dialogue prove interesting. There's a 'Tarentino' like flavour going here as well - with characters that have very specific traits. There's a blind girl with hammers, a guy with a baseball bat and ball and somewhere who matches 'Rama' blow for blow. These are things I remember and it helps separate it from other martial arts films. Having not seen the first one I can't really comment whether or not the fight sequences are different and diverse enough to separate them. I can only view this a fresh experience and they're at times amazing. There's a kinetic speed, efficiency to them and importantly an energy to the way they're shot by the director. It's not just a case of, they're well choreographed they're also well put together and shot, making you feel each punch and create an intensity.\r\n\r\nSome may find viewing it a bit queezy, even though I knew it would be violent I didn't expect it to the extent of this. But a high level of violence doesn't bother you and you're into your martial art or have seen this first one then this won't disappoint. While the story is just serviceable and not much interesting the action sequences are some of the best iv'e ever seen. While most action films these days an over familiarity this does not, the speed and power here rises it above everything else in the genre from the best years.",

After the success of the first one, and a few story changes to integrate the surviving characters, Evans has finally made the movie he always wanted. And it shows.\n\nThe Raid 2 is superior to the first in almost every way. The story is far more intricate this time, a tale of two major crime syndicates teetering on the brink of war. The action scenes have been enhanced as well, bigger in scale than anything in the first movie, and considerably more brutal. Suffice it to say that the squeamish need not apply.\n\nThe Raid 2 is better written, better acted, and better filmed than The Raid, and is the best action film I have seen in recent memory.

I loved The Raid: Redemption, I thought it was a great action movie that was perfectly paced. I was waiting for them to make a sequel and this year they made it and I saw it and I loved it. The Raid 2 took everything from The Raid: Redemption and just made it better. The action, the acting, the pacing, the editing and the direction were all so well done in this movie. Gareth Evans can direct action movies so well because he makes the fight scenes brutal and realistic. He also puts a lot of long takes in the movie without cutting, which was really impressive. Plus he didn't put any shaky cam in the movie, which was great because I absolutely hate shaky cam and I hate that a lot of directors put shaky cam in their movies, but The Raid 2 had no shaky cam, so that gets a huge plus from me. Gareth Evans is a great director and I hope to see him in the future doing more action movies. Seriously, I can't stop talking about the action in this movie, it's so freaken good. Every single action scene in this movie was amazingly choreographed and I'm sure every action scene in this movie will remembered for a long time. Right from the awesome prison yard fight scene till the very end the action was intense and amazing to watch. I would even say The Raid 2 is the best action movie I've seen in a long while; it's not the best movie, it's just the best action movie. The movie itself is still great, but the action is what made it awesome. Other then the action this movie had some pretty damn good performances, like Iko Uwais returns as the main character Rama and just like his performance in the first one he was really good, I would even say he was a little bit better in this one. I don't know the rest of the names of the cast members, but I thought they all did a pretty good job, I thought the Hammer Girl was pretty cool, same with the guy with the baseball bat. I think what makes The Raid 2 better than The Raid: Redemption is not only its action, but the story was much stronger. The Raid: Redemption was just about a bunch of cops raiding a crime boss's apartment block, which was still awesome, but The Raid 2 has more to it than that. The Raid 2 is about the main character Rama, who has to go undercover in the criminal underworld to put a stop to the corrupt politicians and police officers. This movie has a much longer length, then The Raid: Redemption and at times the action scenes do seem to overshadow the story, but the story is still there and it's an interesting story. I know many people will be going to see this movie just for its action and that's okay because the action in this movie needs to be watched because it's amazing. I know anyone who loves action movies will love this movie, sure at times it gets really violent, but if you like action that probably won't bother you. The Raid 2 was a fun, violent, well directed and entertaining movie and I'm glad I saw it.",

However, the film has too many characters & plots and as a result is too long by at least 30 minutes.   Where the first film suffered from too little story, this one has too much.  Thankfully, Evans does know how to film action scenes by pulling the camera back & using longer takes so to display the awesome stunt & fight choregraphy (the car chase/fight is a particular highlight).

            "content": "The Raid 2 Berandal (2014): A few years back, a little movie titled \"The Raid: Redemption\" stormed the scene with some of the most violent and memorable fight scenes in movie history. With this sequel, we may have proven that lightning can most certainly strike twice. \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is an Indonesian action, crime epic starring Iko Uwais and a large cast of strong supporting roles. It takes place directly after the events of \"The Raid: Redemption\" where police officer Rama must go undercover to unravel criminal family underworld, dispelling its dirty cops all for the protection of his family and city. \n\nI don't think I've yelled more profanities with glee in any movie so far this year; this movie is an absolute blast! \"The Raid 2\" is nothing short of a modern action masterpiece taking notes from the likes of \"The Godfather\" and \"The Departed\" all tossed into the mix of brutality brought on by its predecessor. Everything that fans loved about the first film is present here but it adds a gritty crime backdrop into the mix that may be hit or miss with some. Personally I enjoyed the plot for the most part but I'd be lying if I felt like it was completely successful. What made the first film such a breath of fresh air was in its simplicity; it was 90 minutes of pure mayhem with a paper thin plot reminiscent of \"Die Hard\". This sequel is better than its predecessor, but what makes it better, also holds it back a touch from being a perfect film. This movie has too many characters and its plot is very convoluted and perhaps too large in scope. There's a lot of dialogue and character names thrown at you all at once making it a tad difficult to follow at first. I appreciate the effort in making a more grandiose action picture but not at the expense of intrigue. Don't get me wrong, this is a step in a beautiful direction for action films everywhere but with a few minor tweaks, this movie could have been utterly perfect.\n\nOn that note, what is executed to complete and utter perfection is the fight scenes in this movie. They are, without a single hesitant doubt, the greatest fight scenes that I've ever seen. The level of choreography, discipline and detail into every single shot of these brutal sequences makes every second pulse pounding. This is backed by an excellent score and crisp/clear cinematography making each fight a dance of death that you won't soon forget. You would think that 2 hours 30 minutes is too long for an action film but because of how well this movie balances the pacing of its plot with its brutal carnage laced set pieces, it never stops being engaging. The cast and especially its lead are all excellent in and out of the action. Iko Uwais is incredibly believable as the badass sole survivor in any brawl and hopefully we'll be seeing more from his talent in the future (maybe in \"The Raid 3\" *wink, wink*). \n\nI couldn't have been more impressed with what I got in \"The Raid 2\". I've heard great things for some time now and despite this built up level of expectations I loved the movie from start to finish. It's hyper violent, unapologetic and visceral to its core. With a few minor plot issues and a lack of accessibility with all audiences, \"The Raid 2\" stands tall as one of 2014's very best. Fans of this particular genre should see this as soon as it comes to your local cinema (due to limited release) with as big of a crowd as you can. General audiences may not flock to it with the same level of admiration as the aficionados but those with the stomach shouldn't miss this treat. You'll never look at baseball bats and hammers the same again.\n\nGRADE: A",

It is that plot though that jars especially in the first half of the film, it's not that it's bad, just that we've seen this kind of thing done to death (and better) in Hollywood and even the small screen. It had me shuffling in my seat wondering if a better sequel was too good to be true. Thankfully around the time they introduce Mad Dog again (how did he survive a slit throat with a broken lightbulb? Same actor cast in different role?) it kicks into overdrive and delivers the goods in devastating fashion. Go see at cinema it's what films like this are made for.",

            "content": "Movie lovers who can appreciate the intricacy of (action) film-making will undoubtedly marvel at this art-piece which can only come into existence by the sheer love of the people behind its creation. For a perspective, the original script for the Raid 2 along with the fight sequences had been developed years before even the first Raid franchise hit the theaters back in 2011-2012. \n\nRumor has it that each of about a dozen gorgeously choreographed fight scenes in this film requires 1.5 months of planning which also includes complete camera movement design end editing, purging the need for story-boarding. The final kitchen fight scene, which I  reckon the most satisfyingly climactic nerve-racking fight sequence I ever witness, was shot over 10 days period. And I think Mr. Evan's unorthodox camera movement plays a big part in keeping the audience startled and perplexed at what they witness on the silver screen.\n\nSo, it really bewilders me that some disoriented critics measure the film out of tune with what the filmmaker is aspired to do: delivering the most kick-ass movie possible. And, it is safe to say that they DO deliver, overstepping their Hollywood's blockbuster counterparts at a fraction of the budget. \n\nIt would be naive to expect writer-director Gareth Evans to present us with an \"original\" story to tell, if there is such a thing. It's not what makes us see this movie in the first place anyway. It is the refreshing feeling of experiencing artistic take on raw violence intoxicated by the exotic and rarely seen Silat style martial-art from the inventive cinematic point of  view of the genuinely avant-garde Wales director.\n\nHaving said that, the storyline is actually engaging enough to perfectly complement the shocking, jaw-dropping, and sometime deliciously comical action scenes. The acting department is equally complementing and much more enjoyable than the first franchise with such hip and memorable characters such as the Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man who barely even say a line..\n\nNonetheless, the fact that it is a subtitled foreign film might explain why many non-Indonesian viewers would be easily lost and find the story too convoluted. Not to mention, Gareth Evans favors his audience by bringing in loads of characters whose unfamiliar names and faces must have saturated their brains' RAM capacity. No wonder why many find segments particularly in the first half of the movie to be dragging even unnecessary while they are actually key to the character development and tension build up. \n\nIn fact, it is one of rare occasions where I believe spoiler would not ruin but add to viewers' experience of the movie. Alternatively, plan to watch it multiple times to catch bits here and there while indulging your senses again and again on the exquisite show of divine cinematographic opus.",

The action is bar none, but it gets repetitive and frankly most of it never forwards the plot.\n\nIt indulges in its ridiculously convoluted plot, where the original was minimalist in its narrative. Entire sub-plots could have been cut, whole action sequences could have been taken out, and the movie would have been better for it.\n\nThe antagonists have nothing on Tama and Mad Dog. The plot is too contrived to make them effective 'villains' and not just another punching bag for Rama to knock out.\n\nRama himself is done a massive disservice in this movie, sidelined on one hand and made an unstoppable force on the other, turning a once interesting character into a boring cliche. \n\nIn the end, The Raid 2 suffers the near fatal flaw of sequelities. While no one can truly match Gareth Evans' action choreography, he made the mistake many up and coming film makers make, fixing what was never broken.\n\nThe first ten minutes of this movie made it clear he thought he could...he was mistaken, and it showed.",

The characters are lively and put on one heck of a blood drenched show and will have you chanting for more, the film is one hell of crowd pleaser and manages to be even crazier and entertaining than the predecessor.\n\nThe Raid 2 hits the target and then some and is definitely worth the price of admission more than any movie out right now if you have the stomach for it and although I enjoyed Captain American: The Winter Soldier, The Raid 2 is far more badass than that flick and has one hell of an leading hero and he doesn't even have superhero powers. People should be lining up to see this film, SEE IT NOW!!!!!\n\nThe performances were all solid and the stunts they do deserve a standing ovation! Iko Uwais, who plays Rama is one hell of an action star and the best of his kind since probably Bruce Lee, he is a force in the action world to be reckoned with and will have you rooting for him every step of the way. Julie Estelle, who plays Hammer Girl is one of the major highlights of the film and has one of the best scenes of the movie and was nice to have woman kick some major ass than just all men, a smart and refreshing move. The other highlights of the film was Very Tri Yulisman as Baseball Bat Man and Yayan Ruhian as Prakoso, they were both brilliantly insane!!!! The list goes on!!!!\n\nDirector and Writer, Gareth Evans should be hailed as the new king of action and crime films!!! Bravo man, bravo!!! After his batshit crazy segment Safe Haven in V/H/S/ 2 and now with The Raid saga, the man validates himself as a very bold director that seems to be getting better and better with his craft and deeper with his writing. He is one of my favorite directors now and I can't wait to see what he throws at us next!!\n\nOverall, The Raid 2 is one of the best sequels ever made that will have everything you want, yet still has you begging for more. The story is grimmer, the action more blood dripping sensational and even more crazy characters, and I loved every second of it!!!! Bring on The Raid 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The introduction emphasises the need for the main character to investigate police corruption but this consequently proves to be a minor aspect, instead concentrating on the territorial conflict between this gangster organisation, headed by Bungan, and a rising threat by the name of Bejo. Unfortunately, the plot just isn't as smart as it is isn't aiming to be. The idea of an uncontrollable son who wants more power or even the emerging merciless gangster has been done before and to better effect. I also found it odd that they used an actor from 'The Raid' (who could not have possibly survived the events that took place) to play another character in this movie. Perhaps it's due to a shortage of skilled people who can perform the stunts required in this series but it certainly didn't help the authenticity of the plot. The constant thrills approach of the first has been substituted for one which includes many more scenes of dull talking. After 20 minutes or so, I felt myself wishing they would somehow find themselves back in a 15 storey apartment building and they could go back to messing shizzle up. \n\n\"But Lewis, where does the four stars come from? All you've mentioned is negative criticisms\". Well, most of these criticisms relate to the first half of the film which was hovering around a 3 star rating. However, the heavy material kicks in after Bejo introduces his three martial arts henchmen into the mix (two of them which interestingly use a metal baseball bat and two hammers as their signature weapons). The first half had fighting scenes which lacked the variety of 'The Raid' but the second half is packed full of sick, creative action ranging from an exhilarating car chase to a final raid of Bejo's restaurant. It's choreography is still unmatched in modern cinema while the final confrontation with one of Bejo's henchmen displays some of the finest martial arts skills you'll see in a very long time. The violence manages to improve from the first as you'll find yourself wincing a lot more at the breaking of arms and legs while there are quite a few shocking moments when bullets are used to give enemies facial reconstructive surgery. The action towards the end is ground-breaking really and this reaches 5 star levels. It almost makes viewers forget about the first half. Nevertheless, as a critic I have to balance its strengths and weaknesses, and so overall its weak plot but top quality intense action means 'The Raid 2' resides at 4 stars.",

            "content": "The Raid had a simple plot that was fairly easy to follow, the focus was more on the action. In this second outing, the focus is definitely more on the plot, and there's more of it. There is more action as well, but it's spaced out this time and there are long stretches of dialogue and exposition in between. Surprisingly, the script and acting is pretty top notch. The best acting here goes to Arafin Putra as Ucok and Iko Uwais as Rama. Arafin is perfectly slimy but still likable as the P.O.S who looks to shake things up and Uwais is still ever the bad-ass as Rama (who gets the shit beat out of him quite a bit in this one, but still manages to stay on top nontheless) even though he's not the only one doing the fighting this time around.\n\nThe action in The Raid was insane, and somehow master action director Gareth Evans manages to make the action/fight scenes in Raid 2 even more insane and brutal than before. I will say there is a good deal of shaky cam here, and sometimes that makes it a bit hard to make out what's going on, unfortunately. However, there are still a good deal of action scenes (I count 5, but that's just one man's opinion) that manage to recapture the brutality and fun of the action in the first film. The highlights this time around are the opening fight in a prison bathroom, an all-out prison riot, a fight in a subway car featuring Hammer Girl, a street fight featuring Baseball Bat Man, a fight on the roads (in cars), and the final 3 fights where it's essentially Rama vs. the rest of the mob. As I said before, while the action/fight scenes are more spaced out here, the action that does ensue will still make you cheer, your head spin, and will leave you absolutely breathless in the best way possible.\n\nBy expanding the world of The Raid 2, we lose the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere of the first film (as I said before though, there are still some action scenes that feel tense), and by spacing out the action scenes and upping the run time ( a whopping 150 minutes), this sequel ends up feeling less tight and focused.  The plot is fairly strong, as is the script and acting. The Raid 2 is pretty different from The Raid, I'd say The Raid 2 works better as a film than as a pure action film. There's definitely more meat for us to chew on here. If you go in expecting The raid, you'll be satisfied but a bit disappointed, so it's best to adjust your expectations accordingly. By taking this film in a different direction than the first, but staying true to what made the first film great (them action scenes) The Raid 2 manages not to be better than the first outing, but just as good as it's predecessor was although in different ways. Both films are masterpieces, and any die-hard action fan would be wise to seek BOTH of these films out. Expect to walk out of The Raid inspired to go forth and kick-ass, and expect to walk out of The Raid 2 feeling beaten and bruised, but rejuvenated and ready for more.",

In fact, Evans has even greater range, channelling such standouts as Park Chan Wook, Nick Refn, QT and Beat Takeshi, in addition, of course, to Woo. Hollywood needs CGI to deliver the stuff Evans shoots live action, and the cinematography is absolutely  exquisite. There is not a poor or prosaic shot in the entire film, and that's usually something we reserve for artists like Scorsese, not genre directors. (When you consider that the bulk of the prison yard riot was a single shot, and one of considerably greater technical difficulty as the the opening shot of Touch of Evil, you start to get a sense of the caliber of Evans, pun intended.) This is a director flexing his artistic muscles, with never a boring moment, and he's someone we're going to be talking about alongside Sam Peckinpah and King Hu, which is about as rarified as it gets--Evans is as much of an innovator. He continually throws us things we've never seen before and he doesn't need a big budget to do it. There is absolutely nothing out there that compares to this film.

Don't get me wrong, when the action does happen it's amazing to watch, spectacular car chases, with epic and brutal martial arts fights but it's the stuff in between that really expands the film.  It's taken more of a Infernal Affairs approach this time around rather than a straight up action flick.\nThe only slight issue I had with the film was they had the actor who played Mad Dog in this first movie also appear in this movie playing a completely different character which was a little weird because I kept thinking this guy ain't supposed to be alive!

            "content": "Hammer time!\n \n\nThe Raid was such an incredible hit that almost the day it came out Gareth Evans announced there would be a sequel, 3 years later here is it. But I suppose the reel question is, \n\n\n\nLet's face it, no matter how much we wanted to believe, The Raid 2 was never going to be as good as The Raid, because the raid was something truly special, it didn't need any glamour; it was what it was, and that was a hyper violent martial arts movie, a film that was as new as it was vintage. Lightening never strikes twice.\n\n\n\nI think one of the main things I have against the Raid 2 is that in the end, it all has a feeling of pointlessness about it, as if the entire 3 years the policeman put into unearthing all this corruption was for nothing, now for me that isn't an ok thing to do.\n\n\n\nThe Raid 2 has another problem as well which is that no matter how well you plan things , with that level of violence and that many fight sequences your finale will never be the high point of the film, however Evans tries his best to keep the blood pumping by giving us one last shock moment in the final 10 minutes. The film feels mute and oddly quiet when put against the rest of the adrenaline inducing feature.\n\n\n\nSee the problem that The Raid 2 has, is that no one is really there for the plot or the story, I see now that my mistake on the first Raid is that I called it out on it's average story, however no one cared for it, all people wanted was blood. But for some reason it seems as if Gareth Evans has heard my cry and made The Raid 2 much more plot driven. This brings problems of it's own because as much as I enjoyed the film I found the entire thing to be far, far too confusing. There are so many narrative strands that almost none of them pay off. The Raid 2 just has far too much going on inside it's own head to make sense. \n\n\n\nA perfect example of this, is that one of the assassins may or may not be homeless and then has this super surreal sequence when he meets with his wife begging to see his child. It just all fits together so awkwardly, I agree it helps flesh out your characters and give the whole a feeling of being a world, but The Raid 2 feels like too many plates all spinning at once.\n\n\n\nAlso the entire film is based on the thread that Rama's brother is executed in the opening sequence, however because we are still getting a grasp on who's who we never quite get what's going on. This is the problem many films have, if you forced a director to strip down his plot to the essentials and told to make a 2 hour film, you'd get The Raid, give him a budget and make his time his own and you get The Raid 2.\n\n\n\nThe Raid 2 also has surreal comical sequences and I'm sure that in it's homeland these wouldn't be seen as funny but overhear it is. There is an assassin who kills people by striking a baseball at them. That is as stupid as it sounds.\n\n\n\nOf courses the flip side of the coin is that Garath Evans makes everything look so spectacular and beautiful that no one really minds if it is all a little bit preposterous. Make no mistake, when The Raid 2 starts getting into it's violence, it becomes epic. I've seen a lot of fights in my life, in movies and in real life, and there were several sequences in The Raid 2 that made me wince and react. \n\n\n\nI praise The Raid 2 for it's ambition, for possibly trying to say something about the world but I condone it for not being able to tell that story or message right, I truly feel that Evans was aiming for McBeth and he got The Merchant Of Venice instead. If The Raid was Drive, then this is Only God Forgives.",

There are at least half a dozen scenes where the only feasible reaction is to laugh out loud with sheer incomprehension at the level of carnage on display, and the level of skill that allows it to be so thrillingly captured on film.

The main issue I have is its pacing, since I'm comparing to The Raid: Redemption. The Raid: Redemption's story is very straight forward: the good guys have to fight their way out. The fight scenes were set up better because of its \"fight or die\" situation. In The Raid 2, the pace slowed down and added more plot. I appreciate their effort in doing so, but it started to feel formulaic. The first 10-20 minutes of dialogue leads to a fight scene, then the next leads to another, and then another, etc. It was kind of a drag, but the wait was pretty worth it. The action scenes and choreography is just a BIT more amazing than the first. The Raid 2 is still a great action film to me and has successfully fought its way to being one of the best action films in 2014.",

            "content": "It's not too often that I feel so energized by a film that I will applaud what I just saw. These scenes usually involve a perfect build to a rousing climax involving a sequence rarely seen on camera before. For many people, the Raid: Redemption did that with its well executed foray into ultra violence; however, I thought it was just ok. I am proud to say that The Raid 2 ups the ante on the ultra violence and climaxes with one of the most amazingly executed fight scenes in cinematic history. It is a demonic ballet of violence.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief intro, The Raid 2 reintroduces us to the hero, Rama (Iko Uwais). Rama's brother, after surviving the original raid, is gunned down by a man named Bejo (Alex Abbad). Since Bejo is connected to dirty cops, Rama is sent into prison to expose the corruption inherent in the system. To do this, he befriends Uco (Arifin Putra), son of a famous Jakartan gangster father Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo). Rama becomes Uco's right hand enforcer at the wrong time: Bejo's growing influence ignites a simmering war between the Bangun and Goto families, introducing the world to \"bum\" Prakoso (Yayan Ruhian), Hammer Girl (Julie Estelle), Baseball Bat Man (Very Tri Ulisman), and the Assassin (Cecep Arif Rahman), who are bound to get in Rama's way on his quest for justice.\r\n\r\nThe Raid 2 learns some lessons from the Raid: Redemption. The first film doesn't valley enough: after each fight sequence, we waited about a minute or two before another one began. In the Raid 2, fight sequences are longer, but so are the valleys. This gives the audience time to relax and rebuild the tension before the next fight sequence begins. In addition, these lows allow for some solid character development and parallel the frustration in multiple characters as they grow impatient of waiting for their time until their impatience erupts into violence. The Raid 2 is longer due to Gareth Evans change in direction, but ultimately it is also much more satisfying.\r\n\r\nIf you are an American action film director, be sure to hire Yayan Ruhian, Larnell Stovall, or Iko Uwais as a consultant for your film. These 3 (2 of them are actors in the film, including the main character) are the primary fight choreographers in the Raid 2. The three excel in creating unparalleled fight scenes among many combatants, or one-on-one. The fights all contain elements of reality: if a bone is broken, your abilities are impaired like a normal person. In addition, each fight has a wrinkle that differentiates it from all the others whether it be location (backseat of a car, train) or weapon (hooks, baseball bat, hammer). Each unique fight builds upon the previous fights until the climax where Rama has to infiltrate a secret meeting. During that megafight, each individual fighter has proven adept at their specific skills, making engagement with our hero an escalating test in skill and technique. This megafight climaxes with a mono-e-mono masterpiece set in a kitchen. The brilliance of this sequence is the combination of artistic, skillful movement and escalation, resulting in a rousing bout that will make most audiences erupt in applause. I was so into the fight I found myself as out of breath as each fighter. Not often is choreography praised in an action film, but without it, the Raid 2 would lose all of its appeal.\r\n\r\nActing isn't a prerequisite for the Raid 2, but the main players do their duty. Arifin Putra deftly portrays Uco as a petulant mostly smart child with anger and daddy issues. There is more nuance in Uco than I expected, making the breaks in the fighting more than just tolerable. Iko Uwais portrays honor and care well enough to make it easy to get behind Rama, even when he is killing a LOT of people. Tio Pakusodewo is also quite good at playing an aging gangster who uses his knowledge for the greater good of everyone instead of just himself. However, any actor involved in a fighting scenes deserves commendation for the effort and realism put into the battles. Fighting is every bit as (and probably more) challenging as nuanced emotional character beats, and each warrior earns all the praise they are sure to get.\r\n\r\nIf we are cut, we bleed. If we are hurt, we cringe. But we still can fight. The Raid 2 understands this, and uses this logic to craft some of the great fight scenes in cinematic history. In the age of Marvel superheroes, it is nice to know that normal guys can generate the same thrill as Iron Man or Captain America. However, I don't ever need to see what a shotgun blast to the face looks like again.",

It's quite visually striking in a few ways.  Some images are captured in a rather iconic way as you might have seen in A Better Tomorrow II or Takeshi Kitano's Violent Cop, though with more color.  Images that are perfect for a good trailer no doubt but elevate the movie overall.  Those are the still-moments.  When things are getting crazy you get incredible views that on occasion have never been done before.  A couple fights that take place inside cars come to mind.  The hits are both given and received hard with excellent use of the environments, such as in Police Story.  The violence gets chaotic and bloody as in something like City of Violence.  A young woman dual-wields hammers for Christ's sake.  The final one-on-one fight made me think about Wheels on Meals, though far more bloody, of course.  You can't count on one hand (or two) the number of great action moments.  There is no shortage.  It's an embarrassment of riches for people who love foreign action like the movies mentioned above.  Gareth Evans and Iko Uwais are a director/actor pair to be feared on par with John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat.  Not having seen the first film will provide some confusion up front, but beyond that the movie is an all-new story.  The Raid 2 is not necessarily original, but it hits every note perfectly -- Gareth Evans took an exam on how to thrill people in a movie and scored a 100%.",

The tale shots forward two years with Rama, who has been in jail for his cover, joining up with the gang. As things spins out of control, so the violence amps up in orders of magnitude. Knives, cleavers, hammers, baseball bats and kitchen sinks (okay maybe not the sink) fly across the screen as two gangs are played against each other. The fight sequences is a visual martial arts feast that will leave you breathless. Evans directs action with the same flair as the first. This is well worth your time and money. Role on 'the Raid 3'.",

Being Indonesian movie, acted, directed, and produced here in Indonesia, it could be the most successful Indonesian movie that successfully represents Indonesia in the world movie scenes.\n\nAfter garnering such positive reviews and financial successes from the first movie, the second one is produced in a much better quality, much more budget, many more great actors, much more visual effects, and much better fighting choreography. In other words, The Raid 2 is simply much better than The Raid 1.\n\nMy Thought on THE RAID 2: BERANDAL (2014):\nOn Storyline (75/100): Not like the first one, The Raid 2 has enough storyline to say that it's a great fighting movie that has content, not just an action movie that solely rely its strength on the fighting scenes. The storyline is actually quiet great and has twists.\nOn Casts (85/100): This movie is very well acted by the main actors. Yes, there are some parts that could have been better. But, I think this movie already provides me with all I can ask for on the quality of the casts\nOn Visual Effects (95/100): Do you know some movies that you couldn't even know how the directors make it? Have you ever gone like \"How the heck do they make it look like that?\"...... Yes, this is one of those movies. All the ruthless fighting and killing scenes are really awesome.\nOn Fighting Scenes (95/100): Anybody who like movies with gory stuffs, ruthless killing, and great martial art fighting NEED TO, HAVE TO, WILL WANT TO see this movie. Period.\n\n\nHonestly, this is one of the best Indonesian movies I have ever seen. Plus, it sells and gains such positive reviews all over the world. It's a very recommended movie to watch, you wouldn't waste on a buck.",

I don't know how Gareth Evans and his crew does it. The sheer realism and surreal action scenes involving hand to hand combat are unlike anything I've ever seen in action films. The camera glides and follows every bone-crushing moment, it makes you jump out of your seat and applaud. Hopefully a 3rd part will be made, I cant get tired of these films.",

Fights are blazing, choreographed with such precision that each death-inducing blow produces an impact across the cinema. Gareth Evans conducts a cinematic plays stringed by excessive bloodbath, his visions might be over-the-top, but they will leave both fans of the action genre and casual audience cringe breathlessly.\n\nThe prequel had some poor unintentionally funny dialogues, even more so if one understood Indonesian. For this movie, the script has been polished and scenes are constructed more consistently. Granted, it's still troubled by some setbacks of usual action movies', but there are more engaging and personal lines to be had. Acting is improved with the addition of Arifin Putra as Uco, the son of mafia boss who is eager to prove himself. The character is ruthless in his actions and also passionately fueled by ambition and greed, Arifin Putra portrays it well with a hint of doubt or maybe even guilt.\n\nAlex Abbad as Bejo is quite harrowing despite his disability. There's a disturbing untrustworthy feel surrounding the character, the fact that he has legion of assassins make him more treacherous. This army of assassins almost seemingly pops out of some Japanese anime, akin to what inspired Kill Bill's or Matrix's. Among them there are not many that stands out in acting department, what makes them memorable are their choice of weapons and the body count they pile with them. A visually impaired girl swinging double hammers in a subway, that's gold.\n\nIko Uwais as the leading protagonist performs respectably. He's a man with good ideology and equal ill fate; it's easy to sympathize for his cause. He has done a good job playing a difficult role, but his strength lies in the action sequences. To say that the battles are brutal is an understatement; these warriors unleash pure mayhem on each other. Every broken bones and limbs are executed with much gusto, blood sprayed from all angles, this may very well be the most brutal thing one can see on cinema.\n\nCinematography is splendid, it's apparent that Gareth Evans was motivated by many Hollywood movies. Scenes are slick, utilizing different camera angles for best view of the action and often time follow it in continuous shot. The cameras seem almost glued to the characters as they rush and rip each other apart, yet they will pan or zoom out just in the right moment for the audience to appreciate the intricacy of the movie's complex action choreography. Its particular car chase scene takes the viewer swirling through the vehicles astoundingly; it's the best chase scene since The Matrix Reloaded. \n\nThe Raid 2: Berandal has refined the plot from the prequel and in terms of sheer action carnage none can rival it.",
