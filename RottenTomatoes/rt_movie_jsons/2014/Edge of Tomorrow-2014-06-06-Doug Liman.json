    "summary": "When Earth falls under attack from invincible aliens, no military unit in the world is able to beat them. Maj. William Cage (Tom Cruise), an officer who has never seen combat, is assigned to a suicide mission. Killed within moments, Cage finds himself thrown into a time loop, in which he relives the same brutal fight -- and his death -- over and over again. However, Cage's fighting skills improve with each encore, bringing him and a comrade (Emily Blunt) ever closer to defeating the aliens.",

            "content": "Scintillatingly boring. The intention, in fact, is to to have the main characters relive over and over and over nearly identical events as they struggle against all knowing aliens who, almost inevitably, look like enormous spiders, ones that always know the heroes are coming. However, the tedious repetition that is unintentional is even more dull. Yeah, Tom as always, is excellent as is Emily and the supporting cast. But reduced to a comic book tedium, my most exciting moment was to know, yes, it's over \u2014not the aliens but the film. That so many critics who are supposedly professional can be dazzled by this astounds.",

Sure you may say the movie takes place in a different universe with different rules and such but that's clearly not what the writer and director's intent was. It's clear the story was attempting to model our real world as closely as possible. And for good reason because with their world very similar to our real world the viewer can relate better which will likely induce more fear. However, there were some cliches that just weren't realistic. Additionally not everything made sense and if I actually cared I'm sure I could think of a couple plot holes. CGI looked very off at times and some scenes were incredibly choppy. The second half was much better than the first. At the beginning I thought the relived scenes would get annoying and repetitive, but they were done well and was one of the best aspects of the movie. There were funny moments, and the concept is fantastic, but it could have been much better. Luckily Emily Blunt is a baddie so an additional half a star just for her.",

Was like watching it in the IMAX theatre.\nDoug Liman is a genius. He can be an auteur but he hasn't realized his potential mostly because the auteur is dead; the only auteurs left are the ones left over from the 1990's. Liman obviously was inspired by a lot of science fiction movies from the 50's. And to this inspiration he brings dazzling special effects. I can hardly think of a movie that looks better than this one; perhaps the only one that comes to mind is Cameron's Avatar. \nAt the end of the day though this movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that works in its favor because it knows what it is; which is, pretty much, a fun blockbuster to be released during the summer. In this respect this movie earns 5 full stars because it knows what it is and it excels and even sometimes breaks ground. \nI'd go so far to say that this movie could be rereleased and rediscovered years from now. I hope that everyone that dabbles in Virtual Reality will give this movie a shot on their VR. Really is a good time in 3D with the sound all the way up.",

These aliens have the power to manipulate time, yet certain people have the capacity to restart their days after dying and return to where they were before, much like a computer game player. or something comparable. They need to find an alien brain that is buried beneath the Louvre Museum in an aquifer. Anyhow, in the end",

Both Cruise and Blunt play roles they are not used to and come up with excellent performances.

The sci-fi technology takes the form of military dropships, shoulder cannons, and exo-skeleton jackets straight out of \"COD: Advanced Warfare\", which enhances the action by giving characters astounding, almost superhuman abilities while everything else is mostly kept the same; Therefore allowing the movie to take a futuristic tone while still being grounded in our own reality. Edge of tomorrow is also supported by a fantastic cast with all-round fantastic performances; Emily Blunt is incredibly compelling in her role as the ultimate soldier, and she gives a an amazing performance as the stoic Rita Vrataski, only being rivaled by the leading man himself: Tom Cruise. The best part of this movie is William Cage\u2018s arc (Cruise), he begins as a selfish and cowardly PR man, and through the events of the movie, we see him literally transform into a totally different person, forged by \"the fire of the crucible\" into a battle-hardened hero.

Tom Cruise is playing a cowardly officer who tries to go AWOL when he is asked to lead troops onto the battlefield, I loved seeing this change of pace for Cruise who plays an incredibly athletic superhero-type character, you can see the fear in his eyes and you know that he fears death more than anything, I really bought into his character and loved seeing him develop his courage to do what is necessary to save as many lives as possible, it was a clear yet satisfying arc. Emily Blunt gives the best performance in her career as a super bad-ass chick who has been battling alien invaders from space, and she is such a good supporting character, she helps to build up and develop Cruise, she contributes to the plot and should empower women with her awesome fighting skills, and I genuinely cared about what happened to her, I was so pleasantly surprised by how good out two main leads were in this film and would love to see them together again. Brendan Gleeson is also a very underrated actor who performs very well in this film, he isn't in it all that much, but his character served a purpose to the story and I just really like his screen presence. I love seeing Bill Paxton as a rude officer who makes jokes and calls people names, that is the perfect role for him and he produces more laughs than anyone else, RIP Bill Paxton, I would've loved to see him in a sequel. You would think that someone living throughout a day and then dying and living through that day again would get very old very fast, but every time they change something a little bit to keep it interesting, and for the most part, it always was, I loved how they explored this concept of coming back to life when you die and would love to see more of it in a sequel. Doug Liman is such a good director, he knows how to helm great action sequences with CGI blended throughout, the aliens in this film look awesome, and they are very worthy foes for our main characters, I think that this rivals the Bourne Identity as his best film, he really struck gold with this one and I am dying to see a sequel to this film. I implore you to watch this film, no one saw it when it came out and no one is talking about it, It is in my top 5 action movies of the 2010s and I am still waiting for a long-overdue sequel.",

I rented this as critics said it was a must- see sci-fi movie. They were right.\nSPOILER: We defeat the aliens in this movie's concluding world-line. But oddly enough though Cruise dies yet again doing such, he reappears alive only to look up and find the movie's heroine to get to know her all over again without aliens interfering. So the ending is a tad confusing. How did our hero survive death in the world-line where the time-warping alien entity was already blown to bits? Did Cruise really die as he lay in the organism's blood and guts? Did the near-dead Cruise somehow gain a final time warp? Who knows? Who cares really? It's sci-fi at its best.",

Repeat: Spiderhead) See IMDb for more information). While Tom Cruise can get a little old and annoying, much like Brad Pitt (Why is he always eating something in movies!). But the story was outstanding, incredible world building. It also really makes you feel like the aliens actually pose a threat. Almost like the Combine invasion of Half-Life (Half-Life - 1998, Half-Life 2 - 2006, Half-Life 2: Episode 1 - 2007, Half-Life 2: Episode 2 -2007.

Great concept, fantastic execution and a great two hours of entertainment. Edge of Tomorrow is Groundhog Day in a science fiction setting- to a beat. But that shouldn't discourage the viewer from thinking this will be a predictable film. The humor element plays a great part and adds to the zing of the action scenes. Acting, as expected is good with Cruise doing what he does so well- run, jump, smile, kick, punch. Emily Blunt is a great actress and brings a freshness to the role of the lead female. The special effects aren't heavy, but they are used well and assist the story instead of the other way around. Doug Liman is an exciting director and boy does he bring his best to Edge of Tomorrow. If you like action or sci-fi movies than this is a must watch. ",

            "content": "What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliche. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.\n\nFirst of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the \"full metal b****\" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.\n\nGoing back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.\n\nThe Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.\n\nThe premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an \"Alpha\" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the \"ability\" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of \"hair\" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very \"us vs them\" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.\n\nYou'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.\n\n8/10\n\n*This review is from 2015.",

Well I remembered liked Edge of Tomorrow back in the day, so I just read the manga and bought and re-watched the movie. I'd say Alita is certainly the better adaptation, while LDE: The Edge of Tomorrow is just a good movie that is based on a manga. It's too different to be considered an adaptation, and it's two different names only further clarifies that. \n\nWhile I do fall into the typical circumstance of enjoying the source material more, it doesn't affect my view of this movie (because it doesn't claim to be the same title or anything). I think this movie and it's screenplay really made the story/concept it's own, which was quite accessible while being very niche at the same time.  \n  \nThe baddies have a cooler design in this movie too.",

I went to see this with some friends expecting a \"typical action film\" (just something to pass the time) and we all left the theater saying \"wow, that was WAY better than I thought it was going to be!\" By the second time I watched the film I realized that I loved it.\n\nFirst, the characters. Blunt is clearly the highlight of the film here--every scene she's in and every expression she makes is incredible, she acts out her character fantastically and you get the sense of the story she must have gone through without the film having to spell it out for you. Cruse also does well and the film gives his character a very drastic (while also believable) character arc. You see his highs and lows, moments of avoidance, moments of acceptance, and mostly just moments of sheer trying things over and over again until he finds a solution that works. But the film does this in a PROGRESSIONAL manner--rather than seeing the character go through his days sequentially and chronologically as some time-travel films do this movie wisely assumes the audience understands the general concept and chooses to skip the repetition entirely. The film is constantly pushing forward so you're seeing new things--we still see the characters struggle and fail, but you see it more on their faces and through their skill in combat more than the film having to show you every single second of every single reset. Sometimes it even uses the resets to comedic effect, it's all quite cleverly done!\n\nAs for worldbuilding, the alien design is fantastic. It's so organic and mechanical, threatening but sentient. It's a great design and a nice change of pace from more humanoid or simply \"monster\"-like aliens. You can clearly see how they're a threat but instead of just being \"monsters\" you also get the sense that they think and understand, which only makes them even more dangerous to humanity. The mechanic of how the time shifts happen, too, is quite clever (if a bit lucky for our protagonists), and serves the plot well. \n\nWhen it comes to practical effects there's so many explosions and fire and cool looking scenes but the characters pull of the \"look\" of those giant mecha suits quite well. I can't help but assume that must have been a practical effect because it LOOKS good. The heaviness to the suits, the giant helicopter blade sword... no dated CGI here, almost every frame of the movie feels real (minus maybe that Louvre run) and it'll hold up great over time.\n\nI'm kind of gushing at this point, I suppose, but this is probably the best action focused film I've ever seen, I've rewatched it many many times and I'll continue to rewatch it many times going forward. Good character arcs, great alien designs, wonderful practical effects, all woven into an interesting story and concept.",

            "content": "The edge of tomorrow is an action-packed movie that is not only entertaining, but it also contains some important themes. One of the apparent themes throughout the movie is choice. Our story follows Major William Cage, who commissioned to serve in the fight for all humanity against what seems to be unbeatable odds. The whole human existence is on the brink of extinction when a species of aliens is hell bent on taking over the world. In the fight for his life, William Cage is infected with the blood of a rare type of this alien species, also known as the alpha. This is significant to the plot because the blood of this creature has caused him to be able to start the day repeatedly, but only after he has died. The theme of choice is clear in the fact that he could do anything else with his days, yet he still chooses to fight on and attempt to stop annihilation. He is the world's only hope, because of the aliens' intelligence they can adapt to each move the humans make and are able to remember every tactic once the day is restarted. But William is not alone, he is accompanied Sergeant Rita Vrataski. She is a ruthless soldier out to save humanity as well. It comes to a point in the movie where it seems that there is no more hope. He has tried everything throughout all the times he has repeated the day. It appears Rita was the one holding him back, and he learns that he must go on alone if he wants to complete the mission. His love for his partner is the one thing that is keeping him back from saving humanity. Coming to their wits end they cannot come up with a plan to overcome what seems to be impossible. In the end he loses this power to restart the day and he finally realizes that this isn't a game anymore. The lives of the ones he loves and even his own are at stake. He swallows his pride and finally realizes that he needs to lead his team into the belly of the beast if they are going to win and save humanity. So, after many loses and coming face to face with defeat he finally does it. Him and his partner survive, and they save mankind. All is well, the day starts over, and the aliens are all taken care of. \n\nThe moral of the story was that he had to choose to survive, and that he had to sacrifice to make it through each recurrence. William had to learn from every mistake that led up to his death, and in the end, he had to overcome his faults. I agree with the moral of this movie, we all must make decisions for ourselves and we must make sacrifices for the betterment of others. Thinking of others above ourselves is a great practice we must all learn at some point in our lives. In the end of the movie William realizes that he cannot achieve success by himself. In the same way we cannot enter heaven with the blood of Jesus Christ. Every time we try to be perfect on our own we ultimately fail, until we submit ourselves. In the movie we see evil being condemned. The heroes are fighting against what is tearing down their world, not joining it. They fight to restore balance and life to a world that is breaking down amid chaos. The edge of tomorrow shows allot of similarities to that of Buddhism. William Cage must relive repeatedly, suffering each day, until he is finally released when he finds the thing binding him to this recurrence. I do not think this agrees with the bible, because it seems like it relates to the idea of samsara and nirvana, how it teaches that life is suffering and can only be escaped when we reach enlightenment. If anything, Christianity is shown through the setting of the movie. There is chaos that is ravaging the world in which we cannot fight on our own. Although there is allot going on they put on an entertaining show, which is a key point to movies. To be honest I do not have anything bad to say about this movie. It was an interesting movie, and I would recommend it to those who are above 13 and enjoy watching action movies.",

With that in mind, it is solid entertainment even if it isn't profound in any way and it proves that Tom Cruise can do much more than just Mission Impossible these days. The one thing that is noticeably innovative is it's view of an alien takeover with aliens not having any conscious, individualistic quality but rather as chaotic beings meant solely for death and destruction as headed by a hidden, central source with ambiguous motives. Overall, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" feels like watching a video game being figured out, but hey, this a fun video game play-through to watch.",

The action scenes, story, progression were all top notch. I also loved the development of the main character from zero to wimp to slightly better, to bad ass, to broken, back to bad ass. I also thought the romance in this movie was done well, not over the top to take away from the story but a welcome addition to making the character and their relationship feel human. Especially during his broken parts where he's relived the same day over and over and tries to save her. The ending was well done while raising the stakes as it was his last life. It didn't feel like a deus machina and I'm glad it was all resolved well. I just wished I got to see more of Emily Blunt and Tom cruise and their interaction towards the end. Guess its up to the imagination at this point. Fantastic movie.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, I would say  let s review this movie  but I m pretty sure we ve done it already.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It s deja-vu all over again. Let s recap Tom Cruise s new film Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nSCOTT: We meet Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), the spokesperson for the United Defense Forces, a combined military force that is attempting to repel an extraterrestrial invasion by a species known as the Mimics. Cage is sent to General Brigham s office and is surprised when Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders him to participate as a soldier in a wide scale invasion of Mimic-occupied France. When Cage resists and attempts to blackmail Brigham, the General has him arrested and sent to an English base as a private about to be deployed to France.\n\nGREG: Cage is outfitted with a mechanical exoskeleton and lifts off in a heli-transport with his new troop of soldiers bound for a D-Day sort of invasion. They crash land and are met with overwhelming forces - as if the Mimic enemy knew they were coming. Cage is all thumbs with his new gear and is quickly killed in combat. He then immediately wakes up back at the base where he was shanghaied and relives the experience of meeting the soldiers, flying into battle, crashing, and getting killed. On his third incarnation, he meets up with Rita (Emily Blunt) - a soldier who is well-known as the fiercest of the Army s warriors. He relates his experiences to her and she tells him to find her when he wakes up. When he wakes up at the beginning of his day again, he seeks out Rita and relates his experiences to her. Much to his surprise, she believes him. She relates that she herself had been infected with the ability to  reset the day  but had lost it.  Rita tells him that he must go into training to help them find the  Omega  alien who, once killed, will destroy the enemy and save the Earth.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I have a confession to make. I m a sucker for time travel movies, especially ones that are smartly made and contain all the elements of a good hero story. One of my criticisms of previous Tom Cruise movies has been that his characters rarely show any change or growth. Because Edge of Tomorrow is one of those repeating time-loop movies, much like Groundhog Day, William Cage absolutely must change in order to break the temporal cycle. So we re given a satisfying story of personal growth that redeems not only the character but saves the world as well. Cage starts out a coward and a fool. We don t like him very much, and when we learn that he is squeamish it doesn t seem likely he can survive countless blood-soaked battles with the Mimics. Dire circumstances, however, gradually transform Cage into an invincible warrior. What we have is a dark Groundhog Day on steroids, a film that works on many different levels, including the all-important emotional level.\n\nGREG: Scott, I m glad you mentioned Groundhog Day because that is the criticism I have of Edge of Tomorrow. It takes the central idea of Bill Murray s film and applies it to war. Since Groundhog Day is such a well-known film, the filmmakers must offer something above and beyond what we already know must happen. We already know that the hero will recycle through his life experiences and learn and relearn lessons until he becomes proficient. Edge does offer one new thread which is the ability for the hero to lose the gift of time travel. However, once this fact is mentioned in the story, you know there has to come a point in the film where the hero must lose the power. It made Edge rather predictable. I ll agree with you on Cage s growth in this film. He starts out as a wimp and a coward and when he finds himself in the predicament of reliving his life over again daily. We see him become a better man. He comes to care for his platoon-mates and falls in love with Rita, the beautiful war veteran. By the end of the film we are treated to a redefined man, one we hardly recognize.\n\nSCOTT: Another difference between this film and Groundhog Day centers on what has to happen for the hero to escape from the time loop. Bill Murray s character has to become a good man, but Tom Cruise s character must do more than just change his nature; he must also destroy the Omega. In both Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, a woman is the central instrument of the man s change. I think it s no coincidence that the woman s name is Rita in both movies. The villains in Edge of Tomorrow -- the Mimics -- are somewhat novel in both their appearance and in their behavioral characteristics. The creatures are a strange spider-reptile hybrid that moves at hyper-speed. They also have the ability to use time travel to anticipate their enemy s next moves. The Mimics are also disappointing in some ways, and I ll let you, Greg, describe why this is the case.\n\nGREG: Thanks, Scott. Apparently the Mimics suffer the same malady that aliens from across time and space suffer from - that of being controlled by a singular, central mind. When Cage destroys the  Omega  beast, all the  Alpha  and  Drone  aliens also stop working. This is a tired plot device that we ve seen in such movies as Independence Day, Divergent, RoboCop, and Transcendence, just to name a few.\n\nSCOTT: Edge of Tomorrow recycles a few old ideas but offers two rock-solid hours of fun and adventure. Tom Cruise turns in one of his best performances in years here, and for a refreshing change he plays a character who evolves throughout the course of the film. Because the movie is very well done and because I love sci-fi stories that utilize time travel effectively, I m happy to award Edge of Tomorrow 4 Reels out of 5. The hero story in this film is appealing on several levels. Cage embarks on a dangerous journey in an unfamiliar world, and to achieve his mission he must undergo a transformation that is satisfying to watch. We re treated to several key features of the hero s journey, such as Cages encounter with Rita, a remarkably strong female character who plays a mentoring role in helping Cage discover his missing inner quality. Rita is the key to Cages redemption and also steals his heart. In my view William Cage is a worthy hero who deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, Greg, the two formidable forces that Cage must overcome are the Mimics and his own weakness of character. There are also a few other oppositional characters who get in Cage s way, such as General Brigham and Sergeant Farrell. Pardon the pun, but the Mimics unfortunately do mimic prior sci-fi extra-terrestrials. But the good news is that the Mimics also have a unique look and intriguing time-shifting abilities. Overall, the villainous components of this movie are used to great effect, leading me to conclude that Edge of Tomorrow deserves a strong rating of 4 Villains out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I really hate to say this, but I didn t have the same impression of this movie as you did, Scott. The graphics and battle scenes are definitely worth the price of admission. But Edge of Tomorrow borrowed so many plot devices from other movies that I can only give it 3 out of 5 Reels. Cage as the hero undergoes a good transformation which is gradual and believable (in the context of the sci/fi elements). But we ve seen this done before exceedingly well in Groundhog Day. One redeeming element that I found in Edge of Tomorrow was Emily Blunt as a completely believable female warrior. We don t see that everyday. Still, I can only give Tom Cruise s character 3 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, we re so far apart on the villains here. The Mimics are such a retread from other movies and have so little to offer other than being evil, mindless, bad guys that I can t give them such a lofty score as you did. I ll grant you that there are other oppositional forces in play, but in my mind, it s the Mimics who are the main villains and they simply don t measure up to other fine villains we ve seen this year (witness The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past). I give the Mimics just 1 Villain out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

A premise like this may sound like some sort of weird B-rated fan film, but Edge of Tomorrow, or All You Need Is Kill, or Live Die Repeat, whatever you wanna call it, is an incredibly enjoyable action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It reminded me of a video game in many aspects which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The way Tom Cruise's character constantly died over and over to the same aliens while slowly figuring out what to do and how to do it to advance further and further in the plot reminded me a lot of retro rouge-lite titles like Ninja Gaiden or like modern titles like Dark Souls. The characters of the movie aren't really as fleshed out as I'd like them to be, the most fleshed of the characters was Emily Blunt's character and even that is only given through small bits and pieces. It's enough for me to not care about the eventual forced romance and for me to care less about the fate of the other side characters, but it is not enough to drag the film down too low. The action, creative idea, brilliant execution, and interesting alien designs help push this movie up as one of the most creative action movies in recent years.",

And unlike so many summer action movies, it actually has a plot and a fascinating one at that.\n\nIt is difficult to talk about the plot of the film without giving too much away, but suffice it to say that humans are at war with invading aliens and somehow Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to relive the same day over and over again. It is Groundhog Day meets an alien war and it works incredibly well. The only fear with this kind of plot is the redundancy of repetition. Fortunately, this film does not have that issue, any scenes that \"repeat\" are different enough that they remain interesting. The war genre, especially war with aliens, opens up the plot to delve deeply into many subjects regarding life, humanity, war, etc. While Edge of Twilight does not delve very deeply into the philosophical themes, it does enough to avoid the tag of \"shallow action movie\" and also doesn't spread itself too thin as to convolute the plot.\n\nTom Cruise puts on a great performance ranging from a charming smile to bouts of distraught rage. The only other character of note is another soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blount).  It is refreshing to see a strong female character in a leadish role - Rita isn't just there to be eye-candy. She a strong fighter, strong-willed, intelligent, and has deep emotions. There are several other minor characters. While the supporting cast is comprised of individuals instead of some generic cookie-cutter characters, they don't get that much screen time; this film is really a two character affair and the two characters are strong enough to carry the film.\n\nIf there is an alien war, it'd be nice to have some action and Edge of Tomorrow defiantly delivers on that front. The first battle scene is especially memorable; quick-cuts, the use of sound, and explosions going off everywhere create a sense of a brutal, chaotic battlefield. It's no surprise consider the director, Doug Liman, also directed the action packed The Bourne Identity. There is plenty of action throughout the entire film. The most surprising aspect was how funny the movie is overall. There are plenty of funny one-liners and physical comedy. What the film does best is to use the repetition aspect of the plot to create some very funny moments throughout the film. Of course this is not a comedy movie and it does get serious and tragic as well.\n\nThe only real issue I had with the film is the ending. It is a satisfying ending on its own, but there was a huge missed opportunity to have an incredible ending. I won't go into detail as to what that is exactly, but I thought I should say something negative-ish about the film as well, but fortunately there really isn't much to say on that front.",

            "content": "In past reviews, I've discussed how the world of cinema has been doling out some pretty decent horror movies lately.  That's certainly true, but the sci-fi genre has also very quietly been churning out some real gems in recent years.  \"Inception.\"  \"Source Code.\"  \"Looper.\"  \"Cloud Atlas.\"  \"Oblivion.\"  \"Predestination.\"  \"Transcendence.\"  Any one of those titles would make for some great, intelligent viewing for those who like a little bit of futuristic depth with their stories.\n\n\nYou could also add Doug Liman's \"Edge of Tomorrow\" to that list.  (Incidentally, this movie came out in 2014, the same year as \"Transcendence\" as \"Predestination.\"  This was a particularly good year for the genre.)  Combining elements of the aforementioned films \"Looper\" and \"Source Code\" as well as a dash of 2001's \"Minority Report,\" \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a perfect example of a film taking some overly familiar elements and doing some very fun things with it.  It's composed of pieces of several other recent sci-fi adventures and has one of the most derivative underlying stories you could imagine, and yet its gimmick makes it seem fresh, unique and highly entertaining.\n\n\nAnd its gimmick?  Why, a \"Groundhog Day\" style time-loop, of course.  Every time soldier William Cage (Tom Cruise) is killed in battle, he somehow wakes up back at the beginning of the same day...before the battle has begun.  It's almost like a stage of a video game; get yourself killed, you simply lose a life and try again.  Trial and error.  (Thankfully our hero appears to have an infinite amount of lives.)\n\nThe battle in question is with a slimy band of tentacled, multi-limbed invading aliens.  Code-named \"mimics\" due to their ability to learn from and ape their enemies' tactics--in this case, mankind--these nasty critters have world domination on the agenda.  To combat them, our world's militaries have devised powerful exoskeleton suits that enhance a soldier's strength, speed, and reflexes.  (Kind of like the suit Matt Damon gets equipped with in \"Elysium.\"  Hey, there's another influence, and another good recent sci-fi flick!)\n\nCage's unique situation would seem to give him an edge as he knows what's coming before it occurs.  However, every time he \"dies,\" he has to start from scratch, and it means exploring every possible angle and scenario to try and alter the outcome.  And when he encounters a fellow soldier (Emily Blunt) that's previously experienced this same phenomenon, he learns that the stakes are even higher than he initially believed.\n\nThe screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (based on a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) is clever and twisty, and it's also chock full of some wickedly dark humor.  Cage finds himself at Death's door A LOT, and there are echoes of the TV show \"Supernatural's\" great third season episode \"Mystery Spot\"; in theory, a character dying over and over again shouldn't be funny--save for maybe Kenny on \"South Park\"--but it certainly can be.  Sometimes it's the method in which he's killed, sometimes it's just the fact that it happens so damn often.  And sometimes there's just a throwaway line of dialogue that had me chuckling.\n\nThe aliens themselves are nasty and intimidating, but they aren't really anything special visually.  But that didn't matter to me as I was deeply invested in the story and the characters.  It didn't matter who or what the aliens were.  They were the enemy; that was all they had to be.  And Liman (\"The Bourne Identity,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\") stages the action sequences with skill and competence.\n\nWith \"Minority Report,\" \"Oblivion,\" and now this, Tom Cruise has started to carve out a nice niche for himself in the sci-fi action genre.  (Even the \"War of the Worlds\" remake had its moments.)  I particularly liked his role this time around as it seemed so different from other Tom Cruise roles.  At the onset of the movie, Cage is a frightened neophyte, a reluctant soldier forced into combat when he'd rather literally be doing anything else.  There's no trace of Cruise's normal \"hero mode\" here, and it was a change of pace to see him act a little...well, cowardly.  It takes dying a few--and by a few, I mean \"a lot\"--times for Cage to find his resolve.\n\nBlunt is also great as the tough-as-nails soldier who won't take shit from anybody, Cage included.  Some of her best moments occur when she's toughening up the wormy rookie...and sometimes that even means literally killing him!  You'll have to see the movie to get it.\n\nThe supporting cast is made up of reliable character actors like Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and Noah Taylor.  All are superb, leaving memorable imprints on roles that are, at their heart, rather cliched.\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a fantastic movie, thrilling, funny, and engaging.  It's a near-perfect example of taking overused subject matter (who would've thought that we really needed another hostile-alien-from-outer-space movie?) and making it interesting again.  If I've said it once, I've said a thousand times: it's all about execution...particularly when your main character is himself getting executed over and over and over again.",

The movie explains why Cruise's character William Cage is stuck in a time loop, although it doesn't make much sense. Once you accept the premise, though, it's a fun ride.\n\nAt first, Cage tries to change the course of the battle he must continually repeat. When that doesn't work, he tries to avoid it altogether. But he ends up dying anyway when the aliens conquer Earth, only to wake up a day before the final battle yet again. Slowly, with the help of one other soldier (Emily Blunt) who has had a similar experience, Cage realizes he must defeat the aliens to escape the time loop. With each loop, Cage becomes a better soldier, slowly gaining more ground each time he goes into battle.\n\nThe training scenes, where Cage dies over and over and comes back to try again, are quite funny. Things get a bit more serious when the heroes finally have a plan to defeat the aliens. I won't reveal too much, but why is it that so many movie aliens are hive creatures under the control of a central queen? The production values are solid and the effects are great. Cruise, for all the weirdness of his off-screen life, is still a very watchable actor. And in the final scene of the whole movie, Cruise says nothing, but gives a look that reminds you he's also a very, very good actor.\n\nIt's just too bad there wasn't a way to drop Bill Murray into this somewhere.",

Also, there are aliens and fighting and all that fun action.\n\nTom Cruise continues to prove his chops here. A lesser actor would have gone all stoic determination, but Cruise keeps his sense of charm throughout the entire movie. Similarly, Emily Blunt manages to portray the tough soldier archetype while still retaining some humanity. Bill Paxton is very entertaining as the stereotypical drill sergeant, and Brendan Gleeson is great as the military commander.\n\nThe film's plot is great, taking lots of twists and turns; it is not as repetitive as you might think, thanks to some great plot and editing choices.

The theological departure of this alien from of a mere conventional destruction force is that parasitical, cancerous relationship that feeds on human's own natural instincts. This is a force of Evil, instead of the force of an enemy such as that in the \"Independence Day\". The problem of Evil is always far more interesting that of the mere opposing Foe.  That is why Star War, Lords of The Rings are far more interesting than Star Trek or Harry Potter. \n\nThe central character is William Cage, a shallow smart-ass who does the publicity for the defending earth army.  A strange sequence of unfortunate event sent him into a perpetual limbo of eternal returns - waking up as a handcuffed deserter, dying in the messy battle field.  Can he learn with each repeat?  In reverse of the \"Groundhog's Day\", Cage tries to live a bit longer each iteration with the help of Rita who also had such repeats.  \n\nThe fleshy body of this story is an action story with technological hijinks, snappy wit and occasional rather blunt dark humor.  Rita sigh at each failed training session \"now you need to die\" and then shot Cage point blank.  Do over!\n\nYet the heart of this story is a striving for meaning in doing one's duty, better each time.  The old Cage chipped away his smarminess and emerging with credible courage and nobility.",

            "content": "In modern cinema science fiction films can be organised into two categories; those which manage to be thought provoking and interesting, and those which skip on development in favour of mindless action. Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise's latest foray into the genre is thankfully part of the former, with its unique take on futuristic warfare.\n\nLightly inspired by and adapted from Japanese novel \"All you need is kill\" Edge of Tomorrow takes place in the not-too-distant future, where mankind is under attack from a species of extra-terrestrials known as mimics, who have overrun Europe. The combined armies of the United Defence Forces with their advanced military exoskeletons aim to push back with the beaches of France serving as the main frontline. From here we're introduced to Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), a propaganda officer who is thrust into combat with no knowledge of experience of infantry combat whatsoever; Cage is quickly killed by the rampaging monsters, but something is amiss as he wakes up and experiences the same day of brutal combat over and over again. From here, the film loops over sequences and then progresses further as Cage, along with the fabled Seargent Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to unravel the mystery and outwit the Mimics before it's too late. While the film's repeating of the initial action scene may seem like a waste of run time, the film uses it sparingly to hammer home the strange and baffling situation Cage and Vrataski find themselves in and this technique is wisely cut down to avoid tedium for the later parts of the movie. Over the course of their mission across France and rural Europe, the dynamic duo teams up with an inquisitive scientist (Noah Taylor) and eventually a rag tag squad of soldiers to take on the alien menace. If there's one gripe with the plot, it's that the mimics don't really get a lot of backstory and explanation; the mystery surrounding their hierarchy and the way they fight is well done, but we never learn much about where they came from, or why they are attacking humanity.\n\nOf course a plot this complex wouldn't work too well without solid characters and the cast of Edge of Tomorrow pulls off this feat quite well. It's a welcomed change of pace to see Tom Cruise in a more vulnerable role this time around; rather than the usual tough guy we usually see Cruise play, here he really needs to go through proper development to become the one to stop the Mimics. Emily Blunt as Rita stands as the opposite; a strong-willed and powerful leading lady who assists and trains Cage, rather than the other way around. The relationship between the two is well developed and builds naturally over the course of the film as both characters are distracted from their attachment to each other by the mission at hand, and the grim consequences for failure. In other roles, Bill Paxton as the drill sergeant is surprisingly charismatic, despite the small role he has in the film. Though the other characters aren't as well rounded or developed enough to make you care about their fates, the film nonetheless delivers where it counts in terms of characterization.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow's bombastic action sequences can be very disorienting; whilst the exoskeletons seem cumbersome at first, they quickly come into their own on the battlefields of Europe. During the action, the camera does shake quite frequently but in this case, it adds to the disorientation and visceral nature of the combat. The music matches this mood, with gritty tones and echoing sound effects during the combat, contrasted against more sombre tracks in the film's final moments. In addition to the strong technical presentation, there's also some great looking stunt work from Cruise and Blunt, which heightens the intensity further. The Mimic designs are also quite unique; the creatures seem to be made up of coils and other machinery pulsing with electrical energy; this gives way to some particularly stunning lighting effects in the film's final act. As far as science fiction films go, Edge of Tomorrow does a fine job with its effects, working to absorb the viewer in the fires of battle wherever possible.\n\nAt first glance Edge of Tomorrow seems like another generic science fiction film, but the complexity of the plot made possible by the bending of time really does add some much needed spice to a crowded genre. If you're willing to engage your mind, this is one science fiction war worth plunging into.",

Instead of Cruise being the bad-ass guy we know and love, he plays a coward who doesn't want to be part of the war against mankind and the aliens. On the other hand, Emily Blunt's character is an awesome, ass-kicking chick who is determined to win, and never gives up. The director of cinematography did an excellent job of giving stunning visuals of destruction, apocalypse and war. It was directed with care by Doug Liman, and the climax was thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat. Do not miss Edge Of Tomorrow on any circumstance. It is fantastic!",

Structured where a single day is in a loop for our time-defying protagonist (performed with wit and charm by Tom Cruise), the obvious comparisons to 1993s Groundhog Day or 2011s Source Code immediately spring to mind. Similar to those films, Liman and his screenwriters have fun with filling their limited time with quirky characters, memorable dialogue queues and exciting (Aliens-esque) action. Most of that is difficult enough to entertain in news ways but the smarts in the story is tied directly to the characters and although we cover a lot of the same ground throughout the two-hour film, it all serves to help our heroes grow. The result is an inspired balance between the adventure of the film (which is great) and the heart-making Edge of Tomorrow that rare action movie that provides the brain and the brawn.",

            "content": "With the exception, maybe, of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, no film has ever so closely replicated what it's like to actually play a video game than Doug Liman's All You Need Is Kill Live/Die/Repeat Edge of Tomorrow. And with the exception of Scott Pilgrim, no film that's either explicity based on a video game or more tangentially based on the idea of video games (like this one) is smarter than Edge of Tomorrow. But in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and being one of the smartest video game movies ever made doesn't necessarily make a movie smart.\n\nThe film is basically a riff on Duncan Jones' Source Code but set during an alien invasion. It begins with some exposition: A crusading species has invaded Earth and taken control of most of Europe. For a while, it seemed mankind was fighting back in vain, unable to kill even one of these creatures. But the famous Battle of Verdun changed the tide somewhat and gave humanity a hero in the form of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who leads mankind in its first victory in this planetary war.\n\nOn the precipice of the next big battle (for London), military PR shill Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown to the wolves by his commanding officer. He's heading to the front line and killed just minutes after figuring out how to turn off the safety on his mechanized suit weapon (think Avatar).\n\nBut wait: Cage is back on a tarmac about to be verbally accosted by his platoon's leader...again. Now he's back on his transport vehicle. Back in battle. Dead again. Alive again. What???\n\nThe reason behind this morbid Groundhog Day doesn't make very much sense, but thankfully, neither Liman nor the film's screenwriting team (Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth) dwells on it too much. Edge of Tomorrow isn't concerned with the why, but rather what Cage and Vrataski do with all that time. It's not a deal-breaker necessarily-the way it just plows through reason. But the fact that it does so in a way that virtually eliminates the film's stakes for the majority of the running time is something no screenplay could recover from.\n\nWhen I say the film replicates the experience of playing a video game, it's because of this premise. Work toward a goal, make a mistake, lose a life, start back at the beginning. It's Super Mario Brothers: Invasion. Occasionally, you'll encounter a boss or hit a checkpoint of sorts, but you'll play the level again and again, finding patterns that advance you further each time. Again, it's interesting to see a talented filmmaker like Liman and stars like Blunt (who's great) and Cruise (who's fine) attempt to mine this material and this style of storytelling for something meaningful, but it's fool's gold they dig up-mindless engery cinema.\n\nAll that said, it's not a boring film to watch. There's solid chemistry between Cruise and Blunt (who has great chemistry with anyone she shares a screen with because she's Emily Blunt and because she's awesome), and there's some clever bits along the way that clue you in to just how many times these characters have performed this exhausting exercise. Edge of Tomorrow might have been more noteworthy if it disposed of the alien thing altogether and asked its characters to solve a mystery or even something hilariously innocuous like a jigsaw puzzle, but big and loud is a business imperative. So this is the film we have, and while it doesn't live up to its potential, it's nevertheless better than most of its ilk. A perfectly watchable, wildly imperfect movie.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/edge-of-tomorrow-review/",
