Tony Revolori is perfect for his role and plays it so well. Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, and Jeff Goldblum are all fantastic and their minor roles.

When it started, it took a little bit to get the plot going and lost my interest a couple of times but then it grabbed my attention as it progressed more!

The film uses comedy which fits the tone of the film perfectly, being careful not to overuse jokes. The fragmented narrative is done to perfection, Tarentino esque with everything just working out amazingly. I was gripped throughout the film although I felt the narrative was confusing in places, it excited me as I wanted to figure out what was going to happen next, showing the skill of Anderson and his pure brilliance as a director and a master of suspense. Anderson's unique way of telling a story always has me, along with most of the audience, in awe at how brilliant he is, especially his use of color and symmetry in every shot. This amount of effort which he puts into his films pays off as he always pulls in large audiences and box office ratings, cementing himself as one of the all-time great story tellers.",

Visually, it's a pastel wonder that although fictional, is based on the coziness that exudes from Central European Christmastime. It's a display of Wes Anderson's style, with perfectly framed and centered shots of pop, pop, pop dialogue that could take place inside of a dollhouse. This is a comprehensive story concerning swindling, high-brow art, inheritance, nostalgia, injustice, the \"immigrant story,\" and Nazism (albeit, a fictionalized version of it). Anderson takes you from 1985 to 1968 to the 1930s with his multi-layered storytelling. The ensemble cast is fantastic and includes the usual Andersonian suspects — Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Adrian Brody, Edward Norton, et al. — but all of these actors hold minor roles. The undeniable star is Ralph Fiennes as the loyal concierge, Msr. Gustave H. I didn't appreciate his performance when I had first seen this one back in the mid-2010s. It's such a distinct performance than his notable roles in Schindler's List, Red Dragon, Spider, Quiz Show, In Bruges, et al. In fact, I don't see a movie before TGBH where he'd have done anything similar. Truly, a testament to his range. \"Gunther was slain in the catacombs\" is the sort of line that, in context, grasps the quintessence of this character. It makes you feel good to watch even when it's covering some pretty dark material. I love this movie. Haven't seen French Dispatch yet, but this is definitely Wes Anderson's finest.",

The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.\n\nAlexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it's never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.\n\n'The Grand Budapest Hotel' boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.\n\nBill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one's taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Gustave's lovers, Madame D mysteriously dies, we follow the adventures of Zero to help M. Gustave escape from being framed and to solve the mystery of who killed her.\n\nA single aspect of the film that stood out to me was the usage of the cameras when filming. Rather than the camera following the actors or leading the actors, the camera was mostly static. This made the film stand out and funny in a sense. It also gave it a more storytelling view which was what the film is based on. Having a static camera that stayed in one place also brought out many small details in the film that you wouldn't usually see in many other films. The usage of a static camera angle presented the many small details showing in this film combined with its storytelling aspect is genius.\n\nWes Anderson's film, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes on a mystery aspect while giving you a few laughs.

(Raph Fiennes) is a well-renowned concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel amidst a war in the 1930s. Gustave is known for making \"friendships\" with the older wealthy women that stay at the hotel. Unfortunately, one of the women Gustave H. is well acquainted with suddenly dies. Gustave H. and Zero (Tony Revolori), his lobby boy in training, travel to the old women's funeral and Gustave H. is gifted with an extremely important painting. Due to its popularity, Gustave H. is framed for the old women's murder and he must attempt to clear his name\n\nThroughout this film, symmetry catches the eyes of the audience. Wes Anderson does this by not only keeping the camera in the center but also placing chairs, tables, people even, on either side of the camera. If you were to draw a vertical line down the middle of the screen both sides would be balanced. Something is satisfying in knowing that the background, or setting, being shown is perfect when the character and what they are going through is far from it. The color palette that is used throughout the film highlight how life is seen inside and outside of the hotel. Because of the war, the are lots of blues, grays, and browns. This highlights the ruggedness of the war.  In the hotel, the colors are more vibrant due to its popularity. The colors purple, pink, and red give the hotel a whimsical feel. What I enjoyed about this film is that it focuses on the artistry of the film. Wes Anderson uses actors that do amazing jobs, therefore as the director, he can focus on the colors, camera, and the overall aesthetic of the film.\n\nI would recommend this movie and all Wes Anderson films for that matter. This story that he gives us in this film is filled with drama and adventure that has a bittersweet ending. The dialogue is also witty and funny with a hint of adult language. The fact that it is being narrated by two different people in different eras is what makes this film feel a bit more real. Yet the cinematography keeps a childlike element that doesn't take focus away from the acting. This film has enough heart and action, but a lesson can be learned as well. I rate this film 3 ½ stars.",

It's clear there's a number of emotional and thoughtful ideas attempted here but for me it just doesn't work. The movie never goes further than second gear and the humour is sporadic not hitting every mark. The star-studded cast feel underused for their abilities. I understand that we're only getting windows into the story but nothing truly hooked me here. The overarching story is easy to understand and there are a number of great settings and visual moods which are done quite well but they don't make up for the lack of entertainment from beginning to end of this movie. Overall, while I understand what Wes Anderson was going for, the overall package didn't provide an entertaining experience for me.",

There are lengthy tracking shots.  There are plenty of stylish pans and zooms.  There is an all-star cast, including several of Anderson's regulars (Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray). To add to all of this, Anderson also includes some black and white footage and, to mix things up a bit, changes aspect ratios from time to time.  It's the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the concierge at an upscale hotel, and his devoted lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), as they elude villains involved in a disputed inheritance and evade police who believe that Gustave has killed his 84 year-old lover.  As would be expected, it's irreverent, visually arresting, and relentlessly entertaining.",

The attention to detail is phenomenal and not a second is wasted on presenting a nearly perfect blend of visual artistry. While its three-layered narratives may seem ambitious, the filmmaker triumphantly finds a balance between friendship, romance, villainous treachery, and politics. Admittedly, one could argue the filmmaker's idiosyncratic direction is style over substance. However, beneath the surface is a melancholic social critique of humanity.

The plot itself was satisfying. A grand tale with high stakes and a satisfying resolution. But the movie really shines with its characters. The lobby boy impresses with his loyalty. The concierge is a fascinating, funny, and complex man. Ultimately my favorite part of the movie wasn't the story itself but rather how the story was told. The movie does not take itself too seriously. All the characters fill out their roles with exaggeration. The villains, exceedingly dastardly and cruel. The lobby boy, steadfastly loyal, almost the concierge's shadow. The concierge, noble, suave, and kind, the very personification of class. As well the pacing of the characters movement is hurried and purposeful to the extreme, adding a comical effect. Overall a fantastic movie.",

            "content": "No one does a movie like Wes Anderson, known best for his perfectly symmetrical shots and aesthetically pleasing coloring, the 2014 film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is one of his best works yet. Though he has faced much critique for having less \"artistic\" films and more \"artful\" films, I believe these specific choices do not lack distinctive meaning and are brilliantly portrayed in this film.  The story encapsulates two main characters, the ones that stand out the most are M. Gustave, played by Ralph Fiennes, accompanied by his bell boy Zero, played by Tony Revolori a first-time major motion picture actor. Alongside a star-studded cast of Hollywood actors, these two wrap the whimsical world of a glamorous 1930s Hungarian hotel into a short hour and forty minutes. Anderson uses the change of lighting and coloring to shift the focuses and time periods in the piece for example, dimming the lights for dramatic effect when the narrator is telling an important detail and switching to warm bright colors when he is speaking of things like Zero's love interest Agatha. Though a center focus may seem unnatural, Wes Anderson uses it to draw the audience away from the story at times to focus on its beautiful framing, tricking the audience into seeing so much more than just the words spoken in the story. The movie may be so appealing because through this language of framing we are allowed to re-live the feeling of a picture book we enjoyed as a child, when stories were not just words on a page but rather an imaginative escape into the world of the written characters, (which makes sense considering this movie was based on book itself). Overall, if you're looking for witty humor, artistic pictures, and a heartfelt  story, look no further and enjoy the hilarious adventure Wes Anderson paints in the Grand Budapest Hotel.",

            "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel, written by Wes Anderson, is a charming and chaotic tragicomedy that tells the tale of how a man came to own The Grand Budapest Hotel. Anderson is able to demonstrate the importance of grace, honor, and loyalty and most importantly the significance of forging relationships and displaying kindness towards people. Unlike other films within this genre this film has an emphasis on crisp colors and visually pleasing cinematography. Furthermore, it uses over dramatization of situations in order to evoke a comedic effect. Unlike Wes Andersons other work, such as Sing and Fantastic Mr.Fox, this film combines tragedy along with it's comedical writing style. Because of the lighthearted music and bright color scheme, scenes in which there is a violence offer a stark contrast and give a shock to the audience. Using these elements, the writer is able to focus on the importance of upholding and creating relationships with individuals, as well as upholding honor and loyalty. And doing what you can to help a person out. All in all, I would give this film four out of five stars. I immensely enjoyed the mix of comedy and tragedy within the film, and I found the cinematography to be compelling and spectacular. However, I found the film to be entirely too predictable. In addition to this there was little to no character arc throughout the film that was evident, and the social commentary was difficult to understand and find. Nevertheless, the film was fairly effective. The crispness in the colors used helped to create a charming atmosphere, and as I mentioned before I highly enjoyed the stark contrast to the scenes that displayed violence. The plot of the film was fairly chaotic and intriguing, but the overall resolution was predictable. Additionally, the soundtrack and dialogue used was extremely enjoyable. Much like other films within this same genre, the downplaying of violent scenes as well as the over-dramatizing events helped in making the film extremely enjoyable. All in all I would say that this film teaches an important lesson in upholding oneself with dignity and doing what you can for others.",

            "content": "In his film, Wes Anderson cleverly plays with whimsical aesthetics reflective of the European Art Nouveau style, which dress the harsh reality of a pseudo-fascist regime that takes place in a fictional Zubrowka. To me, Anderson has blurred the line between the political and fantastical quite well, which allows the audience to reach a deeper understanding of the contextual politics driving the film's plot. Sequences which are borderline comical and provide a value of entertainment such as the chase scene between Gustave and Dmitri, are inter-spliced with more politically charged scenes such as the train scene where we see an altercation between Zero and Gustave with soldiers which resulting in the destruction of Zero's documentation. I think this heightens the degree of consciousness the film has of its own political themes because of how well they're integrated with the fantasy and comedy. At the same time however, Anderson distances his film from portraying true events by setting the story in a time not symbolic of the event it is modelling. For example, we know that Anderson is trying to emulate the Nazi regime, but his story takes place in 1932, way before Hitler came into power. This further drives the mythological position Anderson plays with.\nThe inter-textual use of art in the film also acts as a mean of balancing the relationship between fantasy and politics. Anderson's featuring of Michael Taylor's painting \"Boy With Apple\", serves as a McGuffin that facilitates the audience's understanding of each of the characters through the way each of them interacts with the painting. For example, Dmitri's utter rejection of the idea of a concierge owning such a priceless painting showed me that to him the painting was a symbol of wealth and that he ideologically perpetuates a classist perspective, which in itself is political. The fact that the painting is not even real and was painted by Taylor specifically for the film only highlights to me the brilliance of politics and fantasy acting in relation with one another.\nAdding to its socio-economic dimensions is Anderson's Art Nouveau stylings I mentioned earlier. By using this type of architecture, which is symbolic of an over-saturation in wealth, the glorification of this class system during this time period is made evident. The glaring difference we see in scenes from 1968 which show a more stripped-down version of the hotel which Zero runs is not only done to show the effects of fascist occupation but to me represents an overcoming of the power dynamic and hierarchy of the class system and a movement towards liberated thought. Seeing that it was Zero's version of the Grand Budapest Hotel only solidified it for me further because of how he was represented as the other (not of high society I mean) in earlier scenes from 1932. While it was a departure from the luxurious establishment it once was it signifies Zero's development from starting as the lobby-boy as well as his immigrant status largely defining him and how he's treated, to eventually becoming the hotel's proprietor, which I believe is a moment of working through the politics that have fought against him.\nIn terms of the form of the film, Anderson has remained true to his signature style with the way he uses color, composition and camera angles. His first establishing shot is already enticing enough to make you want to continue watching the film, with its pan up towards the remarkable hotel set against a scenery which emulates a painting. This is smart in the way that it sets up the importance of aesthetic. Reminiscent of many of his other films, Anderson's shots are very symmetrical and its clear that he tries to make them look perfect, which is ironic considering how flawed his characters are. I feel like this only adds more to the comedic aspect of the movie. In terms of composition, I like the way Anderson first places Gustave in front of the frame with Zero always behind him, we can tell who holds the power in their relationship. But as the movie progresses, we see a shift in this with Zero slowly being placed in frame directly next to Gustave and we see them become equals. This visual movement is a physical representation of Zero's moment of working through that I mentioned earlier, as he becomes more in tune with his identity.\nAnderson is very brilliant in his ability to create a film which is aesthetically pleasing and comedic enough that it draws audiences in, but he then uses this modality of entertainment to explore important socio-economic and political themes while also entertaining his audience. This, I think, makes the film easy to watch even if it deals with darker themes. Wes Anderson films are always very thoughtful and deliberate, and The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception.",

His format shouldn't work, however, it always does. Next to Rushmore, I'd put this as his best work. The movie had a beautiful pallet and overall design. The way Wes Anderson positioned the camera made every shot a piece of art. His way of making a comedy really works here. The acting is superb. I really enjoyed Ralph Fiennes's performance as M. Gustave. I felt that he was able to bring the right amount of comedy to the role that, at times, reminded me of Fawlty Towers. I also liked seeing Tony Revolori in a role other than Flash in Spider-Man, I feel that he did a great job portraying the timid lobby boy. Obviously, Saoirse Ronan is great in this, along with everything else she does. The script in this is fantastic, allowing the characters to stand out from one and other. Another thing I love about this movie is the score. Still, above all, the colors in this movie really make it work, along with the set design. I've found that Wes Anderson's focus in film is making everything look perfect, especially because the character's aren't. This stark contrast is what makes his movies funny. There are obviously some problems with the movie. One of the glaring problems for me is that I felt the tension sometimes didn't work, and I feel that some of the conflict and emotional moments didn't hit as hard as they should have. The comedic characters are great, but I feel that in a way, they were 2 dimensional, which I suppose was part of the movie in a way. Still, this movie was definitely deserving of the best picture nomination it received. Watching all of Wes Anderson's movies in order has made me appreciate the development of his style. Slowly, movie by movie, Wes Anderson begins developing the distinct style he is known for today. I believe that The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best example of his personal style, and that is why it's one of my favorites. 9.4/10",

The two work so well together and enhance the movie as a result.\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe beginning isn't perfect, but I gave it a perfect score because it's extremely intriguing. By the closing of the first ten minutes, I had a strong feeling I was in for a treat the rest of the way through. I was right.\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nDirector Wes Anderson is known for a specific style that's so different from anything else out there and The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception. Colors pop and images jump out at you in exactly the way he is trying to convey. His style, hard to explain at times, is hard not to appreciate and enjoy. When you watch a movie like this, you truly feel like you are getting a full-on cinematic experience.\n\nConflict: 10\nThere is a scene towards the back half of the movie that I call \"The Escape\". It is action-packed yet has some subtle nuances at the same time. Definitely one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but not the only one hinging on conflict. Despite a comedic overtone, the film relies on a number of different points of tension to drive the plot.\n\nEntertainment Value: 9\n\nMemorability: 10\nGustave and Zero are easily one of my favorite duos since Jack and Rose in Titanic. They have a strange relationship, one that contributes to making the movie unforgettable. There are so many moments that stand out (the reading of the will comes to mind) making this a movie hard not to think about. It's a movie you can watch a number of times and see something new each time.\n\nPace: 10\n\nPlot: 10\nFlawless storytelling. Magical and original. Enough said.\n\nResolution: 4\n\nOverall: 93\n2014 is one of my all-time favorite years for movies and it's because of movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel. It takes storytelling to new heights with a crisp, original way of looking at filmmaking. This movie definitely made me a believer and a fan of Wes Anderson.",

            "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel is a thoroughly fun, eclectic, and entertaining Wes Anderson flick. Wes Anderson truly hones in on his style of film-making (which is basically a genre of its own at this point) and utilizes a brilliant ensemble cast to craft a unique narrative about a fictional hotel during 'World War II.' Ralph Fiennes was simply brilliant and Tony Revolori was a revelation! Their deft interplay was evident from the first moments they shared the screen together. Every moment they shared on screen together was whimsical fun as the two got into quite a few precarious situations. The villains were perfectly cast as Adrien Brody's douchbaggery and Willem Defoe's terrifying mug made for completely reprehensible but thoroughly entertaining heels for the film. Cameo appearances were also aplenty, with Saoirse Ronan and Bill Murray stealing scene after scene. The set design was gorgeous and fantastical, with no detail left untouched. I will definitely have to watch the film again and again to catch all the little fun touches. The humor worked perfectly and complimented the outlandish plot, similar to the Coen Brothers in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou.' The prison scenes were especially entertaining as the resourcefulness of the characters made for a thoroughly entertaining sequence for an equally entertaining (and quite frankly, ridiculous) escape. The whole film felt at the same time serious and emotional and completely tongue-in-cheek. That is the true mark of a Wes Anderson flick and I am thoroughly excited to see what The French Dispatch has to offer. Overall, this is a must watch for any fans of Wes Anderson and of film in general and is a great way to immerse oneself in Anderson's eclectic filmography.",

Even though the message is generally one of pathos and regret. I shall have to watch it again at some point. I feel it might change. As it would.

            "content": "A surefire way to laughter!\n\nWes Anderson's indie absurdist comedy-drama The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is absolute nonsensical comedy and pure joy filmmaking for 100 minutes of delightful charm. Wes Anderson's direction is sublime and fast in one of his funniest features. The odd humor and resonant dramatic moments keep you guessing as he lures you in with elegant charm and stays engaged because of all the quirky characters and sleek filmmaking. Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness adapt Stefan Zweig's novels into a surreal crime mystery full of endless absurdist humor of the highest caliber. You will not stop smiling during The Grand Budapest Hotel until the credit hit.\n\nAll the delicate pinks and vibrant purples in Stephan O. Gessler and Adam Stockhausen's production design make The Grand Budapest Hotel look like a luxurious period dollhouse. It's so beautiful to look at Robert Yeoman's cinematography as every shot is a cute square and close medium shot of adorable perfection. His style is so refreshing and breathtaking that it's clearly influenced anyone from Paul King's Paddington and Paddington 2 to Rian Johnson's Knives Out. Barney Pilling's editing is quick with slick cuts from one decorative German locale to another lavish spot. Milena Canonero's costumes are neat concierge uniforms to period soldier uniforms all in striking purple or black. She outdid herself with these outfits of colorful flair.\n\nAlexandre Desplat's score is so pleasant as his whimsical charm is still present in his ambient sounds that are more electronic this time around, yet remain graceful. His movie music is refined, yet chaotic fun and always fun to hear. Heike Merker and Norma Webb's make-up is excellent as they age Tilda Swinton decades into an elderly lady, in a role that she delivers convincingly. Meanwhile, they give all the gentlemen of The Grand Budapest Hotel an air of sophistication and grace. All the ladies are gifted with cute looks and restrained beauty with pulled back hair and neat dresses.\n\nI must mention Ralph Fiennes elevates The Grand Budapest Hotel into all time great comedy status thanks to his riveting and hilarious comedic turn as Monsieur Gustave H. His endless poetic ramblings and rude offhand remarks are just too funny. Tony Revolori is fun as the steadfast lobby boy Young Zero Moustafa. F. Murray Abraham is heartbreaking and interesting as Old Zero Moustafa. Jude Law is excellent as the Young Writer, who is our narrator along with Tom Wilkinson as the Old Author.\n\nI loved Mathieu Amalric as the secretive Serge X. Adrien Brody steals every scene he's in as the scoundrel heir Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis. His sudden curses and calm walk show a level of refinement to his acting that allows him to be intimidating without trying too hard. Willem Dafoe is monstrous as the serial killer J.G. Jopling. Jeff Goldblum is funny as the lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs. His cat getting killed is so funny like how Wes Anderson kills off many of his furry creatures suddenly in his features.\n\nSaoirse Ronan is magical and sympathetic as the pastry girl Agatha. She's captivating every second she is on screen. I simply adore Léa Seydoux, so it is delightful seeing her as the maid Clotilde. My only complaint to Wes Anderson is that Ronan and Seydoux should have had more lines!\n\nHarvey Keitel is cool and funny as the tough prisoner Ludwig. Bill Murray gets a fun cameo as Monsieur Ivan, meanwhile, Jason Schwartzman is funny as the lazy Monsieur Jean. I really enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson in a Wes Andreson feature again as the helpful Monsieur Chuck. Edward Norton cameos as a pivotal character called Inspector Albert Henckels. Furthermore, Wes Anderson puts in all manner of cameos of actors from his previous films for the astute fan of his extensive filmography now.\n\nIn all, Wes Anderson utilizes his magnificent cast wonderfully resulting in an enchanting picture.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is one of the few directors whose films can immediately be identified as having been directed by him due to their distinct visual style, cutesy dialogue and the actors he frequently collaborates with. This is one of his most popular films as it is an exquisitely crafted picture of unique delights that revels in one beautifully framed shot after another. Fans of Anderson's are sure to be delighted, I count myself among them, but even those who are not completely entranced will find a surprising amount of depth in the central relationship portrayed in this film. The film is deserving of the critical acclaim it received and was one of the best films nominated for Best Picture in 2014 in an otherwise lackluster lineup.\n\nM. Gustave, Ralph Fiennes, runs the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1932 while carrying on affairs with a variety of older, high maintenance women. Chief among them is Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, Tilda Swinton, who leaves him the priceless \"Boy with Apple\" painting after she dies much to the consternation of her selfish son Dmitri, Adrien Brody, who hires assassin J.G. Jopling, Willem Dafoe, to track him down. Meanwhile Gustave has taken bellhop Zero, Tony Revolori, under his wing and the two go on the run together as Zero begins a romance with baker Agatha, Saoirse Ronan, and their country goes through political turmoil. They are able to successfully evade their captors for a long time through various complex schemes but eventually a shootout occurs in the hotel that leads to further revelations about the will of Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis.\n\nThe whole film begins about three different framing devices which sets up immediately that the film is more focused on stylistic flourishes and appearances than a plot. Beauty is a major focus of the film as it is wonderful to have Anderson step you through the various details of how a pastry containing contraband tools was constructed. We also get to learn all of the intricacies of the lives of the people inhabiting the film as while they are big and cartoonish you do come to care as much as they do about living life in a way that is proper. Gustave's commitment to wearing a specific perfume, enunciating all of his words perfectly and appreciating the loyalty of his friend is honorable in a way and the Nazi-like figures looming in the background only make his ideals appear more admirable.\n\nFiennes also gives one of his greatest performances as in a rare comedic role he proves that he can blend his posh, uptight persona with a dash of wit and comes out giving one of the most entertaining characterizations of the year. His ability to rattle off impossibly long lines of dialogue is unmatched and you can almost smell the oft-spoken about perfume his character is said to wear as his character goes about his business in this film. The supporting cast also get moments to shine, as you would expect from a group of performers so highly distinguished, because while there is not the depth of the characters found in Rushmore (1998) and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) there is still entertainment to be had in these broad characterizations. Brody gives a typically high spirited performance as the chief villain and Dafoe brings a quiet menace to the role of the ruthless hitman. Ronan gets less to do and cameos from Owen Wilson and Bill Murray feel perfunctory but at least for the audience there is a moment of excitement at spotting actors who have played significant roles in Anderson's other films.\n\nFinally, the extraordinary beauty of the film must be discussed as several shots of spectacularly framed interiors in which every detail has clearly been pored over for hours make you sit back in awe. The costumes, the interiors, the production design and even the fictional ‘famous' painting are top notch and the efforts of Anderson are obvious as the visuals are reminiscent of his previous work. Those who worked on the production must have faced hours of painstaking work but their efforts were absolutely worth it because the end product appears flawless. Anderson is a master of style and if that's something that you value in your entertainment this is a visual feast.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.\nThough the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protege, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).\nThe film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction. \nEmployed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.\nWhere the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson.",

Bellissima anche la luce e i colori e quindi in sostanza la fotografia, il tutto accompagnato da una bella trama condita di dialoghi eccentrici. Tra i personaggi ovviamente spicca Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) e ho apprezzato molto anche Edward Norton e Tony Revolori.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, are you Hungary to review The Grand Budapest Hotel?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) You keep pestering me to do it, so let s recap!\n\nSCOTT: The movie begins with a young girl admiring a statue of a man simply known as  The Author.  She begins reading one of his books that describes a trip he made in 1968 to the Grand Budapest Hotel. At that time the drab, outdated hotel attracted very few customers. During his stay, the Author (Jude Law) encounters the owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who is anxious to tell his story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest.\n\nGREG: That causes another flashback to 1932 where a young Zero is taken under the wing of concierge extraordinaire M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is quite the lady s man - if by lady you mean elderly widow. One of his  friends  has died and left him a fortune in the form of a priceless painting Boy with Apple. However, the children of the deceased are not willing to let the painting go that easily. They frame Gustave and he escapes from prison. Now the chase is on as Gustave and Zero are on a mission to clear his name and recover the painting.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange movie about strange people. The movie tells the story of a man, Gustave, who is overly polite and loquacious in situations that call for neither quality. Gustave is a mentor figure for a young lobby boy named Zero who appears incapable of showing any facial expressions. The duo get caught up in a dangerous plot with many other equally strange people, each of whom has some quirky or menacing mannerism. Wes Anderson-world is stylistically surreal and cartoon-like. Pastel colors tend to dominate and actors are instructed to master the art of nonverbal minimalism with their bodies, faces, and movements. There seems to be an exaggerated attempt to create and nurture caricatures of people and situations. Sometimes the effect is comical; at other times it is merely odd. If the goal was to make the movie sets and characters memorable, in a way that a bottle of Pepto-Bismol is memorable, then the goal has been achieved.\n\nGREG: I enjoyed Budapest very much. Wes Anderson always delivers an experience that you won t find in other films. Last year s Moonlight Kingdom was another standout movie by Anderson. The characters are always likable and innocent in their own way. If I have a complaint about Budapest it is that it dragged on in the second act. The film clocks in at just 100 minutes, but it felt like much longer. Another complaint was the appearance of too many cameos. There is a hotel shootout that had so many luminaries pop into frame that I was distracted from the story.\n\nSCOTT: Ironically, within a movie that is as unconventional as a movie can get, we have a rather conventional hero-sidekick combination. This is not to say that these dual heroes are uninteresting. Far from it, in fact. Gustave does a fair amount of mentoring of Zero, who grows from a youthful innocent boy into an informed and experienced young man. Gustave relishes his role as a mentor to Zero, and while I m not sure that Gustave changes much during the course of the movie, he certainly has plenty of heroic traits. In fact, he dies performing an act of self-sacrifice.\n\nGREG: I agree, Scott. In our book on heroes in the movies Reel Heroes: Volume 1 we lay out the Hero/Sidekick as one of the types of duo-heroes. Gustave and Zero play this pattern to full force. Zero knows nothing of the world of hotels yet Gustave feels sorry for the boy because he is a refugee. Here, the hero is the mentor to the young man whom we care about because of his innocence and underdog status. The story if rife with villains as well. We meet the eldest son of the widow, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who is intent on having the painting for his own. I was pleased with the coloring of Dmitri. He is a vile man and we get a bit of his backstory as the scorned son of Madame D. Dmitri enlists the aid of a diabolical and evil henchman named Jopling (Willem Dafoe) who has steel teeth and wears rings that double as brass knuckles. While we don t get a lot of backstory on Jopling, he demonstrates his villainy with the many killings and maiming of characters in the story.\n\nSCOTT: The two main villains are a detestable pair for different reasons - Dmitri for his loathsome greed and Jopling for his psychopathic brutality. The movie doesn t delve into the details of these two villains  histories or life stories. These bad guys exist mainly to provide a grave challenge to Gustave and Zero. It s interesting how movies often pack their villains with a familiar one-two punch. The main villain is often the mastermind of the operation, and the secondary villain(s) are usually the muscle who carry out the physical dirty work. This split-structure of villainy represents a departure from the more unified structure of the hero, who in order to succeed must possess both brains and brawn.\n\nGREG: Scott, I enjoyed myself at The Grand Budapest Hotel and could find myself going back for a second visit. The characters were colorful and unique. While it was a bit slow in places, the film held my interest for most of the time. I give Budapest 4 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this story were likable, even affable. I enjoyed watching M. Gustave s growing fondness for Zero and Zero s growth under Gustave s tutelage. I give the hero-pair 4 out of 5 Heroes. The villains were more complete in this film compared to others we ve reviewed so far this year. However that isn t saying much. Still, they were stereotypes of villains gone by as the estranged son and his henchman. I give these evil-doers just 3 out of 5 Villains. Movie: Heroes:  Villains: \n\nSCOTT: The Grand Budapest Hotel isn t a great movie but it has an endearing and quirky charm that gives it lasting appeal. I give Wes Anderson lots of credit here. After all,  strange  doesn t always mean memorable, but here it does because of Gustave s unique combination of charm, courage, and quirkiness, and also because the film tosses out a look and feel that I ve never seen before. Like you, I ll award The Grand Budapest Hotel 4 Reels out of 5. As I ve mentioned the hero duo of Gustave and Zero doesn t break much new ground, but I have to admire the transformation of Zero, who learns many life lessons from Gustave, not the least of which is loyalty. This is the trait that inspires Zero to hang onto the hotel decades after any rational person might do so. This hero pair earns a solid 3 Heroes out of 5. In keeping with the rest of the movie, the villains were an odd pair that movie audiences love to hate. This mastermind-muscle pairing was effective although their characters were not as developed as they could have been. For the same reasons as you, Greg, I give them 3 Villains out of 5.

            "content": "For his latest feature, Wes Anderson pushes his quirky vision to what may be a new high for him. He combines the multitude of different filming techniques he's become so well-known for, both old and new (symmetrical cinematography, stop-motion/miniatures, etc.), into what is truly his most technically impressive film to date. The key to The Grand Budapest Hotel (no pun intended) that it gets right where his previous film struggled is making sure there's a story worth telling with this technical prowess as a backdrop. Pulling a complete one-eighty from the often cold tale of childhood love in Moonrise Kingdom, this time around Anderson has crafted a zany story-within-a-story murder mystery that is perhaps his funniest film to date. Anderson, of course, has always been a master of dry black humor, but much of the reason this film is so unflinchingly hilarious is the cast he's gathered to tell his story. The ensemble consists of too many names to list but all of whom are predictably great (most of whom are frequent Anderson collaborators), but the two standouts are brand new to being in front of an Anderson-operated camera: that is, Ralph Fiennes and newcomer Tony Revolori. Fiennes' dry wit and comedic timing is impeccable for an actor whose work has been primarily rooted in serious drama, and Revolori perfectly captures the awkwardness that feels like a cinematic extension of Anderson himself. It's easy to go on and on about how comedically perfect of a film this is, and ignoring the fact that Anderson never sacrifices emotion for a laugh. At the undercurrent of all the wackiness is a genuine feeling of romanticism and loss: the fact that Anderson can balance such opposing themes really is a testament to his capabilities as a storyteller, and in that regard, it's certainly not a stretch to call this his magnum opus.",

The film takes you on a chase involving a priceless Renaissance painting and a battle for an enormous family fortune, recounting the adventures of Gustave H and Zero Moustafa. Ironically, much of the film's action and plot are staged outside the hotel, which Anderson could've explored more seeing as it was revered to be 'grand' throughout the film after all. A worthy note would be the world Wes Anderson has created once again, The Grand Budapest Hotel and the fictional providence of Zubrowka is warm and vibrant, set against the backdrop of a changing continent soon to enter a war.  \n\nThe pairing of Fiennes and Revolori as the lead characters are surprising and delightful despite being new faces to Anderson's films. While much of the supporting characters are Anderson staples such as Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe Edward Norton, and Bill Murray. The pair truly capture the bond of Gustave H and Zero, the characters' relationship and its development is heart-warming and bittersweet while the dramatization capture the whimsical signature of Anderson. Anderson is quite skilled in crafting adolescent and juvenile characters that we've seen in 'Rushmore,' 'The Royal Tenenbaums,' and 'Moonrise Kingdom,' but his recent take on grown-up characters is still improving.\n\n'The Grand Budapest Hotel' features Wes Anderson essentials-a beautiful and vibrant production design, quirky and eccentric characters, romantic subplot, a warm filter, and a deceptive visual style- that leaves almost nothing to complain about and much to adore.",

Kedua sosok ini juga memperlihatkan sebuah hubungan atasan-bawahan yang kemudian luntur menjadi \"sahabat\" lewat sebuah kesetiakawanan dan loyalitas. Harapan saya, mungkin film ini patut dijadikan sebagai salah satu criterion collection. Film berdurasi 100 menit mungkin adalah salah satu yang terbaik di tahun 2014. Penonton tidak akan menyesal untuk mengeksplorasi dunia The Grand Budapest hotel yang penuh warna, aksi, dan tawa.",

Wes Anderson that.\nThe film basically focuses on a concierge at a fictional East European hotel, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his adventures through four timelines (utterly confusing).\nThe film is only saved by the addition of a large cast of superstars at different stages (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Tom Wilkinson.

The Shining, Barton  Fink, anything that does have a hotel, the older the better, I'm a mark for. This movie has that in spades, the majesticness, and the pretentiousness, this hotel has it. The type of hotel that has hallways and balconies and whatever for god knows what reason, But Anderson  knows, and that's a big plus to this movie. The characters here are funny, and Anderson seemed to tap into the works of Guy Maddin with many of the shots here. Such a joy to watch, and would watch this again in a heartbeat.",

It had probably the most star studded line up I have ever seen with several cameo appearances, none of which improved what was a truly awful and disjointed story. I think, and I mean think, that it was a tale about how an old man came into possession of the Grand Budapest hotel, which was through an odd character named Gustave. Both he and Zero (the now owner) formed a tight working bond that led them to be close friends as well as employer and employee, with Gustave promising to bequeath his newly acclaimed fortune providing Zero stuck by him. He naturally needed Zero's help as he himself was a conman that used women as a means of securing wealth, and the hotel was just a little something he gained using his cunning charm and guile. Throughout the film, Zero is merely an accomplice to Gustave's criminal mind, but is undoubtedly a man of his word, if not somewhat of a freak. They spend the majority of their time fleeing angry relatives of the deceased woman he recently took advantage of, who have hired hitmen to hunt him down. Despite the fingers being point at Gustave for what looks like an intentional murder, spurred on by the lure of the ensuing will, we never really learn the true nature of her death and as is the case for the vast majority of scenes, there are a lot of questions unanswered, and many actions misunderstood. I simply didn't get this, didn't find it entertaining, and its success is beyond me. Clearly the A-list of celebrities deployed must have gone some way to gaining this an A-star status because the content is nothing short of woeful. If I were to see this in a cinema, I would have soon used the opportunity of the dark room for a little shut eye. Maybe this will grow on me when my maturity levels in films increases, but for now it's a very negative recommendation I'm afraid.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson films are a bit of an acquired taste, but when they're done well they're great. This one is done well. Presented as something of a fairy tale, this movie captures Ralph Fiennes' previously unseen comedic talents as a vain and pompous hotel manager whose ability to switch between excessive verbiage and foul-mouthed gutter talk at the drop of a hat is the highlight of the film. It's nostalgic for a nonexistent bygone age while at the same time cynical about how truly that era even represented the values it stood for in the same place. And of course it's filled with Anderson's typical flourishes, like the unconventional narrative style, the odd dialogue, and the precise framing and layout of every scene. When the film is good these characteristics make it better. When it's bad these make it worse. This time it's better.",

            "content": "You get about 5 seconds thorough a Wes Anderson movie and straight away you just know it's that sly guy with his unique style. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Andersons little project here and one that is hugely entertaining as well, mixing humour with wit and love with surrealism, this movie truly contains a lot of different things. The story is about Gustave H a hotel manager of the place in the title, but it is not through his eyes we see the story no, it is F. Murray Abraham well no it is the character of Zero Moustafa a small hotel concierge who is hired by Gustave and quickly rises up to be a star player in the running of the hotel. The plot throws in twists and turns, characters that only Anderson could make up and at one point a shoot-out between a group of people who have no idea who they are shooting(sounds pretty mixed up right). The one thing that stops this being pretentious or anything along those lines is that it is funny, thoughtful but also just generally made up well, it never tries to make you think \"Oh cool\" but you can at times feel that, but it doesn't feel forced.\n\nThe movie contains so many actors it is near impossible to count how many big names or recognisable faces this movie contains. Gustave is played by an very on form Ralph Fiennes whose performance is both hilarious but also just generally well acted even dramatically speaking. We see the likes of Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Jude Law, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray and even one of Anderson's absolute favourites, Jason Schwartzman. The strange thing is that among all the talent on show it is the young actor who portrays Zero who is maybe one of the most memorable and his name is Tony Revolori. Now I am not saying Revolori is that great I mean it really is Fiennes who steals the show acting wise, but Revolori does enough to make his character stick out and you can sort of in ways connect to him.\n\nStraight from the side camera shots are just one of the many things we see so often in Wes Anderson's plethora of work. In this movie he adds in little miniature set pieces with little trees and buildings and also moving miniature figures and vehicles and really makes them look actually good and uses them to good effect too. The movie likes to move fast I mean after all it is fairly short, however the frantic pace does not make this any less of a great piece in fact if anything it makes the jokes funnier because they are so quick and snappy, at times the slight humour can drip out but in large quantities so it feels pretty nicely done. What Anderson also does so well is just make this feel so fresh and new, I mean to be fair who the hell as ever made a movie like this before but what Anderson brings to the table is more than fresh, it is fresh and really good mixing great characters who are likeable with really nice sets and Wes writes the thing well too, I mean I can definitely see why this got so many nominations at ceremonies across the world.\n\nIs there much wrong? ,well I guess it could have been the slightest bit more laugh out loud at times but that doesn't matter, that isn't what this movie is all about. I think this is a sort of loveable movie but for sure is extremely likeable and I don't think only a certain \"crowd\" will like it, it has a little something for all to offer. One more thing I really need to say which I never went properly into is the production design especially the whole make up of the sets used, the sets used for the parts in the 30's are magnificent and some of the best I have ever seen in movies, I felt yet again Anderson's style creeping up in even the smallest of places.",

I enjoyed every scene in this movie as the actors had such great chemistry. \nIt's a cliche at this point to say that the script is amazing in every sense of the word. And the directing is so fantastic that my words cannot describe it. \nAnd by God the cinematography is so astoundingly beautiful. the beautiful and vibrant colors on the screen look like the pages of a book. that's how amazing this film looks. each frame is symmetrical and has distinctive geometric shapes. beautiful. \nThe movie is also hysterical. I was laughing from scene to scene in this movje. the dialogue is so witty and clever that I was in tears in some parts. what really suprised me and was extremely welcome was the use of violence in the Grand Budapest Hotel. it was used very well and so over the top it fit the film perfectly. \nMy main complaint with Moonrise Kingdom was the ending and how I didn't find it satisfying. This ending however satisfied the heck out of me. it fit perfectly and was beautiful in its meaning and execution. I won't spoil anything but I was taken aback with emotion. \nPERFECT MOVIE!!!!!",

            "content": "-The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy film directed by Wes Anderson. The screenplay by Anderson is from a story by Anderson and Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. It stars Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees (Tony Revolori) to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder.\nThe film is an American-German-British co-production that was financed by German financial companies and film-funding organisations. It was filmed in Germany. The Grand Budapest Hotel was released to widespread acclaim from film critics, and many included it in their year-end top 10 lists. The film led the BAFTA nominations, with 11 nominations, more than any other film, including Best Film and Best Director for Anderson, and Best Actor for Fiennes. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and garnered three more Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Director for Anderson. It also garnered nine Academy Award nominations, the joint most (with Birdman) for the ceremony, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Academy Awards for Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. \n\n-It was filmed entirely on location in Germany, mainly in Görlitz and other parts of Saxony as well as at Studio Babelsberg. Principal photography began in January 2013 on location in Berlin and Görlitz. One of the principal locations was the defunct Görlitz Department Store, a huge Jugendstil department store with a giant atrium, one of the few such department stores in Germany to survive World War II. It served as the atrium lobby of the hotel. The widow's mansion was filmed partially within Schloss (castle) Waldenberg. Filming concluded in March 2013.\n\nCritical response:\n- The Grand Budapest Hotel received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for the film's visual style, Anderson's screenplay and direction, and Fiennes' lead performance. Film aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 92% \"certified fresh\" rating, with an average score of 8.4/10, based on reviews from 257 critics. The consensus states: \"Typically stylish but deceptively thoughtful, The Grand Budapest Hotel finds Wes Anderson once again using ornate visual environments to explore deeply emotional ideas.\" Metacritic reported a score of 88 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Many ranked it one of the best films of 2014.",

            "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014) is a modern day auteur film. Themes that are evident in most of Wes Anderson's canon are present in his latest film. However in this film Mr. Anderson truly brings to bear all the various tools of modern filmmaking.  Editing (speeding up the FPS), aspect ratios, miniatures & scale models, set design, CGI, wardrobe, voice over, narrative structure, and score are all utilized with expert craftsmanship.\n                 \n                 Different and out of place accents don't interrupt your suspension of disbelief. The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014) in many ways is a fairy tale that takes place in a heightened world that satirizes both pre and post World War II Europe.  Some characters who were clearly not American speak with American accents. Yet it doesn't break the suspension of disbelief and it still feels cohesive and maintain the characters believably that inhabit this slightly off kilter world.\n               \n                 A young man who is in many ways more mature and or capable then his father figure is a trope in much of Wes Anderson's canon. The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014) is no different. Ideas and themes that are evident in Anderson's debut film Rushmore (Wes Anderson, 1998) are still present and being elaborated on in his most recent film. The relationship between a neophyte and his father figure is not yet stale despite it being present in most of Anderson's work. This is perhaps due to the casting of Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori in the roles that would typically be inhabited by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. Similar to Woody Allen's casting decisions in his recent films a fresh face can revitalize a character type that we have grown accustom to.  \n               This fairy Tale takes place in fake eastern European nations and fake Middle Eastern nations are named. Despite the fake names they sound eerily real.  The fake but real sounding names give a sense of era and location without being overly specific. Pre WWII e & pre communist Europe help depict the dying days of Aristocratic old money Europe. The elements of the story that take place in mid 80's communist Eastern Europe provides a juxtaposition to the era that the primary narrative takes place. The shifting of eras is one of the ways Anderson plays with narrative structure. Because of the expert art direction and set design one is never confused as to what era they are viewing.\n                \n                The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014) is whimsical, epic, and sometimes downright laugh out loud funny tale. Wes Anderson has the uncanny ability to take absurd elements of a heightened world and make the people who inhabit it utterly believable and relatable. Wes Anderson is one of the few modern day filmmakers I'm comfortable calling an auteur.",

I must say, with a very interesting and engaging story, goofy characters with the addition of an amazing cast, humorous moments, and nice cinematography, The Grand Budapest Hotel is once again another winner from the works of Wes Anderson! This is probably one of the best comedies I have seen in quite a long time!! And considering how many bad comedies there have been recently, this is really saying something!!!",

Pleasing his customers is his number one priority, even if that means having sex with the aging doyennes. Then there is Gustave H's adoring and trusty sidekick, Zero, the lobby boy, wonderfully played by young Tony Revolori, in a scene-stealing performance, he is a stoic and observant pupil, whose painted on pencil mustache suggests that perhaps he shares some of his mentor's rarefied tastes. Soon mayhem will hit the grand hotel in the form of murder, revenge and a sinister dark plot. Brilliant direction by Wes Anderson, with terrific supporting performances by F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amairic, Adrien Brody, Williem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Kietel, Jude Law, Billy Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Tom Wilkinson. Impressive cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman, and a sensational score by Alexandre Desplat. An absurdly funny and original madcap comedy. Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "In the present day a girl reads a book. In 1985 the author narrates his tale of his visit to a hotel in 1968, meeting the owner who tells him a story of the hotelâ??s heyday in 1932 and back again like a cycle to the present day. Wes Andersonâ??s The Grand Budapest Hotel retains a narrative structure, which represents the story as a history that should be preserved and remembered.\n \nZubrowka, a fictional country on the verge of war, sets the scene for The Grand Budapest Hotel. However, this is not a film about war, merely a film that is set amongst the backdrop of an impending war. You instead follow Ralph Fiennesâ?? concierge Monsieur Gustave H. and Tony Revoloriâ??s young lobby boy Zero Moustafa on a journey to prove Gustaveâ??s innocence after he is framed for murder. Their comedic relationship keeps you from thinking what hazardous situations they are always in. Thus, this flick is perhaps a study in the escapism of war perils.\n \nI think it is safe to say that Fiennes steals the show with a performance that deserves at the middling least an Oscar nomination. At first he is extremely alienatingâ?¦ to Zero! To the viewers he is bluntly hilarious and from the moment you see him you treasure each scene he is in because he is plain and simple marvellous. With his swift conveyance of speech and dry humour, Fiennes has brought to life a character that for all his emptiness in life can still bring joy and excitement to others. Yes he does have some peculiar traits such as satisfying elderly pensioners, but that is an attribute that makes him unalike anyone else we have seen before. It almost makes you want to work for Gustave in war-torn Zubrowka.\n \nRevolori is excellent as Zero; his innocence and growth as a character is convincing to the point where you would have expected him to turn out like F. Murray Abrahamâ??s older Zero. His lower rank and admiration for Gustave allows you to indulge more in Fiennesâ?? performance. The moments where Zero is equal to Gustave as friends are moments where Gustave will remain an enduring cinematic figure because for all his dryness he still has good intentions and does care for his friend. Every scene between Gustave and Zero is special; whether it is Gustaveâ??s protection of Zero on the train, making him his heir to his fortune or Zeroâ??s assistance during Gustaveâ??s prison escape. We see them at first differently because of their status on the hierarchy but at the end this status is blurred, as they are now first and foremost friends.\n \nBoth characters stand out the most amidst a huge ensemble cast of Tilda Swinton as the elderly lover of Gustave, Brody as Swintonâ??s son and Gustaveâ??s nemesis, Norton as the peace-keeping Inspector Henckels, Saoirse Ronan as Zeroâ??s lover and Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum as an assassin and Swintonâ??s lawyer. Smaller roles for Jude Law, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Owen Wilson, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Murray lends the film extra grandeur and spectacle status. As if the grand hotel was not enough already! There are so many actors and different scenes that so much goes on in such a short amount of time that it really is a true feat of storytelling to tell such a history in such an intriguing, comedic manner.\n \nDirector Wes Andersonâ??s distinctive style allows you to retrieve so many meanings and interpretations from his images. The pink-layered grand hotel gives a very nostalgic feel about the proceedings and atmosphere. The bliss of the hotel during its zenith in 1932 is felt whereas the future scenes are seemingly void of happiness and excitement. This intelligent ploy undoubtedly serves to elevate Fiennesâ?? character as the centre of the film. The Grand Budapest Hotel is in abeyance, waiting for Gustave H. to return.\n \nI would have never thought Ralph Fiennesâ?? Monsieur H. Gustave trying to clear his name amongst numerous highly stylized backdrops and a vast array of credible characters would contravene all my expectations and turn out to be the best film of 2014. Pure vintage!\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        10/10",

His apprentice was this annoying sniveling boy who said truly all the time and would say how high if Gustave told him to jump. I just couldn't get into it, one of those movies that intentionally tries to be different in an annoying sense. It never seemed to get to the point til the last five minutes and I find the whole movie mostly irritating with the narrator intentionally trying to use big obnoxious words no one understands and being superfluous and talking way too fast-ugh spare me me the confusion.

            "content": "Inspired by the original story written by Stefan Zwieg, The Grand Budapest Hotel could be Wes Anderson's masterpiece. The film which is made in typical Wes Anderson style, following his previous work which includes; Moonrise Kingdom, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums to name a few, all share character based, charming and unique stories. He has truly perfected his filming style (you know when you're watching a Wes Anderson film) pairing that with the most exceptional cast, some of whom have been cast members in previous Anderson films.\n\nI'd describe this particular film as a matryoshka doll way of storytelling with each story nested within another. I've read that Wes had described this film as a kind of  \"confessional\" which it is kind of true because it has a secretive storytelling kind of feel to it.\n\nIt takes place \"On the furthest eastern boundary of the European continent: The former Republic of ZUBROWKA. Once the seat of an Empire.\" the story revolves around two characters firstly M. Gustave (played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes) this character is a charming, well perfumed, meticulous man who is the embodiment of the hotel. Secondly we have Zero (impressively played by Tony Revolori) who is the new lobby boy at The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nM. Gustave has many friends who visit the hotel wholly to see him, all of which were \"rich, old, insecure, vain, superficial, blonde, needy\". He attends to them all personally (watch out for the clip of him receiving a blowy from one of the guests, blink and you'll miss it!) but when one of his guests ends up dying under suspicious circumstances (Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis - played by Tilda Swinton) and with M. Gustave receiving a valuable painting (Boy with Apple) in Madame Céline will, the family become enraged and declare M. Gustave shall not have it causing a hilarious almost child like argument. So begins the adventure of M. Gustave and Zero, they have to take on many obstacles in order to keep on to Boy with Apple. With M. Gustave being framed for her death, M. Gustave attempts to evade arrest by running through the lobby of the hotel being chased by the police which is hilarious but what I liked most about this scene is how Anderson makes you feel like you're a bystander watching this unfold for real by keeping the camera still and having no music.\n\nI feel like this film isn't so much about the story but more about how each character how they develop and the relationships that grow throughout; the relationship between Gustave and Zero is a lovely sentiment as their bond grows stronger throughout the film. One of the key scenes is Gustave taking up the guardian role which is summed up within the train scenes where he sticks up for Zero twice as army officials want to arrest him, theres another probably more important scene that I believe bound them together was when M. Gustave breaks out of prison and had loses his shit with Zero for forgetting Lady Panash (M. Gustave's favourite cologne) in turn questioning Zero's upbringing and coming to the conclusion that Zero is a war refugee, he immediately apologies to Zero and they hug it out \"we're brothers\".\n\nNearing the end of the film there is a chaotic firefighter scene with everyone getting involved which I feel sums up the environment in which this story is surrounded by and that is unfortunately war (and during war valuable goods are fought over).\n\nIts almost as if you're just along for the ride whether you love or hate these characters (except Gustave. Everybody should LOVE Gustave!); the way in which this film is told and created is utterly fantastic almost as if it was a fairy-tale... for adults because there's death, sex and swearing in it.\n\n\"You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... oh, fuck it.\"\n\nCharmingly beautiful.",

Ralph Fiennes and Adrien Brody are a protag/antag match made in heaven. Not to mention Willem Dafoe's dastardly, villainous aura and Tony Revolri's performance as the loyal, determined Lobby Boy.

With an emphasis on both charming and peculiar. The cinematography is simply just excellent and unique, the colours vibrant and engaging. The plot itself is well-paced with drama and comedy without so much as a lull or a drag at any moment of the movie. The light-hearted musical score compliments and changes along with the story without ever being overwhelming or seemingly out of place but instead it shares and even amplifies the quirkiness of the film. That's how you recognize a successful music score, it makes you question if it was really composed specifically for the movie or it came along with the hotel itself if you know what I mean. Kudos to the director and whoever else responsible for the excellent execution of this film. Brilliant acting of all the casts especially Voldemort. This film is just simply excellent.",

The film could've easily been a children's story minus the violence and language, but overall it didn't feel very groundbreaking to be or a masterpiece. It had its moments but I find that with most Wes Anderson films. They're funny and colorful but not I don't think they're as spectacular as many make them out to be.",

There is some sumptuous imagery and as aforementioned very good acting from\nFiennes but at times the film frustrated me for reasons I don't know.\n\nWhilst it isn't a bad film, it definitely isn't a great film.

Well, to the Grand Budapest, of course, where a wild Eiling comedy unfolds, with Ralph Fiennes taking the typical Alec Guinness role. A wild murder romp that toys with aspect ratios (this was a crazy year for doing crazy shit with cameras/editing, huh?) and is full of the trademark wonderment Anderson's made his name on, this gleefully colorful dark comedy falls right in line with Kind Hearts and Coronets more than The Royal Tenenbaums, which should make it Anderson's most accessible film since that cartoon fox.

The setting is fictional  - but there are echos of what really happened in Europe in the 20th Century - the film is very funny but it is also very sad and there are some genuinely shocking moments. It is a great story as well and it has made me want to find out more about Stefan Zweig upon whose writings the film is based/inspired. Incidentally, Tom Wilkinson's character (and Jude Law's  - who plays the younger version) is based on Zweig - they even look like him - except Zweig committed suicide in 1942. Anyway, back to the film - the story is complete and doesn't feel rushed but I would love to find out more about the hotel and the adventures of its concierge - M. Gustave H. - I don't suppose Wes Anderson would even consider going there, however. But I am very glad he invited to The Grand Budapest Hotel.",

Ralph Fiennes' performance is a highlight as he embraces his role brilliantly.\n\nThe tone and themes of the movie might be light but there were a couple of dark undertones in this movie especially at the end which I won't spoil.

I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I'm confident history will bear me out as being more right than wrong. \n\nProof that Wes had created something special in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is how immensely I enjoyed this movie and simply didn't stop watching it mid-way through like I have a number of Wes' other films. \n\n(\"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\"...really?)\n\n\"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" may not be grand. Surely the performances are whimsical, the comedic timing impeccable and the cinematography captures an almost magical world but none of it in the realm of Oscar-winning accomplishments.

            "content": "Okay so I missed seeing this film months ago. I think it's the only major awards contender I haven't seen. Out of all the great films of 2014, this one is the most creatively artistic. Yes, not even the masterpiece Birdman was as creative or inventive as this film. It recently won Oscars for it's costume and makeup design. \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is directed by the great Wes Anderson, and stars Ralph Fines, Edward Norton, F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson, and Tony Revolori.\n\nMonsieur Gustave H (Fines) is the caretaker of the Grand Budapest Hotel. The true owner of the hotal is unknown. Gustave runs a tight ship at the hotel. One day, a new lobby boy named Zero Moustafa (Revolori) appears. He and Gustave become close firends throughout the film. One day, one of Gustave's elderly lovers dies. He and Zero make the trek to her estate. In her will, she leaves Gustave a famous priceless painting. Others present there-including her son-aren't so happy. Gustave and Zero make off with the painting. Gustave is then the prime suspect for the murder of the elderly women.\n\nRalph Fines is a very talented man. His performance in this film is very good. He and Tony Revolori make a splendid team together. Young Revolori himself gives a charming performance, as do the rest of the incredible cast.\n\nFirst of all, Wes Anderson is an incredible director, and he outdoes himself with Grand Budapest. His direction is surefooted and impressive here. Secondly, this film has an absolutely fantastic script. Birdman may be taking home the Oscar for best screenplay, but in my eyes, this film had the most exquisite screenplay of the year. It is beautifully written, with amazing dialogue and effectively beautiful narration. It felt like I was reading the actual script. The characters are all quirky and interesting, and every character has fine dialogue. Thirdly, you all know I am a sucker for beautiful camera work. Out of all the great cinematography I saw this year (ei. Birdman, Ida), this film could be the best camera work I saw. Yes, Birdman took home the award for that as well, but Robert Yeoman's work here is incredible. All of his shots are symmetrical, stylish, and well lit. The camera movements are glorious, and the amazing costume and set colors worked so well on screen. Lastly, the score. I was desperately hoping Hans Zimmer would take home this one, but Grand Budapest prevailed. Alexandre Desplat took this one, and I have to be honest, it was my second choice for best score. It's a beautiful, artistic score, and I'm very happy for Desplat.\n\nWhat stood out the most concerning this film was the art of it all. The costumes are just marvelous. Every coat, hat, and uniform is well made, and looks authentic. The colors work brilliantly on screen, and the sets were just a cinema lovers wet dream. All the sets, models, and props were unique.\n\nThis film is well made, and it's also very thought provoking. Underneath the amazing script and beautiful production, is a very meaningful story concerning the Holocaust. Young Zero is a Jew who's family was killed during the war. The film shows Zero constantly mistreated because he is Jewish. Gustave is always standing up for him. A prime example is when the two of them travel on the train. Zero is always inspected and mistreated when the soldiers search the train. The film tackles many issues of that time with extreme respect. It reminds me very much of Ida, which also dealt with various political and human issues of the 1930's and 40's. For this reason, I have grave respect for this film.\n\n\"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is a thoughtful and somewhat profound film concerning the terrible events of the Holocaust. Aside from it's beautiful artistic style, it's brilliantly directed by Wes Anderson, and has a stunning script. The performances are good, the costumes are astonishing, and the comedy is extremely clever. It's a clever comedy that manages to be completely respectful to the heavy subject matter.",

With a variety of characters and a peculiar script Wes Anderson is able to grab your attention from the very first minute. The story is set in fictional country of Zubrowka in 1930s. We hear the tale of how Zero Mustafa (Toni Revolori) the lobby boy of the prestigious 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' ends up becoming the owner of the same. He becomes a good friend of the hotel's concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). But things take a turn when someone close to M. Gustave dies and he is arrested suspecting of murder. Zero and Gustave embark on a journey to prove the innocence of M. Gustave where they become even closer friends. Ralph Fiennes has given a fine performance and definitely one of the most under-rated actors. We also have Edward Norton in a relatively smaller role and a exciting Bill Murray cameo as well.\n\n Anderson gives intricate and vibrant detailing to the sets making visually beautiful. Also the make-up and hair styling department has done a great job. The music and background score is wonderful. With a run time of 100 minutes The Grand Budapest Hotel does not overstay its welcome. It is quirky, weird at the same time entertainingly funny with a heart touching story. Definitely worth a watch.\n\nRATING: [4/5]",

It's like watching a 2d cartoon script slide show or playing a wonderful 2d platform game, which is really magnificent. I love the casting, they are so fun to watch. The genuinely made poetic dialogues, it's a top notch. One scene that really caught my attention, is the prison scene. I mean that is really fun, like I'm watching the 3 stooges on a classic Chaplin film. But I felt, I don't have that satisfied feeling. I don't know, maybe it's the over the top sequences, or everything is rushed within an hour and a half. Maybe the story is not drastically dramatic. But let's face it, it is a beautiful piece of art that intended to be done as a classic. It's the genius of film making. 4/5",

            "content": "As a viewer who is not familiar with the work of Wes Anderson all I knew going into The Grand Budapest Hotel was that he is a very \"quirky\" director. Sure enough, right from the beginning we are introduced to his unusual style by having 3 different layers of framing devices before getting to the real story, and then when we get to the story it is introduced with a stop-motion animation sequence showing the exterior of the titular hotel. Of course that all set the perfect tone because most of the characters we meet in the movie are sort of like cartoons themselves. The story is a bit convoluted for me to explain here, but I will simply say that Ralph Fiennes plays an amazing concierge (Gustave) at The Grand Budapest Hotel who likes to sleep with some of the older ladies who stay in his hotel. When one of his conquests dies and names him in her will, the family is frustrated and seeks to take back what they feel belongs to them. All of this is told through the eyes of a new lobby boy who Gustave has taken under his wing. It's a non-stop ride from the moment the will is read. There's a lot of intrigue, action, and entertaining chases. They even include several stop motion sequences in the middle of the film which are crazy, but surprisingly fitting in the overall tone of the movie.\n\nI was really surprised how much fun I was having while watching this film. I mean it is utterly ridiculous, and some of the slapstick silliness rivals the likes of the Three Stooges or Marx Brothers. Yet it did have me chuckling throughout. Anderson does have a very particular way he likes to frame his shots and everything feels far from reality, but it works when assembled together in a wacky movie like this one. In a way it feels like a stage production and everything is presented as if a live audience were sitting in front of every scene watching as it unfolds. The one way that The Grand Budapest Hotel did not work for me, however, was how it came crashing through the fourth wall. The first time I noticed this was in the introduction of so many famous actors. People like Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson would show up and it was almost as if the film paused for the audience to applaud. I genuinely would not have been surprised to see them take a bow before continuing with whatever scene they were in. However the more awkward choice that Anderson makes is the anachronistic language. There are several moments in the film where someone says something that feels utterly out of character, and even out of the time period of the film. Those moments took me out of the movie and I struggled at times getting back into it. Still, I must admit that The Grand Budapest Hotel was a surprisingly fun experience and I'd be interested to see if I would enjoy it even more on a second viewing now that I'm familiar with Anderson's style of humor. If nothing else this has inspired me to seek out other works in his filmography.",

The star of the show is Ralph Fiennes who shines as a sophisticated but incredibly crass hotel concierge.  One moment he may be giving our young protagonist insight into business and high culture.  The next he's dropping F-bombs, getting into fights, and having sex with rich, old women.  Said protagonist (Tony Revolori) plays this film's equivalent of a straight man and acts as a clever foil to Fiennes, grounding the hilarity a bit.  Honorable mentions to Jude Law for some interesting narration and Willem Dafoe's creepy, murderous, Terminator-esque hitman.  Throw in a great soundtrack, superb art direction, and amazing set design and you have the funnest Best Picture nominee for 2014.  If you haven't seen it, you need to fix that.  NOW.",

For the whole movie had no clear direction and lack real character development.\n\nWhat Anderson try to redo here is the artsy romanticized noire of the early 20th century. where he fails is bringing together the cool score produced for the film with timing and acting.

            "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel marks my first entry into the wonderful world of Wes Anderson ... or what was supposed to be the wonderful world of Wes Anderson. Sadly, I find myself on the outside looking in.\n\nI've heard all the acclaim, all the stories, all the Wes Anderson-isms. The Grand Budapest Hotel lives up to every word of it. It is as meticulously put together a movie as I have ever seen. The camera work, the staging of the actors, the sets, the costumes, the dialogue, it is all micromanaged down to the letter. And herein lies a problem. Every aspect of filmmaking in this movie is compressed through Anderson's schtick. There is no room for happy accidents. The movie appears to be made by a well-oiled machine, which is acceptable, because the machine is an inventive one. This movie is unlike any other that I have seen, visually speaking. It's a treat. Then it's another treat. Then it's one treat after another for 100 minutes.\n\nPerhaps I wasn't prepared for it, but by the halfway point, I was drowning in Anderson's pervasively saccharine confection. It's so artificial. Not only does the movie not look real (by design), but it in no way feels real - which is infinitely more disappointing.\n\nI didn't mind the fact that the movie exists in Candy Land, with shockingly obvious usage of models, painted backdrops, etc. The movie is, if nothing else, amazing to look at. But the drama associated with the characters falls woefully short. The movie's definition of character development is relegated to one painfully tired \"my parents died in the war\" scene.\n\nAnother thing that continually took me out of the intrigue of the story are the performances. At the time of its release, I saw a handful of articles outlining Anderson's stickler mentality for dialogue. Each line is a direct mirror of the script, delivered as the director deemed fit. Often, actors have to deliver a hefty amount of dialogue in a very short amount of time. This leads to performances that are not as good as they should/could be.\n\nThe movie is shot like a dance: actor moves into position, actor recites line, camera moves to reveal another actor, actor number two recites line, etc. This smothering style leads to some disappointing performances. You can see the actors rushing to hit their marks, delivering dialogue at an uncomfortable speed, barely keeping up with the director's explicit vision.\n\nIn addition, the movie is stunt casted far past the point of diminishing returns. I counted seventeen actors of great experience and merit in the cast list, two of which actually give performances worth noticing. Ralph Fiennes does everything in his power to bring M. Gustave to the screen. He is not helped by Anderson's extremely narrow direction, but he goes all in on the performance, and it pays off. F. Murray Abraham also brings a welcome level of gravitas to his scenes, though how on God's green earth does Zero grow from being an Indian teenager into a white adult?\n\nThe rest of the cast is horribly disappointing. There are at least fifteen actors who are relegated to one-dimensional characters with very little screen time. Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray are great examples. I legitimately raised an eyebrow at their appearance in the movie. There was absolutely no reason to cast them in these parts. Cast them in substantial roles, by all means. But don't waste these actors talents in pointless cameos.\n\nI can't say that I love much about this movie, but one thing that I have instantly fallen in love with is Alexandre Desplat's musical score. It might just be my second favorite score of the year (behind John Powell's How to Train Your Dragon 2). It's so energetic, unique, and fun!\n\nAlright, so I've basically spent this entire review outlining what I did not like about The Grand Budapest Hotel. But I have to say, the movie is too unique, too stylish, and ultimately, too much fun to be ignored. I saw things I liked in the movie, and I saw things I did not. Anderson makes no attempt to hide any perceived flaws, and I can credit the movie for that. I enjoyed my stay at The Grand Budapest Hotel well enough, but I certainly did not shed a tear as I checked out.\n\n\"There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.\" 6.5/10",

It's not the laugh-out-loud kind of humor that comes from well-timed jokes but rather from the idiosyncrasies of quirky, odd people in extraordinary situations.  Fortunately, I did enjoy this film more than I expected, and I think it's because the story was more lighthearted than some of Anderson's previous work.  I found the world and characters he created quite intriguing.

One of 2014's greatest movies. Anderson makes this a whole lot better than Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and The Royal Tenenbaums. The movie is packed with fantastic scenes, and actors.\n\nThe film takes place in 1932, at a famous European hotel, a remarkable concierge named Gustave H. (played by a great Ralph Finnes), who charms his guests. He is assisted by his junior lobby boy Zero Moustafa (an outstanding breakthrough performance by Tony Revolori), who becomes the friend he trusts. The hotel then leads to a story of finding a valuable Renaissance painting called \"Boy with Apple\", a battle for a large fortune, and  chases on trains, skis, motorcycles, and trains in Wes Anderson's greatest movie yet!\n\nThe cast in the film is great on so many levels. Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, Zero's love interest. Tilda Swinton plays the woman who started this \"Boy With Apple\" adventure. Tom Wilkinson plays the Author who knows the story of this journey. Adrian Brody plays the son of Tilda Swinton's character, who doesn't want to give the painting to Gustave. Edward Norton is the cop who is investigating the scene. Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and William Dofoe also appear in the film.\n\nThe production design on the hotel, trains, buildings, and mountains in the movie are amazing! The costume design is  perfection! The makeup looks so realistic! The original score is legendary. Wes Anderson films usually bore me, but this one actually got my attention. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a wonderful comedy!",

Perhaps those reluctant viewers also quietly know that other than the refined visuals there's really nothing to see here, but they go along with it because of the frenetic pace and quirky characters. Anderson makes use of his flash pan's and tilt's to great effect, but the editing of some of the scenes seems a little sluggish at times, thus not holding the desired rhetoric together. The frame is almost always filled perfectly when static, which is mostly the case as the pan's and dolly's serve as transitions. The changing aspect ratio's are an amusing solution but don't really do anything for the film. But once again, it's all for nothing, as the story and film give the impression they are its own purpose, which is doubly unfortunate because the audience is left without much do hold on to. The scenes tend to be written very poetically and sometimes even overwritten and those lines gave the actors fits. Fiennes is good as M. Gustave while the others just sort of exist as sketches, blending into the style over substance ethos of the entire film. Fans of great camerawork should see it, but anyone looking for more beneath the surface could skip it.",

There are moments of occasional satire on European politics, but overall the film is frothy, light and highly enjoyable. Ralph Fiennes was the highlight for me, his clipped British demeanour put to hilarious comedic effect in the midst of this crazy, zany Anderson world. Go on, give it a go!",

            "content": "Those familiar with Wes Anderson will now know that his style needs no introduction. So much has been written or said about his idiosyncrasy that there are few adjectives left in which to describe his very unique approach to filmmaking and storytelling. Those that find him ostentatious or grandiose will likely want to avoid this (his eight film) while those that rejoice in his work will no doubt find this a boisterous festivity and celebration of his artistry.\n\nDuring the 1960's, a young author (Jude Law) visits The Grand Budapest Hotel - one of Europe's most respected  establishments. He meets it's owner M. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who tells him of when he was a young lobby boy (Tony Revolori) and how he came to know the colourful and flamboyant M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and the adventures they shared in the hotel.\n\nAs much as Anderson's style is so well known now, so too is the consistent ensemble of actors that he's able to amass. All-be-it in cameo roles, his most reliable trio from the early days of his career in Wilson, Schwartzman and Murray are here, once again. His mid-career actors like Goldblum, Dafoe and Brody make further appearances while Swinton, Norton and Keitel add themselves to the mix again following \"Moonrise Kingdom\". Their roles may be small but no matter how small, it's still great to see such a wonderful ensemble of actors all get the chance to interact. However, it's the newcomer in Fiennes that's the main focus and the true star of the show. His performance is endearing and his comic-timing absolutely note perfect. His ability to accentuate a simple word of profanity can, at times, produce some genuinely hilarious moments. After witnessing his work here and his darker comedic turn in \"In Bruges\" it would seem that Fiennes is just as comfortable with comedy as he is with drama. I'd definitely welcome him flexing more of his comedic chops in the future.\n\nAnother one who plays a major role in the proceedings is Robert Yoeman. No Wes Anderson review would be complete without mentioning the sublimely colourful work of this fantastic cinematographer. The film is a real feast for the eyes and as Anderson maintains a brisk pace while juggling numerous characters, Yoeman allows him to create his illusion on a wondrous palette of delicacies.\n\nIt's fast. It's intricately layered. It has a slight edge of darkness. Ultimately, though, it's entertaining - as Anderson so often is. Many have declared it his best film and although I don't agree, I wouldn't argue with it being his most ambitious. 9 Academy Awards (although a glaring omission for Fiennes) is further proof that he hasn't ran out of ideas or that his approach has become tiresome. There seems to be life in Anderson yet and I still find myself wondering and intrigued by what his next adventure will be.\n\nMark Walker",

Pero que eso no reste en lo más mínimo la originalidad y visión de este director, Wes Anderson que sin duda es uno de los genios fílmicos de nuestros tiempos. \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" presenta la narración de un libro ficticio del mismo título (que es un respetuoso tributo al escritor Austriaco Stefan Zweig) donde narra el épico encuentro entre el Concierge Gustave H. y el Lobby Boy Zero Moustaffa forjando una entrañable amistad y un enorme respeto mutuo que los llevará por una vorágine de singulares aventuras conociendo en el proceso una gran gama de fantásticos personajes. Como en sus filmes anteriores, Wes Anderson demuestra un arrollador poder de convocación al lograr un elenco de estrellas, cada uno de ellos, actores y actrices sólidos, que no solo acuden al llamado de Wes Anderson sino que que se lucen en esta brillante y sumamente inteligente comedia. Una obra que no pretende ser históricamente precisa, sino que simplemente implementa a su propio estilo creando una nueva realidad hilarantemente inteligente.

What I mean is I take in what story is unravelling, and what presentation has been laid out for me, the viewer.\n\nWith this, Wes Anderson gifts us with his delightfully whacky, The Grand Budapest Hotel; A cartoony caper that follows the adventures of Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel concierge, who has been framed a murder. With the help of his small, brave lobby boy, Zero Moustafa, they embark to clear his name, and claim what's rightfully his; the painting of \"Boy with Apple\". \n\nAnderson is a director of beauty. Every single moment watching this film I got distracted by the gorgeous grand purple, the extravaganza of mise en scene, and the storyboard camera angles. At times, it became difficult to follow the story because of such well crafted, thought out scenes. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even the aspect ratio changed in each time represented on screen, to show the start of an ever growing technology. Absolutely wonderful. \n\nYet for all its cinematography, the cast is splendid cherry of this marvelous cake. Fiennes and Revolori are brilliant as the hotel duo, playing off each other with impeccable comedic timing. While the film can be classed as a deadpan, or even black comedy at times, TGBH has its moments of woe and harsh realities. While it's set in a fictional place, the events surrounding the time are real history, and these characters have had their experiences. \n\nAnderson fans will adore this hotel escapade. Those who aren't will still love this quirky, funny misadventure. Its achievement of cinematography is something truly to appreciate. Stunning to watch.",

A new role for him, but he dominates the screen with his calm demeanor, hilarious dialogue and quirky actions. Around him are a dozen other notable actors, but the second best role was played by new comer Tony Revolori playing Zero and Gustave H's partner in crime-literally. Supporting efforts from the likes of Owen Wilson, Ed Norton, Adrien Brody and more propel the film even further to the point where you get all caught up in the antics happening on screen.\n\nNext I would talk about Anderson's never failing cinematography, more beautiful than ever before. The camera angles suit the story, as well as the lavish colors. Which brings me to the story line, arguably his most clever and deep. Its a one setting dramedy turned adventure tale in the most wonderful of ways. Racy and comedically violent at times, I consider it a genre-defining film. Wes Anderson so skillfully captures his characters and brings forth a story not likely to be forgotten. The fact that a film of this style got nominated for Best Picture says something.

I have always liked his work but never loved it but that all changed with \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", his most accomplished and entertaining work to date that is likely to appeal to a mass audience. It is also the best movie of the year so far!\n\nIt's a story within a story within a story within a story. The central character in this star-studded vehicle is Ralph Fiennes in a very different, career-best performance as the manager of the title hotel in 1932. He romances old ladies and has a special spot for Madame D (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) who leaves him a priceless painting in her will, leading him and new lobby boy Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori) on the run when he is suspected of her murder. \n\nThe cast is uniformly good but Willem Dafoe is a standout as the henchman of Madame D's villainous son (Adrien Brody). The extended cast includes Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel, Mathieu Amalric, Edward Norton, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum and Saoirse Ronan (as Mustafa's love interest). Most of the roles are brief and Anderson makes a brilliant job directing the cast, a task many other top-tier directors would fail at.\n?\nThe way the story plays out is just like a good book with so many interesting subplots and rich details (it is fitting that in the movie the story is the great work of a novelist). The movie's pacing, storytelling technique and colors (which are just brilliant) reminded me of modern French classic \"Amelie\" without feeling like an imitation.\n\n\"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is worthy of several Oscar nods (Lead Actor, Screenplay, Production Design, Score by Alexandre Desplat, among others) but I just hope the Academy has the memory. This is entertainment at its best! Anderson's screenplay is reportedly inspired by the works of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig.",

Also, the decision to frame nearly every shot dead-center was distracting.  Worth a view on HBO Go?  Sure.  Best picture of the year?  Nope.",

There is never going to be a film that appeals to absolutely everyone, it's just not possible, but Grand Budapest Hotel comes pretty damn close judging by the reviews and the 9 Oscar nominations. It is funny, immensely original and hugely engaging. It has amazing attention to detail and the acting by a stellar cast is second to none. It might not appeal to those who prefer endless action - explosions every 2 minutes, New York destroyed by ice storms or London flattened by meteors (and I must admit that I do enjoy those films too) but I just found this film hugely enjoyable - and at just 96 minutes long, it doesn't drag on or complacently assume that the viewer wishes to spend 3 hours in its company.  A shame that Ralph Fiennes didn't even get an Oscar nod but nevertheless I thought this was a wonderful piece of film-making",

The storyline flowed and absolutely loved the scenery. This film definitely has received the proper praise. It was great to see Adrien Brody back in a film, however, I did giggle a little bit seeing his character. I have noticed that Anderson likes his characters to be quirky and different from other characters. The transitions between past to present was done very well. All of the film flowed nicely and felt natural. No forced transitions. Adored the film and for sure recommend it. If you want a different storyline with some quirky characters you will get a kick out of this film. I honestly hope this film wins a few Academy Awards.",

Even our protagonist Gustave H. is a meaningless cypher, all quirks and puzzles, overly mannered to the point of inhumanity, not a drop of blood in him. And *everyone* is like that; watching The Grand Budapest Hotel feels like watching a cuckoo clock or a music box; it's a pristinely mechanical thing, impressive primarily from an engineer's perspective.\n\nAll this is a little painful to say, but it must still be said that a below-par Wes Anderson film is still an ingenious, unique thing, and this is still a zippy, entertaining little caper with plenty to enjoy for those with a taste for the daft - it's just that it's utter, utter fluff. Crying 'style over substance' is 100% valid, but what we have here is an absolutely mind-boggling amount of style (seriously, this is one of the most brilliantly realised feats of cinematography I've ever seen) and essentially zero substance. If you want Anderson's eccentric visual flair as well as characters which actually resonate, he is yet to top The Royal Tenenbaums. Thinking about it, I'm not entirely sure he's trying.",

Fabulous film, probably the best from a mainstream American studio for 2014.",

If you like any of Anderson's other movies you will enjoy this because they are all very similar and feature a lot of the same actors.  I was impressed with the amount of talented actors featured in the film but most of them had small irrelevant parts.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is the first film from Wes Anderson where his directing style takes a backseat to the plot and the narrative style. Anderson fans have become accustomed to his quirky nature, but The Grand Budapest Hotel is a stark reminder that not only is he capable of surprising those of us callused to his films, but he can gut-punch us with a drama that hits the heart in a big way.

When one of his favorite guests die, the two must deal with her overbearing family, their psychotic servant, a stolen painting, and being accused of murder.\n\nI was first introduced to Wes Anderson's work when I saw Fantastic Mr. Fox (watch it if you haven't yet) and was a fan right away. After the equally great Moonrise Kingdom two years ago, I was excited to hear he had another movie coming out this year. Even though I had no idea what exactly would happen in it, I knew I would enjoy it. I wasen't sure if it would end up playing near me, but as luck would have it one of my theaters ended up showing it and I got to see it.\n\nAnderson's usual cast of supporting actors show up. Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, and Tilda Swinton all make appearances, even though some are sadly briefer than others.\nRalph Fiennes's Guastave could easily have been an unlikable tool, but he's a fun eccentric character. Still a tool, but a likeable tool. It's also kind of fun seeing Lord Voldemort and The White Witch sitting down and eating lunch together.\nThis will easily be remembered as Tony Revolori's breakout role, it should get him some great attention from other directors and we'll see a lot more of him.\nAdrian Brody and Willem Dafoe are our bad guys. Of course everyone knows that Dafoe can play the villain perfectly, no difference this time around, but Brody is a fun surprise at being a great spoiled, evil brat.\nAlso I'm glad to see Jeff Goldblum making a small comeback in the recent years, and his appearance in this movie is great too.\n\nThe thing I love about Wes Anderson's films is they are completely and utterly unique. While a lot of directors are inspired from and pay homage to the works of their long time favorites, Anderson creates a world that is all his own. The scenery and buildings feel real yet wonderfully fictional in part to the fantastic cinematography that makes you feel like your walking alongside the characters or sitting in the same room as them.\nIt might be a little too weird for some people and if you enjoy it, good luck trying to explain what it's about to other people. The Grand Budapest Hotel is defiantly for people who enjoy their movies being a bit different from the normal.\n\n8 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"Me and the boys talked it over. We think you are a really straight fellow.\"\n\"Well, I've never been accused of that before but I appreciate the sentiment.\"",

Repeated jokes can be found en masse, along with \"color saturation,\" or as I like to call it, Wes Anderson trying his damndest to tell you what the color yellow means.

There's a couple decent laughs, but most of the time, I'm sitting here wondering \"why?\" I can at least say I liked it better than The Royal Tennenboobs. Because that last joke has the maturity of some other jokes in this movie. But fine. You like Anderson's style. You like Tennebaums and Mr. Fox and Rushmore. Can you not tell me you don't want Anderson to branch out? He is using the same style in this movie that he was using over 15 freaking years ago.

I quite enjoyed it although any more weirder would have been too much. Fiennes is perfect as the legendary concierge and the many cameos work. Visually experimental and quirky as a whole this is a must for Anderson fans and open minded viewers as well.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's signature style flourishes in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\"  That is a polite and complimentary way of saying \"This movie is very odd.\"  The ensemble cast alone is reason to watch (since everybody is bound to have a favorite on the list), but the way that each actor is utilized makes it even better.  The list includes Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray, and that's less than half of the list!  From F. Murray's sophistication to Willem Dafoe's cold-blooded intensity, you never know what type of character the next star will play.  My only complaint about the film is that I wish I could spend more time with each character.  The Russian Matryoshka Doll introduction of the story that quickly transports us from the present to 1985 to 1968 to 1932 seems a bit unnecessary but sets the tone for the entire film.  Anderson's lighthearted approach to serious situations like death, prison, and war make for a viewing experience that I can only describe as \"awkwardly enjoyable.\"  It is amazing how much actually happens in the 100-minute runtime as characters fly in for a short chapter and then disappear for the rest.  I believe that this film will see some Oscar nominations, particularly for its screenplay and acting.  I wouldn't consider it to be one of the best films that I've seen, but the unique style makes me anxious to revisit \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" soon.",

This was my first-ever approach to Wes Anderson's movies, so my perspective is wholly unique and somewhat virginal. I had my ACOG sight clipped on, my eyes were locked in. And, notably, I liked his style, especially his specificity. Everything is exactly how Anderson wants it to be. He has both the smaller and bigger pictures in his mind that he pencils in masterfully. There was broad and narrow themes and Wes portrays them so accurately and so precisely. I believe the parody of Anderson is the symmetrical composed shots, and this movie really takes that at its word and encompasses that. I mean every single shot is of that style. The aspect ratios of the screen even change through the different timeline brackets, which was cool, including the crisp black and white scene at the end. The camera feels on train tracks or on a rotator cuff at times. Ralph Fiennes is spectacular in this movie. He is so nuance. You think he is this sort of English dandy, prim and proper, but then it breaks away at the seams with these fits of cussing and moments of cruelty mixed with beauty. He is just such an interesting character. There is a story within a story within a story within a story. The storylines are layered like a Mendl's cake. And storytelling ends up being what the movie is ultimately about, I think. The idea that when a story gets filtered through different people. Different interpretations get driven through it and heighten it and deepen it in certain spots. It's probably lost consistency over the tellings and retellings of the story. I found myself breathing in the sweet aroma of this movie and was left completely breathless at the end. Wes Anderson is spinning this yarn with these characters. And I was delightfully following the thread the whole way through. I realize it's hard to walk the line of a drama comedy, yet they balance the tone at emotional equilibrium. I mean, both the funniness and the grave seriousness, Ralph Fiennes and Anthony Quinonez (had to spell-check that) pull it off with such panache. Wink. Quick word on Zero. I love the vintage morale of Zero's devotion to his job and how that's intwined with his identity and character. That resonated with me because I mourn the loss of that in places of businesses today. I far too often go to those places and have people giving off this err of not giving a dang. And I love the message relayed by Zero being emotionally invested in his job. One other thing: Ed Norton, by all accounts should be speaking in a German accent right? And that guy at the end who looked like Father Abraham. We're expected to believe that was Zero 50 years later. He's not even the same race. That being said, I think with Wes Anderson, he's stooped in his own rebellious schemes, that he's willing to break Hollywood rules and confidently construct his own universe. Also, best hotel movie I've seen to date, I think.",

E a verdade é que pega nessa mesma história com um irresistível ritmo de 400 metros crawl, que não ficaria para trás se tivesse de nadar ao lado do Scorsese mais acelerado (\"Goodfellas\", \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"). Tendo isso em conta e entretidos também pela química familiar desenvolvida entre Ralph Fiennes e o estreante Tony Revolori, ficamos sem tempo para reparar que Wes Anderson não consegue mesmo escapar à tendência de transformar cada um dos seus filmes numa casinha de bonecas (mesmo que este tenha menos daqueles planos dos objectos organizadinhos sobre a mesa).  Muito menos consegue evitar também gags totalmente falhados como o episódio da Sociedade das Chaves Cruzadas,  que serve só mesmo para convocar Bill Murray e assim arrecadar os pontos de \"coolness\" que essa presença traz.",

A plaque reads \"Author\" \"in honour of our National treasure, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a book with \"The Grand Budapest Hotel written across its front, she then turns the book over to reveal a black and white picture of the \"Author\". The picture turns to colour and the Author begins narrating the story from behind his desk in 1985. He begins to tell the story of a hotel he once visited many years earlier in 1968 the hotel of course was The Grand Budapest. Set in a fictitious place the hotel stood in Alpine Alps somewhere in Europe. The young Author talks about how the once Grand Budapest hotel is now in a dire state, run down and looking a lot worse for wear. Whilst bathing he meets the current owner a mysterious and sad looking man, he soon learns this man is the current owner, he learns that he was once the richest man in the world who owned all the riches one could ever imagine. The owner invites the author to a meal and begins to tell his story. The owner agrees and begins to tell his tale of how he arrived and now owns the Grand Budapest Hotel. Flash back to 1932 and the owner now a young lobby boy begins the tale once more for the author he begins to fill the ears of the Author as he is whisked away to another time and into a life of murder, theft, love, sex, art and riches.....\nVisually this story is stunning, plot wise the story telling is masterful, the camera shots used are vibrant and gorgeous, the score is an absolute journey from begging to end, the humour is endless, a little dark in places but still very typical of Wes Anderson's style. At times it did run a little slow in places but not enough to take anything negative. The cast was huge, so many big well-known names and every one of them played their character perfectly. Ralph Fiennes (Clash of the Titans, The Hurt Locker) as Monsieur Gustave H, was brilliant darling so charismatic and lovable. Tony Revolori (very new to the movie world) as Young Zero Moustafa was also amazing as Gustave H right hand man. F. Murray Abraham (Scarface, Amadeus) as Old Zero Moustafa. Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong) as the vile Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis, Willem Dafoe (The English Patient, Spider-Man) as J.G. Jopling Dmitri's right hand assassin. Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, Independence Day) as Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, add to this already amazing ensemble Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and a plethora of other very big names and you start to get an idea at how big this film really is. You would think having so many huge names could only equal bigger egos and a total mess, but it is the complete opposite.\nI loved The Grand Budapest Hotel it is unlike Wes Andersons other film in the sense that this one has much more of a plot which of course only helps. I would recommend this for anyone who can look beyond big bangs and actually enjoy a real film. If your idea of a great film is Die Hard or something else as crass and pointless I wouldn't bother because you actually need to be slightly intellectual to really enjoy this one. Better yet if you don't like films with subtitles stay away, not that this has any it'll just make you think more than you normally would like to.\n4 out of 5 BanShee Screams.\nThanks for reading.\nX\n#thegrandbudapesthotel",

The acting performances were all very distinct and all very well portrayed by the actors. The standout performances being Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, one putting in one of the better performances of his career and the other making himself known to the world with this amazing debut to film. This film had a very different and specific style of humour that is not typically used in modern comedies. This both helped to film but i think also slightly hurt it. It did take a little while to understand the humour the director was going for, but once i did it became more clear how it was being used with the overall plot. The plot was an interesting one that takes you back through time and doesn't spend too long in a single location, which really helps to move the film along quickly and provide a variety of scenery. In the end it is the directing techniques used by Wes Anderson that really make this film shine. - 8.3",

            "content": "A quirky little tale that was inspired by the writings of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig. I have never heard of this guy and I don't know of his work (as far as I'm aware), so unfortunately I cannot comment any further on this movies accuracy adapting or being influenced by Zweig's work. What I do know is to expect all the trademark Wes Anderson quirks from plot themes visual style and of course casting that we have all become accustomed too. Now I will admit this does kinda bother me somewhat as I find this sort of repetition, mainly in his casting, a tad mundane and unadventurous, or at least it can lead to that (Tim Burton).  \n\nLuckily this movies theme and visual direction grabbed my attention...well mainly the visuals. The story begins with flashbacks within flashbacks as a young girl starts to read from a memoir written by the 'author' (Tom Wilkinson). The memoir recounts a tale about a trip he made to the Grand Budapest Hotel back in 1968, the younger version of the author played by Jude Law. The young author meets up with the aging hotel owner played by F. Murray Abraham and they discuss how he became the owner. This in turn leads to another flashback to 1932 as we see the young hotel owner as a lobby boy under the tutelage of the hotel concierge played by Ralph Fiennes.\n\nThe movie is basically a Germanic/eastern European wartime murder mystery split into five chapters. An wealthy elderly hotel guest dies and leaves Fiennes character (Gustave) a valuable painting much to the anger of her odious money grabbing relatives. It is then discovered the old woman has been murdered and Fiennes is a prime suspect. What follows from there is a madcap vintage slapstick of a black comedy as we tag along with Gustave and his lobby boy Zero as they attempt to evade dangerous relatives, soldiers and prison (long story short).\n\nSo as I said for me this movie grabbed my attention through its unique visual style which kinda reminded me of classic murder mysteries but in a very Germanic sense. You could maybe drawn comparisons to the comedy 'Clue'? visually at least...kinda. The actual hotel surrounding background and the funicular are a highly detailed models which are based on real locations in the Czech Republic (the hotel anyway). I adored these models because they simply looked fantastic, admittedly obvious models but that's the appeal...it looks like a model railway set. The cold snowy terrain and weather really gives this movie a warm cozy atmosphere, the cutesy models, highly decorative traditional interior sets (very continental) and characters that look like your old relations all combine to give this almost Christmas glow to the proceedings...or it could just be me.\n\nThis sumptuous visual flair is helped along by the colour scheme of certain sequences such as the hotel being a light shade of pink making it look like a large cake. The interiors are also bright and colourful as are the staff uniforms in that classic 30's style. The fact that young Zero's girlfriend also works at the local bakery making fluffy mouth-watering pastel coloured baked treats almost feels like Anderson is teasing us. On top of that the bakery van is also a deliciously looking light shade of pink making you literately think of nothing but pink icing marshmallows and cakes! Its tantamount to torture I tells ya! \n\nOn the flip side the fictional war aspect of the tale which is set in between the two great wars (1932) clearly looks and feels like WWI but it isn't...I don't think. Despite the whimsical vibe there are still beatings murder and oppression in some forms in the latter half of the movie, nothing hideous but enough to jolt you out of your cozy spot. I guess the real problem for me was the casting...yes that's right the casting. The movie is based around European aristocracy, puffed up rich continental types with fat moustaches that you'd normally see living currently in certain areas of north London. The issue is they are all played by very American actors and it doesn't really gel half the time.\n\nFiennes is easily the best thing going here and he fits his role perfectly with his own upper crust upbringing. His performance is both charming and amusing with his suave debonair persona as he greets and sucks up to the guests...then all of a sudden blammo!...he'll drop an F-bomb outta nowhere...brilliant! Kudos also to his sidekick played by Tony Revolori who looks just the ticket as the young alert lobby boy, dude looks like Penfold (Danger Mouse). There are various other decent performances throughout (too many cast members to mention) but its the odd characters played by Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson (basically the entire American cast) that just don't work. The only American that does slot in well is Dafoe as the assassin who basically looks like Count Orlok once again...so yes that fits into this era and region perfectly.\n\nThese characters are meant to be Europeans in a small landlocked alpine country...yet they have American accents! plus some of these stars don't really do a great job performance wise either. You do get the impression Anderson revels in collecting a large glittering ensemble cast that looks stunning on paper and the movie posters but don't necessarily fit the bill. Plus I also get the impression Anderson kinda likes to play dress up with these big stars and not worrying so much about their characters, after all this whole movie does tend to look like an illustrated children's book or an explosion from within a toy box (with layers of pink icing on top). \n\nEssentially the story is about greed I guess, on the surface everything seems sweet and pleasant but dig down and really everybody is a bit of a shit and not to be trusted...including Gustave to a degree. I'm not even sure if I liked any of the characters really, I suppose the lobby boy is our (the viewers) most trusted ally. In the end the movie ends on a happy note or so you think, Anderson finally slaps you across the face as the very ending is actually quite sad and grim like some kind of children's fairytale. Its an odd one for sure, starts off like as a feel good flick...visually looking like everything is taking place within a snow globe, but slowly grinds you down until you feel like sobbing at the finale. I still can't really decide if I actually liked it or not, its certainly well made directed and crafted but its not what I thought it would be. I must give kudos to Anderson for his creation and storytelling (even though it all feels a tad ostentatious) but I still can't help but feel somewhat empty and emotionless towards it even though I really really wanted to love it.",

            "content": "Basic: So, there is a lot of plotting going on in this film, but anyway, the story starts off where a young girl, who's reading a book called, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", which is made by the author (Tom Wilkinson), and then it flips back to the author a little bit, and then it flips back to 1968, of a writer (Jude Law), that he met a person named Zero(F. Murray Abraham), and then it flips back to 1932 of where the young Zero (Newcomer Tony Revolori), who's a lobby boy, and spends his time at The Grand Budapest Hotel. Then, lastly, it spends almost the rest of the film on M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), and young Zero of where both of them get involved into murder, theft, and also into some big adventures as well. It's like a box inside a box inside a box inside a box.\n\nWhat's the deal: I wouldn't say that I am a big fan of Wes Anderson, but it doesn't mean that I disliked his work. There are things that I like about it his work. He knows how to make a great soundtrack in his movies, and he's also a filmmaker, that does so much style, and creativity. In fact, I've only seen two of his movies. The first one, was Fantastic Mr. Fox, which I had a good time watching it from start to finish, and then somebody recommended me to watch Rushmore, which it's a classic coming-of-age film, and I actually enjoyed it. Now for his newest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, I've to say that this one is more than to be liked. Truly, and being honest to myself, that I really like this film, and there are things that I really like about it. The settings and the shots of it are very exquisite and very colorful enough. I do believe that it's gonna win some Oscars for that. The storytelling devices in the film are super creative, but what I think of what makes it even greater is how both the story, and the characters are so effective, and outrageous. The film does have a great screenplay by Wes Anderson, which it is the best screenplay he has ever written, and it's very humorous, and absolutely brilliant. Plus, the cast is fantastic. Ralph Fiennes, who I see him in serious roles rather than comedic roles, but he actually carried a lot of humor and a sense of awe through this whole movie. Tony Revolori does have a lot of talent, while Saoirse Ronan is getting better and better of her acting. They do make a great relationship to each other. F. Murray Abraham does carry some big emotions in the film, and the rest of the cast, well done job. The pacing does come off fast, but I don't have a problem with it. The ending is pretty emotional, and even though I don't like sad ending, this type of ending does make me feel satisfy. Alexandre Desplat's music is amazing. Milena Canonero's costumes look beautiful. Right now, I've seen it three times, and I still really like the film a lot.  \n\nMy full opinion: The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably the most marvelous film by Wes Anderson, and it's also one that takes you in a silly, joyful, and breathtaking ride. 9.7/10",

            "content": "Loaded with extremely high expectations even before being released, The Grand Hotel Budapest is a typical cult Wes Anderson delivery which will either make you love or hate it. Completely polarizing, it is an absurd, frenzy story, with elements of black comedy which actually is quite thoughtful. \n\nEven though the movie's name suggests that the hotel and what happens there between the two world wars would be the center of the story, director Wes Anderson takes a completely different approach. The Grand Hotel is only a partial background for Zero Moustafa's (Toni Revolori) life and adventures as a lobby boy. Hired by Mr. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) , the iconic concierge of The Grand Hotel Budapest, Zero gets involved in a frenzy adventure to, falls in love and grows up as a person amidst a battle for a huge family fortune. \n\nTo many the story would seem a bit too scattered and silly, while the character might be seen as too quirky. However, those familiar with Wes Anderson's style and previous deliveries would expect exactly this from the movie!  His typical dark humor, references to the not-so-far-yet-forgotten-past and tributes to the classical film-making are to be observed all over his delivery. Every single shot and frame is nostalgic. Even the actors and their performances are marked by the Wes Anderson's love for the cinematic history. Speaking of acting, the huge list of A-star Hollywood names is a pleasure to be observed simply because everyone is so unique in his or her old-school character. Needless to say, above all is Ralph Fiennes, who character of a player, seducer of old women, yet a perfectionist when it comes to his profession and to hotel management. \n\nGiven the track record of Wes Anderson, The Grand Hotel Budapest is hard to be considered his best delivery. Simply because he has no bad movie and all of them have been an example of classic film-making. That is why, by saying that The Grand Budapest Hotel is another Wes Anderson delivery that matches his standard is simply enough to make this movie a must see !",

While the plot and screenplay is driven very fast and some aspects of the film's overall story feel a little too broad, I was continually fixated on the visual elements of this film. Brillaint costume design and stunning acting from a large talented cast is able to deter away some of the film's less noteworthy aspects such as its anti-climatic ending. While the film definitely has its emotional and comedic show stoppers, the ending felt very flat, as if the film just ended without an concluding stunner. We always knew the ending, and though the means to getting to there were twisting and exciting, it would have been nice to end on something a bit more groundbreaking and suspensful. The real star of this film though has to be Wes Anderson whose thoughtful, precise yet visually brave direction leads to film into a new style of modern cinema. Something a little different with its various settings, unique effects, deep themes and extravagant design, Grand Budapest may not be as groundbreaking or dramatic as it tries, and could have been, however with a perfect lead performance from Ralph Fiennes, this film is able to create its own path and ultimately can still stick out from the busy arthouse genre with films that are becoming so similar and unexciting these days.",

            "content": "There is no doubt that Wes Anderson is a master story teller. His films are charming to a degree that we can only describe as being in love with his films. But his latest endeavor, The Grand Budapest Hotel, stinks of cuteness. He must have shared notes with Tim Burton regarding one's own stylistic choices, because his pseudo-expressionism borders on self-parody.\n\nIt's refreshing to see Ralph Finnes play a character who isn't evil, corrupted, dark, or whatever variation on evil there is. I found his character to be a bit much. In the past, we've dealt with characters who have had foils that I can personally relate to. Royal Tenenbaum was an asshole who was never close to his family, while Scout Master Ward in Moonrise Kingdom feared being a failure. I could not latch on to the suave, over the top M. Gustav. The best acting moments came when Gustave would simply declare \"fuck it\" or a moment when (SPOILER) someone is pushed off of a cliff (END SPOILER). The only character I found truly fascinating was Agatha and unfortunately, she served only as a romantic partner and reason for Zero to step up to the plate in the film's third act.\n\nWes Anderson's direction coupled with Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography are without a doubt the most memorable aspects of the film, certainly more so than the performances or the interweaving story (which I found not to be too interesting). The scenes with Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe are gorgeously lit and beautifully shot. Anderson moves the camera around like a dream, creating suspense simply through movement as opposed to using body language or the POV of the characters in that scene.\n\nAfter falling in love with Wes Anderson with his previous work, I found The Grand Budapest Hotel to be a self indulgent bore fest. Don't get me wrong, this film is not bad and I'm happy that an independent release of this nature was able to find main stream success, but simply put, this movie is \"too Wes Anderson.\" It oozes his style, as I had mentioned before, to the point of self parody and slight groans every time the camera panned to the left or right of a focal point.",

The movie got really silly and tedious in its long, spy-thriller, Mission Impossible-style scenes of escape and networked communication.  Again, too clever by half.  It wasn't worth my time.  Credit, however, to the actors and the set department for making a little something out of a poorly-conceived story and a less-than-stellar script.  That said, Ed Norton was wasted in this film, and it's slightly upsetting to see a brilliant actor like Norton reduced to taking roles like the one he played in The Grand Budapest Hotel.",

And that's where The Grand Budapest Hotel achieves on so many levels. It has all of the above and more. A great story told by a great storyteller.\n\nI would call this movie a hybrid. It is part murder mystery, part comedy, and part period piece all at the same time. It has something for everyone. So to say this is a movie that is unique is quite an understatement. You have never seen a movie like this, I have never seen a movie like it either, and I gobbled it up with pure glee.\n\nThe movie has an overwhelming cast of great actors: Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, and many many more. Usually when you assemble such a fantastic team of actors, it does not quite work. Some movies treat them as cameos and never really get much from them. Or one might outshine another. Or even worse, none might shine at all.\n\nBut this movie gets it right. No character feels out of place, and believe you me, there are a lot of A-list celebrity actors who play different characters, yet they all seem to mesh so well. Why you ask? Because first and foremost, this is a great story and script. The acting is top notch. The dialogue is brilliant and comedy gold. \n\nThe characters hilariously chat up a storm, oblivious to the here and now so much so it puts their lives in danger. The dialogue between Zero Mustafa, played by Tony Revolori and Gustave, played by Ralph Fiennes, is majestic, magnificent, and mirthful. Add this to a who's who of actors, a wonderful and alluring plot, great acting, and you end up with a must see movie for all.",

            "content": "In the Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state ravaged by war and poverty, a young writer (Jude Law) discovers that the remote mountainside hotel has fallen on hard times. Many of its lustrous facilities are now in a poor state of repair, and its guests are few. The writer encounters the hotel's elderly owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), one afternoon, and they agree to meet later that evening. Over dinner in the hotel's enormous dining room, Mr. Moustafa tells him the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel and why he is unwilling to close it down. The story begins in 1932 during the hotel's glory days when the young Zero (Tony Revolori) was a lobby boy. Zubrowka is on the verge of war, but this is of little concern to Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. The owner of the hotel is unknown and only relays important messages through lawyer Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). When he is not attending to the needs of the hotel's wealthy clientele or managing its staff, Gustave courts a series of aging women who flock to the hotel to enjoy his \"exceptional service\". One of the ladies is Madame Céline Villeneuve \"Madame D\" Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton), and Gustave spends the night with her prior to her departure. One month later, he is informed that Madame D has died under mysterious circumstances. Taking Zero along, he races to her wake and the reading of the will, where Kovacs, coincidentally the executor of the will, reveals that she had bequeathed Gustave Boy with Apple, a very valuable painting, in her will. This enrages her family, all of whom hoped to inherit it. Her son, Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis (Adrien Brody) lashes out at Gustave. With the help of Zero, Gustave takes the painting and returns to the Grand Budapest, securing the painting in the hotel's safe. During the journey, Gustave makes a pact with Zero: in return for the latter's help, he makes Zero his heir. Shortly thereafter, Gustave is arrested and imprisoned for the murder of Madame D after forced testimony by Serge X (Mathieu Amalric), Madame D's butler. Zero aids Gustave in escaping from Zubrowka's prison by sending a series of stoneworking tools concealed inside cakes made by Zero's fiancée Agatha (Saoirse Ronan). Along with a group of convicts, Gustave digs his way out of his cell. Gustave then teams up with Zero to prove his innocence... \n\nWes Anderson is a director you either love or hate as I have said before, to be quite blunt. I had a hard time to accept his a bit too ambitious and \"smarty pants\" hipster sort movies at first, but with \"Life Aquatic\" and \"Moonrise Kingdom\" he managed to convince me with his theatrical colourful stories and his attention to details. I reckon \"Moonrise Kingdom\" is one of his best features, so I had high hopes for \"Grand Hotel Budapest\" as the positive reviews came pouring in. My first reaction after seeing the \"Grand Hotel Budapest\" was that is was to be honest a bit boring, stale, too long and it almost felt that he made it with just his left hand. With that I mean the storyline just didn´t engage me at least as his previous movies did. It´s a great cast, but the whole production feels more like an excuse for a fancy dress up party that really leads nowhere and all the characters has this deadpan look on their face throughout the movie. Yes, Fiennes makes an impression as Gustave H with his dry wit and farcical appearance which we are not used to see and it´s always a treat to see so many big names in one movie giving life to all these strange characters.

Anderson e seu inseparável Diretor de Fotografia, Robert Yeoman, brincam com cores e movimentos inesperados que terminam em enquadramentos simétricos cheios de profundidade de campo e elementos curiosos na composição do quadro.\nComo se não bastasse, a história, mais profunda do que parece num primeiro momento, se utiliza de uma narrativa similar à de um conto infantil, hilária e cheia dos personagens sempre estranhos do diretor, interpretados por um elenco tão estelar (alguns fazem apenas 'cameos'!) que dá para pensar que trabalhariam de graça para ele. \nFilme espetacular!",

I believe this is his best film to date and may even be his masterpiece.  It of course is teeming with his signature style and includes the typical group of kooky characters, but there is a melancholy about the story that resonated with me more than his other work.   This movie is brilliant for many reasons, but what makes it original is that it is so much at the same time:  it's a dark comedy, screwball comedy, crime caper, and a fairy tale (albeit more Hans Christian Anderson than Disney), and somehow it all blends together seamlessly.  The writing is fantastic and absolutely should at least be nominated for an Oscar:  the narrative is tight, the plot is fluid, and the dialogue is sublime.  It stars Anderson's usual army of A-list actors, and of course they are all great, but it's Tilda Swinton who steals the show, who only has two scenes but is somehow the standout performance.  Though I hate to even say that because Ralph Fiennes is perfect in the lead role (as well as newcomer Tony Revolori).   Who knew Fiennes had such great comedic timing?   This movie is beautiful, whimsical, stylish, sentimental, rich, quirky, and hilarious (the chase scene in particular had me in stitches!).  If you haven't already, you gotta see it.  The best movie I've seen so far this year.",

Every Wes Anderson's film precedes his previous one and I would say he brought his uniqueness in a whole new level this time. This time he is not talking about family. He portraits the trustworthy friendship between mr. Gustuva and his lobby, Zero in a humorous and vivid way. Together  with the tricks of framing and colours, Anderson creates his own world, which always willing to give a warm welcome to audience. I might say in previous Anderson's film, the storyline might not be the strongest part of all aspects. But this time, the pace of the story seem to be more friendly to audiences. Dividing the story plots by book chapters makes me can't wait to see what's going on, just like what we do when we have a book on hand.\n\nThere is one saying, the only film which looks alike anderson's film is the other Anderson's film.

The two posters we saw in the cinema walls were quite dull: one with a gallery of ancient photographs of people who we did not know of, and a large pink building in the centre in front of the misty mountains. We didn't expect anything from this film while entering the cinema... but turned out to be laughing and having the urge to watch the film again when leaving the theatre. \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" directed by Wes Anderson, is a comedy film that revolves around the adventure of a posh concierge and his lobby boy during the first and second World Wars. As soon as the film began, I was attracted to the vivid colours, (especially pink), unique (ridiculously silly) characters that have cartoony characteristics and their humour, and the imaginary creative editing which I believe are the gems of this film. Every moment of the film did not stop from impressing me at all. I don't really remember what the sound design like, but I do remember that..back in summer when I knew this film was going to be shown on my flight, I resisted to watch it because I didn't want to watch this film on a tiny screen with headphones with too much noise around me. If I had the chance to watch this again.. I will go buy it and watch it. I am now pretty excited to purchase the DVD of this film and watch the \"behind the scenes\" . No regrets, amazing film, a good film if you want a good laugh.",

I also like the rest of actors in this movie. And the ticket was really really hard to get, so many people want to watch this movie, it was lucky to me to finally got one.\nIt's an adventure story about Mr.Gustave and his lobby boy Zero. I won't say anything else about the story because I don't want to spoiler. I strongly recommend you to actually watch it. You may find that Ralph Fiennes not only can play gentleman and Voldemort, he can also play comedy, and he can do it in a very good way. The last time he plays a little comedy part in a movie was in the movie which called In Bruge. That's also one of my favourite one.\nAt the very beginning, I was like saying \"What the...\" \"Oh my god\" every ten minutes. Because it really is an unusual movie. Not just because of the story, but also because the technique of expression, the color it used, the composition of the scene and many other things. I even thought the director must be a psycho or something because the whole pictures were just like a dream, sometimes it's illogic, but it won't interfere your understanding, and that's why it is fascinating.",

What more is there to say? \n\nI am beginning to totally dig Wes Anderson's style of directing. I like the quirkiness of his films like \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\", \"Moonrise Kingdom\" and \"The Darjeeling Limited\"; he's makes the films seem so clever and even though it's not laugh-out-loud funny; there's plenty of humor in his film which I really enjoy. The cast in this film was superb: of course, Ralph Fiennes (M. Gustave) is my all-time favorite actor and was the sole reason I wanted to watch this film; but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the other cast members are also some of my favorite actors. Tom Wilkinson (Author) is always a treat to watch, Adrien Brody (Dmitri) is just hubba-hubba in my book and it worth it even seeing s glimpse of him in any film. I also like Jude Law (the young writer), the wonderfully talented Saoirse Ronan (Agatha), the ubber cute Edward Norton (Henckels), the awesome Tilda Swinton (Madame D.) and the hilarious Bill Murray (M. Ivan). But I must admit, among the sea-of-talented actors, there were two standout performances and its coincidentally for the same character: F. Murray Abraham (M. Moustafa) and Tony Revolori (Zero). I mean, you expect a brilliant performance from Mr. Fiennes but Revolori complimented his performance so perfectly that it's hard to deny the chemistry between the two characters-- their like a matching set of salt-and-pepper shakers, you can't have one without the other. F. Murray Abraham, although his character doesn't appear with Mr. Fiennes', he portrayed the *****SPOILERS***** older version of Zero so convincingly that you just instantly fall in-love with him because he's the grandfather you've always wanted to have type of guy. He did a really terrific job! In fact, this film is probably one of the best films I've seen all year and the cast was so divine, there wasn't a miss-cast part in the entire film; they were all truly marvelous and the story was just awesome!!!

These central characters along with nearly all of the others are infectiously fascinating with all of their strange nuances and mannerisms. The dialogue is often very frank and therefore, a bit strange and striking, but this style along with the slightly unorthodox yet compelling cinematography combine for a pleasingly bizarre experience. The style is one of the best qualities of the movie and never really gets old; however, it can at times seem a little artificial and awkward, despite its otherwise overwhelming success. The movie is also quite funny in many places both as a result of its unconventionality as well as its cleverness. \nWhile the overall style of the movie is by design eccentric and a bit absurd, the plot itself is coherent and very intriguing.

It tells the story of a suave concierge, Gustave H. who has a taste for the older lady clients of the hotel where he works. Gustave takes a new lobby boy, Zero, under his wing to teach him the trade but the unlikely couple soon become embroiled in a case of murder and the theft of a priceless artwork. This film is hugely enjoyable and very funny. It has a cast of pantomime characters and preposterous situations that mean it occupies a world just slightly removed from reality however, it is utterly charming and brilliantly made. There's a stellar case with the likes of Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham. Fiennes takes the lead role of Gustave H. with Tony Revolori as the young lobby boy, Zero. Fiennes plays his role with the perfect pitch, balancing deftly somewhere between pillar of the community and a bit of a cad. Revolori is great too managing to be wide-eyed innocent and a quick-thinking foil. The film looks opulent and sumptuous with its 1930s Eastern European setting giving it a suitably grand and exotic appearance. Wes Anderson handles the more slapstick and overtly comic moments well and directs with care and precision to make many scenes genuinely moving. It's a long time since I've seen a film that was this inventive, sharp and clever. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and recommend it highly.",

That said, I really wanted to like this film.  The trailer marketed it as a fast paced caper that just seemed too bent on Anderson-lunacies that it might have worked.  It doesn't fully come together, but it's still an entertaining piece thanks to Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori.  Even at a slim hour and 40 minutes, the story gets bogged down with too much meandering, side stories and cuteness and it almost becomes too complex for it's own simplicity of the payoff.  In the end, it comes off as a Tarantino meets Anderson if told as Life of Pi meets Inception.  Not an amazing film, but artistically is probably the best all year.",

We travel back in time to the 1930?s at the hotel's peak of grandiosity to meet the beguiling M. Gustave, Zero's one time predecessor and mentor.  A battle of fortune and theft sets forward a monumental ordeal involving an insurmountable many.\n\nM. Gustave is a meticulous man with a taste for the finest comforts in life. Ralph Fiennes plays the bourgeois concierge completely straight and, yet, is the source of most laughs in this comedy and is wonderful to watch. The rest of the film is a who's who of well-known actors in fully realized idiosyncratic character performances. Expect to see Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, among others we've grown accustomed in a Wes Anderson film, though I won't ruin the surprise.\n\nWhen you look at the film in parts it is masterful. The visuals and sets are luxuriously stunning, beyond anything you could imagine and a dream. The acting is top notch and characters intriguing. The story is entertaining and funny and especially unique. The music by Alexandre Desplat is charming and complementary. And yet, I feel as though the film doesn't come together as Mr. Anderson wished.\n\nWes Anderson films tend to be rife with characters and plot lines. The Grand Budapest Hotel jumps from each strand without fully completing or connecting at its conclusion, especially in regard to minor characters.\n\nWhile thoroughly enjoyable and charming as a film, if more time were taken to develop some subplots, remove others, and intertwine the rest, The Grand Budapest Hotel would easily have been one of Wes Anderson's finest creations.",

I did find The Grand Budapest Hotel funny but you've got to like a bit of slapstick and silliness although a lot of the humour is physical and visual in its nature. It looks great too has an authentic feel for the time in which it is set. Add to this an all-star cast with not a bad performance amongst them.\n\n\nSet in between the world wars in the 1900s Gustave (Feinnes) is the concierge at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. He is the king of his craft and everybody warms to him and especially so the wealthy females of shall we say the more senior variety. One of these is Madame D (Swinton) who passes away and leaves Gustave a rare painting called Boy With Apple in her will. This does not go down well with her family and Gustave along with his faithful bell boy Zero steal the painting. This leads to a chase with the authorities suspecting foul play in Madame Ds death with Gustave the chief suspect. Also interested in the painting is Jopling (Dafoe) who seems to be a member of Madame Ds family or a hitman or both. There is also a ridiculous prison escape and a bonkers shootout in the hotel.\n\n\nWhat can you say about a cast that boasts the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Harvey Keitel and Edward Norton (to name but a few)? Stellar casting and all are good without exception. Ralph Feinnes is particularly funny in the lead role and this surprised me as I wouldn't have listed comedy as one of his major strengths. I particularly liked Norton's policeman and Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe also gave performances that I liked.\n\n\nI liked this a lot more than I thought I would and the prison escape was particularly funny. Not laugh out loud belly laughs or anything like that but very enjoyable nonetheless. Maybe the Grand Budapest Hotel represents a turning of the corner for me and Mr Anderson and for this reason I await his next offering with a new found positivity.",

The world is imaginative, the tone deadpan, the cast an endless parade of talent - yet for all the bells and whistles it remains the shell of a Wes Anderson movie, devoid of the usual wit and deep humanity of \"Rushmore,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" or even \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" and \"Moonrise Kingdom.\" In its place is an abundance of oddness for the sake of oddness - we have a miscast Ralph Fiennes as Gustave (a role in which Peter Sellers would have killed); an annoying amount of colloquial \"fucks\" said by otherwise urbane characters, weirdly off-color and un-funny jokes about Gustave's sexuality, and a far-too-busy score by Alexandre Desplat which never gives you a moment to breathe. Yes, the design and cinematography is beautiful; Anderson's imagination creates a seemingly-endless amount of gorgeously quirky visuals, but without the heart and the wit it becomes a nauseating assault. He wants to make a statement about basic goodness in the face of a hardening world, but after the endless chases through dollhouse sets, the neverending bobsled race, and the paint-by-numbers parade of cameos by Anderson regulars, the sentiment feels tacked on and the film becomes the most un-Wes Anderson thing of all - disingenuous.",

The films setting is great, this also a very colorful film. When u was watching I felt happy to watch it because of the bright colors it sets up a new feeling in me. One thing to note is the cinematography which is done in this movie flawlessly. The script is great and acting is astounding. I can't even find a negative in this film. Overall from its vast amount of colors to its story this movie is a must see.",

            "content": "Perhaps the best Wes Anderson movie out yet, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a quirky tale about Monsier Gustave and his protégé Zero and their adventure. His best because he has made this movie in such a rhetorical way that humour is in abundance, emotions are very close to perfection but yet so purposefully distant and animation (in the characters) so lively.\nThough Wes Anderson ranks high on my list of favourite directors, I try not to be bias. However I adore movies with an ensemble cast. I thought it was a fool-proof formula until I came upon The Expendables or The Monuments Men. \nThe whole movie runs with a set pace, a rather fast pace unlike in The Royal Tenenbaums. Gustave and Zero are set in motion right through the film and the end of narration maintains the motion. Anderson has been very successful in not letting the drama seep through the plot to spoil its comic nature. Frugal with dialogues, actions maintain the momentum in the film. \nSets, costume, cinematography, screenplay, direction- everything is signature Wes Anderson. I liked this film because of its simplicity. The story just moves ahead and rapidly enough for you to just sit watch and enjoy.  I simply loved it for once and I'll go with 4.5 stars. A must watch for Wes Anderson fans and critics alike and if you want to start watching his movies, better start with this one.",

It was Wes Anderson, but seemed more serious than \"MoonRise Kingdom\" or my favorite of his \"The Royal Tenenbaums.\" And for me, a Anderson lover, this wasn't necessarily a good thing. His more serious films, \"Darjeeling Limited,\" were my least favorites of his.So this worried me indecently. But the cast looked great, i do love Saoirse Ronan, and the art style looked like Anderson on steroids. A whole building with his quirky decorating style? Sign me up! So i decided to give \"Budapest\" a try. And i was not disappointed. The visuals drip with atmosphere and color. Soft, muted colors, but colors all the same. The aspect ratio also flips back and forth, a small but notable touch. When it is in our time, it's full widescreen. A few years back, it's the annoying stretched thin version, and in the main story, it's fullscreen. This is just the first, but most perfect example of Anderson's great attention to detail. The whole film is more emotional than his others, but still manages to have the chuckle friendly style that has persisted all of his films. And the cast is wonderful! Ralph Fiennes completely owns his character and Tony Revolori, the young newcomer who plays Zero, couldn't have asked for a better first film. The details, which are what Anderson does best, are abundant here. But the real stars, (weirdly enough) are not his typicals; dialogue, details, art style. The real stars are his characters. Not since \"Tenenbaums\" has there been such richly created Anderson characters. And that is what makes \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" a place worth staying at. At least for a while. 5/5",

It's so well done I didn't even notice it at first.\n\nAlso, great performances by a perfectly cast ensemble (the mix of accents doesn't even bother me in this case), especially Ralph Fiennes in the lead, whose harried concierge is very different to anything else I've seen him play, but handled with just as much skill.\n\nGreat movie all round.",

            "content": "#movies A big hotel situated in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka used to be very popular and luxurious place many years ago. But now it can boast of only few visitors, its glorious days are a thing of the past. There is a certain writer (Jude Law) among the people who are living in the hotel and one day he he happens to meet the present hotel owner called Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Naturally he seems to be very rich and powerful and it is with much shyness the writer dares to ask him how Moustafa became the hotel owner and how much money he paid for it. As I have mentioned the young writer is eager to ask questions and know such things. To his astonishment he hears that the hotel owner paid nothing. In addition Moustafa seems to lack in a good listener and wish to share the story of his life with somebody. In fact Mr. Moustafa is an old man and obviously needs communication even more than the writer himself. So he starts telling his story. \nMany years ago Zero (can you believe it?) was a lobby boy at the same hotel. He was an immigrant and had no proper documents. But the chief manager called Gustave agreed to give him a trial. In a short time Zero proved to be very smart, helpful and useful and Gustave realized he could trust the boy in everything. Gustave was a sort of the perfect hotel manager to tell you the truth. But he had one peculiar feature - he had a lot of lovers, mainly they were rich, elderly and lonely ladies who stayed at Grand Budapest Hotel. One day all of a sudden Gustave learnt his lover Madame D. had died unexpectedly after just leaving the hotel some weeks before. \nRead more http://www.viewforum.net/movie-stunned-me-150/grand-budapest-hotel-3954/#post6598",

That is literally the best way I can describe this plot.\n\nWes Anderson managed to create one of the weirdest, odd, quirky, and original movies I have seen in years. With a stellar cast this is a mostly enjoyable movie. I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite movies of the year but I do recommended it.\n\nThis has a stellar cast but this is one of the downfalls of this movie. There are so many actors being introduced here that it's a hard time for them to shine, although we do have some great cameos throughout which I will not spoiler. Ralph Fiennes leads the movie as M. Gustave, the owner of Budapest Hotel. He does a pretty good job from what he is given. I think that he owned every scene he was in and gave some gut busting hilarious moments throughout. \n\nOther actors worth mentioning is Tony Revolori as Young Zero, a lobby boy. I honestly liked him, he did a fine job and showed to be a likable presence. Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe do good acting out of the material they are given. But I have to say it was only Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori who really stole the show.\n\nNow this is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen in my life. There are just so many random scenes of characters doing the most strange things. The screenplay while strange was excellent writing. Wes Anderson created this strange world of strange characters. I have to praise him for doing that much but I wonder, how did he manage to write this? I'm not trying to be rude at all but this kind of looks like he was either damn high. Again I'm not trying to dis him! But it did seem as if was that at times. Without a doubt one of the most original movies in years.\n\nBut this movie was pretty funny at moments. Ralph Fiennes gives some great moments throughout, he is this wise cracking, rude, self absorbed dick who doesn't care about other other than Zero. But the humor comes from the most over the top moments. I mean over the top at it's weirdest. I will not spoil anything however I will mention a sled chase sequence that just the funniest thing in the entire movie The interactions between characters were interesting to watch. They are pretty messed up or quirky people and that made it even better. \n\nNow visual this movie is stunning. I can see possible Oscar nominations coming it's way for art direction, production design, and even the score was great. The buildings and environment is unlike anything I have seen all year and it all does look fantastic and again, original. Everything about this movie is original, visually anyway. \n\nI also noticed a strange diction from Wes Anderson. The way he directed this movie and the way the picture looked. He always had a straight angle, never turned and he would hold the camera in place the entire time. Once in a while he would spin it around but he liked the use continues shots of the hallways or the characters. He even went for using quick cuts a lot. Between the continuous shots.\n\nMy biggest complaint is some of the story telling in it. There is narrating throughout but I felt it being more distracting than helping. And throughout the second act it seemed to drag on a bit. But toward the ending it picked up and become much better and more enjoyable to watch.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the movie. It was weird without a doubt, we have a huge cast with only two of them giving really good performances. I think this will be lucky and get Oscar nominations for art direction, score, production design and maybe even screenplay for Anderson.\n\nI give The Grand Budapest Hotel a B+.",

The parts of the movie I payed attention too, I thought were ok, but as a whole I ended up just shrugging my shoulders and going \"meh\" to.  The cast is terrific, and it's very offbeat, but really, you have to be in the right type of mood for it.  This isn't something you'll just throw on at 11 am on a Sunday.

I loved some of the relationships in this movie and wished that that was the main focus of the movie.\nBut instead we get a story about a murder, an arrest, and a prison break. In a unique way I might add, since the movie is presented in parts. That is a very risky move because if one part seems longer than the other than that makes the movie look slow. There are five parts in this movie, and unfortunately this movie is not an exception to this rule. I felt some parts, particularly part 3, seemed to drag on for a very long time when it didn't need to be. It was just a prison break that seemed to last for an eternity. \nRegardless of the pacing, Wes Anderson sure does have plenty of style in this movie. With yet another awesome soundtrack for Alexandre Desplat and sweeping visuals, it's no wonder that Wes Anderson succeeded in the box office with this movie. I can't wait to see what visual brilliance he comes up with next.\n\n7.5/10 Great",

This film is colorful, brilliantly scripted, and beautifully shot, something cinematography should aspire to be. The film knows it is campy and knows that its special effects are cheesy, but its sense of purposefulness and individualism pours over into the audience. This is truly a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that is over-the-top but in a glorious and mesmerizing way. It will be impossible for this film to be ignored come December.

The different plots may seem unoriginal but the way they are executed make them stand out from other movies. \nThe script is intelligent, witty, and thoughtful.

There are a few action sequences, yet they show a unique solemn restraint that deliberately reduces them to whimsical events in a plot, rather than raw excitement. Often it is sentimental or reflective with themes of old age, friendship, and young love. Thankfully, the substantive emotion never pulls the mood down. It has wonderfully intriguing characters and an amazing cast to bring to personality and life to them. There are even somewhat mysterious elements to the story to keep you guessing and a few mildly humorous moments. It really defies categorization, but it certainly bears the stamp of a Wes Anderson movie. This is by far my favorite Wes Anderson effort. His pretentious subdued monotone dullness normally rubs me the wrong way. The difference here from his other films is in the delightfully spontaneous and eventful story that has colorful characters with definitive personality. Ralph Fines, in particular, makes an unforgettable with great presence that defines the movie. He is the main character, but his story comes through the perspective of his protégé. The story moves quickly and smoothly and the flashback conversational narration has a pleasant storytelling quality. It is many things, but Anderson brings it all together in one clear and incredibly fun adventure.",

In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old-world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel. The film moves forward at a breakneck speed. You have to be very alert in order not to miss something. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time. \n\nGRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the back-drop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent.",

He shows off his own personality in his films.\r\n\r\nRalph Fiennes is M. Gustave.  He is a famous concierge at one of Europes most picturesque hotels.  When the wealthy Madame D. passes away, she wills her most prized possession, a painting to Gustave.  Her son, Dmitri(Adrien Brody) refuses the gift and Gustave and his Lobby Boy, Zero, steal the painting.\r\n\r\nDmitri and his thugs chase the pair across the continent.  Things get more complicated when a second will surfaces.\r\n\r\nQuirky, but in a good way.  It is highly entertaininga nd features a host of solid actors and actresses, such as: Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, and F. Murray Abraham.\r\n\r\n[img]http://content9.flixster.com/rtmovie/11/50/115047_gal.jpg[/img]",

This is a film filled with old school style , both in front of the camera and behind it. The film swells in its beautiful setting of the 30s to 80s - all beautifully portrayed by the rich production design and the wonderful performance to go with that. Ralph Fiennes takes this beautiful layered script filled with comedy and subtle drama and takes it to a new level with a brilliant performance - certainly the best of the year so far. It is expertly written , stylized by the beautiful and unique elements of cinematography to go with it . The camera was given a character - it's a very unique style of shooting the film with static cameras throughout making the center of the screen as the pivot. The style runs throughout the different settings in the entire length of the film. Another notable piece was the excellent use of changing aspect ratios to state the setting of the story. The story itself , being a short journey of the lead character - wonderfully narrated  by F Murray Abraham. The cast was brilliant , eccentric and the performance came across the screen. Technically the movie is a brilliant piece of art. If i am to draw any straws i would like to mention the slightly unbelievable nature of the miniatures or models used in this picture . But then again that might be for any reason or limitations. However that's a point to be noted as some of the very wide shots do dwell in the realm of uncertainty. The score is wonderfully written , original yet dwells on the period nature of the story. Overall , this was a nice piece of art with a comedic performance with underlying very strong and mature emotional resonance and the credit for that must go to both the script and the actors. Although it might be one of those films ignored by many movie goers - but to those that views it this will be a movie which is more like a portrait . \"The Grand Budapest\" hotel is a sophisticated achievement",

I guess he was inspired by Monty Python in his younger days.  But inspired is not what this film should be called.

            "content": "If you've followed my reviews, then you've come to be aware of my problems with Wes Anderson's particular brand of film-making.  You will never read, in any of my reviews of his films, that I think he makes bad films.  If I ever say that, it's because I think a particular film of his is bad and not because he's a terrible filmmaker.  That would be a fallacy.  The problem I have is how often he puts he lets his idiosyncratic touches, whether it be shooting techniques, writing characters, how he frames shots, etc, get in the way of effective storytelling.  Moonrise Kingdom, his last film, and my least favorite of his films, is a perfect example of this.  I think that film had a chance to tell a good story with emotional depth and poignancy, but all that was lost in the midst of all the quirkiness.  It's the same thing that happened to Fantastic Mr. Fox.  He let his quirks get in the way of a good story.  While I certainly gave this film the same rating as Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, I have no problem in admitting that The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's best film in 13 years.  Or, for those of you not aware, when The Royal Tenenbaums was released.  That movie is, undoubtedly, his masterpiece.  I'm STILL only missing Rushmore, I NEED to watch that.  This isn't a great film, but it's very, very, very good  While it's very obvious that this is a Wes Anderson film, fans of his will quickly pick up on that, I think this is one of the few movies that, while quirky, doesn't become overbearing to the point that it makes the rest of the film tedious to watch.  There's actually a good little story here.  Well let me clarify that, the whole story about Gustave being framed for murder and his and Zero's attempts to exonerate him is actually a bit of a mess to follow at times.  I just think that it's needlessly expansive, almost as if designed by Wes Anderson to get some of the people he enjoys collaborating with a paycheck.  There's nothing wrong with that, but if the story was a little more stripped back, it probably would've been better.  But there are characters that don't really need to be here and all they do is help clog up the drain, so to speak.  Of course I say that, but at least even the smallest of characters gets something important to do.  It might not be of the utmost important to the main story, but they get something to do and that's what matters.  Ultimately though, while the story is certainly entertaining, and probably Anderson's broadest, what really holds the film together is Zero's relationship with Gustave and how that develops throughout the film.  It's clear that Gustave's personality, much like is mentioned in the film, is just an illusion.  It's clear that there was something in his past, something tragic, that has made him the way he is.  In many ways, he is incredibly overprotective of Zero and, later, by extension, Agatha.  He deeply cares for Zero and comes to consider him a good friend.  That part of the film I very much enjoyed, the chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori is excellent.  There's also the fact that the story is set against the backdrop of the impending war, clearly inspired by World War 2.  Because of that, in spite of all the whimsy and fun moments the film provides, there's this air of impending doom.  Like something is bad is going to happen that is, invariably, going to change everything.  Nothing will ever be the same again after the war hit Zubrowka.  I think that underlying core to the film is, leaps and bounds, better than the main story itself.  Thinking about whatever happened in the past that made Gustave into the insecure and vain person he is, much like the women he romances, and that sense of impending doom, that the great war will destroy everything in its path.  How the now much older Zero chooses to keep the hotel running, because it's one of the few places where he was truly happy.  Those are the real highlights of the film to me.  Visually, this film is very obviously a Wes Anderson film, its cinematography is excellent.  The costume design is very bright and colorful, almost decorative in a sense, as if you're watching a movie painting.  I will say that the film is meticulously crafted.  Not that his other films weren't, but it's more obvious here.  And it's also clear that the film was inspired by some slapstick classics.  To Anderson's credit, it doesn't come across as theft as much as paying tribute, while at the same time adding his own idiosyncratic touch to those classics.  The cast is top-notch, Ralph Fiennes absolutely kills it here with his performance, man has great comedic timing.  The film has such a large cast that, unfortunately, nobody stands out as much as Ralph Fiennes, and Tony Revolori himself, but everyone gets a little color.  There's no character here that isn't interesting and, again, that's a credit to Anderson's eye for eccentric characterization.  Like I said, the story is definitely a bit of a mess, but I very much enjoyed this movie.  It's Wes Anderson and his fans will approve.  The unconverted, however, will find nothing to win them over.  While I think this is his best film in 13 years, even I didn't think it was great.  I don't think that, miraculously, this film would make me not feel skeptical when going into Anderson's next project.  I always know he can just revert to his olden ways and just do quirky for the fuck of it with no regards to story.  Still, this is a very good movie.  Can't exactly recommend it however, as it entirely depends on how you view Wes Anderson's style.",

The cast was amazing and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as the lead. Like many other Wes Anderson movies, the film is very original, with a punchy script that is funny throughout. The sets were amazing, along with the different costumes and the whole look of the strange and mysterious hotel. It's one of those movies were you will see something new every time that you watch it because of the attention to detail and the many different characters who have there own individual backgrounds. In all, it's a movie not to miss, but you do have to have a certain sense of humour to enjoy it. Brilliant!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis role was definitely made for Ralph Fiennes, who played his part extremely well. The chemistry between him and his bellboy was great and I liked the way that he dealt with Tilda Swinton at the beginning. The cast must have been a joy to work with because there are so many big names who bring there own unique styles to this masterpiece. I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson's movies, but this one is close to his best work. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch if you want to see something original and extremely witty.\n\nBudget: $31million\nWorldwide Gross: $167million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about the different goings on in a hotel. 8/10",

The cast that he managed to assemble for this is filled with his usual and a number of others that is too long to list off.\nTo explain the plot of GBH is a hard thing to do but to sum it up it's about a cast of ridiculous characters all connected to this one hotel and the story that unfolds is part fairy tale, part cartoon, part stage play and part novel.\n\nIt has a very distinct and fast paced style that benefits from the well-timed humour and sometimes shocking violence.\n\nThe writing is something I can't praise enough.  Written by Wes Anderson himself, he has a full-realized vision for each character and you really feel the heart behind each one (except the ones that are heartless i.e. Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody).\n\nThe bright colours and beautiful snowy landscapes are absolutely wonderful to look at and fully take in.  Snow-covered streets and mountaintops are shown throughout the movie and give you a sense of the fantastical place where this hotel is based.  Also adding to that fact is the amazing set design.  The pink walls, the fancy chandeliers and beautiful artwork placed throughout the lavish Budapest hotel tell you whom the place was meant for.\n\nI've noticed that because of how different and original Anderson's movies tend to be, he gets these actors that have seem to have all but disappeared.  And not only does he manage to get them on board, but also to get some of their best work out of them.\n\nBill Murray and Edward Norton are prime examples of this.  Completely nailing their roles and comedic timing.  It was also nice to see Harvey Keitel back as a crazy buffed out prisoner who helps Ralph Fiennes character break out.\n\nAdrien Brody and Willem Dafoe as the nefarious and twisted Desgoffe-und-Taxis (most hilarious last name ever) contributed some of the most hilarious and violent scenes of the film.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most violent, funniest and heartfelt comedies I have ever seen and the characters and setting can never be stripped from memory.",

His quirky sense of humor and stylized films are so unique that he manages to draw us in to this colorful world effortlessly. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception, and once again Anderson introduces us to a quirky setting full of dysfunctional yet amusing characters. In my opinion there was no better setting for an Anderson film than a fictional country in Eastern Europe like the one in The Grand Budapest Hotel where these gigantic and beautiful ancient castles fit his style perfectly. At times his films feel like you are turning the page of an illustrated book from one scene to the next and that is what is so unique about his style. I am a huge fan of his films and wasn't disappointed with his latest effort although I wouldn't consider it amongst his best work (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Moonrise Kingdom are my favorites). I do acknowledge however that his films tend to grow on me upon rewatches so it may manage to make it near the top of my list in the future. Once again watching an Anderson film proved to be a wonderful and unique experience, and I laughed hard during many scenes. Anderson never seems to lose his touch as there are several memorable moments throughout the film.\n\nNo one can deny Wes Anderson's creativity and it is just a pleasure to experience what his quirky mind is going to come up with next. The dialogue is brilliant once again and several characters stand out. Ralph Fiennes in the lead role as the hotel concierge is brilliant as is his apprentice, Tony Revolori. The two have great chemistry together as Fiennes' character sort of becomes the parent figure of the young lobby boy, which Anderson always loves to explore in his films. The epic cast was brilliant as well, and it was good to see Anderson's frequent collaborators on screen together once again. They may not have much screen time, but Anderson fans will appreciate every second they are on screen (Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton). The highlight of the film for me were the spectacular and hilarious chase scenes through the gorgeous Alps background and Willem Dafoe's comedic performance. The way Anderson edited those scenes was extremely funny as well. I really liked the quirky soundtrack  which just added to my overall enjoyment of the film. I only wish the film would've explored the romantic relationship between Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan a bit more and that it wouldn't have concluded in such an open ended way. It was still a lot of fun!",

Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... oh, fuck it.\n\nWes Anderson es un director que tiende a adoptar la misma estética en todas las películas que dirige, y mientras son hermosas visualmente, los personajes y sus historias no me conmueven y en The Grand Budapest Hotel es la primera película después de The Royal Tenenbaums donde los personajes tienen la misma fuerza que las imágenes. \n\nComo siempre, esta película reúne a un elenco genial de actores, que se destacan en sus respectivos papeles, especialmente Ralph Fiennes como Gustave H, el encargado del hotel, donde es interpretado con el humor característico de Anderson, pero la actuación de Fiennes logra darle una dimensión que sobrepasa cualquier expectativa. \n\nLa historia de The Grand Budapest Hotel tiene un gran peso. Habla acerca de la amistad entre Gustave H y el botones del hotel Zero. Sin importar las diferencias entre los dos encuentran un medio donde les permite aceptarse entre ellos, y se embarcan en aventuras emocionantes. Ese es otro aspecto de la película que me sorprendió, el suspenso. Hay escenas donde realmente te preguntas como saldrán de esa situación, por ejemplo durante la fuga de la cárcel, la cual estuvo ejecutada perfectamente, y si no tuviera esa estética, hubiera dudado si realmente es una película dirigida por este director, y me alegra cuestionármelo porque significa que está tomando riesgos e intentando cosas distintas en sus películas. También la escena del monasterio, que mezcla el humor con la tragedia excelentemente. En realidad, casi todas las escenas de esta película son memorables, y tienen algo especial y claro que como siempre la estética juega un papel importante, y nunca deja de impresionarme la perfección con la cual es logrado, sobretodo la simetría y la paleta de colores. \n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel es luego de The Royal Tenenbaums de mis favoritas por Wes Anderson. A pesar de que mantiene su estética usual, hizo algo distinto y emocionante, y espero que siga desarrollando esa nueva faceta en su dirección.",

            "content": "This is my first Wes Anderson film. It will not be my last. The Grand Budapest Hotel is endearing, fun, quirky, and bold. The dialogue is snappy, the characters felt alive. But, the best part of this film was the director. I've heard of Wes Anderson's style, quirky and fun and I've seen some clips from his movies. But, I've never sat through a full viewing of any of his films. And goddamn it I wish I had. The cinematography is amazing and the way it was directed was truly a wonder to behold. I even found that some scenes looked like art, literally, looked like a painting that was alive. It was so beautiful to witness what a director could do when they put their heart and their mind into their project. Wes Anderson did an excellent job with this film which is, literally, a piece of art.\n\nThe plot is quite simple for a movie as layered as its famous Mendl's cakes (by the way *SPOILER ALERT*). It's basically about a well-known concierge (played by Ralph Fiennes) whom steals a painting (that was his according to a piece of the will, but the piece of the will was burnt albeit there was a second copy that no one knew about until the near-to-end of the film) and he is accompanied by a lobby boy who is also his protégé and the one to own the Grand Budapest Hotel later on. So, craziness, hilarity, wackiness, quirkiness, randomness, everything maniacal, just what you'd expect from Wes Anderson, ensues. The reason it's layered is because of just that, a lot of things happen in this not too long of a runtime for a film and it feels loaded, but balanced at the same time. It's like Anderson knew exactly how much to put in. And the performances were spectacular. Everyone had a role to play and they all did it wonderfully with just as much of an amount of quirkiness added to each and every one of the characters. Even the actual hotel had, what felt like, a soul. Everything felt so alive, the colors of each shot jumped out at you, but it had enough restraint to not make you feel burdened by it. You can see how meticulously crafted this film was.\n\nThe performances were spectacular. Everyone had a role to fill and they all did it exceedingly well. But, the breakout from this, the one who stole each and every scene was no other than Ralph. If there is a definition of underrated, it's definitely Ralph Fiennes. At the beginning of the film when I first saw his face I couldn't even remember his real name. He stole the show and his character was extremely likeable. Another thing that worked well was the cameos and the supporting actors. Adrian Brody was a great bad guy and so was Willem. Bill Murray was charming, and so was Jeff Goldblum. I actually felt genuinely bad when Jeff died, but the way it was shot made me laugh, which it was supposed to, because a steel door tore all four fingers off his hand, but they popped off and it reminded me of cartoons I would watch as a little kid and it was meant to be taken lightly. And I guess that's the point the film is trying to make.\n\nIt's a serious world out there. And I mean it can get dark and gloomy as shown in the film (through the wars, and the train stops). Everything can get quite sad and messed up. But, the film plays it off as if it was to be taken lightly. I feel that Anderson made it that way to deliberately say, \"Life is serious, and things may get taken away from you, loved ones will die, but there is always humanity, there is always someone there that can wipe that all away when it seemingly encroaches in from all around you.\" This is what the film was about. It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously, but it was supposed to be emotional. And that's why when it was ending and it showed Zero (the lobby boy) at his later years as the owner, explaining to the author what the hotel was like and how it was now. It looked like it was all in ruin, in shambles, even the concierge wasn't there which led to Zero having to get his own key to his own room. The soul of the Grand Budapest Hotel suddenly felt not so grand. It felt dead, and it was no longer alive like it used to be. But when Zero stepped in the elevator and when the author said good-bye, Zero smiled as the doors closed.\n\nAnd that's when I began feeling tears.\n\nThis sick world that has a sort of beauty to it is dying, but that doesn't stop us. We still keep going. We still keep moving. And it's our memories, or past experiences, our very lives that carry us on. And even when the very thing he grew up in, that helped him when he was down, that was in ruins and that was dying, even if the hotel was all that at the present, Zero still didn't care. He was able to look past all the old, all the ruin, all the emptiness, and he felt more alive than ever because he knew what the place used to be like. And he still kept it in his heart what it was. Wes Anderson basically flipped off all the evil that can be found in the world and told it all to go fuck itself because he doesn't take it seriously. This is his personal message, this is his film. This is what he wanted to say through the characters, the story, the acting, the quirkiness, the randomness, the war, the assholes, everything. This is what he thinks and I can't help but admire the man for that. That's how we should all truly live and that's how Zero and Gustave lived. That is the story of the Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nThroughout the film I thought of it as just a fun experience so I wanted to give it an 8/10, but when the end came and I saw what had happened it bumped it up a point. But...then I started writing this review and I thought back on the film. Sure it was fun and of course it has flaws, every film has flaws, but the moral/point/message of the film stands up tall in my eyes. The film knows it has flaws, but it doesn't take anything seriously and yet it still is moving enough to make me get teary eyed. This is a work of art. It didn't need something pretentious to get its message across; it just needed a competent director that actually loves what he does. This film is what all directors need to strive for nowadays. Because all I see are directors who just don't give a fuck and want money, but this one actually cared. And it made me care. \n\nAnd so with that I will give this film the honor of being my first RT rating of...\n\n10/10",

            "content": "I love movies. Anyone who knows me knows that fact. I went to school for photography/film analysis many years ago so I consider it a rare treat when a film grabs hold of me in so many ways that I can't even describe. The film critic inside me just can't wait to share with you the amazing-ness that some filmmakers imbibe their creations with, and THIS is one of those movies. This is one of the reasons I fell in love with film in the 1st place and why I write these reviews (that I hope) you will read on my Facebook page.\nLet me 1st say that I've always admired director Wes Anderson's work, but I've always thought that he's been a little overrated. Yeah I enjoyed 'Rushmore', 'The Royal Tanenbaums', and most recently 'Moonrise Kingdom', but I often felt that his movies were best viewed in a museum, or from under a glass case. His films often struck me as a bit pretentious and a bit too smart for their own good.\nBut I have since changed my mind. And it is because of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. The film is so lovingly made, the cinematography is so fantastic, the music so infectious, the acting across the board so fun to watch that I absolutely will put Wes Anderson's name on the short list of best American filmmakers that are working right now.\nHere's the plot synopsis:\"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the back-drop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent\". (courtesy of Fox Searchlight)\nNow that that's out of the way, I can tell you that you probably won't have a more fun time watching a movie this year. It's so vibrant and full of life, it kind of reminds me of an old Charlie Chaplin or Marx Bros film (except in glorious color) where something crazy is happening in EVERY frame. I wanted to pause this movie so many times just to take it all in. \nWe are now in July, and so the year is more than half over. This is MY PICK for Best Picture of the year (so far). I doubt there's anything that will be able to top it, but we'll see. It's truly a masterpiece. My HIGHEST of the HIGHEST recommendation! As close to perfect as a movie can get. :) :) :)",

Ralph Fiennes carries the movie extremely well, proving himself to be a wonderfully eccentric straight man with perfect comedic timing.  He's surrounded by a great supporting cast of bizarre characters who keep the film, and the laughs, moving along nicely.  My only major criticism was the third act, which ends with a fizzle instead of a bang.

If it's not his best, it is arguably his most ambitious on a narrative level, and unarguably on a visual one.

Eccentric and conspicuous all the same, the Grand Budapest seemed like a wonderful fairytale for a fairytale.",

            "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) - 8\r\n\r\nThe setting jumps between four distinct periods; the most interesting to us is the most remote, in 1932. Eccentric Gustave H, prominent concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel, and his newly employed lobby boy Zero Moustafa live the end of the hotel's golden age as the war approaches the state of Zubrowka. Both will get themselves in serious trouble after the mysterious death of Céline, one of the numerous love aberrations of Gustave. Among her voluminous heritage lies a valuable painting that was willed to Gustave--blasphemy for her family who won't take half-measures to reclaim what should be rightfully theirs. Gustave and Zero will jump on a risky and whimsical adventure until the conflict of interests is settled for the best and the worst. I think it's safe to describe this as the darkest Wes Anderson movie, darkly fun that is. Both for the story and the characters, especially the brutal cold-blooded killer J. G. Jopling, who has become one of my favorites in Wes filmography. Willem Dafoe can really put together a convincing killer act. This playfully eccentric, witty and darkly fun movie is among Wes' most expressive works, in my opinion. The Grand Budapest Hotel abounds with memorable scenes, dark humor and the deviant Gustave H might very well be the most iconic character in this mannerist universe, great acting from Ralph Fiennes. Steve Zissou is still my favorite goon, though. The Grand Budapest Hotel shows greater maturity and assertiveness from Wes, who has been granted with more sophisticated technical wizardry and casting quality in his latter works.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm left with a faint feeling that Wes may have reached the creative limits of his cinematic artifice. In the beginning, I was intrigued by the possibility that the four distinct settings and narrators could bring something new and substantial to the table, but that doesn't seem to be the case in my perception. Looking back, it almost seems like a simple technical gimmick to persuade the viewer that the movie holds more substance than it actually does. This is still the basic formula used in all Wes' movies, but this time enriched with a strong wistful flavor arising from the fact that the whole adventure is nothing more than the cherished memory of what was live and loved by Zero Moustafa--only this would justify a space-time transition, and only one would be enough. What's the point of four transitions? It seems redundant to me. The whole story is apparently read on the present by the girl in the a cemetery sitting just beside the grave of the book's author, but we barely become aware of it. Other than its darkly comical side, this could enhance even more the notion of distant or dreamlike past, in which case more development in the \"sober\" present would be desirable. Fortunately this wasn't a distraction per se; just a personal remark to explain my mixed feelings about the four settings and the ending. I found the whole movie very engrossing and entertaining; Wes is an expert of mood manipulation. I am very curious to see what he will do next. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes' sharpest mannerism. Highly recommended!",

Numerous stars fill out the huge cast in roles from teeny on up and Ralph Fiennes' erudite, continental, and occasionally foul-mouthed hotel concierge is fantastic!",

            "content": "\"There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity\"\r\n\r\nThe Wes Anderson nerd inside me just couldn't help but adore his latest venture into the obscure, yet fun world of The Grand Budapest Hotel.\r\n\r\nIn the most lavish, posh hotel in Zubrowska (a cleverly named fake country), the head concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) is a well-revered individual, even if he is a massive womanizer, but for senior citizens and not young chicks like most playboys are. Anyways, one of his \"wooed blondes\" Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, or just Madame D (Tilda Swinton) gets murdered and leaves the hilariously silly painting Boy with Apple to Gustave in her will, and at the funeral, D's son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) pins Gustave as the prime suspect. Now Gustave and his recently hired lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori) must set out to prove is innocence, with comic mayhem ensuing at every turn.\r\n\r\nThis story within a story within a story, cleverly composed by Anderson and story writer Hugo Guinness, is just a delicious spinning yarn. It could've been very easy to make a story like this uninteresting and boring, but Anderson populates the candy-colored world (marvelously put together by production designer Adam Stackhousen) with some pretty interesting and memorable characters, including a lovable rogue in M. Gustave H., played exquisitely by Ralph Fiennes. Included is a wonderful who's who cast ensemble that ranked amongst the very best I've seen in a Wes Anderson film, all of whom pull of great jobs even if they are only onscreen for but a few minutes. Noticeable standouts include Adrien Brody as the potty-mouthed, revenge-filled son of Madame D, and Willem Dafoe as J.G. Jopling, my favourite character, as Dmitri's emotionless assassin.\r\n\r\nAs huge of a Wes Anderson nerd I am, it's debatable as to whether or not this is his greatest film to date, but I think it is the most \"Anderson-y\" of the films he's done. This is in every way his film and his style. I love how no other filmmaker has the balls to make films like this, and for his individuality in a world where there are remakes and sequels that plague theatres is always welcomed. I go into further detail in my Moonrise Kingdom review, and while he does turn some off just by how \"weird\" he is, I have a strong feeling that homey knows exactly what he's doing.\r\n\r\nLike the opening quote details, which is in my mind more true today than it ever has, and the story, about the humor and heartbreak of relationships is brilliantly weaved in Anderson's glorious script. The humorous moments gave me frequent chuckles, from the subtle to the macabre, but it also provides an interestingly thoughtful take on how friendships work. Gustave's deliciously prickish attitude coupled with Zero's quiet innocence quite literally makes this film, if you ask me. For as so much visual splendor is in hotel, and how much charm is in the concierge, I felt that the flick has a wonderful beating heart underneath all that deliciousness.\r\n\r\nWhile not as funny as Fantastic Mr. Fox, or as magical as Moonrise Kingdom (I actually still say that Moonrise is the better feature), The Grand Budapest Hotel shines both as a humorous, candy-coated period piece but also as a thoughtful work on relationships. M. Gustave H. and his little lobby boy Zero are just as entertaining now, as they undoubtedly will be during repeated viewings, and if you are as big of a Wes Anderson fan as I am, then be sure to check into this hotel whenever you get the opportunity.\r\n\r\n***1/2 out of ****\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 88%",

The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception and compartmentalizes a thrilling wondrous adventure into a world and time that's seemingly impossible of such things.\n\nWhat sticks out in this film is not only how his focus on quirky storytelling juxtaposes many of the darker occurrences of Gustave's tale, but also how it was acknowledged from Zero's recollection as a fantasy. That the beauty, charm, and humor that we were all enjoying was simply in a man... too \"civil\" for this world.\n\nIt's an interesting character study of illusion and one's ability to create a veil of existence that's even contagious to those around him. The idealized romance between Zero and Agatha, successful escape from prison, reclamation of his innocence and rise to fortune was all just so slightly mired with murder, sacrifice, and untimely deaths all around. It's like a careful dance between a dream and actuality.\n\nI recall 2012's \"Life of Pi\", where I feel that movie failed this succeeded by utilizing a comedic undertone to capture the viewer's imagination before deconstructing it's beauty with harsh realities. There's an endless supply of offbeat laughs and thrills before we're brought to a cathartic conclusion.\n\nAfter Moonrise Kingdom disappointed me a bit I'm relieved to say The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of Anderson's best and fans of his work will most definitely enjoy it. Those who aren't? Just the same.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's latest movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel, may be the writer/director's best work to date. His normal brilliance is apparent through the duration of the dramatic comedy, making for 99 minutes of cinematic genius.\n\nRiveting performances by Ralph Fiennes as the esteemed and unquestionably refined, concierge Gustave H, paired with his eager to learn sidekick, lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), are the steam that keeps this comedy/drama engine running.\n\nThe tale of how the famed Grand Budapest hotel fell into the hands of a refugee lobby boy (Zero Mustafa) plays out marvelously. The adventure the two embark on is as grandiose as it is captivating. Wes Anderson's mind creates a universe that is fun and goofy, with dashes of explicit, which provides sheer entertainment value throughout this movie.\n\nThe story is quickly teased by The Author as an old man (Tom Wilkinson - present day). Wilkinson grips your attention from the start, before jumping to an earlier time, where The Author as a young man (Jude Law), encounters the older Zero Moustafa, further teasing the story's true inception. By the time the story finds its footing, Wes Anderson has you completely enthralled, following Fiennes and his protege Zero on this creative caper.\n\nIt doesn't take long for the ride to begin after an organic meeting between the Author and enigmatic Grand Budapest owner, Zero Moustafa takes place. Shortly after, a dinner is agreed upon so the mysterious owner, who resides in the building in a room the size of a storage closet, can share his remarkable tale to the curious Author. The story then jumps to an even earlier time where the legendary fable of concierge and lobby boy truly begins.\n\nGustave's charm matches the quality of the affluent company he keeps down to the Lair de Panache he is seldom without. The systematic and overly charismatic concierge, is the toast of the Grand Budapest as well as the mastermind behind its inner workings. His calculated approach is shared with lobby boy Zero, who begins as pupil to the meticulous concierge, before forming a brother-like bond with his eccentric teacher.\nGustave H's close nit connectedness to every minute detail of the Grand Budapest, enables him to wine and bed some of its wealthier inhabitants, while building invaluable relationships. Gustave's brashness is wildly comedic, making it acceptable and endearing to the characters in the story and audience alike.\n\nThe concierge's curious relationship with one hotel guest in particular, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Tilda Swinton), is the catalyst behind Gustave's imprisonment. His relationship with the countess is inextricably linked to his fate throughout the film. Even in prison, Gustave embraces his fate with charm and grace, his charisma never fleeting.\nAfter Gustave is framed for murder the story takes an unexpected turn, the twists and turns along the way to proving his innocence set up entertaining challenge after challenge, offering intrigue throughout the film as they work to prove Gustave's innocence.\n\nAs with most Wes Anderson pictures, there are masterfully crafted characters, whose quirks accompany the quick-witted dialogue that progresses the film from opening through credits.\n\nOther Wes Anderson staples, such as cameos and select roles from a familiar cast of characters (a laundry list of talent), are present, some of which you will wish had a larger role in this very intelligent story. All-in-all The Grand Budapest Hotel is a thoroughly impressive effort that deserved the veneration it has received thus far.\n\nThe aggregate score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes is at a 92%, that is right about where I would place this movie... possibly a little higher when it comes out on DVD and I am able to give The Grand Budapest Hotel go around.",

The music score saved the movie and some good moments I won't spoil. Enjoy. - June 18, 2014 review.",

            "content": "One of the director I always look forward to his movie release is that Wes Anderson. Well, who don't like his movies if they are aware of his masterworks. He's one of the unique filmmakers with extraordinary ideas. I always love his screenplay, especially his miniature cinema sets. He believes in those technics and presents on the screen awesomely than completely done with computer graphics. In this movie as well he used them very nicely and gives pleasure to watch it.\n\n     As usual this movie too a comedy with director's traditional actors in it. A comedy that set in the backdrop of a hotel theme and their employees. This hotel is called 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' located on the edge of the Alp mountain in a fictional EU country Zubrowska. The story proceeds with the two layers of flashback to the years 1968 and 1932. It unfolds the life story of Gustave, prestigious hotel's caretaker and his pupil Zero, a lobby boy. Theirs struggle over the accusation of a crime and the other side world war is on a verge to invade the nation. Whether they successful to defend against the charges or not is the remaining story speaks.\n\n     Nice story and performances with eye catching visuals. Easily one of the best of this year. It looks very ordinary if it was a usual style movie, but Wes Anderson's touch made all the differences. The adventures are the highlights in all of his movies and so in this movie. Lots of whites and pinks you can see on the screen which is kind of trademark of this movie. In this humour movie violence partially attached, but safely avoided all the cruelties. With the lend of Saoirse Ronan character the story exploits a little bit youthful romance side. The introduction of other characters in the middle of the storytelling made more venturesome in the later parts.\n\n     I kind of doubt to suggest it if you are unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's earlier works. You should better start with them before committing this movie. There's a reason, because you may not indulge it like my friend who saw this with me who never hear the director. Otherwise, it is..., of course it is another masterwork by Wes. Anyway, I loved it and waiting for his new project announcement.",

He then promises to tell the audience how he came to know a particular story.\n\nWe switch back to 1968, when the Young Writer was staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel, which was in its fading, twilight years.  The Young Writer meets Mr. Moustafa, who tells him the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nWe switch back to 1932; the new Lobby Boy (Zero) begins his tutelage with M. Gustave.  Gustave likes older, rich, blonde women, and he romances them.  In particular, Madame D. is quite fond of him.  She is on a trip, and has a presentiment of death.  Sure enough, she dies in the town where she traveled to.  Gustave and Zero hurry to see her, and are there in time to hear the reading of the will.  The surprise is that she willed the priceless painting 'Boy with Apple' to Gustave.  The family is furious, and Gustave is accused of her murder, but not before Zero and he secreted the painting.\n\nMr. Moustafa pauses to describe his relationship to Agatha, who works in the bakery of the hotel.  Agatha helps in the escape of Mr. Gustave.  Then Moustafa returns to the investigation of Madame D's death, and the process of bringing the probate to a legally sound close.\n\nMr. Gustave, with the aid of Zero and four fellow prisoners, escapes prison.  Gustave reaches for help from his fellow concierge friends.\n\nIn the counter-theme, Dmitri and his cohort Jopling, pursue Gustave for the sake of the painting, mostly.\n\nWill anyone find Serge, supposedly the real culprit in the death of Madame D. ?   Do we get to know how Zero gets enough money to buy the Grand Budapest?  Will Zero and Agatha ever get together legally?  What will become of Dmitri and Jopling?  Will Henckles re-capture Gustave or Zero?\n\n-----Scores-----\nCinematography: 10/10 Fine job.\n\nSound: 10/10 Well done.  Sometimes wildly inappropriate but usually good for a laugh or two.\n\nActing: 10/10  What a cast!  Great jobs by most involved.  No bad performances.\n\nScreenplay: 6/10 The main plot is so stupid it is beyond belief, but one assumes that was on purpose.  I got several belly laughs, dozens of smiles, and double handful of chuckles.",

A delightful film to watch, but somehow I still feel some degree of emotional detachment, which makes the (quite suddenly) sentimental remarks by the old Zero at the end not as effective as I expected. Well, maybe that is the intention of Wes Anderson after all - making a film for the audience to enjoy (and indeed it is enjoyable, and hugely popular - as a Wes Anderson film) and not to frown (I prefer The Royal Tenenbaums in this aspect - a film that can balance both). It's good to see Wes Anderson still keeps up his spirit after all those years.",

This guy has been an amazing director since his first feature but still somehow seems to get better and better with the next picture. \nThe Grand Budapest hotel features some incredible performances by the characters esp. Ralph Fiennes but they still maintain the weird style true to Wes Anderson.\nI don't know if it the bright contrasting colours in every set.\nThe ever so perfectly composed shots in every single sequence.\nThe perfectly planned dolly and tracking shots.\nThe emotionless characters filled with emotions.\nThe interesting aspect ratios or the 100 other characteristic quality of his direction. But there is something about his direction which draws me. \nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is an incredible watch showing the adventures of a concierge, Gustave and his lobby boy Zero Moustafa at the famous Grand Budapest Hotel during the time of war. The movie maintains the level of tensions throughout the film yet giving enough moment of good well written satire. The film seems to going nowhere for a good chunk of the time similar to his other works but somehow he manages to fulfil us with an interesting climax sealing the deal and probably being one of the best films of 2014.",

The actor that plays the kid looks to be from the middle east with a dark olive skin completion, and the older version appears to be Slavic with a big Bulgarian nose, absurd to say the least how hard can it be, they could hardly have looked more different. 5/10 is perfectly reasonable score for this movie.",

With the help of his trusty lobby boy (Revolori) he must escape prison and clear his name, just as Europe falls into war. You pretty much should know what you will be getting in terms of tone with a Wes Anderson movie, and this is no exception. The star studded cast are all very entertaining to watch (in small and large roles alike), and the production design is a triumph of style and colours, as is Alexander Desplat's breathlessly peppy score - but, for a movie that behaves like a comedy, instances of laughter are actually not so many, and the whole affair borders on caricature so often, the potential drama inherent to the story is diffused, and  the anachronistic expletive laden dialogue and occasional attempts  at  visceral violence are no compensation for it.",

If you don't like Wes Anderson, I think that is a sign that you have mental issues. Seriously. For instance, I was reading the negative reviews from other non-critics like Alice Shen and she obviously has some problems. Before you jump to the conclusion that Alice just doesn't like W.A., you should note that she gives a very high rating to Darjeeling Limited. At first I assumed that it was just be a matter of 'taste', but upon further examination I noticed that she gave Silver Linings Playbook and Goonies 1-star as well, and called goonies stupid or something to that effect. Among her 2-star selections for Alice are The Departed and American Hustle--this is upsetting and is what led me to write this counter-comment. Of course there is no incorrectness to a subjective review--A clown can be funny or scary depending on your point of view--but the star gauge that is shorthand for a movie's empirical quality can be incorrect and is downright wrong in many of Alice Shen's critiques. My point is that the stars allocated to movies should be relative between reviews for each critic. If Alice really thinks this movie along with goonies and those other oscar winning ones are relatively worse than some of her 3-star selections (spring breakers, don jon, from justin to kelly, the bling ring, not another teen movie, etc) than she is truly wasting her time writing reviews and embarrassing herself by exposing this warped 'taste'. Alice, you gave 4 stars to Ella Enchanted, Dirty Dancing and Rent, what's up with that? I admit that I haven't ever been able to sit through any of those movies for more than a few minutes, but I'm confident they weren't going to become good movies at any point. Maybe it is taste, but if so, you do not have any and should not publicly express this shortcoming 900+ times. TL;DR: Wes Anderson is an artist and deserves better than crap comments.",
