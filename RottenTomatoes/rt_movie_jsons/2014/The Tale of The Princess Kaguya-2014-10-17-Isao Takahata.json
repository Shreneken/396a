It is perhaps one of the most visually pleasing movies i have ever watched. The art is nothing short of perfect. It encapsulates the feeling of the movie, whether that was purposeful of not is irrelevant, there is no denying it fits so well. The themes of the movie brought me to tears several times. Although decently surface level, the portrayal of wealth vs happiness and the importance of all human emotions was gorgeous.  1 billion out of ten",

Sure, the animation is beautiful and the story is undeniably heartwarming, but it also drags on much longer than it needs to and misses a ton of opportunities to dive into the characters and their relationships. Instead, it uses this intimidating runtime to get weirdly plotty and explain some stuff that didn't really need explaining.\n\nSomehow the movie's main theme of letting your loved ones do what makes them happy instead of forcing them into a specific life gets completely overshadowed with some weird stuff about not wanting to return to the moon (?), despite the fact that our main character has seemingly not experienced real joy for years. It was just a strange way to climax a movie that seemed like it was building to some obvious, yet powerful emotional moments between the princess and her parents.\n\nBut enough complaining! The fact is that this is still a good movie. I've already mentioned the animation, but it can't be overstated how unique and gorgeous it is. The characters have depth and realism that's often missing in animated movies.\n\nIt doesn't quite make it on Ghibli's best-of list, but it's a solid watch.",

Anyone who likes seeing different visual styles of animation needs to watch this movie. Its beautiful simplicity with its visuals is a wonder. I think the story is pretty good too but I mostly appreciated this one because of the visual splendors it provided. Overall, I think this is among the better films from the studio and is just one of many examples of their creative projects.",

When you combine that with the stunning animation that perfectly complements the tale, you have an incredible modern classic that will be discussed in decades to come. Despite the fact that several secondary characters are one-dimensional and the story may alienate some viewers, the pros of this film far outweigh the disadvantages, and it is the closest thing to a perfect film.

Grave of the Fireflies and My Neighbor the Yamadas were two of my top favorite Ghibli movies. So naturally I was excited for this movie.\n\nNow I get the overwhelming positive and emotional reaction from many viewers, but for me, I didn't feel that much from the movie. The biggest reason for this was probably because I wasn't sure where the movie was going for the first half, and then the twist was a bit sudden.\n\nThe animation was the same as in the Yamadas, but this time it was better and more stylistic. \n\nI was a bit sad at the end.

            "content": "Alright, so I went into this film optomisticly; \"it's got 100% on rotten tomatoes and is made by studio ghibli,  what a perfect combination!\" I swear, I tried to watch this film for 3 days and was only able to make it 40 minutes in. Before I start my rant, let me clarify 2 things:\n1: I am an uncultured American and have no idea what is seen as appropriate in Japan. That being said, a good film is one in which anyone from anywhere can view and enjoy.\n2:  credit where credit is due, this film possesses beautiful animation and watercolor artwork, hence why I am not giving only half a star. \nAnyway, without further to do, I have a few criticisms I need to address. For one. This film is rather vulgar in nature; there are many scenes involving nude minors, genitalia, and exposed, growing breasts. I did not expect the amount of vulgarity I saw in this film, and It was extremely uncomfortable for me to sit through. Second. This films early messages and tone were discouraging for me ( I know that i didn't finish and I know that the themes may have strengthened, but as stated, I simply couldn't continue suffering through this film). There are two scenes in particular that bother me; (spoilers)one where the group of kids and kaguya steal a melon from a farmer, and for a second it seems that someone will say something about how it was wrong to do so, as they show the farmer frowning upon seeing his stolen crops. But instead, the greedy kids slice it open and devour it without noting on their unjust actions at all. Aditionally, I was irritated in the scene where they decide to randomly kill a pheasant in cold blood. Heck, one of the characters jumps of a cliff to catch it and kill it, almost injuring himself. Being a bird lover myself, I felt enraged by this vile scene which could have been left out of the film. It adds nothing other than showing how violent and greedy our \"protagonists\" really are. Combined with the vulgar nature of this film, I could not continue watching; i may revisit this film in the future, but for now, my opinion stands strong. I am not trying to discount the mythology behind this film, or discredit the talent and effort put into making it; however, as stated, a great film is one in which all audiences, young, old, black, white, in Greenland or Antarctica, can enjoy and gain something from. While viewers elsewhere may like seeing an old woman's breasts inflate to feed a baby, or seeing a gang of kids kill birds in the woods, I prefer less vulgar content. Say what you want about me not finishing it, but a good film should be watchable from beginning to end in one sitting.",

It's real strength lies in its wonderful art style, embracing a watercolor-esque animation technique far different than what Ghibli has come to be associated with. The uniquely melancholic tone, as well, sets the film apart from its contemporaries, and is a unique strength of Takahata as a director. It might not carry the raw power and brutality of Grave of the Fireflies, but the tone is far more nuanced and balances the Japanese folklore basis far better than Pom Poko; to me, it is probably the most complete film by Takahata, given the visual daring and narrative complexity.

A particularly memorable scene involved the Princess running away with colourful robes and kimonos left on a path beneath an illuminating moon, which was meticulously framed and had this incredible style of illustration that really stood out. Possibly the most beautifully designed Ghibli piece. Majority of the plot worked nicely which was apparently taken from a Japanese folklore legend (involving a magical Princess found in a bamboo stalk raised by humble country folk). Includes some contentious princes hoping to become her husband being sent on impossible adventures; it reminded me of the fantastical ideas one would find in the iconic Arabian Nights stories. One of my favourite Ghibli works for sure. Only slight criticism was interest waning near the end point ending as it started to introduce ideas around the Princess' origins that failed to connect, and derailed parts of the prior plot and interest in the characters - however it seemed like this was all tied into the folkloric mythical element and did not greatly detract from overall enjoyment.",

I just felt sad and like the entire story wasn't fair on anyone. \nThe dub is brilliant, Moretz as Kaguya is personable and spirited and James Caan's warm, sad portrayal of the woodcutter is truly engaging and nuanced. \n\nBut the films striking tone and spark are wistful and charming enough to redeem its 20 pounds of myth in a 10 pound bag.",

Kaguya is beautifully animated, the story keeps your interest throughout the 2.5 hour journey, the English dub is not only tolerable but excellent, and the dialogue is well written and lacks the awkwardness and cheesiness that many anime tend to have. Kaguya has a plethora of themes including the inspirational and healing power of nature, the difficulties of growing up, the curses that beauty/status/wealth can bring, the importance of freedom and playtime, and the importance of letting your children seek their passions. A true masterpiece in storytelling and animation and a movie I will pass on to those I love most.",

Takahata movies rely heavily on the plot so it's really hard to fully praise his work while avoiding spoilers.

Every paint stroke, every detail and every frame by frame animation is perfection. I've never seen such exquisite visionary qualities in a film before. Every frame is colourful, bright and absolutely delightful to admire. Not to mention several scenes have multiple layers of animation embedded within them, masterful. I'm just...in awe of how amazing the animation was, I really am. Trust it to be Studio Ghibli, they really are masters of the animation genre. This film is a re-telling of the famous Japanese folk tale \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" where said bamboo cutter comes across a glowing stalk which is revealed to contain a princess. They raise her as she grows rapidly and, with the help of a divine presence, believe she should be living in the lifestyle of nobility. There is so much to analyse, so much to take in that I just don't have enough words to detail every theme that is explored. The story is one of happiness. The contrasting lifestyles of rural village people to rich noblemen. But is anyone actually truly happy? Princess Kaguya wishes to live back in the mountains whereas her old friends are jealous of her new luxurious residence. Within this personal conflict is the never ending battle of seeking true happiness which conclusively she does not find (much like everyone else in life). The bamboo cutter gave the princess a life in his own image, a life that he wished he desired all along. While he may have been happy, his daughter was not. He was blinded by the materialistic aspirations that he yearned for. The representation of the traditional Japanese culture was wonderful and really captured the authenticity of the folk tale. I do have to warn you though, don't let the cutesy animation fool you. I do not recommend this for children. It's a long runtime, there are heavy themes and I don't think they will fully appreciate it.",

You get the sense that the scenes are being painted as you're watching it.  What Takahata has accomplished is the next level of Anime, of animation, and of filmmaking in general.  The animation as well as the story are deceptively simple, but are full of complex & sophisticated flavours which will leave you satisfied, much like genuine Japanese cuisine and culture.  \nThe story is taken from the oldest recorded Japanese folktale, The Legend of the Bamboo Cutter's Daughter. Its themes are the simple joys of human life & the sadness of conforming to cultural norms. \nThe music is also beautifully minimalistic.  The koto music is exquisite.\nAfter watching the DVD's special features, you can see that Princess Kaguya had a long, painful labour, unlike the character in the film who comes miraculously out of a takenoko, a bamboo shoot.\nThere were a few times I thought of other films while watching this one. Near the end of this film, it has some similarities to Wim Wenders' classic, Wings of Desire, in that there are otherworldly beings wanting to experience the joys of human existence, the small pleasures of which most of us are unaware.  Also, the flying scene is very Miyazaki-ish. \nMy only complaints have nothing to do with the film itself:\n- The tagline of \"The Crime & Punishment of a Princess\" has nothing to do with this film at all.\n- It seems like any animated film is automatically labelled as a kid's movie.  Not so in Japan, Anime is not just for kids; it's for everyone.  There's even animated porn!  In regards to The Tale of Princess Kaguya, the Okanagan Regional Library has it listed under Junior DVD, which definitely this film is not.\n- Also, actors who have dubbed the English versions are always given more status than anyone else.  After working on a film for 8 long years, it's not fair that someone else who spent a weekend in a sound booth gets higher billing than you.  \nThis work of art has taken and will stay in an exalted place amongst Studio Ghibli's vast annals of masterpieces. \nCTT: 5 bamboo shoots out of 5; JDT: 4/5 because she didn't like the freakin' story",

            "content": "STANDARD REVIEW: Even though I don't know much about the original folklore tale that this movie was based on, this film is the best non-directed Miyazaki Ghibli film that has ever been made. Although I have only seen three Studio Ghibli films that weren't directed by Miyazaki, this film is surprisingly better than most of his works and also pretty damn tragic when you think about it. This film (At least in my opinion) is better than Laputa, Totoro and Porco Rosso, heck it WOULD even rank up there with the masterpieces of Mononoke and Spirited Away but not better. Yeah, we've seen this type of story before with princesses being rebellious against tradition, who longs for a break out in the country, but the way the story is told and the animation itself help tell the story in such a mystical way that I just got completely lost in this movie's world. I have not felt this way about a film for a LONG time. In fact I cried from this movie and I haven't done that in years (Trust me, years!). Told with such mysticism and attention, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya would've been a timeless classic that I would've enjoyed everytime I see it, no matter my age. Recommended for the whole family, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a soon to be classic that will be remembered for a long time.\n\nRANTING TIME: OMFG!! This is the worst ending to a Studio Ghibli film I have ever seen in my life! I will admit that:\n\n\tIt has been a long time since I cried at a movie's ending\n\tIt has been a long time since I was this mystified by a movie's setting/story (This goes back to something like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke)\n\tIt has been a long time since I have seen such a goddam perfect movie like this\n\nBut this movie has one of the MOST anti-climactic endings of all time! I have never, EVER seen such a perfect movie ruin itself so hard, three minutes before its ending. Everything was absolutely perfect for me, until those last three minutes. Death Note's last 12 episodes are NOTHING compared to the rate of speed that this movie nosedives into shitville. I have never, ever seen a movie go so downhill, so fast, so hard yet still be more affecting than a 12 episode dive into shitville. I have a feeling this is how a lot of Star Trek fans felt, when they had to sit through the last 15 minutes of Into Darkness' ending. I don't usually reference other forms of pop culture here but for this rant, I'm definitely going to need to.\n\n(SPOILERS) All her life, the Princess has never had one spec of happiness in her life. The moment she left for the Capital, she has always been in the wrong place all the time. She's never loved (Sort off), never enjoyed herself in the Capital and never even makes a genuine goodbye to ANYBODY! In the fair few months she lived in the countryside (I think it was months anyways) were the only real genuine moments of happiness she has had in her \"mortal life.\" Compared that too the years of living in the Capital and you can tell that for most part, the Princess had a pretty crappy mortal time. And of course she forgets all that anyway, so it doesn't even matter anymore, which makes it all the MORE heartbreaking. And don't get me wrong tragedy is fine, just make sure that it ends well! The real title of this movie should've been \"The Tragic Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\"\n\nI get the type of ending that this movie was going for (I think). But the problem with that is the scene itself was so anti-climactic that it ruins any emotional buildup that the movie had going for itself. It almost makes the whole film utterly pointless. If you're going to go the \"E.T. go home,\" route, HAVE A \"E.T. right here,\" MOMENT DAMN IT!! The ending literally has her mid speech about the world's beauty and then all of sudden *PUFF MOTHERF*CKER! We don't give a f*ck about what you have to say! Get on the magic carpet B*TCH!* Personally, this film would've been much, MUCH better if they would just let the Princess have her moment and let her spew about how \"The world is a cruel place but also very beautiful,\" speech and persuade the moon people (Or whatever they're called) that she is not sad and that she wants to stay! As corny as that maybe, personally I would've found that a much more fitting/better ending then what we actually got anyways. It would've fit in the context of the stories fairy tale-like structure and kept itself true to what could've been a goddamn masterpiece that ranks up there with Ghibli's best like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. Freaking Ponyo had a better ending than this! The good stuff in this film unfortunately just wasn't enough for me to say it compensated those last three minutes (That somehow completely ruined everything?). But I still standby my statement, when I say that this movie is one of Ghibli's best non-Miyazaki directed films, just not one I would re-watch a lot unfortunately.\n\nThe only reason why I cried at this movie was the multitude of emotions going through my brain as I reacted to those last three minutes. To have her just leave like that WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOODBYE! And forget EVERYTHING she's experienced, itself was so hard to watch. It was just soooo shocking to see such a perfect movie, completely destroy itself in just three minutes and it pains me too because I loved this movie so much for 98.94% of the time and for those last three minutes to exist is just jarring to me. Don't get me wrong, I still liked this movie but, my god (Facepalm). I really wanted to forget those last three minutes and just mindlessly enjoy this film to no end but I just can't, I really REALLY cannot do it, no matter how hard I try :( This rant shouldn't exist and those last three minutes shouldn't exist! (SPOILERS)\n\nI'm done. (*Phew* That's a load of my chest)",

That none of the film's impact should be dulled by these changes is a testament to the quality of the studio's work, and could make one question if the only reason Miyazaki is highlighted in coverage of Ghibli is because it's easier to focus one's gratitude on a single figure.\n\nIn the tradition of the best folktales, The Tale of Princess Kaguya celebrates life and strangeness, becoming ever-more magical and bittersweet as it progresses. There is a slight slump in pacing near the middle of the film, but even that is suddenly broken with a breathtaking sequence relying on gesture drawings. Kaguya may not be as consistent as the best of Ghibli's work, but one way or another, it will leave you breathless; some for only a few moments, others for half the movie.",

The clothes, countryside, and city all lend themselves so well to the animation style. It stays true to folktale, like Grimm's or Andersen's which are sad. This isn't a Disney-fied version (I do love Disney though) making it happily ever after. Sadly, I don't think my kids would appreciate it.

It does not ruin much, but weighing in at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's maybe a bit too long. The story aside, this is fantastic craftmanship! The used visual technique makes this film. It's like a living aquarelle painting. Often painted with weaker tones - backed with smaller amounts of stronger colors. The music is also incredible and very fitting. I watched most of the film with English dubbing. Maybe wise, maybe not. It was clearly easier to hang on to then, and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz was both fitting and impressive when giving her voice.\n\nKaguya was definitely robbed of an Oscar - it beats the mediocre \"Big Hero Six\" by miles when it comes to orignality and execution.\n\nAn impressive and delightful experience. It's solid all over, but it's a bit long and it could have brought me more emotions. Guess I'm not that connected to ancient Japanese culture - even if I dig it.\n\n8 out of 10 kotos.",

The only the other I have seen except this one is Spirited Away. But now I really consider watching them looking at the skills of the directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, etc. The tale of Princess Kaguya based on an old Japanese folktale is the story of a mysterious girl(named Kaguya later) who is discovered by a bamboo cutter in a bamboo stalk. He and his wife the raise baby girl as their own.Their house is situated in greenery of remote village in the mountains. Kaguya seems to grow very rapidly and becomes very close friends with gang of children in the neighborhood. Merrily singing and playing they enjoy the nature and Kaguya is having the most joyous time in her life. \n\nHer father though, envisions great things after he finds gold and fine clothes in other bamboo stalks. He thinks heaven wants Kaguya to become a princess and they need to raise her in that way. So off they go to the city and become a noble family with their gold. Kaguya who is initial happy with all the royal treatment soon understands the sorrows and bitterness in life when things are forced onto her. The story slightly loses its steam after the breezy first hour and I feel the run time could have been short by about 20 minutes. It dwells into complex themes of our world full of deceit and sorrow and the perceptions of cycles of life, afterlife hidden under its straight forward narrative. At times things get difficult to understand, still the visuals are so beautiful that you are completely engrossed into the scenery forgetting about the story. The ending which left me dazed was quite emotional and spiritually powerful. Despite some loose ends, the movie is overall well crafted with beautiful hand drawn animation and music. I felt it was emotionally moving and deeply profound. \n\nRATING: [4/5]",

            "content": "If THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA is to be Isao Takahata's last film, at the very least we can say he has ended his career on a graceful note.  That's more than can be said for Hayao Miyazaki's technically beautiful but often meandering swan song THE WIND RISES.  Gorgeously rendered in a rich watercolor pastel style out of an old picture book, this melancholy animated feature, based on a Japanese folklore tale, centers on a bamboo cutter who adopts a girl who turns out to be anything but ordinary.  The girl grows quite rapidly from a precociously adorable child to a young lady, but her simple world is turned upside down when her misguided \"father\" decides that royalty is the life she's destined for.  As is usual per a Ghibli movie, the animation is top-notch and rich with detail, even in its stylized mode, and if the film seems long, the dynamics between the title character and her parents -- arguably the real anchor of the film, even more so than a tragic love subplot of sorts involving a poor farm boy -- are presented in a sincere, emotional way that transcends this film from being just another animation showcase.  Joe Hisaishi's music is also a plus, particularly the koto-flavored folksongs that occasionally pepper the film.  It should be warned, though, that this movie does have a few moments that stretch into \"adult\" territory (a scene where a child drinks from her mother's mammary, as well as a few shots of nude children), but it is inoffensively presented and frankly, hardly a detriment.  The bittersweet final fifteen minutes will also encourage the viewer to have tissues in store.  Not only beautiful to look at, but to watch as well, this \"princess\" is a royal treat.  The dub is, for the most part, very well done, with James Caan and Mary Steenburgen turning in solid performances as the bamboo cutter and his wife, respectively.  Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz has a fitting voice for the title character and is mostly good, but sometimes she falls a bit flat during the more emotional moments.  The sparse narration also borders on occasional pandering as well.  The rest of the cast is fine, especially the children in the opening scenes.  There are a couple of places where the dialogue sounds rushed, but otherwise, the script is adapted fairly smoothly.  It's easily livelier and superior to the more lifeless WIND RISES dub.  Still, if you can't stand the dub, there's always the original Japanese track.  Either way, a lovely film.",

The sketchbook visual look, (a rarity for Studio Ghibli, only done in their 1999 \"My Neighbors the Yamadas,\") the strong vocals of Chloe Moretz and Lucy Liu, and the overall classic 'Old Japan' feel of the whole piece is well done. Perhaps the single most breathtaking (and talked about) animated sequence in recent HISTORY is cradled in the second-half of this film, the scene where our princess protagonist blasts through a series of doors like a human rocket in a fit of intense rage, accompanied by abstract shapes, and hastily-sketched charcoal-inspired outlines. The wonder and excitement in this scene is hard to describe, and the only way to do so is calling it \"an artist's sketchbook come to life.\" This brief, fantastically drawn sequence is outstanding and is worth more than all the photorealistic CGI Hollywood has to dish up. However, with that said, Princess Kaguya shows that, as I feared with \"Poppy Hill\" and \"Arrietty,\" Studio Ghibli is becoming far too conservative for their own good. True, there is joy, sadness, and true emotions in \"Kaguya,\" but not in heaping platefulls like past efforts like \"Spirited Away,\" \"Porco Rosso,\" or \"My Neighbor Totoro,\"to name a few. Heck, Isao Takahata's 1994 \"Pom Poco,\" (his least famous film,) contains more visual excitement and originality in its first 20 minutes than this entire film. We as audiences get the miraculous birth of Kaguya almost in the first scene of the 2 hour-long-anime, but there is nothing really miraculous till the last moments when *** spoiler*** the moon people bring Kaguya back to her rightful home with a cloud of joyous, melodious entities. I wanted to see more life, more wonder, more legendary \"wow\" moments so typical in ancient folklore. I felt hungry for more. Still, \"Princess Kaguya\" was a fine film, and a bittersweet goodbye to legendary Ghibli co-founder Takahata. This is Studio Ghibli's second to last film and for that fact alone, it must be cherished and protected till the end of time.",

Cute, whimsical story.\n\nI think I honestly prefer this unique sketch-style animation to the usual anime I'm accustomed to (admittedly, I haven't seen too many). Without losing much detail or emotive ability, the animators employ a noticeably dressed down technique that shows off the hand-drawn line in its simplicity and beauty.\n\nThe story is cute and touching, with lots of intriguing glimpses of Japanese myth and culture. Unfortunately, the film's second act really drags. It's not that there isn't interesting stuff going on here. There's simply a very deliberate hand guiding the story that prefers to very gradually depict the passing of time (ironic considering the title character's growth process is magically truncated within the narrative). Honestly, I dozed off numerous times and kept having to rewind the BluRay. This yarn most certainly could be weaved without crossing the two hour mark.\n\nAll in all, like many traditionally animated films in recent years, I'd recommend The Tale of Princess Kaguya on the merit of its beautiful animation style alone. While the story is emotionally captivating in many ways, it tends to plod along in its second act. But admittedly, this animation deserves to be seen and marveled at from beginning to end.",

So Princess was sent to Earth for punishment until she admits that she doesn't want to live (on earth).\n* Since the classic ver. doesn't reveal what her sin was so there are other interpretations.\n\nMoon = After Life/Heaven/Clean place with no desire thus no sufferings/emotions.\n(Nirvana is one level up from Heaven btw..)\n\nEarth = Life/Reincarnation/Dirty place with desires thus so many sufferings and emotions (but thus also a place of joy, love, hope to human). All things are transitory. \n\n* it seems that in Buddhism the life is suffering so people train themselves on Earth to get to heaven then ultimately to Nirvana .\n\nAs for the animation, I like 2D with deep story so much better than 3D with kid story.\nAnd this picturesque fits the era of the story and it would be nice to hang one scene on the wall as it will look like an art work.\n\nMoon tried everything it could to have Princess experience sufferings in life and always took her away from what she wished for such as life in mountains with friends and a relationship with Sutemaru.\n\nWhen she was hugged by the Emperor, she on the spur of the moment wished not to be here. \nAnd this was the point when Moon decided the punishment is over and it's time for Princess to return to Heaven. (But she loves the earthly things incl her parents thus doesn't go back)\n\nI got crept out and awed by the cheerful and beautiful music, when the people from Moon came for the Princess, which has no sense of sufferings/griefs but is so cruel to grieving Princess and desperate/grieving people who loved her.\nApparently, heaven has no idea what the grief feels like.\n\nThe life doesn't go how you want but still is beautiful and worthwhile.\nWhen death comes for you, it's too late to regret for not having lived the life .",

I felt the same wonder she did as we explored this magical world together, and by the end of the film, I was moved by the emotional arc she went on. It's an amazing thing for a director to make an audience care about an animated, fairy princess, but Takahata makes Kaguya feel real and sympathetic.\n\nAlthough it's perfectly appropriate for children, I'm not sure that's the intended audience of this film. The emotional complexity of the characters feels like something that would be missed by young children. I also think the deliberate pacing of the film would bore their short attention spans. This feels like a film for parents. A film for people who want to relive the wonder and innocence of childhood.",

It may not be the best film to come from this studio, but ever since the mastermind of the studio passed, it will be a challenge to live up to. I really enjoyed watching this film, and by the end I was actually tearing up, because the maturity level of the characters and symbolism that was being shown, really stood out. \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" is the definition of an achievement in my opinion and deserves to be seen by many around the world. This is a very original film, however, it is a tad overlong and slowly paced out, making for a less pleasant experience. It felt like it was trying to take it's beautiful story and stretch it to become a Blockbuster film, which felt very out of left field for the studio. In the end, this is a really good film.",

            "content": "The Tale of Princess Kaguya is yet another unforgettable installment by Studio Ghibli, and it is one done with mesmerizing beauty. Directed by Isao Takahata, one of the co-founders of Studio Ghibli, The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a tribute to the very roots of animation, since the animation is hand-drawn (or simulates hand-drawn animation\u00e2?\u00a6I don\u00e2??t really know). It looks like moving pictures taken directly from a children\u00e2??s book, which was a delight to watch, especially accompanied by Joe Hisaishi\u00e2??s beautiful score.\n\nThe film follows the story of Princess Kaguya, who was brought to the world through a bamboo shoot and stunned everyone with her beauty, which in the long term ended up depriving her from happiness thanks to his father\u00e2??s assumption that happiness encompassed having a mansion, lots of money, and a suitable husband that would treat her like a jewel (or in other words, like an object). It is surprising and encouraging that the film is based on an old Japanese folktale and the screenwriters turned the tale into a coming-of-age timeless story about the relativity of happiness, the objectification of women, and the undeniable pointlessness of material objects. Princess Kaguya is a symbol of humbleness, feminism, and freedom. However, the film is also filled with bitterness since the Princess could never have the things she stood up for, especially freedom; she was trapped in the maze of tradition by being born at the wrong time. The film also depicts the temporality of our stay in this world and succeeds in showing how joyous is to see someone come into the world and how sad and devastating is to see someone go,\n\nThe film raises the following questions: Are all of these materialistic and ultimately pointless things only intended for people who are beautiful? Are the components of happiness homogeneous or heterogeneous? Are we supposed to stick to the image our parents\u00e2?? have always imagined for us? When is the right time for the daughter or son to fight for the happiness they know is compatible with their personality? The Tale of Princess Kaguya is one of those animated films you will not forget soon because it not only appeals to the eyes with its visual beauty, it appeals to _______ (whichever part of the body this applies to) with its deep and emotional plot.",

When her childhood friend Sutemaru is beaten in front of her, she does nothing to help him.  She gives would-be suitors false hope by demanding they fetch items to court her favor. The kicker is she has no interest in any of these men to begin with, so she requests items that are impossible to get. One even dies in the process. At least Kaguya gets depressed about it. At first she seems to praise the simple value of her previous country life over her more exalted existence in the big city, but then the celestial ending kind of throws that idea out the window. Fairy tales always have a moral and I'm sure this one is no exception. I just have no idea what that is given the bizarre finale. I still enjoyed The Tale of The Princess Kaguya. It's different and that's saying something in today's cookie cutter world.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Artistry at a different height - all done with sketches using water color and pencil.It is stunning to see how someone can stitch together enough sketches to tell an epic fantasy story in the true sense with extraordinary emotional and visual presence. The picture tells a heart-breaking story having deep threads of thematic material throughout the movie. It is a story without any stereotypes. It is lyrical , poetic , musical and a wonderful way to say that no amount of computers can beat a pencil. From a story point of view , this is basically an epic take on the life of a princess. It touches the very simple yet powerful thematic lines while masterfully tackling complex themes that are both timeless and has a huge contemporary applicability. This story does not require any villain or anything. It's beautiful right from the first sketch. It starts with a very classic fairy tale concept and then takes on  a heavy turn without losing any poise.  It also hit the archetypes of fantasy which is essentially crucial for the plot but then also takes a totally different way and the final act of the movie is as heartbreaking and bittersweet as it can get . Finishing this amazing piece of art is a beautiful song One can recollect the whole picture even if one cannot understand the language.This is telling those simple stories in an extraordinary way . Hands down this is a picture that will hold dear to most. Thank you Mr.Takahata",
