    "summary": "In 2028, OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. While its drones have long been used by the military overseas, their use is forbidden in American law enforcement. However, OmniCorp gets a golden opportunity to crack that market when Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured in the line of duty. By transforming Murphy into a cyborg, OmniCorp executives hope to rake in billions for their shareholders, but they forget one thing: There's still a man inside the machine.",

            "content": "This movie, in my opinion, has a big budget but a shallow narrative compared to the one in the original. As a novice, I was a little perplexed as to why Gary Oldman's portrayal of the doctor was so sympathetic, why they had to select a \"challenged person\" to enter the robot, and the motivation behind the rage shown for Robocop towards the end of the movie. Yes, I am aware that the cops had to do some sort of unseen labour to transform the character into Robocop, but this plotline leaves much to be desired in my opinion.",

The surprisingly recognizable supporting cast didn't hurt and I was most happy to see Michael K. Williams show up.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson Binge: Jackson plays the bombastic TV personality, a type that has become far more common in the years since this movie, and opens and closes these proceedings with manipulative fear stoking rants, similar to those that many are currently subjecting themselves to willfully on a daily basis. His performance reminded me how much more fun these types of characters were in fiction before they started showing up in droves, in real life.\n\nSLJ January #43",

It's brutal, it's edgy, it's fantastic. The new version is not those things, but this is not the 1980's, folks.\n\nWhat the reboot is, though, is a good, if not very good version of Robocop told by someone else, through a different lens. It's not supposed to be compared to the original. It's a damn good movie with great actors, and some pretty excellent performances for what it is. This isn't going to win any Oscars, but it never presumed to do so. It's a fun movie, and is much better than it has been given a chance to be.",

You do not need blood and gore to make a movie about a robot cop, no it started like the first one did, a cop was nearly killed and almost separated from his family. Unlike the first movie (the family gave up on him) this movie actually showed how a family actually cares for a fallen member. If you think about it, would you abandon your own flesh and blood because he had to be put into a suit in order to live, I for one would not. Action movies do not have to be about blood or gore, but can follow a story and that is why I rate this movie with 5 stars is because this one did just that!",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it s time for a movie about an Irish policeman: Rob O Cop.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) And in the tradition of Madonna and Prince, he became known simply as RoboCop. That s our story and we re sticking to it.\n\nGREG: It s the year 2028 and America is in a war with Iran. They clean the streets with Omnicorp s mechanized military. But back in America, such  drones  are illegal. Evil corporate genius Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) wants desperately to sell his robot soldier technology to police forces in the US but the Dreyfus Act forbids the use of such tech on the homeland. So, he gets the great idea of putting a live cop inside one of his robots, but finding an appropriately disembodied psychologically ready cop turns out to be harder than he thought.\n\nSCOTT: A Detroit cop named Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is horribly maimed by a car bomb outside his home, and Sellars convinces Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman) to fit Alex with a robot exoskeleton. Sellars  hope is that the public will feel more comfortable approving of robots with a human face. At first, Murphy is horrified by his new mechanical appearance, but soon he agrees to fight crime as Detroit s first robocop. He s an instant success, but trouble looms with technological glitches and bad guys lurking all around him.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is a remake of the 1987 movie of the same name. And it gets the full treatment. The graphics and animation are impeccable as we witness high speed chases and shootouts with an army of competitor robots. Robocop is a well-made action adventure. Robocop wants to deal with the thorny issue of man versus machine. It offers us Raymond Sellars as a sort of Steve Jobs with no social conscience (he even utters the line,  How does somebody know what they want if they haven t even seen it?  which Jobs is famous for). Sellars doesn t care about the ethical issues surrounding turning the police force over to machines who cannot feel. In fact, he argues, it s better if the robot cannot feel because it increases reaction times. No fear, no hesitation.\n\nSCOTT: Robocop is derived from a long line of science fiction stories featuring the blending of human flesh with technological implants. We saw it decades ago in The Six Million Dollar Man TV show. The Star Trek franchise ran with it in their creation of the arch villain Borg, as did the Total Recall movies. We see most recently in the Iron Man movie franchise, and now we see it here with Robocop. In some ways Robocop also reminds me of Frankenstein. A  freak  is created from various parts and then is set loose, only to go out of control and eventually become intent on destroying its maker. But Robocop separates itself from all the modern incarnations of man-machines by emphasizing the humanity of the hero, a feat seen only in the original Frankenstein. Somehow, Murphys human, soulful essence is able to overcome the technological mutilation of his brain.\n\nGREG: Alex Murphy (aka Robocop) stacks up pretty well as a hero. He starts out as a compassionate and caring father to his son and a good husband to his wife. He s a dedicated cop on the trail of a bad guy named Antoine Vallon who is dealing in illegal drugs and guns. But when he gets too close Vallon has Murphy targeted resulting in the car bombing. This attack on Murphy makes us feel sympathy for him. Once inside the Robocop suit, Murphy wrestles with the fact that he s forever trapped as a part man / part machine. We re given a hero with both a sincere pain and eventually a desire for revenge.\n\nSCOTT: I agree, Greg. Alex Murphy is a worthy hero in this movie. He is certainly cast into a dark, dangerous world and must grow to heroic lengths to overcome daunting forces seemingly beyond his control. One complaint I have is that only by invoking mysterious forces is Murphy able to claw his way out of Dr. Norton s programming. It would have been a more effective hero story if we, the audience, were made explicitly privy to how this transformation takes place. Yes, we can say that his humanity rose above his implants, but this very important part of the story needs some fleshing out (pardon the pun). As befitting any good hero tale, there are nice supporting allies for Murphy, too. His wife (Abbie Cornish) and child (John Paul Ruttan) are both supportive yet skeptical about Murphy s new role as a Detroit robocop. His police partner Jack (Michael K. Williams) is a supportive sidekick. Then there is Dr. Norton, who appears to be an ally but we re never really sure until late in the game. Gary Oldman as Norton does a masterful job of straddling the line between hero and villain in this story.\n\nGREG: We re dealt a pair of villains in this story. The first is a classic bad guy: Antoine Vallon. He s a very generic dealer in contraband. There isn t much for us to analyze here. He s just a bad guy for Robocop to attempt to bring down. Only slightly more interesting is Michael Keaton s Sellars character. As I mentioned earlier, he is cut from the same cloth as other corporate geniuses. And like so many other corporate geniuses we see in the movies all he cares about is making a buck. He ll do anything to improve his bottom line. And that includes threatening innocent women and children. Heck, I was expecting him to kick a dog at one point just to show how mean he was. Keaton gives it his best, but Sellars doesn t offer us much to really dislike in this film.\n\nSCOTT: I thought that Keaton did a terrific job in his role as the main villain of this story, Greg. He pursued his greedy quest in a most cunning and ruthless fashion, and he did it with style and pizzazz. I agree that Vallon was a fairly useless cardboard villain, but Norton, the corrupt cops, and police chief were all effective in their villainous roles. Overall, the main thrust of the story is Murphys journey as the robocop, and so I was impressed that Sellars  character enjoyed as much development as he did.\n\nGREG: Robocop is a pretty good action/adventure with plenty of chases and gun play. I m sure there will be a video game out soon where we can all live vicariously through Robocop s exploits. For an entertaining and well-crafted 2-hour flick I award Robocop 3 out of 5 Reels. To get a higher rating I would want more character development for Murphy and supporting characters. Alex Murphy / Robocop is a fine example of mythical heroes. He starts out as a virtuous man who dies and is resurrected as a more powerful man. We can all feel his loss, pain, and angst. In the end he exacts his revenge and sets things right. I give Murphy 3 Heroes out of 5. As we ve already agreed Vallon is a stock character and doesn t really warrant a score of his own. Sellars was played well by Keaton but I thought he lacked any development. We re just given a typical Hollywood greedy corporate head with ambitions of more wealth. I give him a score of 3 out of 5 Villains. Movie:  Hero:  Villain: \n\nSCOTT: I enjoyed Robocop, largely because its human elements and storytelling detail allowed it to rise above its appearance as a mindless action flick. In addition, the film raises a philosophical point about the integration of men and machines, as well as the issue of how far we should go to preserve a human life. I agree with you, Greg, that Murphy was a worthy hero but he wasn t a character with a lot of depth. That limits my rating of the movie to 3 Reels out of 5. Robocop does feature a nicely done hero story. Murphy s journey has many of the classic elements, but as noted above, his character doesn t have the flair or magnetism that I like to see in a hero. For that reason I ll limit my heroes rating to 3 Heroes out of 5. I was impressed by Keaton s performance here, Greg, probably more than you were. Sellars  obsession with greed and his manipulation of Norton, of public opinion, and of Murphy were a joy to watch. This is a villain that we love to hate. And we never did discuss Samuel L. Jackson as Pat Novak, a sort-of villain whose extreme viewpoints mixed with disingenuous showmanship made me want to vomit. Any villain who is vomit-worthy is worth 4 Villains out of 5.

Robocop is the story of a police officer who is brutally injured, (In the original he's killed) in a car bombing and is then put into this robotic shell to help stop crime in future Detroit. Just like the original this movie commentates about the idea of man and machine, and how the main character is reconnecting with his human self. \nThe problem with the remake is that it is soooooooo boring. I never thought I'd say that a movie called Robocop is boring. Even if it is PG-13 there's no excuse for this movie to be such a bland bore. Now I like some of the ideas in this movie don't get me wrong. I actually kind of like the redesign of Robocop except for the one human hand. I also like some of the new robots and weapons they brought into it. The problem is though that there isn't a fun crime solving montage as there was in the first one. Emphasis on fun. \nI think Joel Kinnaman is a good actor, but Murphy has the personality of being one of those tough detectives we've seen on soo many cop shows. Now the performances of Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton. But the rest of the performances are not terrible, but not great either. I think Samuel L. Jackson is just cashing in a check for this movie. \nThe main problem with this movie is the fact that there's approximately zero memorable action sequences. There's a training simulation with is kind of cool, showing Robocop and one of the new robots they created where Robocop is falling behind the new robot because he's part human and is hesitating. I thought that moment was cool, but the rest of it was sooooo boring. And I can't stress that enough. The original Robocop was a hard R rated movie that was a fun action movie on par with Terminator. In that movie he literally shoots a rapist in the dick. It is violent beyond imagination. You can't make this stuff up. I don't hate this remake, I just fell like there were a lot of missed opportunities. For one, you can't make a remake of a hard R sci-fi action movie and not make the new one R. Even if the reasoning is to bring in a broader audience. It's a little insulting to think about. But even PG-13 movies can be fun and have cool action, which is the second thing the remake needs. \nI think if the movie is on cable one night it's worth the watch, even renting it once I think it's worth the watch. As I said there's some cool ideas that were created for this movie, but overall the movie is just a bore.",

The second half is shaky, and it would have been better if Padilla were given control like in the Elite Squad films.

This out of place rock'n roll was used again at the end credits. Poor choice in music also reared it's head during Robocop's first test; instead of using the thematic (1987) 'Robocop' music, there was a song 'If Only Had A Heart' from 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) film; I don't understand why Basil Poledouris's unbeatable (1987) Robocop theme music was only used once (for a few seconds at the start); the makers of this reboot probably thought they were being clever using 'If I Only Had A Heart' (in what could've been a good scene), but it didn't fit the film. Like 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', Robocop (2014) starts promisingly, but gets repetitive. Another thing I didn't about this remake is Robocop leaping into the air and getting shut down ala 'Avatar'. And the ending on top of the OmniCorp building felt rushed and uninspired; a climax on top of a building with a helipad...gee, where have I seen that before? 'Mercury Rising' (1998), 'Max Payne' (2008). I was a fan of the original Robocop; I saw it at the movies in 1987 and watched it countless times on video, but this remake wasn't good; with a few simple changes e.g. using Basil Poledouris's (1987) Robocop theme music (for more than just few seconds), it could've been decent. That's my main criticism of Robocop (2014); the music. On a positive note the ED-209's looked good and there were some fresh ideas e.g. Robocop being tested i.e. the company that made Robocop conducting trials before unleashing him on the public, but as I wrote; these scenes were spoiled by the music.",

Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice... \n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"While it's far better than it could have been, Jos\u00e9 Padilha's RoboCop remake fails to offer a significant improvement over the original.\"RoboCop received several comparisons to the 1987 film; the consensus was that it fell short.Guy Lodge of Variety said that \"It's a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era's darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul.\" Leslie Felperin from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the remake \"has a better cast, more meticulous script and, naturally, flashier effects, but it lacks the original's wit and subversive slipperiness.\" Brian Viner from Daily Mail said that while he was \"not predisposed to like this shiny new RoboCop for making me feel ancient, it does have an appealing vitality.\" Andrew Osmond from SFX says, \"It's not a classic like Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original, but it is an excellent, intelligent SF drama\", believing it is \"one of the boldest Hollywood reboots we've seen yet.\" Chris Hewitt from Empire wrote, \"there's a sense that Padilha, or perhaps his corporate overlords, don't really get what made the original so special.\" Nigel Andrews from Financial Times called it \"a leaden, needless remake\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote it was \"a dumbed-down shoot-em-up frontloaded with elaborate but perfunctory new 'satirical' material in which the movie loses interest with breathtaking speed\". His fellow Guardian film critic Mark Kermode rated it 3 out of 5 stars, writing that \"against the odds, this emerges as far less depressing fare than one might have expected, retaining the key elements of political satire and philosophical musings that powered Verhoeven's original\" and \"at least it appears to have been made by someone who understands what made the original great.\" No old movie goes safe today as Hollywood is at a loss to make original movies these days. I reckon it was a safe bet that \"Robocop\" would get a reboot sooner or later. In 1987 \"Robocop\" entered the screen with a mixture of witty satire and over the top violence from director Paul Verhoeven. A robotic cop who fought crime in a near future world overwhelmed by greed, hypocrisy, corruption and excessive, almost cartoonish violence. However, with the remake in the hands of Jose Padiha we get a partly reworked storyline with less satire and more of a videogame feeling. We get a wooden and one dimensional Joel Kinnaman, a same same Samuel L. Jackson and the biggest issue is that the bad guys are not even close to the evilness of Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as Dick Jones and Clarence J. Boddicker in the original. The narrative is abrupt and wishy washy and the characters are guite flat and stereotypical. The chemistry and satire in the original is lacking and this version ends up as a poor take on something 80s iconic. Yes, the effects and CGI is in most cases a lot better than in the original, but when the rest is not up to scratch it doesn\u00b4t matter. Discard this and see/re-see the original instead. Trivia: Michael Fassbender, Matthias Schoenaerts and Russell Crowe were considered to play RoboCop.",

Now in 2014, after multiple delays the remake has finally arrived; though it has some entertaining moments, it ultimately pales in comparison to its predecessor.\n\nThe plot of Robocop 2014 is mostly the same as the original, but with a few differences. Detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is an officer who is severely injured in an improvised explosion from crime lord Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow). His body cannot be saved but his mind lives on in the cyborg law enforcer Robocop, built and designed by Chief Omnicorp Scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) and Robo sets out to clean the streets of Detroit whilst also dealing with the public's perception of him and the corporation's efforts to control him. The remake of Robocop is much more straightforward as a narrative; unfolding within a combination of action sequences with some slower paced moments in between. In terms of themes it's all about corporate greed in the OCP's efforts to get its unmanned weapons put out onto the streets of America. This does provide some links to the modern ethics of using drones and other machinery but nevertheless the plot barrels along at a very fast rate, not really requiring much thought and some scenes end up being completely pointless. The ending too is rather lacking, not really providing much closure. The plotline of Robocop ironically makes you wish at many points that the company had made a video game rather than a movie. The action scenes in particular would have made a strong impression if they were played rather than watched.\n\nWhere the acting talent in the original Robocop worked hard to give an element of duality in the roles, the remake seems to do everything by the book. None of the characters really serve much purpose throughout the film, nor do they go through any interesting arcs. Murphy starts off as a rather generic member of the force, as does his partner Jack Lewis (Michael K. Williams) who barely makes his presence known throughout the film. Kinnamann's performance is often quite confusing; one minute he retains his thoughts as Murphy and the next he's reduced to the mentality of a machine. This had potential to put across the difference between man and machine but it jumps back and forth with such reckless and irregular abandon that it really doesn't matter much to the plot at the end of the day. Robocop's wife and child (played by Abbie Cornish and John Paul respectively) play a larger role in the remake; again, this was an interesting choice but unfortunately they don't deliver nearly enough chemistry and are never put in much danger to entice the audience into caring about them. The big name actors and other members of the cast placed on the poster go to waste throughout the film; Michael Keaton has nothing interesting to show as the head of the OCP, Gary Oldman comes close but never makes Professor Norton into a compelling character and as for Samuel L. Jackson, this could be his worst and most bare-bones role ever in a movie, only appearing in brief newsflashes scattered throughout the remake.\n\nThere was never any way around it; the 2014 remake of Robocop was going to be made using CGI; these effects work fairly well where the futuristic technology is concerned. The robots have more detail before and we are given more insight into Robo's operating procedures with some slick point of view shots. The action sequences are framed fairly well although there does exist some moments where the camera shakes violently; the final fight where Robo takes on the ED-209s to reach the top of OCP headquarters is a solid improvement on the original film's climax and the shootout in Vallon's hideout features some effective lighting but on the whole the action sequences (which are arguably the best part of the film), like the rest of the film are far too brief to be very memorable. The futuristic environment is also lacking; the film claims to be set in 2028 and set outside of some fancy gadgets, the world of Detroit doesn't look any different from our present day world; a wasted opportunity, given how modern movie technology can often render impressive and immersive settings.\n\nIf there's one word to describe Robocop, it's ''rushed''. Despite being released more than twenty five years after the original, this remake constantly brushes over its good aspects while magnifying it's bad ones. There are some parts that provide some mild enjoyment but this version of Robocop is unfortunately doomed in comparison with the original.",

Why when you want a PG-13 you would decide to remake Robocop of all things is beyond me, but there you go, it's a PG-13 so no one gets shot, instead Robocop just Tasers the bad guys.\n\nIt certainly has none of the humour of the original, in fact it doesn't actually have any humour at all. It isn't interesting, attention grabbing, compelling, innovate or original.  The original is set in a dystopian run down city of Detroit.  The remake is set in Detroit, but it isn't in some rundown or dystopian version, it's just Detroit in the future, so why do they need a Robocop so badly then?

A remake is already guaranteed to piss a lot of people off because you are touching their beloved franchise, the least you can then is to be brave and refocus or alter it to create something new (unless the original film is so old that the reboot is nothing more than a needed quality update), and this is exactly what Robocop (2014) did: took an old franchise and reinvented it to successfully deal with a modern issue a bold, sleek, intelligent, and original way while maintaining enough aspects from the original to be considered a successful homage.

Here, the film's message is constantly everywhere: constantly in your face, yelling it out loud, always repeating it. Never giving us the chance to just think about it and make deeper connections, but instead always telling us what we're supposed to see. Where was the subtlety? The clever presentation?

So Padilha has his task cut out for him, could he satisfy both factions? Unfortunately the answer is no and it would be surprising if either group were satisfied with the finished product. It seems like yet another case of the-man-behind-the-curtain syndrome, most notably in the decision to aim for a PG13 rating, against Padilha's wishes, in order to ensure a film that went severely over budget recoups some of its investment. I agree that graphic violence is not necessary in order to make a good action movie, just look at The Dark Knight or Star Trek, but RoboCop falls short of the mark here and delivers a very placid final product. It can be argued that's what happens when the creative control is limited but perhaps hiring a director who's previous work is rated 18+ was the greater mistake. The cast however is strong and Kinnaman(The Killing) executes his role efficiently, with support from veteran actors Oldman, Keaton and Jackson but even this solid foundation seemed somewhat hollow. In a throwback to the satirical nature, that flowed seamlessly throughout the original, Jackson's portrayal of the rhetoric spewing media mogul appears a little disjointed and does little to add to an already inferior reboot. In total RoboCop 2014 does its best to recreate a character that criminals of Detroit should fear but in the end only offers us a modern day Tin-Man and by the closing credits I could not help but think, 'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar'.",

            "content": "The remake of Robocop is a colossal miscalculation.  I'm all for remakes that change up the original material, but this movie does it in such a way as to drain all the juice out of the material until we are left with a dull, boring, lifeless bag of sand.  Let's put it this way, that last thing we need from Robocop is pathos.\n\nPaul Verhoven's 1987 classic was a brutally funny satire on the 21st century, a future run by corrupt corporations and roving street gangs that kill at will.  It was painted in broad strokes and presented, appropriately, as a living breathing comic book, an ultraviolent black comedy in which you laughed at just how over-the-top and silly the whole thing was.  The creators of that film understood that the idea of reviving a dead police officer and refitting him with cybernetics to make him tougher was a ridiculous concept, and they kept their film at that level.\n\nThe trouble with the remake is that it treats this material with sobering seriousness and attempts to give the film an emotional payoff.  Think about that: They want an emotional payoff from a story about a cybernetic cop!  There's a scene where RoboCop comes home and his son tells him that \"I taped all the Red Wings games so we could watch them together.\"  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nThe story you know: Alex Murphy (played this time by Swedish actor Joel Kinneman) is a good cop in a bad city who does his best to remove the city's latest criminal element.  In doing so, he is killed in the line of duty. Instead of letting him die with dignity, Ray Sellars (Michael Keaton), the head of the multinational Omnicorp, decides to use him as a guinea pig for an experiment in robotic law enforcement.  Alex was badly injured in an explosion (in the original he was shot to pieces) and all that remains are his head, brain, lungs, and for some reason, his right hand - not an arm - just a hand!  The rest of his body is made of metal. Sellars gives the job to a brilliant robotics engineer named Dennett Norton played by Gary Oldman in a heartfelt performance that the movie doesn't really call for.\n\nWhen we see Murphy, his only flesh is the face that sticks out of that helmet. We know that he can never be all human anymore.  We understand that having a normal home life would be nearly impossible, but the screenwriters painfully attempts to build a relationship between Murphy and his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and their son Daniel (John Paul Ruttan).  He's 95% metal, so having an intimate bond is not a possibility anymore.  That makes the attempts to connect with this family not only painful to watch, but also kind of pointless.  This may be the only time I might have welcomed a deus ex machina.\n\nAside from the mishandled emotional stuff, RoboCop tries to address Alex's dual identity. Where does the brain stop and the machine begin? Yes, he can take down criminals with the greatest of ease, but that's also the problem. He's so good at shooting criminals and not taking damage that it renders all of the action scenes boring and repetitive. The drama - outside of the family stuff - is suppose to come from Alex's struggle to keep what is left of his humanity even as the nasties at OmniCorp determine to rend it away from him. But that becomes the fulcrum of the movie, and it's not much of a fulcrum.  What is he fighting against?  We are told that Detroit is a cesspool of urban decay but from our perspective the city looks thriving and beautiful.\n\nThe original frequently interrupted the action with silly commercials and news broadcasts. Here it's all whittled down to an O'Reilly Factor-style news show called The Novak Element, hosted by Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) who reports on the progress of Robocop and the senate hearings to shut down the program that created him. Jackson's presence in the movie is welcomed, but it seems to be in the wrong movie. He speaks and comments in a way that the other characters in the movie do not making you wonder if his scenes were tacked on long after the movie was completed.  His dialogue is such a mangled mess that I'm not 100% sure what side he's even on.  Even his last lines are a head-scratcher.\n\nLook, a remake of Robocop is a bad idea anyway. The original was fine. The second film was underrated. The third film was unnecessary.  Like many remakes is an overcooked, under-thought piece of commercial filmmaking put together by a committee who couldn't be bothered to figure out what made the original work. The feels less like a movie and more like an annuity in action.",

The decision to more deeply explore the character of Murphy was a smart one, considering the vastly evolving fields of cybernetics and robotics in the real world. \n\nThis movie wisely stayed away from trying to be a copy of the original, which would have opened it up for even more criticism than it got. Padilha made a good choice by not \"remaking\" Verhoeven's film. Instead this film \"reimagines\" the character in the modern world.\n\nI was especially struck by the performance of Kinnaman, who had to convey and modulate Murphy in at least three iterations: as fully human, as Robocop with Murphy's heart and soul, and as full-on Robocop. His depiction of the \"ruined man inside the machine\" was subtle but powerful and seemed to come from his gut and, as a result, was gut-wrenching. One scene in particular, in which Murphy was confronted with the remnants of his human body, was extraordinarily well done.\n\nThis movie had its flaws, and if you are looking for the same tone of the original, you will be disappointed, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

The human drama is very superficial.\n\nPlot is so unoriginal, predictable and one-dimensional I ended up supporting the bad guys, almost out of spite.\n\nNone of this is helped by Joel Kinnaman's performance in the lead role.

Unfortunately, he's not good at that, coming across as very superficial.\n\nMichael Keaton, Gary Oldman and Abbie Cornish deserve a lot better movie than this.",

This movie is better than the original and I enjoyed original. i agree with everything AI S said .  I can relate much more with this movie  than that of the old one. You know, I read critics who do this critiquing as a career and they very rarely just enjoy a movie. They are too busy passing judgement. They don't go in to enjoy themselves. Now I can go about looking for things that are wrong with a movie, or anything ,anyone and life itself but I promise,  that focus can't allow for us to see,  feel or sit back and enjoy the ride. The more your focus on what is wrong with a movie,  yourself, your  life , life in general , people  , or anything I have very first hand knowledge how it does not allow for you to see,  feel and sometimes even remember things you once loved.  Guys you do not want to be  a critic. Besides, most the time,  most critics are so off, it is so clear how their own issues with life,  themselves  are what they watch when they watch a movie...And so many times they reveal how they decided to not like a movie before they watched it and most of them don't even get how obvious it is that they did. And I do not say this to offend because I would have no right to pass judgement or look down  on someone for this because I have had my own experience with it. Sometimes, you cannot avoid the darkest and worst hour of your life that could last months or even years  and in that time observe how it affects the way you see , feel and or experience everything. Be it a movie, music or anything you once used to love. \n\nBesides,  There is so much to relate with and enjoy regarding this movie, all it takes is imagination. Anyone who has had something happen to them,  that exceeded  their worst fears and  nightmares , something they never even imagined that could happen to them and felt a serious lack of control or a way to beat it. Even upon noticing lacking control over the way you feel about everything. Being unable to find joy in anything at all.\n\n    Murphy and this movie  is not awesome because of being way too powerful but because he overcomes what takes control of him, science ,technology, illness , disease injury, the powers that be, big money,  big corporate business,   they do an excellent job showing how the powers that be, big coorperate business  take away his free will without him knowing it where he cannot even react to his wife or son , , which believe me, this generation has plenty to relate with and if you dont yet have any experience or knowledge concerning this struggle in your life or those around , you will. When you or someone close to will face what the world science and technology deems impossible . The very strong female lead in this movie, his wife replaces the female partner he had in the old movie in such way that has a much deeper influence and connection . When  confronts him and that bond with her , his son in durress of the worst kind ,then you see what makes robocop, Murphy truly  amazing  what makes this movie something anyone can relate with if they are looking for it.. And I will tell you with all certainty,  looking for this will be so much more rewarding for you,  than allowing your focus to control you. overcoming impossible odds , facing a threat that cannot be beaten without looking for it, without believing in it,  without wanting to have it. Murphy,  robocop, when he comes back to life,  is when his  wife finds confronts him as the programming within him is calling all the shots  is within him with the help of Gary Oldman's character  setting it up because he is driven by the same thing, his connection with his wife and son and their need for him to be him. Something beats the science and all the odds.  When what we see and feel drives us to do something we never could have done without the someone we love in pain.",

It was thought provoking and linked into many modern discussions about AI and human life. Also, relationships between Robocop and the doc, his wife and is son are explored in some depth, at some level even better than Verhoeven did it. Negatives were the annoying amounts of robots and drones Robocop had to take on, although that too links in with modern discussion about warfare.  The first scene, were the threat of drones and robots without feelings were made clear, weren't badly done. Yes, the original was way better, but no, no, no: this isn't a bad movie. Not at all.",

I'll have to re-watch it, so I can compare to this version.\n\nI do remember the effects were crap compared to this version (of course...2014 compared to the '80s). I must give lots of kuddos to the makers of this film for the amazing effects and the awesome scenes with RoboCop kicking ass and taking names. Fantastic. I especially loved the battle with the huge security robots. I was soooo nervous for him, but it was awesome how the fight ended. I cannot say how he bested the security robots, but it was nice and it made me smile. \n\nNow....the acting.....it was okay. The main guy was alright, but I felt when he was trying to show emotion (especially before he became a robot) was forced. I feel that they may have filmed the \"non feeling robot\" scenes before the \"feeling robot\" or the \"human\" scenes. He was awesome at no emotion. It was kind of scary how good he was at it. I hope he isn't like that in real life.\n\nGah! I felt so bad for his wife and kid....they suffered horribly with him being on the streets and being a robot under someone's control. So crappy...if I was his wife I would demand they turn him off. I could not live that way. I rather him dead. I need to feel loved...and even with him having some sort of feelings as a robot, it cannot compare to 100% human feelings. There will always be a part of him that she can never reach (like doing the nasty...nope...never happening again). \n\nLOVED, LOVED Samuel L. Jackson. Whenever he pops up in these nerdy films, he always makes me smile. \n\nThe rest of the crew was meh. Like the main baddie. Which is odd, because I have seen him in other films and I have liked him. Not his best AT all.\n\nThe film did seem to drag on near the beginning, but once THE event happens then it got better. \n\nI always have to laugh and roll my eyes when a movie is set in Detroit due to the crime and poverty issues. I really wish Detroit had a RoboCop....that would be nice. Clean it up and bring it back to its former glory.\n\nI usually ignore or don't mention other reviews/ratings about movies and books, but I do have to question why this received such low ratings. I thought it was pretty good! Was it the best movie ever? No. It was a nice Sci-Fi action flick for a lazy night. It had drama, fight scenes, robots, and a controversial issue at play throughout the film. I read some of the reviews and I think people are expecting TOO much out of a film like this. It is a nerdy type film that is action-y. I think people are too much in love with the old film to give this a chance. Boyfriend liked this film a lot and he is the reason that I actually watched it.\n\nANYWAYS\n\nThis was a fun ride. I really need to re-watch the old film. It has been EONS since I watched that. From what I remember, this is a good remake of the old film. Way better effects. Some of the acting was MEH, but some of the actors did a good job like the always fabulous SLJ. Love him. I totally recommend this movie for those in the need of a Sci-Fi with some kickass action! Out of five stars, I stamp this with 4. It's more like 3.5, but I rounded. \n\n\n\n\nFavorite Character(s): The wife, Pat (even tho I did not like his character, I love the actor and he did awesome - like normal), and Tom (he made me laugh) \nNot-so Favorite Character(s): The main baddy & Chief Karen Dean (I wanted to punch her)\nRe-watch?: Sure",

There are too many moments where RoboCop just stands still, taking all the time in the world to shoot and making no attempts to dodge the shots because he's nearly invincible. It's even boring to see him shoot from his motorcycle because the movements of the characters and the camera work were both so static and plain. It's really lame to see one camera shot where a gun is being fired, and then a second shot of seeing the bullet land. The only good gunfight was before he was even RoboCop, because as a human, he feared getting shot and actually had to move swiftly, picking choice moments when to fire back. The one moment when RoboCop could have had a great fight sequence was when he went up against the ED-209s, but he gets his butt kicked. He doesn't do anything impressive at all. He goes from being totally invincible to far too weak, making his partner get shoehorned in to save him not once but twice.\n\nAside from action, there's not a lot of substance to this. The story is pretty typical and uninspired. There were some nice moments where the camerawork stood out at least; sometimes there was a moment where a still shot would have sufficed but it was replaced with a very dynamic one, moving around a lot in a single cut without too much editing.

Is it as good as the original, NO! But it is a decent movie, so lets talk about what they got right. First off was the cast, the guy they got to play Robocop was very adequate, but it is the rest of the cast that does all the heavy lifting on the acting end. Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton all give very good performances, plus the rest of the cast is fine too. The story was not quite as edgy as the original, but I did like all the modern updates they did, such as CCTV in his head with all the police files of outstanding cases, and the bike and weapon, but not the black, I prefer the traditional silver. They also did a good job with the action, and the family angle worked for what it was. This is far from a perfect movie, but I was surprisingly entertained and liked it overall.\n3.5 Beards Out Of 5",

I am impressed by not only the casting and production value but also the relevance of the story adaptation to today's headlines. The film deals with important philosophical and ethical questions such as what makes us human, how far are we willing to let technology direct our lives, and when should we insist upon liberty at the expense of safety. Other themes include media bias and control, the dangers of modern policing, the advances of biotechnology, privatization of the criminal justice system, the dangers of popular opinion being swayed by clever marketing and propaganda, corruption in government and politics, the importance of due process, and the resilience of the human spirit. The film's creators did an excellent job presenting these issues without tipping the scales on either side.",

The original film was wildly violent, darkly satirical and clearly not intended to be your typical action film. This remake however is missing the satire and the gleeful violence, which makes it a rather run of the mill sci-fi action flick. The bright spots of the film are Michael Keaton as the slickly Omnicorp president, equal parts Steve Jobs innovator and money grubbing Donald Trump, and Gary Oldman as an innovative scientist who is reluctantly recruited by Keaton to work on the RoboCop project. I also really liked that the \"bad guys\" in the film were not out and out black hats and certainly did not see themselves as villains (though they unfortunately abandon this at the third act). And Alex Murphy is also made to be more human than he was in the original film, which might have been an interesting storyline if it had been developed properly. At best, you could say this is a passable, though quite forgettable, action film. At worst, you could say it's bland and homogenized remake of a cult classic.",

            "content": "\"NO GUTS, NO GLORY. LITERALLY.\"\n\nIt must have been an hour into the movie when I heard the first person snoring.  I was thinking the same, time for a nap.  I was surprised, all the chatter and backstory was just so... Zzzzzz.  But just as the movie started to lose me it finally kicked into high gear and spent the last half of it dazzling me with sleek and stylish action combined with great music and solid acting.  I don't know why they felt the need for all the human elements, honestly for once I was hoping for more robot action, but once they set the story and mood the movie really started to shine and I was sold by the time the credits rolled.\n\nRobocop isn't the new Iron Man, it doesn't have the heart or humor for that.  Instead it falls into the \"admirable attempt\" category that you'd find movies like Real Steal in.  It has a glossy and polished exterior but in its attempt to make us feel it instead bores.  We want Robocop!  Not the touchy feely man in the machine. So much focuses on the family and the parts of his life he's not around for yet no one seems to remember that he's a giant killing machine now. I don't think I can see him at his son's school for show and tell or quietly sitting in the back of the room during their performance of the Nativity Story.\n\nMost of the cast does a fine job.  I was surprised over and over by the talent.  Especially Gary Oldman who was better than necessary and brought just enough dazzle to his character to make him more interesting than Robocop.  Michael Keaton, Jay Baruchel, Jackie Earl Halley, and Joel Kinnaman as Robocop all did great in their parts along with Abbie Cornish and Jennifer Ehle. But the great cast and beautiful sets still amassed to a movie only half as entertaining as it should have been.\n\nUltimately, it felt like the makers aimed at a PG-13 and didn't have the courage to go for the R which would have made it a far more entertaining movie and likely the Robocop of our dreams. But sadly many people, myself included, will have to wait until the next time they decide to reboot it. Or, accept that they made a moderately entertaining film and really blow us away Hobbit style with the next one. Either way we are stuck with what we have for now and although I didn't hate it, I also didn't love it. Robocop lands firmly in the middle.\n\nFINAL SCORE = 3/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

Loyal fans however and people who dont like run of the mill rehashes will be disapointed but not aghast with this relatively okay outing. Unlike its original itteration, Jose Padiha decides he wants to study, i say study i mean touch upon, the technological aspect, while trying to look cool, rather than pack the violent and horrifying punch the original had in abundance. This outing focuses more on the company Omnicorp, run by an extremely talented scientist, a CEO who knows how to sell a product and a cocky marketing geek who likes to blow the CEO's trumpet. In a bid to install machine protection across the globe and especially in America, Omnicorp enlist the biased media outlet, The Novak Experience to help sway public view on robot protection on months prior to a bill being passed that will ensure human beings stay in control of the justice system. However when Omnicorp find a loop hole in the system and after good cop Alex Murphey is almost fatally injured in a gang assanation attempt, the time seems right to make a half human, half machine defender. This of course works well for a while, until the inevitable complications that come when machine and the human soul collide. It is pretty similar in theory and on paper to the originals, only here it focuses more on the company and their struggles, it is a neat addition and it certainly doesnt hurt the film, when the talent playing the company are phenominal actors, Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson, Michael Keaton, Jay Baruchel and Jackie Earl Halley. And since we spend most of our time around these people, its nice to actually have an weighted performance in such an average film, it makes it entertaining and to a certain extent bearable. We also have Murphey himself played by Joel Kinneman, who to be fair does a good enough job with what he's given and pulls of Robocop with enough believable finese, much like his distraught wife, Abi Cornish who we also spend some time with as the film examines the broken home scenario and the fight for morals within Murphey's head. All of this sounds excellent but at a 12 rating and filled with CGI the movie becomes more like a cut scene from a computer game during the action sequences than a brutal truth its actors try desperatly to portray. In the original the violence was so over the top in order to scare and exentuate just how brutal these machines could be, but here Robocop is cool, people love him, hes slick and pretty close to invincable. In a latter scene he takes on 4 ED409 models and comes off not to bad. It just cheapens the entire thing. I get whats happening here, i know its being mass marketed, i get that but as a fan of what made the original stand out from the crowd and stick with us, this film never will. Because behind all the good performance and decent concept is either CGI battles of really boring, threatless battles in which Murphey can literally take on a small army and not get touched. The film does well in the art department as well, although Detroit is definatley far to polished looking. It's just you never feel fully immersed. It reeks of big studio blockbuster and thats what hurts this film the most. Its sure as hell not the disaster a lot of fans expected but its not what they wanted for the beloved character either.",

            "content": "When I heard that they were remaking Robocop, I had a bit of a head-in-the-hands moment. Why God why I thought to myself. Unfortunately, those suspicions were well justified. \n\nThe problem was that to my generation, Robocop was on of the seminal films of its time. Yes it was violent. It's image of a future Detriot, ridden with crime and it's under-maned and under-funded Police force meant that it was gritty and the violence was key to the storyline and the creation of Robocop. However, it was a wonderful critique of America and the 1980's 'Greed is good' mentality. Key to that was OCP or Omni-Consumer Products, the company that had entered into the contract to fund and run the Police Force in Detroit. Who can forget that wonderful scene where the malfunctioning ED-209 shoots one of the staff and the Chairman turns to the CEO and says - I'm very disappointed....making clear all he's worried about is the extra money it'll cost because of the delay. \n\nIt was against this that I was very concerned when I heard about the remake. However the trailers looked promising so I was prepared to give the film a chance. However, my original feelings were well justified. The film is a bit of a mess. \n\nThe story deviates slightly from the original. In this film OCP makes military robots, keeping the peace overseas. However not in the US where such robots are banned. OCP comes up with an idea of introducing a cyborg - half man, half machine as a sort of police officer that never sleeps or gets tired. When officer Alex Murphy is badly injured in a car bomb - it's not immediately clear why - he's selected for the programme and proceeds to single-handedly clear up crime. However, when he discovers corruption within OCP, he struggles between his desire to do right and those who wish to control him. \n\nHad this film been called, Police Cyborg or something else it would have been an ok film. However, because it's called Robocop you have no choice but to compare it to the original. And it fails on all counts to be a better film so why bother re-making it? \n\nI'll give you an example - in this film, Alex is only badly injured but not killed. But in the original, he's killed. So in the original, they turn him into a Robot. He looks like a robot, thinks like a robot and acts like a robot. But in the remake he's a guy in an improved suit. \n\nThe plot in the remake is hard to follow, the story jumps about like a rabbit in a nettle patch, the dialogue is poor, the main character is wooden - the only decent thing is Samuel L Jackson as a TV announcer but even that is rotten compared to the original's news show - and the ending is so bad you'd only feel more cheated if they'd actually stopped the film half way through and told you to leave. \n\nAll in all one of the worst films I've seen for a while. If you want a decent Robocop film watch the original. Hell even watch Robocop 3......",

            "content": "I don't know if it's cooler that we have a Swedish RoboCop now, or that their turning Inspector Steven Holder into a cyborg in what is essentially \"The Killing\" fan service. Mind you, this film also sees Jos\u00e9 Padilha going sci-fi with his police dramas in what is essentially \"Elite Squad\" fan service, but AMC sells to ignorant Americans more easily than Brazilian crime movies set outside of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. Just wait, people, because if this reboot for the \"RoboCop\" franchise has a sequel that picks up the drug themes of the original \"RoboCop 2\", we may be getting a cyborg Walter White, and it would be awesome, and AMC fans everywhere would have their minds blown as though they were in \"The Walking Dead\", although that's not likely to happen, as these filmmakers aren't quite that passionate about fulfilling fan dreams. Yeah, I'd imagine people are less interested in Joel Kinnaman, and much more interested in Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton being onscreen together, but alas, Inspector Gordon is not the one being turned into RoboCop, let alone joining forces with classic Batman and, for that matter, Rorschach (People need to stop sticking Jackie Earle Haley in inconsequential supporting roles) to take on crime. ...Man, honestly, I'm glad they're not going that route, because the idea of remaking \"RoboCop\" in the first place is kind of silly, although they might just be making a cleaner and more marketable answer to \"Dredd\" with this film, you know, because the PG-13 rating really worked out for the \"RoboCop\" franchise back in 1993. Nevertheless, everyone's favorite boy in blue is back in black... for some reason (The effects and suits were probably built blue, but once they put it on a Swede, they automatically turned into [u]black metal[/u]; ha-ha-ha), and in Canada, which is bogus, because Detroit could have used some principal photography money, seeing as how it went bankrupt way sooner than \"RoboCop 2\" predicted. The future is fast approaching, and once it's here, we're probably going to have an even more updated \"RoboCop\", but until then, we're going to have to settle for this... if you want to say that you're \"settling\" for this film, something that I wouldn't do, being that I'm one of the few jerks on the planet who thinks that this film is good, and am therefore the only jerk on the planet who thinks that this is way better than the original, which isn't to say that I don't have some complaints.\r\n\r\nI have to warn y'all now that throughout this review, I will be going on and on about how this film is startlingly different from the original, in that it is much more dramatic, something that I am very much on board with, at least until the thoughtfulness softens momentum to the point of a hint of dullness, perhaps upon lapses in material to draw upon. Actually, the issue may be too much dramatic material to soak up, because even though there is plenty of fluff and keep pacing fair, the storytelling has a tendency to get so caught up in exposition that it loses a sense of conflict, and even the sense of fun that the predecessors - not even \"RoboCop 3\", in this controversial critics' opinion - very rarely lost. There's not even that much action in this film, and although that's for the sake of making room for a heart that, to me, carries the final product a long way, the thoughtfulness defuses a lot of momentum when the begins to fail at organically bonding with all of the fluff whose presence is still prominent enough to sometimes overtake the narrative. Although the final product is rewarding on the whole, there are times where it's neither flashy enough to deliver as a fun blockbuster nor rich enough to be resonant, lazily falling into borderline superficial fluff tropes that are reflected in the occasional piece of forced humor, and some questionably trite dialogue which exacerbates a sense of familiarity. I think that this film does a lot of things more right than its source material, and yet, even though the original \"RoboCop\" hit some conventions as a very '80s action fluff piece, it was unique with a premise, and although I can crack a few jokes about how this film even rips off that premise, - due to its being a totally different film outside of its retaining a few mythology aspects from the original - this, at least for a modern action film, is more derivative, hitting enough expected beats along a formulaic path to feel rather predictable. Now, as an installment in the \"RoboCop\" franchise, this film does anything but the expected, and yet, by its own right, it fails to escape formula, and that's a shame, as there's so much inspiration, challenged enough by pacing issues, conventions and other lazy attributes to threaten the final product's reward value. The usual blockbuster of this film's basic nature would let things go and succumb to natural shortcomings as an inconsequential fluff piece, but this film has the guts to transcend the call of duty, even when it comes to certain aesthetic aspects.\r\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack automatically gets a few points from my prog-rocking self for crowbarring in Focus' \"Hocus Pocus\" at one point, but in terms of the original soundtrack, when well-regarded Jose Padilha collaborater Pedro Bromfman's score abates, if not dissipates, the film resorts to a thoughtfulness that it sometimes dull, and when it comes into play, it's rarely anything new, and yet, its sophisticated, Hans Zimmer-esque neo-classical sensibilities range from tastefully subdued to grand, just as fellow \"Elite Squad\" saga veteran Lula Carvalho's stunningly well-defined cinematography offers enough sweep for you to embrace most every attribute of this blockbuster's technical proficiency. I can praise the substance of this film plenty, but when it comes to the style, there's no arguing that this film takes full advantage of its having a much greater technical potential to its dated predecessor, delivering on seamless, flashy effects that range from subtle to distinguished, and therefore tremendously complimentary in the selling of a unique sci-fi world. If nothing else, this film's story concept offers a steeper sci-fi mythology, and it's a lot of fun to dissect this intelligent portrayal of a futuristic world, but more distinguished from the original story concept is, of course, the tone, because where the original was a relatively straight forward, rather satirical action flick, this film, as, if you will a \"Dark Knight\" answer to the \"RoboCop\" franchise, proves to be one of the bigger surprises in commercial filmmaking in quite some time by being a much more dramatically charged portrait, not on some experimental, pseudo-humanized robot that was built to uphold the law, but on a man coming to terms with his dehumanization, and seeking justice for the public and himself, so much so that it even has the guts to change the iconic Alex Murphy from a cyborg, - a robot enhanced with human feature - to a full-blown android, a human enhanced, though not fully defined by robotics. There is a lot of potential for both spectacle and depth to do justice, and promising newcomer Joshua Zetumer delivers through a script that does not offer the originals' wit and originality, and has its excesses, but keeps things lively through highlights in clever dialogue and tight set piece crafting, while finding enough realization to the more thoughtful aspects of exposition to provide a sense of nuance and believability to most every, perfectly well-motivated character, who do not feel like fluffy types, and are further brought to life by solid performances. Naturally, a lot of the human aspects of this film must thrive on an effective cast, and sure enough, just about every member of this star-studded roster of acting talents does his or her part pretty well, particularly Gary Oldman as a well-intentioned scientist who hopes to do right by society and a man's life, and leading man Joel Kinnaman as a man of honor and justice who faces many mental, physical and emotional trials as he accepts his fate as an experiment, and seeks closure. Kinnaman is powerful at times, and he and his peers help in defining the meat of this film, but the performance which can truly bring life to this action-drama is that of director Jose Padilha, who could have cut through all of the intelligent scripting and inspired acting and still conformed to inconsequentially fluffy blockbuster sensibilities, but sees the potential of this film, and does what he can to fulfill it, orchestrating style well enough to keep entertainment value recurrent, - particularly in the heat of thrilling action - while adopting a subtlety and grace that, despite its inspiring atmospheric bland spells, most sells the heart of the film, to where I found myself not simply entertained, but engrossed, something that I never was in any of the more fluffy predecessors, including the original which most everyone seems superior, ostensibly mostly out of nostalgia. It's a controversial boast, I know, but I really do stand by the opinion that this film fulfills its ambitions enough to be substantially superior to the original, because even though this reboot to the \"RoboCop\" saga's tonal distinction from the originals is even more substantial, I find this unexpectedly and effectively realized exploration of this subject matter's substance through all of the style to be more richly rewarding, with enough resonance to meet good old-fashioned action flare, and make an uncommonly compelling blockbuster that ought to be one of the bigger surprises in film this year.\r\n\r\nOverall, bland spells in directorial thoughtfulness help in retarding a sense of momentum which is hindered enough by aimless dragging, while trite occasions in writing reflect a certain conventionalism to the storytelling which in turn reflects a certain laziness that threatens engagement value, firmly secured by lovely score work and cinematography, fantastic visual effects, and an unexpectedly dramatically charged story concept which is done enough justice by intelligent and nuanced writing, convincing and effective acting, and flashy, when not gracefully compelling direction to make Jose Padilha's \"RoboCop\", not simply a rich twist on a classically fluffy mythology, but rewarding as both sci-fi spectacle and human drama.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

His disregard for everything Hollywood was his secret weapon. He knew exactly what audiences wanted; they wanted violence, sex and they wanted to be involved in the characters. He had no agenda up his sleeve and he never wasted a single second with a useless conversation, only good ones. The reboot Robo DOES have an agenda, wastes countless minutes with useless conversation and lecture, and took for granted the reason why the 80s Robo was a hit in the first place; it dripped with inappropriateness.\n\nThe reboot of \"Robocop\", directed by Jose Padiha, has its qualities and it has its problems. The 1987 \"Robocop\" was missing two things in my opinion: technology and a connection between Alex Murphy aka Robocop and his wife and child. The reboot \"Robo\" brings both of those in spades, although absent is Verhoeven's fun. In place of the 80s no-holes barred delivery was an agenda that couldn't be made clearer than having Samuel L. Jackson angrily speaking it to you. In place of the original movies fun was an overabundance of politics and relentless talk about the business end of Robocop/Omnicorp. Exactly what people these days don't want to have in their movies.\n\n\"Robo\" 2014 is similar to the \"Iron Man\" movies in my opinion and not because of the metal suit, but because what you get is a whole lot of talk and a few short scenes of Robo being Robo. When the action is going, it is well done. Robo is actually very cool and the upgrade in technology is commendable but upgrades in technology mean nothing if the story isn't engrossing. Take the original for example; the technology was weak. The Ed-209 robot was nearly laughable; yet we didn't care, the story had us.\n\nI was pleased to see them bring the heart and soul of Alex Murphy to light by integrating his wife and child into the storyline, but this was almost overdone as well. \"Robocop\" 2014 isn't a total loss, but the last thing I wanted to do was sit through a Omnicorp sales and management meeting, but that is almost exactly what the movie feels like. What a horrible miscalculation to take a movie that was offensive, inappropriate, carefree and spirited and reboot it into a 2-hour OMNICORP sales pitch meeting.... cause that's what fans of Robocop wanted. NOPE. Even tried to watch it again and didn't feel like being sympathetic to suicide bombers or be lectured out. Hit Eject... watch something else.",

Michael Keaton's performance is pretty good for a cynical, money-comes-first and slick CEO of powerful Omnicorp. I'm not sure about Samuel Jackson's character, though (I kept being reminded of his CapitalOne card commercials). Joel Kinnaman serves up a pretty tight performance; my favorite scene is at the beginning, when Dr. Norton (Oldman) reveals the extensive cyber reparations that had to be done.

However th e family story misses the mark. As does the brainwashing. Oldman is always good, as in Jackson, Keating to a lesser extent. All of whom a are on the dialing this performance in end of their thespian skills. \nAll in all a fine check the brain movie that won't raise the pulse beyond 60 bps,  but can't help thinking why reboot a cult hit for the masses - go grimey or go home.",

Which, from other reviews, I thought would make me like it a little more. But it didn't, I really did not like this movie. My biggest complaint is the writing, the writing is bad. The dialogue is laughable in a lot of moments. The movie tries to be smart; it tries to say something about our society. It tries to talk about the wars that were going on, and are still currently happening. But, the movie fails to execute any of the ideas it had. These are some great ideas, and would have made a better movie, if there were better writers involved. The directing is fine; I think Jos\u00e9 Padilha did an okay job directing the action sequences. The acting is fine; Joel Kinnaman does what he can with the material. Michael Keaton has a fun time playing in this role. It's fun watching him play this part, but he thinks the dialogue is dumb as well and he does not try to make it serious or dramatic. Michael Keaton was the best part of the entire movie, to be honest. Let's talk more about the writing, it's bad. It tries to make you care about the family, what they are going through, and fighting about whether or not turning Alex Murphy into a robot was a good idea. I didn't care about the family; to me they were just blank faces citing pieces of dialogue to move the plot further. This movie thinks the audience is dumb, and they are smarter than the audience and needs to explain what is going on. They do this by showing Samuel L. Jackson talk about the events. This just adds unnecessary time to movie, which feels longer than what it really is. I wanted the movie to end quicker; by the end I was bored. The movie was mildly entertaining me the whole time, but when it was about to wrap up, it just would not go any faster. If you're asking why I have not mentioned Gary Oldman in the review, it's because he is underutilized. They could have gotten anyone to play his part. But, I was entertained by the movie. I was intrigued by the story sometimes. Mild spoiler here, when Alex Murphy is solving his own \"murder\" that was really entertaining, spoilers over. I was entertained, the action was okay. I would not say that you would have to see this right away, but if you do see it, you won't regret it.",

It was very enjoyable for me, however seemed to do little more than bore her.   This would have been great as a 'prequel' as it goes more in depth and slightly changes the original story.  Hopefully they'll tempt at a second movie and bring about more action and more of the story line as OCP takes over the police dept.  All in all for those who saw the originals; awesome job.  However to look at it as a person new to RoboCop; horribly explained, very slow and quite boring.  This really could have been done better to entice both types of audiences.",

Hi-tech computer simulations, heavy artillery, and realistic robots have rebooted this film series into the twenty-first century.  When \"Robocop\" first came out in 1987, it was definitely ahead of its time.  The story was innovative, the violence pushed the boundaries of acceptability, but the technology led to some awkward stop-motion and a man in a metallic suit.  27 years later, CGI has allowed Jos\u00e9 Padilha to show detective Alex Murphy in his inhuman form (just a head and a hand) and the necessity of the Robocop transformation.  The heads up display inside of his helmet and computer technology used by OmniCorp to control and track him also transport us into the near-future setting of \"this could exist in 15 years, but not yet.\"   This franchise was always pretty dark.  The Detroit crime scene is very unpleasant and it was time for this film to join the recent \"dark\" reboots of Batman, Spiderman, and Star Trek.  The casting crew did a really great job by bringing in Gary Oldman as the morally conflicted doctor, Michael Keaton as the villain, and Samuel L. Jackson as the political tv host representative of the media's uncanny influence on politics.  Joel Kinnaman was the perfect choice for Alex Murphy, providing a massive body to fill the suit and an ability to transition between emotional duress and non-emotion.  This film masquerades as a cool action film but actually raises some tough moral questions about medical technology, the media, and arms company ethics.  A lot of people argue that something was lost in translation between the original and this reboot, but once you've seen this modern update of \"Robocop\" it will be difficult to go back to the original.",

Dealing with issues of a person's humanity and automated security, the film is rather provocative.

I have never seen the original but just the name of the character Robocop sounds fascinating. So basically you've got detective Alex Murphy who is this honest cop in this normal cliche area that doesn't like honest cops for some reason.What grinds my gutters the most is when scifi films like this use to have atmosphere and other-worldly sense to them,none of this now tiring and annoying trend of realism. Realism isn't a bad thing but when your reintroducing a nostalgic icon like Robocop,batman,or even the freaking ninja turtles you have to step up your game and get creative with the worlds they inhabit. Cause I do not want to see a character named Robocop in freaking suburbia! This is not atmosphere,this is not an environment people see Robocop inhabit,this is pure laziness! This is lame,this is a freaking Joke! Have some dang passion!\nAnyway being the honest cop that he is Alex Murphy is blown by a car bomb. But lucky for him Dr.Norton and Raymond Sellars are developing a procedure that could potentially save his life.Later Alex Murphy becomes Robocop and after fourty five minutes actually starts to do things relevant the plot.\nNow let's talk about the good even though there isn't much. Joel KIllnman is a stellar choice for Robocop, Keaton is incredible good in some scenes but in others he can become incredibly generic because the script really doesn't know what to do with him half the time.Gary Oldman does a good job as playing Dr.Norton who creates the Robocop suit to bring Murphy back from the dead and the scnes with him Killnman and Keaton he has chemistry betwen them drawing the line between him being a protagonist or antagonist even though you can already guess he's going to be a protagonist, which takes away the mystery. And the pacing feels a little nice.\nNow let's get on the bad side,I did like the idea of his family being in the movie but they come as plot devices instead of characters.It was like they said hey let's add a family for this character so we can act like we have an emotional attachment to this character when in reality we have no idea what were going to do with them.They weren't bad they were just really cheap.The action scenes are completely hit and miss,this film has action scenes are action scenes that bring nothing new to the table,it's every generic action scene you have seen a million times before. Nothing of it stands out. For example there is a scene that is completely shot in the dark so we can't see a dang thing. Kind of like that scene in Alone in the dark where the monsters are coming to attack and everyone comes in shooting in the dark and we can't tell what there shooting at. It could have worked for this film but just doesn't if you factor in that Murphy's suit is entirely black!\nI don't hate this movie but I don't like it that much either and trust me you won't either.It has a decent pace,good performances and some entertaining although unimaginative action scenes. I'm giving this new Robocop a two and a half out of five.",

            "content": "RoboCop is yet another remake of an 80s film that I'm pretty sure no one asked for. The film follows Alex Murphy, a cop for the Detroit Police Force who has recently been severely injured following an attempted murder. To keep him alive, the people at Omnicorp turn him into RoboCop, a crime fighting machine that keeps track of all criminal records and brings criminals to justice in a more efficient way. However, after a glitch while updating criminal records into Alex's hard drive, all of his memories have been erased and is now only a mindless drone with absolutely no feeling. I have never seen the original RoboCop film, but from what I've heard, it's a brilliant piece of satirical cinema. Having nothing to go on, I had no choice but to view this film as its own attempt. Man, what a let down. It has such a silly little premise (seriously, a cop becomes a robot and fights crime) and drags it down to a more serious level, which is the last thing a film like this needed. The end result makes for an incredibly dull and confusing two hours. Where the film mostly falls apart is the script. For the most part, I've seen everything that this film had to offer in other films. It's nothing special and is certainly something that I won't remember in the future. This made the first hour very hard to bear because of its cliched and contrived storyline. I will admit that when Murphy's memory is wiped for the first time, the film picked up the pace a bit. I loved how RoboCop was able to pick out criminals in this film, which made him slightly interesting. Of course, the script was immediately dragged back down to its cliched roots, making the rest of the film groan-worthy. My biggest issue with the film, however, was that there was barely a conflict or antagonist. The story is too convoluted for a stand-out villain to show his or her face. Questions were popping up everywhere concerning the motive of some of these attempted antagonists and it infuriated me. The only credit that I can really give RoboCop is that it has some interesting and fun action sequences throughout. However, just because there are some fun moments through the film doesn't make it something worth watching. All the fun moments are overshadowed by this remake's attempt at bringing something silly from the 80s into the dark and gritty 21st century. Don't waste your time on RoboCop, whether you're a fan of the original, are not a fan, or haven't seen it at all. RoboCop is just bland and boring from start to finish.",

            "content": "This is a remake that manages to distance itself fairly far from its original.  The foundations and ideas are strikingly different and its attempts to try and weave the two films together is where it fails the most.  I honestly began to enjoy this new take on Robocop for a majority of the film.  It was interesting, intimate, and character driven.  Once you wrap your head around the fact that Padiha was making a much more somber and quiet piece, you can sit back and watch some visually stunning camera work, special effects, and some decent, if not uneven acting.  \r\n\r\nIts here that the film succeeds.  At least to me it did.  However, the great feet was to try and not only find a new tone and focus for the film (which they did) but to keep it from paying too much homage to the original.  If you are trying to wink at the camera and break the 4th wall as if to say, \"Hey remember this from the original Robocop\" then make a film that clearly represents that stylistic choice.  But this film falls flat on itself when it reaches new heights and breaks some new ground only to obligatory have some one speak the line \"I'll buy that for a dollar\".  It just takes you right out of the movie and pulls the investment you had for it right out from under you.  \r\n\r\nThis is not to say its a bad movie.  I don't think its bad at all.  In fact, one could argue that the director's intentions were so good in trying to refocus the source material that it actually connected better with people than any of the sequels to the original ever could.  Choosing to focus the story more on Alex Murphy's transformation into what would become Robocop was a cool idea.  And for the most part it works.  Gary Oldman is rock solid as Dr. Norton, the scientist who comes up with the program that can take a man and make him mostly machine.  Here is something we did not see from the original.  The actual scientists who not only came up with the technology to do this, but who struggle with their humanity in the process.  \r\n\r\nJoel Kinnaman is ok as Alex Murphy, but get's better as the film progresses.  He shows some good emotional depth in scenes where he has to face his family as merely a cyborg and its heartbreaking in a way.  Its these moments that I was really invested in the story.  We see an Alex Murphy who is not dead after his accident and knows what is happening to him while it is happening.  The original was vastly different in this sense.  It simply killed Murphy and allowed the executives to control the situation only awaking him once he was a machine.  \r\n\r\nThis take really shows you how terrifying it might feel to wake up realize that you body is no longer there.  That most of you is kept together with machine parts.  These scenes Joel Kinnaman handle really well.  There's a scene in particular that is rarely cringe inducing and really cool.  The training scenes are also well done and a lot of fun to watch.  Jackie Earl Haley is terrific as usual as sort of the snotty military guy who doesn't trust a human in a robot suit.  \r\n\r\nI guess the biggest issues this movie has is its just not quite sure what to be.  Its part Popcorn blockbuster fun, part character piece, and part social parody (but not as much as it thinks it is).  One minute you are watching Robocop fight a room full of ED-209s and the next minute the scope shrinks and you're watching Rocobop having a sociological conversation about the dehumanization he is experiencing with the man responsible (played by the always awesome Michael Keaton as the Dick Jones character)  Its hard to get a make on exactly what you are getting out of it and when its over and \"I fought the law, and the law won\" begins to play, it almost seems like you just watched a small independent film about police brutality.  \r\n\r\nA lot of this can be forgiven at least long enough to get through the movie.  Its better than expected.  It has some genuine moments.  I respect it for trying to be so different, even if at the risk of feeling like a couple different movies at once.  Samual L. Jackson's role is completely shoehorned in and feels like the character was written to give the film some connection with the social commentary elements of the original, but it simply doesn't work and Jackson is just utterly annoying.  Another major problem is the lack of a strong villain.  if its just Michae keaton's character, that doesn't really work.  They gloss over so quickly the actual crime that got him nearly incinerated in the first place that it seems like an after thought when he finally decides to investigate and that villain is never really realized.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty good effort and the film, despite its obvious problems, I would have to say was a minor success.  Visually it was amazing.  The story telling was new and creative.  Gary Oldman was the highlight for me and really took the material seriously.  There was literally no need to turn the suit black though.  The redesign they gave it originally was great.  There was no need to go black.",

            "content": "When I first saw all the hoopla about Robocop's costume on the internet, I was of the thought that this the most egregious example of \"First world problems\".  You know problems that others, less privileged countries, wouldn't even think about.  I attributed it to fans of the original Robocop, a movie I'm a big fan of, being upset that there was a remake and choosing to hate it without really seeing it action.  Well, having seen it in action, I kinda agree that it is a crappy costume.  First things first, while the movement is definitely very machine-like, the costume doesn't really look like it's a robot.  It just looks like a costume that Batman would wear.  It just looks like armor for combat, it doesn't really feel like it's a machine.  Tying it back to the Batman thing, there's this new game in the series coming out called Arkham Knight and one of the villains, the Arkham Knight himself, wears, at least on his torso, an armor that looks a lot like Robocop's new 'costume'.  They originally gave him a traditional costume, that paid tribute to the original film, but it was decided that it was simply much too slow when put into combat situations.  They upgraded to a sleeker, less heavy armor to give him the agility and speed necessary to keep up with the ED-208s to justify putting him out there.  There'd be no point to putting him out there if he was slower than the other models.  The problem comes in that the new suit is simply just a way to make the action scenes a little more exciting.  Because, for practicality, a robot doesn't get tired.  A robot doesn't need to stop and rest, so what's the point of making him more agile?  If the point was to make his reaction time quicker, then an upgrade to his software was all that was needed.  You didn't need to redesign the whole thing, really you did to separate yourself from the original film, but it was done for obvious reasons.  It was done to speed the action up, make things a little easier to watch for the ADD age.  People don't like giant, lumbering monsters.  Look at Godzilla.  I digress, the costume sucked and it was changed for all the wrong reasons.  I digress, on to the actual review.  Look, I was as skeptical as everyone else was, this might be one of the most recent remakes with the most backlash going into it.  From the costume to playing it safe with the PG-13 rating, something I'll get to later, it just seemed like this film couldn't get positive word of mouth even if they had found the cure for cancer.  Just all around negative.  Well, surprise, surprise.  This film isn't nearly as bad as anyone had expected it to be.  That's as backhanded a compliment as you can give out, but it's genuinely not a bad movie.  That is if you look at it as popcorn entertainment, which I did.  I knew there was no point in comparing it to the original because they came right out and said that they were gonna shoot for a PG-13 rating.  I'm sure if it was REALLY up to the filmmakers, they'd have wanted an R-rating, but the studio wanted to play it safe with the remake.  They wanted the most eyes to see their movie.  The only way to do that is to make sure that absolutely everyone can see it is to tone the violence down, don't show any entry points, or blood coming out, when people are shot, don't curse, don't have sex, don't use drugs.  I definitely do think that the film needed that ultraviolent edge that the original had.  The violence is absolutely essential to the satirical tone of the film.  This one completely plays it safe.  I suppose I GET it, I get the reasoning behind playing it safe.  But, because of that, and other factors such as the way the movie is presented as mindless, soulless entertainment, make this movie absolutely PALE in comparison to the original.  Now you may say, 'but Jesse, this movie has some pretty stinging social commentary on the media, politics, and corruption'.  And I say that this is filler disguised as depth.  I'm not gonna pull any punches.  Perhaps it's because they lay it on thicker than Christina Hendricks' ass but this satire about the media and politics did absolutely NOTHING for me.  It's just way too obvious with how it does it, there's no subtlety.  I think that's the point of satire, to throw people off when they start thinking about it.  When you're doing it so openly and so obviously, then it just loses its effect.  I have give props to them because they genuinely tried to give this film an underlying current of satire, but I think it backfires.  It eventually becomes a parody of itself with how hard it tries.  Another point of criticism is the lack of violence.  And this is one that I wholeheartedly agree with.  The film is rated PG-13 only, and I really do mean only, because they don't show any entry wounds when a bullet hits, or blood squirting out, whether with squibs or CG.  But, the fact of the matter is that this movie is incredibly violent.  There's this one really cool scene in Vallon's hideout, the lights are shut off and the only light you see are from when the bullets are fired, or from Robocop's thermal view.  Robocop kills so many fucking dudes in this scene that I literally lost count.  He kills many more people in the film than that, but he kills the most in this scene.  This movie is rated PG-13 in spite of its rampant violence, yet something like J. Edgar, a movie I did not see but I hear about the rating being fucked, getting an R-rating for one instance where someone says fuck.  I mean seriously?  That's the big studios paying off the MPAA for more favorable ratings if you ask me.  So there's a bit of an inconsistency in terms of the violence, you see.  The film is very violent, it's just not bloody.  It's like the bad guys are balloons and when they're popped nothing comes out.  I genuinely think the film had to be bloodier, don't shy away from that.  You can still tell an effective story, though this remake didn't, while being brutally violent at the same time.  The cast is good, can't really complain there.  Characters may be a bit one-dimensional, but the actors themselves do a perfectly good job at giving the illusion of depth.  So props to them.  The action is decent, if a little bit numbing by the end.  There definitely should've been less of it, but what was there definitely needed to be more violent.  That's just my thought.  Like I said, the cast is good but there's no real stand-out as far as highlights go.  Jay Baruchel has the funniest line in the film, no surprise there, but his character was certainly lacking a little color.  All the characters were lacking color.  Only genuinely interesting ones are, probably, the most central to the story.  That is Alex, Dennett, and Sellars.  I did like how Alex wasn't really the end result for Sellars.  He was just a means to an end to get what he wanted, and that is the government to spend more money on his technology.  So Alex is just a puppet, he's for show.  He's not the endgame, and I genuinely liked that approach to the story.  How the manipulated Murphy, by lowering his endorphin levels, so he wouldn't get as emotionally attached in his cases, was a good idea but it, ultimately, goes nowhere.  Murphy is back to normal sooner rather than later.  I guess it serves a purpose in saying that the human soul, even if there is very little of it left, won't ever die.  As corny and cheesy as that sounds, that's where they were going with this.  It's more subtle than the rest of the film, but it's corny as shit.  I think I've gone on long enough with this review, a decent popcorn rental at best, but it really doesn't offer anything that is improved upon from the original.  It doesn't really offer anything better than a lot of summer films.  Decent, mindless entertainment.  Don't be fooled by its attempts at depth through its political/media satire, it's just the illusion of one.",

            "content": "Robocop. One of the most defining satirical films of all time, taking on not just crime but the topics of capitalism, privatisation and political corruption. It is considered by some to be Paul Verhoeven's Maste-\n\n\nOh... we're reviewing the 2014 version?\nRight. Scratch that.\n\nSo Robocop. Essentially a remake of the 1987 classic it offers very little of the satirical charm and caricature that the original brings to the screen. It can't seem to decide if it is even meant to be a satirical film at all and, Samuel L Jackson's minor role notwithstanding, really doesn't delve into the political ironies which are prevalent throughout Verhoeven's.\n\nThe film can't seem to decide if it intends to paint the American population as incredibly sensible and cautious or just simply stupidly ignorant. It really irks me how quickly they made the issue solely focused on America with the comment that all the other Nations around the World are using these machines but then never actually go into any further depth about it. I don't know about you but that's quite an important piece of information right there and leaves us with so many potential questions.\n\nSo the Americans aren't happy with robots being on the street, but every other Nation is? Do they know something the American's don't about the machines or did they just not care what their populations thought? Are the robots in these countries walking around like they were in Bahrain at the beginning of the film, freely inspecting and scanning members of the public? Do the other countries just not care about basic human rights and freedoms all of a sudden?\n\nOr have the other countries done their research and made sure that the machines are utilised and controlled in a proper and sufficient manner?\n\nEither way the Americans come off looking like they're either the stupidest people or, alternatively, the only sensible people left in the entire world. It just doesn't make for a believeable framework for the film to start on.\n\nAside from Alex Murphy, played by Joel Kinnaman, who is I must admit a tad more likeable than I initially gave him credit for upon my first viewing of the film the only character you get the time to feel any connection with is Gary Oldman's Dr Dennett Norton who seems to flick back and forth between a likeable Doctor who cares about Alex Murphy and a somewhat horrificly nasty employee of company OmniCorp (yep, let's totally mess with his brain to make him a mindless zombie to impress the news crews. That's totally ethical.)\n\nThe problem that the film has is that it doesn't sufficiently blend the mechanical and organic layers of the film which results in you really not giving a damn about any of the characters at all and even the attempt at giving Alex Murphy a more human connection in his wife and child falls on deaf ears as they just don't do enough to give the film, or Robocop, a sense of humanity.\n\nFollowing on from the 1987 R rated Robocop the action too feels rather flat; the violence and outright savagery that you experience in the original film mesh very nicely with the dystopian, corrupt feel that the film overall portrays and, whilst the 2014 film doesn't portray the world at quite the same level of collapse as the original the action sequences are so very tame in comparison it almost makes you feel that, quite honestly, there isn't any need for a robocop. Sure there's corruption and gangs, but there always has been, there always will be. They're not running the streets, killing with impunity in the middle of the daylight, or at least, not that we're shown. I get that the idea in the film is for Robocop to be the prototype for getting military and robotic forces on the streets in America but really... Why? What would they do? I can't see the market for however-many billions of dollars a year that they suggest is a realistic estimate.\n\nThe whole film just feels like a confused, convoluted mess of ideas and attempts to half-heartedly ring back to the 1987 original whilst bringing a sense of newness and innovation but really it just doesn't come together quite how they intended it to.",

Influential news pundit Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) stirs the debate between the CEO of OmniCorp (M. Keaton) who wants to sell their products for use in civilian law enforcement in the United States but is suppressed by public opinion, as embodied by the Dreyfus Act promoted by Senator Dreyfus. My belief is that robots are faster, and lacking feelings and emotions makes them perfect to enforce the law. Senator Dreyfus does not trust them and believes machines must have emotions to know right from wrong. After officer Murphy (J. Kinnaman) suffers a horrible accident, he becomes the perfect patient to become Robocop. Personally I believe a police force consisting of robot enforcers is great because crime will be reduced drastically (as shown in the film) and less humans will die in the line of duty. Its a win-win situation. Interesting viewpoints shown on this film directed by Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Padilha. I find this sequel better than the predecessor and highly recommend it in Blu-ray!",

Let's start with the main character Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnamon.  Joel brings a lot more emotion to the role there is a depth to it that feels genuine.  the acting is very good. He maintains a human element even after becoming mostly robot.  Secondly you have to notice the fine work of Gary Oldman, he brings genuine humanity to the film.  The villains are purposely under-written. The special effects are well rendered.  The pacing is good and the music is generic for this type of film.  The cinematography is excellent.  As for the plot I won't bore you with the details, if you've seen the previous Robocop film then you'll know what to expect, even as there are many changes to it.  rated PG-13 for language and extreme gun violence.

Yes, the black armor is horrendous.  He motorcycle looks stupid.  The intro sequence in Tehran is...a bit confusing.  Also, the problem with pairing an actor like Joel Kinnaman in his first real leading role alongside veterans like Gary Oldman, Jackie Earle Hayley, Samuel L.

            "content": "It's the year 2028 in futuristic Detroit. Advanced Robot technology is spearheaded by a massive corporation: OmniCorp. Their drones are utilized heavily overseas by law enforcement, but the market is becoming saturated. In order to grow the company and please shareholders, the only option remaining is to utilize their robots at home. But their efforts are met with heavy resistance, as politicians and the American people struggle to accept the idea of robots enforcing the law without any human reasoning. An OmniCorp scientist (Gary Oldman) is left at a standstill; how do you put a man inside a machine? When police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnamon) suffers a horrific accident, it provides OmniCorp with an unprecedented opportunity.\n\nWhat am I missing here? This was panned by the critics, yet to my surprise I enjoyed it. I haven't seen the original RoboCop in some time, so I went in without any biases or expectations; I viewed this as it's own film and didn't compare it to the original. I thought it had a great balance of action, great special effects, meaningful drama and believable characters that made it resonate. Joel Kinnamon (Alex Murphy), Gary Oldman (Dr. Denneth Norton), Michael Keaton (Raymond Sellars) and Abbie Cornish (Clara Murphy) all put in some very good performances; the cast was very strong and they made the film better than it probably should have been. \n\nThe film takes some time to add some depth to Alex Murphy; his conflict between duty and his family was palpable and effective. The re-imagined soundtrack was very impressive and there were some interesting social commentary on the lengths we're willing to go for security (as did the original film). It's not perfect however. Samuel Jackson's pro-gun Pat Novak was just way over the top and it did have a few plot holes (the script could've also been a bit better). Some things also didn't quite make any sense; even in this futuristic world, the parts of Alex Murphy's body that they were able to be salvaged and reused seemed a bit implausible (to say the least). Having said that, watch it with reasonable expectations and I think you'll enjoy this quite a bit. I thought this was a pretty good reboot and worth watching. I definitely saw enough to be interested in the new franchise going forward.",

It is highly political and I found myself saying \"that's bullshit\" at least once.\nNow compared to the original...it takes a whole new story to it but keeps the political statements and looses the dark humor and gore. Which in itself the last two kinda made the original great. I sensed if Hollywood didn't tip toe around money and what rating makes them the most of it, they would have done this right.

            "content": "The \"Robocop\" remake lacks originality. While this Robo-remake was slightly better than most remakes it still lacked something that only the original had.    \n\nEvery so often Hollywood gets the bright idea to remake classic or original films that should be left alone. Now, don't get me wrong, there have been some remakes in the past that have made a significant improvement from the original. Remakes like: The Fly (1986), 3:10 to Yuma (2007), King Kong (2005), Scarface (1983), Cape Fear (1991) and Oceans Eleven (2001) all stood out from the original. But when there are good remakes, there come bad ones as well. Remakes like: Clash of the Titans (2010), Conan the Barbarian (2011), The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), Halloween (2007), The Invasion (2007), Planet of the Apes (2001) and Psycho (1998) all were awful remakes and films in general. Back to my point, while Jose Padilha's (Elite Squad) Robo-remake was much better than any of these bad remakes in my opinion, it still did not make a significant improvement over Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original. \n\nThe original Robocop was no masterpiece by any means, but it still had that special something from the '80s. Verhoeven packed in themes of gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, capitalism, revenge, dystopia and ultra-violence. These aspects are what made that film so unique from that time period. The year is 2028, and OmniCorp is at the center of their \"robot soldier\" technology, when Alex Murphy, (Joel Kinnaman) - a good father and cop in the corrupted Detroit - is critically injured in a car bomb. OmniCorp makes their golden opportunity to create their Robocop, turning Murphy into part man, and mostly part machine. Kinnaman did an OK  job as Robocop, but I preferred Peter Weller's performance from the original. Director Padilha lacked Verhoeven's craft and critical/comical satire in the film. The next flaw was the PG-13 rating. This of course was made to boost ticket sales for younger audiences, but the ultra-violence is what made the original stand out. The ultra-violence was a major factor for the original because Verhoeven used it to satire the American culture. \n\nWhile the special effects were a huge improvement from the original, it still should not be the biggest factor for a film. One noble performance from the film that I should point out was Gary Oldman. He plays scientist Dr. Dennett Norton and does a superb job. Oldman has always been an actor I have admired, so if you do go see this film, go see it for his performance alone. Another thing this film did a decent job on was focusing more on Murphy's family relationship after he turns into Robocop. Sadly, half way through the film the ending became predictable and was totally bland from there on. \n\nOverall, this Robocop had some entertaining aspects (special effects and Oldman's performance), but it also contained negative feedback for the lack of direction, absence of Peter Weller, lack of ultra-violence, the predictable ending and the lack of making it stand out from the original.",

I really wasn't that impressed with this reboot, and the Paul Walker lookalike who plays the lead was a bad choice. This Robocop didn't even move like a robot, and for someone who has a new brain, he certainly remembered a lot. I know that the director was trying to spice up the storyline, but the two main factors that were missing was that his family was supposed to have been killed and what happened to his partner? The black suit looked awful, he should have stuck with the silver, and all of the famous one liners either missing or not used that much. Samuel L. Jackson's character was a total waste of time, but on the plus side, some of the action wasn't that bad. In all, it's a very bad attempt at a modern Robocop. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up:\nIt really looked like they got Samuel L. Jackson at the last minute, when all of the casting had finished, so they just made up a role for him. I preferred the original when they used news reels to explain what was happening in the community. The guy who played the lead didn't really show any real emotion, which was really needed in the role, and he seemed to adapt a bit to quickly, to the fact that his whole body was a robotic suit. I can understand that the director wanted to bring Robocop to these modern times, but there were too many key elements missing which made the first movie. Because the film made over double it's budget, it's obvious that they are going to come out with a sequel, but they really do need to go back to the drawing board.\n\nBudget: $100million\nWorldwide Gross: $243million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who were into the original Robocop, but don't expect the same quality. 4/10",

Being a child of the 80's, Peter Weller will always be the definitive Robocop of my childhood (hows that for being objective?) and there lays the first problem, There are a lot of original robo fans out there who have been waiting patiently to see another outing with their favourite cyborg cop. However after the anticlimactic d\u00e9b\u00e2cle that is Robocop3, it is understandable why some fans would rather the franchise be left alone. That is unless by some freak turn of events, Weller now 66, reprised the role with Paul Verhoeven back in the director's chair. Sadly that simply isn't on the cards, leaving us to settle for the next best thing, a reboot. The new movie retells the story of Alex Murphy from a very different angle to that of the original 80`s movie. Jos\u00e9 Padilhait should be praised for daring to branch out from the established story and breathing air in to the franchise. However setting a PG13 rating, I have to wonder if he ever actually saw the original. Hollywood seems to believe movies today need to meet the 13-17 demographic to stand any chance of making money. Personally I'm inclined to say the reboot suffered due this decision. Robocop and the characters that populate Verhoeven's dystopian future can only truly work in an adult rated movie. Padilhait's Detroit lacks any of the social decay or gritty run down appearance of the original. In fact it actually looks pretty clean, which left me wondering why they needed Robocop in the first place. Not a single one of the villains was really intimidating on screen. The worst still was realising who the main villain was, something that didn't happened until very late in the movie, by which time it felt like a rushed after thought. \nPerhaps this is a fault of a PG13, which takes the edge off otherwise dark characters, preventing them from being who they could or should be. Robocop spends a lot of the movie struggling with his emotions, when really he should be out cleaning up the city. Oh wait that's right the city wasn't that dirty to begin with, why do we need Robocop again?\nHow any of the family orientated fluff is important to a teenage audience is beyond me. As a teen, I watched Robocop for the brutality, the gore and to see a cyborg cop kicking butt and lets not forget how Robo deals with rapist! \nWhile the reboot does bring a fresh perspective to the Alex Murphy story arch, the most important side, the action was seriously lacking. What is so good about Robocop taking out bad guys in the dark? And why was it necessary to explain his every action with techno babble? What made the original work so well was its lack of explanation, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps for themselves. The reboot doesn't settle for showing us Robocop, it insists on explaining how the magic trick works and in the process spoiling the illusion.\n\nIf you want an action movie you could do worse then Robocop, however there are other PG13 movies, which offer better action and darker villains. In fact if you're an adult, just watch the original Robocop, aged it might have, but the story still beats this hands down.",

I didn't have any attachment to the original.\n\nBut from what I do remember is there was quite a lot of gore in the old one, and almost none in this one. Now, I understand this bothers purists or people who equate gore and violence with maturity and classic film-making. But personally, I don't really care for it. Though it could have gotten away with more than it did, that's not a primary concern for me with this film.\n\nGenerally speaking, it was a good set up to the story, other than a corny buddy-cop precursor. Then I felt like the film just took too long to build up to any sort of climactic end. The middle of the film feels like there's nothing really at stake. Until the very end, but by then I think it was too late for me to invest much concern.\n\nStill I definitely have to praise another great performance from Gary Oldman. Michael Keaton did admirably too, really all the acting cast did a fine job.\nI think the weak part was the screenplay and direction.\n\nMaybe it was the pacing, or the way the story progressed. I can't put my finger on it but something was not right. In terms of action, I think it was overly concerned with looking cool, and less with looking serious or dangerous.\n\nWhat I did like about this movie was the cynical, satirical exploration of the corporate machine and it's trying to maximize profits whatever the cost. That mixed with the common themes of AI control over people, and how it's just not a good idea.",

But that mechanical feel is well interspersed with human moments that develop Robocop Alex Murphy's struggles to accept his new role in life. The moments where his past memories intersect with his programming are well played by  Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman). Simultaneously Robocop deals with modern questions about how many concessions Americans will make to ensure their own security, and examines whether drones should be carrying out the actions they do abroad today. At one point the film clearly states that safety is not freedom, and that indeed too much safety might equal less freedom.

Having him wake up fully aware of who he is seems a deliberate step to make it different to the original, but it doesn't work very well. The family story lacks depth and the villain is just dull. As is the conclusion on the roof top. The good story here is watching a good man in Oldman, try to create something good, but buckle under pressure, make bad choices but then seek redemption, without it being contrived. It's really Oldman's performance that lifts this film from a 2 star film to a 3 star film.\nThe lack of violence in the film really is disappointing. You might argue that violence doesn't make a movie good. That is true. But in this film, it's truly lacking. It's like a Superman film without flight.",

Then when it's over you just go \"meh, I'll stick with the original\".  \"Robocop\" is kind of the same way.  The movie is well made and has some great performances.  But once it's over and everything has sunk in, it feels kind of pointless, because the original is stuck with you.  Joel Kinneman steps in as the half robot/half cop, and he does fantastic.  I'm a huge fan of his from \"The Killing\", and he does great.  As does Michael Keaton, Jackie Earle Haley, and Gary Oldman.  This movie has a terrific cast.  Samuel L Jackson has a small role as a political talk show host, that could have been bigger and meant more.  But it doesn't bring anything new to the franchise or take it to another level.  It is exactly what the original was, a B+ action movie with some subtext.  Maybe if it was rated R like the original and could have gone harder, it would have been better.  I mean, it's not that it's a bad movie, but it isn't.  It's just in 5 years when you want to watch \"Robocop\", you will always choose the original over this, and in 15 years this will be forgotten.  Could be wrong, but that seems to be the case for most remakes.  Good for a one time watch or rental.",

No real range needed of emotion, but when he needed to show anger, frustration and/or the occasional cracked smile, his face did all the work.  Gary Oldman had a much larger role than I was expecting and Michael Keaton was a below average baddie, but the biggest question mark was the inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson.  Total fluff.

First off, PG-13 rating (WTF were they thinking?)They made the Auto-9 non-lethal. No psychotic drug kingpins. Barely gave ED-209 a cameo. Nobody got shot in the dick, I mean shit, hardly anybody got shot at all - other than with tasers (boooo!). Now, I know some will say, \"Oh, but what about the 50 cal. T-Rex submachine gun?\" Yeah, well that's fuckin' cool, but the only thing he ever shoots with it are the damn robots. I don't think they even used a single squib in the remake, which is just an insult to a franchise that (up until now) made use of more squibs than can even be counted reliably.  \n\nIn the original, Murphy retains at least some of his body, requiring him to eat (remember the Gerber's?). In this acid-trip-alternative universe where CGI is always best, he's reduced to nothing but a talking head and lungs! Seriously WTF? And why even with the lungs if they have that kind of technology? His entire fucking body, save the head, eyeballs and one hand (and, conveniently I guess, his cardiopulmonary system) is gone, and you're gonna tell me that they can't find a better way to oxygenate then without relying on his frail, infection-prone human lungs? That would mean Robocop is effectively immune to almost all kinds of small arms fire, but fucking tear gas or bronchitis could fuck up his day! \n\nOk, now let's explore the \"plot.\" Murphy dealing with being a man trapped in a machine, trying to wrestle the memories of his family out of his programming took like 3 scenes and 20 min of the original, with the rest of the movie being a gore fest. In this new version, that struggle with his mind/OCP programming was ALL there was. Seriously, the main fucking bad guy in this movie was the OCP programming, which Murphy overcomes with his willpower.\n\nAnd then there is the terrible social commentary, which if it wasn't already blatantly obvious (armed drones in USA = bad idea), is made patently clear by Sam Jackson's over-the-top caricature of a big-media political puppet with an obvious (and, of course, implied paid-for) stake in the \"drones are good\" camp.\n\nAnd who is to blame for this tragedy? Ultimately, Sony and MGM, for pulling a turnabout and replacing the combination of Aronofsky/Self with Padilha/Zetumer. First of all, this was Padilha's first film using the English language, and Zetumer is a virtual unknown. I know James Vanderbilt supposedly contributed, but with credits like White House Down and The Amazing Spiderman 2 to his name, that aint saying much. In the end, it comes down to terrible writing, an over-reliance on special effects to make it more impressive in 3D, and the inability of a fledgling director to recognize that he was creating the film equivalent of human excrement.\n\nThe ONLY thing that makes me feel better about watching this movie was that I watched a less-than-legally-made version, so Sony didn't get shit from me for this theatrical abomination.",

            "content": "While it's not a perfect movie by no means this is a good movie, and honestly how many movies are perfect anyway? The film delivers where the original 3 didn't in many areas, and while I understand that online fanboy's can't seem to let go that changes happen all the time when things get updated, and modernized.. This is a reboot, and a re imagining of the RoboCop story.\n\nGone are the campy badly acted scenes from the original films, and the badly done special fx. The movie has some great cgi work done to it, and enough action, and gore to keep most fans happy without being just crude, and overdone.\n\nPeople's big complaint was that the \"RoboSuit\" the \"Black suit\" was different from the one used in the original movie, and so it's not RoboCOP, and soon named the movie \"RoboFlop\" without ever giving it a chance. SMH!\n\nSome who saw the movie complained about THAT first, and foremost so it seems that people can't let that go, and have some sort of OCD against change. Mostly nostalgia fans really. \n\nMe I had no issues with the look they went with in this movie, and found it to work very well! The suit used was awesome, and the scene where RoboCop see's what's left of his human body is very well acted, and written. \n\nHonestly I laugh when someone complains about something so stupid as what fans complained about with this movie. The movie is action packed, and cast very well... From top to bottom the movie has a stellar cast.\n\nOverall this movie did make money at the box office globally, and I hope a sequel gets made. This was a good movie don't listen to the online haters. \n\nLet me say that I was a fan of the first two Robocop movies as a kid, and grew up hating the 3rd, and never got into the comics or the cartoons. But I always liked the first two movies, and in due time I expected someone to remake the series or bring it back some how. But over time the bad special fx, and camp factor of the first two movies are obvious as they don't hold up very well today.\n\nIt's a very cool storyline tho one which can easily be translated to what we are facing today with invasion of privacy, and the potential of us losing some of the freedoms we have due to political unrest.\n\nRobocop much like the Terminator series, and even the Matrix trilogy reminds us that our evolution as human beings could easily be in danger if we aren't careful with our own creations. While we like to think we are very smart, and we like to play god sometimes it begs the question when have we gone too far?\n\nThe film takes place in the year 2028 so it's not that far fetched to think that this could happen one day soon when we look at how advanced computers are today. We are not looking at something that far off in the future here at all.\n\nNow this remake has managed to anger a lot of fanboys online from day one people complained, and nit picked at little things which made no sense really. Most complained because they said the movie having a black suit looked too much like something out of BATMAN. Ironically enough Michael Keaton is in the movie, and he played Batman. Keaton plays Raymond Sellars the CEO of OmniCorp or OCP for short. Yes they kept OCP as the company name.\n\nWhen multinational conglomerate OmniCorp who is at the center of robot technology, and is in charge of taking care of our global wars using their robots overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it.\n\nWhen Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.\n\nThe movie has one of the best cast I've seen put together for a remake ever. Besides Michael Keaton, and Joel Kinnaman the film also has fellow Batman alumni Gary Oldman as Dr. Dennett Norton the Doctor Frankenstein of the movie. He's the man behind the machine, and the real brains behind OCP.\n\nJackie Earle Haley as Rick Mattox the man who's in charge of training Robocop, and eventually has to try, and stop him.\n\nJay Baruchel as Tom Pope who's fresh of his big hit film \"This is the END\" he plays one of the marketing geniuses at OCP who's trying to figure out the best way to sell a \"Robocop\" to the people.\n\nAbbie Cornish as Clara Murphy is a bit under used in the film but it's not shocking when they have so much story to tell. Either way she was excellent in her performance, and what I loved the most about this movie is the strong bond between the Murphy family, and that is evident by the good chemistry that Joel & Abbie had on screen.\n\nThe movie also has Sam Jackson in a political tv show type who only comes out in scenes promoting the OCP agenda. Don't want to give too much away but he's a scene stealer, and at the very start of the movie he does just that. But it's not shocking Sam Jackson always steals the scenes he's in. He's that great of an actor. Michael Keaton also does a fantastic job here looking sympathetic one minute, and evil the next. He steals a bunch of scenes here also, and gave a great performance.\n\nThere is one scene when Dr. Dennett Norton shows Murphy what is actually left of his body, and he takes him apart. This is a very powerful scene, and acted very well by both men. Remember Murphy loses his limbs, and all that's left here after they put him in the suit is his head, a hand, and lungs.\n\nPeople ask why would they keep one of his hands? Well I think it's to allow him to have \"feel\" when he touches something. But that isn't really addressed in the movie. But I think it's a way to allow him to keep a little piece of his humanity.\n\nHonestly overall everyone was great in this movie, and even tho fanboys also complained about the PG-13 rating this movie has a bigger body count, and more action then the original. So reason why Murphy gets to become the chosen one for Robocop is a bit under developed but it's tied up very well at the end.\n\nIF there isn't a sequel to this movie it's tied up well enough that it would work as a stand alone movie. But I do hope to see a sequel to it. I really think it deserved better, and the fans who have hated on it for no other reason other than to hate because it's not exactly how the original was I say this.\n\nYou want something that's a shot for shot remake? Look at Psycho, and how that turned out. They have a lot of nods to the original movie here we even get a nice reference to \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" I think people just have a problem sometimes letting go, and they can't accept updates to classic movies.\n\nBut if you go into this movie with an open mind, and are willing to give it a fair chance you will be surprised about how good it actually is.\n\nJos\u00e9 Padilha is a great up, and coming film maker, and sadly the studio was a bit hard for him to work with, and while this movie is really good had he been given full creative control we could have had a masterpiece.\n\nThat this isn't but honestly it's a worthy remake to a classic, and it's a movie that deserves a better fate than it looks like it's going to get, and which at times is actually a better film then the original. The human element works much better here then it ever did in the original.\n\n4.5 out of 5",

The first half of the movie well established the groundwork, that machines do not have the right to end a human's life because they don't understand the value of it. That got me excited. However the second half swept all that foundation away, and started depicting the lust of human. All the bad decisions and crime now are driven by the greed towards money and fame, while all the machines are being fair and doing their job right. The ending was utterly bizarre, leaving me scratching my head with absolutely no clue what to derive from it. Overall the flick is slow when there is no action or explosion and that led me to fast forward a bit. \n\nRoboCop throws everything at the wall and see what sticks, but most of it just goes splat. The other few random moral questions it threw out and spatted are:\n\n- A purely lawful, impartial system would not exist or it will just be utterly boring? \n- An amputated guitarist was playing with machine hands but couldn't control them perfectly and said \"but I need emotion to play.\" Wtf was that?

Gone is the story of a robot slowly becoming human, and more about the internal war Murphy has around the almost semipolitical plot about the use of Drones over humans and the cost of human life. Leading the film talent wise, we have Samuel L Jackson who acts as a political commentator pretending to be a news personality, Gary Oldman who does a good job walking the grey line of good and bad, and lastly Micheal Keaton is just refreshing to see as a whole. \n\nWhile the film lacks the camp and cartoonish nature of the original, it stands as its own film which if anything makes the original stand out so much more. Too often in the realm of remakes and reboots, it is as if the legacy of the classics are trying to be burried. The only thing RoboCop about this film is the hero is named Alex Murphy and the inclusion of a company named Omnicorp. \n\nTragically, despite its good and great moments, it just doesnt break any boundries in film, nor goes to that one extra special place that great films go.

            "content": "Padilha's RoboCop starring Joel Kinnaman, if we are to evaluate it with a view to the original, might have been a pretty creative retread. Though both films seem to turn on the same themes, those being techno-liberal justice and the critique of neoliberal policing that persists today, Padilha's version makes an attempt at creating a sleeker version by dealing a renewed dose of science fictional estrangement in the beginning. Trying to be relevant, the film begins with a critique of international policing that forces us to examine our present, a time of globalization, reborn 'zero tolerance,' privatized soldiers, remote drone attacks, and political polarization over issues of national security. It fails, however, to pick up this compelling international thread after the first 15 minutes. As a dystopia that globalizes the original's satire of neoliberalism, this film could have been headier and something completely different from its 1987 predecessor. \n\nVerhoeven's original was a clever and entertaining critique that ultimately championed a facile techno-liberal solution to the problems of street crime. Indeed, Alex Murphy in Verhoeven's version, though capable of human discretion and emotion, was nothing more than a superhuman, galvanized urban Rambo out for revenge. It is hardly relevant that revenge is a particularly human foible. Though the film looked interesting in the beginning, it pretty much ended up valorizing the same facile, testosterone-charged solution to crime and, just as the original, unsubtly makes the heterosexual family the anchor for human sentiment and the exception to the dehumanizing effects of technological evolution. It is certainly not the first or last work of art that that will commit that crime. Nonetheless, perhaps it's because I had less attachment to the original -- I was only about 6 when  Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop hit theaters -- I didn't mind the recent reincarnation. That doesn't mean I liked it though.",

Instead, it addresses other themes of security, surveillance and control, which is probably a wise move.\n\nIn the past, I would normally have made the suggestion that a film like this might be better off not using the name of a beloved original, and tried to be its own original film. This was certainly the case with the Total Recall remake. However, in this case, if the film had attempted that, it's likely that the film would still be interpreted as a \"RoboCop wannabe\". If a filmmaker is going to remake RoboCop, this is as good an attempt as any.\n\nUltimately it's quite enjoyable, but its biggest problem is that it's missing the X-Factor of iconic moments and characters. Moments like when ED-209 malfunctions the first time when it's introduced, or the TV ads used in the original. There aren't those moments in the remake, and that may reflect the difference between a good director and a great director. \n\nThis means that this film is quite good, but will probably end up as a footnote rather than a landmark in film history.",

Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is a cop that is crippled in a traumatic explosion, but they can make him harder, better, faster and stronger, so they meld man to machine to make RoboCop.  The original RoboCop had the tremendous benefit of being directed Paul Verhoeven, who knows how to work social commentary into a science-fiction story.  He can take an idea that is ludicrous on paper (seriously, the conceit of a robot cop is pretty juvenile when you stop and think about it), and make it completely cerebral and relevant.  I will give you this: the special effects here are good looking, and it is pretty cool to see a disassembled RoboCop body, but that is the only thing that this remake has a leg up on the original.  If you didn't have a new or fresh spin to take on the story, why would you even bother to do it in the first place?  The original really overachieved when you get right down to it, and this completely neuters and sterilizes the story to make it a completely generic action movie that has no tooth.  I don't blame the actors here, as there is effort being placed forth.  Gary Oldman doesn't just phone it in, and Samuel Jackson chews scenery, although I will say that Kinnaman is a bit bland as the RoboCop, and has nothing on Peter Weller.  This isn't the worst thing you could watch, but much like the Total Recall remake, there really is no wow-factor, and it is an action movie that is ultimately forgettable.",

            "content": "It is important to note that I have not watched the original RoboCop and I heard many people claim that rebooting it is stupid as the concept is no longer relevant. I can't tell how close the new film is to its source material, but, to my surprise, it was not only relevant, but also a good movie in general. That said, it did come with quite a few flaws of varying importance.\n\nRoboCop is mostly a satire on mainstream American media and their effect on public opinion and governmental decisions. While it also touches on the way the United States treats countries abroad, specifically in and around the Middle-East, the idea is not explored beyond the premise of the movie. The way it approaches its critique of media is both through humour and drama, which seems frivolous, but still appropriate in tone. The way some news channels shamelessly and nonapologetically expose their biases and political agenda is, for all intents and purposes, inappropriate. It makes for a poorly informed society, and seeing a film pick up on that, make fun of it, and shed light on its potential consequences is essential.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few themes RoboCop could have delved into much deeper than it ultimately did. One in particular is the question it implicitly asks many times over: \"What makes us human?\" It seems that the movie tries to base most of its explanations on pseudoscience and the ethics that come along with it; however, at one point, the protagonist manages to override Dr. Norton's tweaks to his brain and, this being a very climactic moment, an opportunity the filmmakers could seize to answer the question, it simply goes to waste. One character eventually vaguely mentions the existence of a \"soul\" in a sarcastic tone, but the idea isn't explored much beyond that. A possible route the film could have taken would be to address the mysteriousness of science, and to show that no matter how advanced our technology, there will always be seemingly inexplicable phenomena just waiting to be explored. Otherwise, they could have gone completely against such a world view. Instead, they remained passive and the question was never answered or brought up again: it ended up being a banal vehicle to make the plot progress forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot progression, there are many illogical, let alone absurd story elements designed to transition from one scene to another that could have been handled much more smoothly. For example, just before Murphy's reveal to the public as RoboCop, the authorities decided it would be a good time to upload the entire criminal record database to his brain in a few seconds which resulted in an unsurprising panic attack and made them take drastic measures as an attempt to fix the problem. The decision is clearly too silly to be real and takes the viewer straight out of the experience. Another pointless addition to the film is Rick Mattox's character. He is an asshole for the sake of being one and adds little to nothing to the whole movie. Although few characters feel real, this one shines in his two-dimensionality. He is the archetype of the flat character: he doesn't evolve one bit and adds zero comedy or drama to the movie. He is but a tool.\n\nThe characters could have been written better, but Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and, to a certain extent, Samuel L. Jackson really bring their characters to life with solid performances that overshadow the mediocre dialogue.\n\nVisually, the film looks dated. There are a few technical missteps in the special effects, but the reason it's unappealing is because of its blandness. The choreographers didn't reinvent the wheel, they just created a spinning tin man wielding two guns, an oddly common practice, except for the tin man part. Some shootouts are enjoyable, but they certainly are not the highlights of the film.\n\nIn retrospect, RoboCop is a good relevant movie that's worth a watch despite its many faults, but I don't see it becoming a classic. I don't know how good the first one was, but surely it had something more substantial going on for it.",

While far from being close to achieving the cult status of the original movie, this is a very good and decently entertaining action with a story relevant to a future that seems more and more probable. \n\nAgain set in Detroit and once again with the high-tech corporation OmniCorp in the center of the story, director Jose Padilha does his best to keep the movie the closest possible to the original. The background of the story is changed, as this time OmniCorp is not really fighting the crime in Detroit, but searching for a way to sell its robots on US soil, rather than only overseas. When Officer Alex Murphy is ambushed and almost killed, OmniCorps grasps its chance to create Robocop. The reboot certainly lacks the fun element which made the 1987 delivery a cult, but on the other side it is cynic and sharp enough when it comes to describing politics, media influences and corporate world. \n\nJose Padilha's version is also more human and Alex Murphy/Robocop (Joel Kinnaman) is still connected to his loving family. This leaves less screen time for a development of \"the bad guys\", but on the other hand Murphy's character becomes more complex, more dramatic and less detached from the human reality. In terms of acting and cast, Joel Kinnaman could not match the level of Peter Weller, but on the positive side it is a nice surprise to see Michael Keaten in the role of the corporate mogul Raymond Sellars.\n\nIn the end, the 2014 Robocop will never become as memorable and legendary as the original 1987 movie, but it will be remembered as a decently entertaining sci-fi action flick. With its budget of $100 mio.,only $60 mio. domestic and $185 mio. international box office, the possibility of establishing a new franchise seems to be very small unless it performs excellently on the home video market. Better than expected, Robocop surely deserves at least a new sequel.",

They are mainly used outside the USA, for example in Tehran, where American soldiers are trying to bring freedom to the local people (as I have mentioned almost nothing has changed). Battle robots replace human soldiers there. The Omnicorp head Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) dreams of introducing his robots to the USA to make American cities safer and to save the lives of brave American cops. As a matter of fact his corporation will earn lots of billions every year, but it is naturally not their first aim. It is only a bonus to being noble, honest and patriotic. Yet there is a certain \"Dreyfus Act\" which legally forbids to use battle robots in the USA.\nBut there are no obstacles a real patriot would not overcome In order to win the public support Omnicorp plans to make something new. They are about to combine a human and a battle droid to make a hybrid. They want to prove it will be safe, stable and socially friendly. The matter is now they to find a suitable candidate for such a complicated task. \nAlex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is an ordinary cop. Now with his partner Jack Lewis he is investigating a very fishy case. \nread more http://www.viewforum.net/family-movies-comedies-adventures-147/robocop-2014-a-3869/",

This Hollywood popcorn flick is best enjoyed by not comparing it to Verhoeven's satire riddled, religious iconography packed, hyper-violent with a borderline X-rated, cult classic original.  Padilha's RoboCop is exactly what you'd expect from any other cookie cutter project that some studio big shot thought would be a good investment, but the director actually holds his own, conforming to a PG-13 rating without sacrificing too much in the way of storyline, or action.  \n  \nThe story is straight forward, and serves mainly as a vehicle to get RoboCop from point to point so he can shoot stuff.  If you're looking for a robot cop walking around and shooting other robots, gang members, corrupt cops, big business CEO's and bigger robots for an hour or so, then this is your ticket to RoboParadise.  The pace is quick, and the film hardly ever drags, which is important for the popcorn demographic this movie seems to be aimed at.\n\nThe cast is well implemented, featuring veteran actors like Time Burton's Bruce Wayne, a Bill O'Reilly channeling Samuel Motherfuckin Jackson, the always brilliant Gary Oldman and lovable newcomers like Jay \"guy with a maple leaf tattoo\" Baruschel and Omar who now works with the police force as a SWAT sergeant.  \n\nMusic was pretty unimpressive.  Standard Hollywood fare big orchestra compositions, with no distinctive or unique sound.  The cinematography was consistently solid, but nothing I would particularly go out of my way to call unique either.  The HUD views from the POV shots of RoboCop were well developed and immersive, but best of all, the displays and readouts all seemed to have a real purpose rather than being composed of frivolous after effects porn.\n\nOverall, give it a watch if you want some brainless action.  With luck, this film could get Padilha enough credibility to direct another Hollywood backed film, but with some more creative control at hand.",

There are some definite improvements, mostly in the story department and primarily in the fact that this time around RoboCop starts out with more humanity but struggles to keep it (which in my opinion makes more sense and offered a better narrative). the action is good but I felt there could've been more of it and with a slightly faster pace.  the performances are solid for the most part. Joel kinnaman as RoboCop functions well but he's definitely no Peter Weller. the best performances, however, came from Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson, Jackie Earl Haley and Abbie Cornish. these all bring something new to the RoboCop story that really updates it appropriately. RoboCop himself is cool as usual, or at least while he's in his traditional colored suit. when he makes a change to all black (trust me no spoiler here) I felt the suit kind of lost its iconic feel and became RoboCop meets batman begins (normally I'd welcome this but ultimately I prefer the traditional metallic blue and black combo). all in all I'd say this is one of the better remakes I've seen in recent years. it definitely doesn't take any of the thunder from the original but its worth a watch  or two.",

Good casting: Joel Kinnaman's Alex Murphy / Robocop is sympathetic and surprisingly human; strongly supported by Gary Oldman, ideally cast as the doctor tasked with Murphy's transformation. Oldman's character's constant struggle to balance ethics and Murphy's family's concerns with the requirements of OCP and it's CEO (Michael Keaton, in a very entertaining performance that proves you don't need to chew scenery to be the baddie), actually makes his interaction with Murphy one of the most interesting features of the story. Jay Baruchel as a weaselly marketing man, and Jackie Earl Haley as a gruff weapons trainer are also entertaining; not so Samuel L Jackson, cast as a fascist news presenter as part of the film's failed attempt to include some of the augmented satire that characterized the original. Here, it comes off flat. Fortunately, it does not break the movie, which against expectation, does not end up feeling like a cynical money grabbing attempt from its studio (it may well be), and although one can argue remakes are indicative of a bankrupt imagination, this film proves that the premise of Robocop was worthy of an update in the era of drones and smartphones.",

The film ventures into the territory of corporate greed and had a chance to become rather relevant; but it never really decides to tackle a whole lot by never going too deeply into a story.  Gary Oldman (Tinker Tailor ...) plays the scientist/inventor with some morals and Michael Keaton (Batman) plays a moral-free corporate suit who together decide what to make and/or do with Robocop.  Abbie Cornish (Bright Star) is wasted as a grieving wife and Jennifer Ehle (Sunshine) is a thankless corporate gopher -- the female characters are weak here.  It appears to want to stir-up some damning debate but it fails as the one making the colorful political commentary -- Samuel L. Jackson -- has too much fun with his small, wholly unnecessary role.

            "content": "Despite still being able to appreciate the gritty and gruesome quality of the original, rebooting 'RoboCop' was understandable given the film technology we have now. I got to admit, I was quite half-impressed with the trailers. However, I would't have supported it if I knew they were going to turn it into RoboCrap. \n\nFirst of all, the event leading up to the cop's near fatal injuries pales in comparison to the original. A car explosion at his house just seemed like a quick and lazy way for the writers to get him into the robo-suit as soon as possible without establishing much foundation for the viewer to feel empathy towards him and his family. There is also problems with logic in some parts of the film. One example being when robocop catches a wanted murderer and rapist at his promotional event. Show me a wanted criminal who would turn up at an event littered with police officers, let a alone a state of the art robocop, and I'll show you a situation which is unrealistically dumb and takes the audience for mugs. I didn't like the whole idea where robocop malfunctioned from being too emotional. It represented a very feeble way of building tension in a scene. Getting too emotional may have impact at a little tea party but not in an action movie setting. \n\nOne of the main flaws concerns the story's focus on the corporation's attempts to market robocop. It was a necessary part of the plot since it demonstrated how he was treated more as a product than a human being but this took too much precedence over seeing robocop kick some criminal butt. Apart from the training simulation scenes, there was not a lot of seeing robocop in action. The ending sequences were okay in displaying glimpses of robocop's combat skills but this mainly served to show what was substantially missing from earlier parts of the movie. Furthermore, the family aspect that seemed vital to the plot was under-emphasised while some of the acting was so poor that they might as well have called this hobocop. Samuel L Jackson's comical news reports gave it something a little out of the ordinary and did prove to be an entertaining addition through providing another third party's humorous perspective on the story. \n\nI still like the premise and I agree that this reboot could have been much, much worse, probably doing enough to save half a star of the rating. In spite of this, if I saw you pick up the dvd or blu ray of this in the shop, I would slap it out of your hand and point to the 1987 original.",

            "content": "Back in 1987 Robocop was an instant hit. No surprise there as the franchise was clearly a new concept and the era was bringing some good action movies one after the other and Robocop was riding the new wave. After 27 years the half man half mech robot is rebooted and it certainly looks good. Though plot is slightly similar to the original since the new Robocop has vast differences to its presentation my intention here is not to compare the two movies but to concentrate on the new version.\n\nThe movie background runs in 2028. American drone and robot technology has evolved in to a stage where their wars off shore are largely handled by unmanned machines. Yet the domestic situation remains hostile to the machines and Omnicorp the large corporate responsible for building the robots are looking for ways to enter the local market. And they find their ticket when Alex Murphy a detective in the police department gets injured in the line of duty. Omnicorp transforms Alex in to a half man half machine Robocop with wrong intentions and Alex starts to disobey his programs letting his human side to take control.\n\nAt a glance it's evident that the CG work done here is outstanding. Not like in the 80s now the industry is well equipped to make Robocop visually beautiful without using much of onset props. Therefore the man in machine looks flawless and the technology looks spick and span. And when the action kicks in it really blasts. Yet what makes the true contribution to the new Robocop is not how it looks but how it feels. The director spends a great deal of time (Almost exactly half of the runtime) conceptualizing and building the background to bring in the hybrid. The viewer gets a full picture of the political situation against the movement and the corporate strategy that goes in to building the Robocop. And giving a solid foundation the story of Alex Murphy is well put and it's emotional. Though the entire movie is highly predictable there is joys in seeing things unveil.\n\n\nMaybe the only complain that someone could have including me is the lack of action at the peak. It all seems too easy for a single Robot to bring down a large corporate like Omnicorp. However thinking of the point that this movie is just the start of a new sequel and there might be a next one coming, the lack of action is acceptable. On a final note though Robocop is kind of dumb it's decent and entertaining.",

In other words this comes across as total propaganda. There are other differences, the original was gruesome in the literal sense, with bowels and blood everywhere, but this version is gruesome on an intellectual level, with so much trans-humanistic and dehumanizing spin it will make your head spin. Other things come to mind like how this version is technologically superior, but ultimately less satisfying. And due to the lack of satire it's not a feel-good movie, but a feel-bad movie. The acting is okay, but the story development and continuity is atrocious, it really made me think this should've been a two-parter, but then I doubt I would have gone to see the second part. All things considered this movie would have been reasonable on its own, but as a reboot of such a great movie it just fucking blows.",

            "content": "So way back in...whenever, we were given the news of a remake for the ultra violent uber satirical comicbook styled sci-fi 'Robocop', directed by Arsene Wenger, wait what?! One hoped twas a poor joke but unfortunately as you all know it wasn't, so here we are now...'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar' hehe...no seriously its a line in the film.\n\nAfter an intro the film kicks off and we get the classic Basil Poledouris theme stomping its way over the opening credits...sweet. Well not really because the theme has been tampered with and sounds completely off key and fudging awful, strike one Robocop reboot. \n\nThe plot is generally along the same lines as classic Robo (that's how I will refer to the original, classic Robo) with Murphy being struck down by some bad guys and coming back from the brink of death as a robotic police officer. All this admist a corrupt police force helped along by the dark OmniCorp company which provides advanced robots for the US military. The original film had a biting satirical edge influenced by a Reagan era of heavy consumer culture, privatisation, capitalism and greed, a truly slimy corporate climate full of greasy suits. So what does this film have you ask? how can this film hope to create such a sharp edge when classic Robo's plot no longer fits the bill. \n\nWell this film firmly goes down the sort of relative notion of our current climate, asking if robots with guns (or robots at all) should be allowed to roam around controlling human beings (replacing the police mainly). Is it right to have a mechanical object with artificial intelligence in charge of pulling the trigger and possibly terminating a human life, plus of course the subject of national security is ever present. The film starts off overseas as robots/drones patrol the streets of Tehran, a display of American power and might over a much poorer simple people. Naturally and predictably we are shown straight away how a powerful robot (ED-209) can cut down an innocent child who was wielding a simple knife. So the modern day debate surrounding drones being used abroad to replace troops is stuffed in your face well and truly. The debate about drones policing us on a regular basis is still very much science fiction and could be shoved in any action film.\n\nAlthough the use of these themes are well presented it still doesn't really feel overly relevant to today's society. The distinct lack of any real dark humour or dark satire on social commentary through any media is really obvious, this was the fabric of the original film and half the reason it was so good (other half was uber violence). Other smaller issues pop up which again seem to be by-products of films these days. Why is the character of Lewis now a black man? I'm not saying that's wrong but why the need to change that character? is that a PC move? wouldn't a female character create more emotion in a crisis? I realise this film wants to distance itself from the original but changes like this just seem utterly pointless, change for changes sake, there are other important issues to think about. Plus a strong female character works well usually and can be a plus for a film. In fact the whole point of that character seems completely defunct now anyway seeing as he does nothing to aid the new plot, reduced to a background character.\n\nAs for Robo himself and the crux of the film, well its a mixed bag really. While the action sequences are very slick and lovely to look at (unsurprisingly) they do come across as any old first person shooter for your Xbox (or Playstation if you're that way inclined). Yes I know it sounds cliche me saying this but I have to because that's what those sequences look like, the infrared shoot out especially with all those colourful cross hairs and readouts popping up everywhere. Robo's HUD in general, while looking very pretty, seemed way too over the top for me. I realise the tech is suppose to be white hot but really? Robo can even tell what emotion a person is going through or about to go through...WARNING: VIOLENCE IMMINENT: THREAT, SUBJECT COOPERATIVE: NON THREAT. Soooo can Robo tell if a piss or sneeze is imminent too? Then you got all that crap going on when he's scanning around as if he can see through everything and project perfect virtual isometric 3D images with measurements and angles etc...come on! all that makes him too powerful, the HUD can do anything!\n\nIts too easy for Robo in this film, he can pinpoint criminals within 10 minutes with his super HUD, no human can make a move in this city without him knowing and sniffing you out sheesh! Anyway this leads me to the suit, the famous suit, is it better than classic Robo? don't be ridiculous. Now I'll admit it looks better in silver trim of course, we all know that, but that doesn't save it. Overall it still looks plastic to me, close up or from a distance...still looks plastic I'm afraid with no real weight to it either. Its like any modern day piece of electronic equipment really, plastic with pointless LED lights on it. Kinnaman's face is too normal looking if you ask me, wouldn't there be any damage burns or scars?? He doesn't move like a robot either, he just walks around and moves as normal with badly added sound effects that don't sync up. Also he doesn't seem to have any speech issues or twitches or anything, surely you'd have some visual signs of mental stress...apart from crying and grimacing. In short this guy takes to being a head in a jar in a robot very easily frankly, no sweat. \n\nOverall it looks like what we all thought with the release of the first images online, a man in a plastic ripped ninja suit. Of course the human hand doesn't help one bit, I appreciate the idea behind it but no. Its not totally dreadful, his helmet and visor are quite cool with the red Cylon thing going on. What I don't get is the need to give his cheesy 'Knight Rider' rip off bike (it does look bloody awful and babyish, Batbike anyone?) those two daft looking red visor-like slits too, thinking of toy merchandise sales there methinks. One thing I thought of during the infrared shootout was the fact that his red helmet visor kinda gave his position away in the dark didn't it, like a target for his head...shoot me here.\n\nThe action sequences are impressive effects wise but that's no big deal these days. Sure ED-209 looks OK and sounds OK but really so what? that's only a small cog in a big wheel, this film could of been so much more. The action hints at being really solid had it been for ADULTS! yes I'm sorry but that's the bottom line. There were some nice moments but they fizzled out under a PG-13 rating which wouldn't allow them to be truly kickass. The only one sequence which comes close to a true adult Robocop moment is when we see Murphy taken apart revealing just a head, throat and lungs. There's also another small moment when we see 'Norton' operating on Murphy's brain...but that's it, that's all we get.\n\nOther than that its really weak in places and really tries too hard...just like Kinnaman who does his best tough guy act at the start which is awful. His Robo effort isn't much better really seeing as he still comes across exactly the same as before he was blown up. There aren't any bad guys in the film either really, think about it, there isn't really  any actual nasty bad guy you really wanna see killed off. Sellars doesn't really feel or act like a bad guy, like Novak he actually brings good arguments to the table about using robots in the US for security, saving more lives overall. \n\nMattox is more of an annoying employee than a bad guy, just slap him, stop being so robophobic against that poor robot fella. The main crime boss and his henchmen are so flippin' weak its untrue, they're barely naughty let alone vicious drug dealers, they don't do anything! On the tiny plus side I did quite like how they tweaked Robo's brain so he could perform better because his human side was causing hesitation (no memory wipes in the future?). Just a shame they spoiled that by having him miraculously override further brain programming by...beats me! the power of love?\n\nOh and how on earth was there CCTV footage of Murphy's murder? it was on his driveway, what there is a CCTV pointing at his driveway from the street? he has his own CCTV? oh he did it seems, handy.\n\nIts been said before and I will say it again, the film admittedly isn't the car crash I thought it would be, it is a well made sci-fi visually...but its no Robocop film. Had this been a stand alone sci-fi I could look on it more favourably despite similarities. End of the day it still remains a toothless sanitsed, factory production line CGI offering that will be forgotten about within months. The least said about the end credits music track choice the better and at least Jackson got to use his favourite curse words at the very end huh guess that will please the masses (facepalm).",

So Padilha has his task cut out for him, could he satisfy both factions?\nUnfortunately the answer is no and it would be surprising if either group were satisfied with the finished product. It seems like yet another case of the-man-behind-the-curtain syndrome, most notably in the decision to aim for a PG13 rating, against Padilha's wishes, in order to ensure a film that went severely over budget recoups some of its investment. I agree that graphic violence is not necessary in order to make a good action movie, just look at The Dark Knight or Star Trek, but RoboCop falls short of the mark here and delivers a very placid final product. It can be argued that's what happens when the creative control is limited but perhaps hiring a director who's previous work is rated 18+ was the greater mistake.\nThe cast however is strong and Kinnaman(The Killing) executes his role efficiently, with support from veteran actors Oldman, Keaton and Jackson but even this solid foundation seemed somewhat hollow. In a throwback to the satirical nature, that flowed seamlessly throughout the original, Jackson's portrayal of the rhetoric spewing media mogul appears a little disjointed and does little to add to an already inferior reboot.\nIn total RoboCop 2014 does its best to recreate a character that criminals of Detroit should fear but in the end only offers us a modern day Tin-Man and by the closing credits I could not help but think, 'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar'.",

            "content": "It was 12:00 midnight on April 4th, 2014, ladies and gentlemen, when I finally decided I was officially done with Hollywood. I watched the Robocop remake last night, and I don't think I've ever been this depressed about the future of cinema in general in my entire life. Not because the film is really one of the worst movies of all time (it's not), but because of the pure and unfettered irony and complete ignorance of the art of filmmaking it takes to make a movie like this one. Making a mainstream blockbuster adaptation of Robocop is like making a TV show out of The Truman Show, or a theme park out of Jurassic Park. It misses the point of the original creation in a way that only money-grubbing Hollywood buttholes could. God, what a depressing turn of events.\r\n\r\nThe original Robocop is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite movies. Don't laugh, it's true. Although elitist cinema snobs (Cutler) will undoubtedly turn their noses up at Robocop because of its excessive gore and pew pew pews, it's actually far deeper than most people give it credit for. Under the surface of that remarkable film is a startlingly well-thought-out political allegory about America's culture of vapidity and the state of our culture. It is truly the rarest breed of film: Intelligent trash. So how ironic is it that this film that debases the warped, violent culture of America has now been transformed into a film that represents everything WRONG with the warped, violent culture of America? It would probably be funny if it weren't so damn depressing. Not only did the filmmakers totally miss the point of Robocop, but they did all they could to absolutely destroy my enjoyment of the original film. That's the worst kind of sequel, prequel, or remake-the one that prevents you from ever watching the original movie again without your perception of it sullied.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this film is, as you may have guessed, the blatant commercialization and dumbing down of the source material. Right from the get-go, it's painfully obvious that this film is nothing more than a cynical attempt to turn a sarcastic and sardonic movie into a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. The original film is practically a parody of the action genre, but this movie ignores those roots and peppers the runtime with unnecessary action sequences, explosions, and militaristically clich\u00e9d speeches by Samuel L. Jackson. It's every bit as empty-headed, generic, and silly as the movies that the original Robocop so expertly skewered. Sure, the original had its fair share of gore and violence (in fact, it had to be censored just to retain an R rating), but at least it served the story. The subversive wit and social commentary of it more than makes up for any detours it may have made into generic blockbuster territory. It's not perfect, but it was certainly a lot better than this load of manure.\r\n\r\nThe performances, as one would expect, are nothing special in the slightest. Joel Kinniman is bland and uninteresting as Robocop himself, giving us very little to root for in the hero. Sure, he's a cyborg... that doesn't mean he can't be an interesting character. Samuel L. Jackson plays the angry black guy again, and Gary Oldman (as always) is the best part, although his character is a stereotypical scientist in the vein of Kiefer Sutherland in Dark City. It would be really interesting to one day have a scientist character in a film who isn't a wimpy, geeky butthole, but apparently scriptwriters these days are more devoted to tropes than ever. I think I can safely say that most of the actors do the best with what they're given, but what they're given isn't much-The story is overcomplicated, the script is generic and dull, and the whole film lacks any of the energy that was put into the action sequences and CGI. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for Robocop: 2/10 stars. Yeah, this thing is awful. To be fair, this movie is only bad enough to merit maybe a 3 or a 4, but because it so tragically and hilariously missed the point of the original movie, I can't help but hate it. If you want a textbook example of why Hollywood these days is terrible, look no further than Robocop. Otherwise, there is no reason to sit through this lifeless, emotionless, painfully ironic piece of Hollywood drivel. Everything about this movie is by-the-numbers, generic, and headache-inducing, from its lame dialogue to its incoherent action sequences. If you're a fan of the original, definitely stay away. If you're an idiot like Jed who likes remakes more than original films, check it out. All I can say is one thing: It's even dumber than the things that the original made fun of.",

            "content": "It is becoming quite clear that Paul Verhoven films cannot be remade. He has a style that can take serious and thought-provoking concepts and add dark humor to his films. This is both evident in the original Robocop and Total Recall. Now I hope someone doesn't try to remake Basic Instinct or Showgirls. \nThe tone of this film is the major reason as to the criticism of this film; even before it was released in theaters. Back in the day (1980s-1990s) films could've been campy and cool. We've had plenty of dark films with some camp elements. Now in the post 9-11 era, films have taken themselves too seriously. Gone are the fun campy elements in big action films. A prime example would be the Bond/Batman films compared to today. Even though I enjoy both interpretations. I do admit there were some campy elements to the Batman films of the 80s-90s. Obviously, the Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and even Timothy Dalton films had some campy elements in their Bond films. The gradual shift into the post years after Sept. 11 called for a more serious tone, the threat and suspense of these films were heightened and the villain and protagonist became more ruthless. However these films are void of the humor that lightens the tone. 9-11 is not just a reason for the absence of campiness, it's because the audiences has changed. I'm pretty sure if there was a campy moment in one of Daniel Craig's bond film or Nolan's Batman, the tone of the film would feel unbalanced.\nRobocop is a hard film to remake. The sadistic characters like Clarence Boddiker, the action sequences, claymation animation, satirical look at society, hyped up violence, over use of blood squibs and one liners. Even though this film was really violent and the characters were fuckin nuts, you could still laugh at the film because of the tone. Robocop is not a film to be taken seriously, it is a film that is suppose to entertain you for two hours. Gone are the fun, sadistic characters (I did like Jackie Earle Haley's character), claymation (obviously), blood squibs and overuse of violence. The film has a somewhat satirical look at society at how much heavy influence political affiliation has on society. Throughout the film, congress is trying to enact a law that will allow robots to work in law enforcement. Samuel L. Jackson plays a hybrid of Glenn Beck, Bill o'Reilly, mixed with Al Sharpton's hair and I would also say his character gets real passionate on topics like Rachel Maddow. I felt that Jackson character is a satire on how political pundits who have a heavy influence on the choices people make. \nThe other actors were okay, the guy who plays Robocop was forgettable. Then again...so was the original actor. I know it may offend people when I say the original actor didn't have any gravitas to the first Robocop, but ask yourself this question: What could you say about the Murphy before he was Robocop? What was the most interesting thing about Murphy before he was killed and then revived as Robocop? I do admit the other actor did convey more of a human element to the film. We have some character build up in the film during the pre-Robocop scenes. This film deals with the conflict of human vs. machine, so there are moments when the character will override the system due to his emotions or free will. The action sequences are nothing spectacular. This film is pretty straight-forward. What I enjoyed about the original film was the sequence of Robocop responding to crimes that had no connection to the plot. There are no scenes of Robocop saving hostages from a crazy politician, preventing a convenient store robbery by killing the robbers/causing a lot of property damage and who could forget, apprehending a rapist after shooting his dick off. The remake doesn't provide us any of that action instead it goes directly to concluding the plot. That's the problem, the film doesn't give any time to have fun and explore Robocop. I realized this was a major issue when I enjoyed the training sequence in this film. This is a part of the film where you get to see what Robocop can do, even the exposition of how the machine works with Murphy was wonderfully done. Even though the training sequence and other action sequences felt like a videogame, it was the best part of the movie. Another thing that is missing from this film is the atmosphere.\nIt's ironic that now would be the perfect time to create Robocop. The first film did predict the economic and social decline of Detroit. It is still considered to be one of the dangerous cities in the US. Technology is on the cusp of creating a machine like Robocop. However this remake failed to capture the atmosphere of a crime ridden city. Detroit actually looks clean and, not deserted. The first film really captured Detroit as a city that has literally become Hell. There is nothing in the remake that'll make you think Detroit is dangerous.\nGrowing up in the 90's, parents weren't as PC or overly protected as they are now. I, like many kids grew up watching violent films like Robocop and the Terminator films. Hell, they had toys and a Saturday morning cartoon of Robocop. So I'm pretty sure companies were aware that kids were watching these violent R rated films. Now we've made a shift into PG-13 since most movies have grossed the most under the rating. There are certain films that can be done with a lower rating, however films like Robocop cannot. The violence that almost gave this film an X rating is what gives Robocop it's charm. Without all of the elements that were previously mentioned, this is just some generic sci/fi action film. Wait for this film to be in your 7.99 DVD bin at Wal-Mart.",

The original Robocop was a hard movie to reboot, and this reboot did ok. Reboots such as the Amazing Spider-Man and some others had big shoes to fill. It's hard to please everyone with a reboot. Why? Because there are some people who just want the same movie in a different timeline and there are other people who want a completely different movie. Robocop is a movie that is that much harder to make a reboot of, not to mention that it was a good movie.",

            "content": "It is impossible for the new \"RoboCop\" film to avoid comparison to the 1987 original version, particularly for die-hard fans prepared to analyze the reboot with scrutiny and a sense of disillusionment for recreating a sci-fi classic. It has been years since I've watched the original \"RoboCop,\" and while some of its most iconic quotes and satirical themes still resonate with me, I made it a point to avoid re-watching the original film as I do when preparing for any remake or book adaptation. By experience, a re-watch or re-read will result in angry outbursts at the theater for minor dialog or plot changes, creating an insufferable experience for myself and anyone sitting near me. Of course, if you've never seen the original \"RoboCop,\" you have nothing to worry about.\n\nSurprisingly enough, \"RoboCop\" launches with the promise that it is, in fact, more in-tune with our present day political issues, or rather, the political issues we will be facing in the year 2028. We are immediately greeted by the strongly opinionated television news anchor Pat Novak, played with feverous entitlement by Samuel L. Jackson as he channels his inner Fox News reporter. Novak discusses the \"robo-phobic\" mentality of American robotic forces being used for military purposes, primarily in Tehran, where suicide-bombers sacrifice their lives to destroy the massive, war-prevention machines. Unfortunately, this irony goes largely unnoticed, along with the numerous chances \"RoboCop\" has to pose any effective political statements. The film becomes all too concerned with OmniCorp, a multinational corporation striving for the distribution of robotic soldiers for war, and ultimately, as law enforcement agents. The problem, however, is that Americans do not trust artificially intelligent forces due to their lack of human cognition and emotional responsiveness.\n\nRight on cue, we are introduced to Alex Murphy, a police detective who is violently killed in a car bomb explosion. Alex suffers severe burns on over 80% of his body and loses practically all of his limbs, making him OmniCorp's best suitor for the half-human, half-machine they dreamed of creating for public support. Alex's heart, lungs, and damaged brain are all that remain, displayed with gory yet beautiful detail in glass encasings. He is kept alive artificially within his black steel armor, and his brain chemistry is altered to react more like a machine than an emotional human. He is merely an illusion of depth, much like the remainder of the film, which relies entirely on explosive mayhem and an overly complex plot to hold the attention of its viewers.\n\nEventually, \"RoboCop\" manages to find the man inside the machine, attempting to convince us that there were affirmations of heart and humanity all along the way. This attempt is ultimately futile, because \"RoboCop\" is more concerned with guns and explosions than it is with human cognition, corporate greed, or political satire-something the original film did with imaginative perfection. By all accounts, the \"Robocop\" reboot is a largely entertaining film filled with action-packed sequences and spectacular CGI. It simply plays out too generically to leave a lasting impression.",

Overall, I like the way the script approached the story and its various themes (not dumbing down but also not overdoing it), although it does suffer a bit from uneven pacing. \n\nCast/Acting: 1.5/3\nNot much acting going on here, just actors rattling off lines. I think they got the cast a little mixed up: Samuel L. Jackson should play the gangsta boss and Gary Oldman should play the talk-show host. \n\nProduction/Effects: 2/3\nI don't really like the look of the new suit (doesn't look robotic enough.) Some parts of the action (where Robocop fights those mecha things) look a little sped up and fake. But generally, the production looks good. \n\nSpecial/Other: 0.5/1\nNot bad as remakes go, but it feels like there's a lot more of the story that needs to be told.

The downside is that it did nothing to improve the overall storyline, nor did it really bring anything new to the picture other than a few visual upgrades and a little bit of humanity. Humanity in the sense that Robocop acted more like a normal street cop than his predecessor, Peter Weller. Still, the action scenes and the toned down violence did little more than rile us up with no real sense of gain in the movie itself. It felt like Robocop's greatest achievement was when he shot the rapist/murderer in the middle of the crowd. Beyond that, the other things he did seemed as simple as tracing some phone calls and running into a building, guns blazing. This was done way better in the original. \n\nStill, as said before, it was not a complete loss. Although the partnership of Officer Lewis was one of the high points of the first one, his new partner, Officer Lewis (haha, funny) was more toned down, but still had a good effect all around. The chemistry between the two was not as effective in this remake, and taking it out of the spotlight was a decent move. \n\nWe did get to see more of Robocop, but his presence was much less menacing, and he was much sleeker. This also leads to the downfall that never get to see him take down a simple gas station robbery, nor does he take down any smaller crimes other than ones pertaining to the head crime boss. The real problem with this is that we never see him interact with the common people of the city. There was no \"Have a nice day\" or \"Stay safe, citizen.\" We only get a grand scope of his deeds and no real look at how he deals with your normal, everyday crime.\n\nThe last thing of note is that there was a gigantic sideplot of his wife and son, where it was overlooked a lot more in the original. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to individual opinion, but it also means that we see a lot less of Robocop enforcing the law, and a lot less of the overall plot itself. It was a trade off, but was it truly worth it? I'd say no. \n\nA mediocre reboot, overall, but it is worth watching if you're in the mood for an action flick where a little thinking is in order.",

This film lacks enough action and heart to make it enjoyable. The story felt like a first draft without a clear idea of what it was trying to say.

            "content": "MY REVIEW OF ROBOCOP (1 Star)\n\nRemakes don't tend to excite, especially when the original was just fine on its own.  A do-over on a terrible film is another story, but I have to admit to being a little excited when I heard Jose Padilha was directing the remake of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic.  Padilha, a Brazilian filmmaker, impressed me greatly with his ELITE SQUAD movies, filled as they were with visceral, impactful action.  Additionally, THE KILLING's Joel Kinnaman would be slipping into the lead role, and I have found him to be a powerful, hugely empathetic presence.  \n\nIt was obvious to me that the reboot would make the original look clunky when looking at the huge leaps and bounds we've seen in effects work, and that is very much the case here.  I can also appreciate that the remake is going for an entirely different tone.  Whereas the 1987version was a sly, humorous and satirical look at corporate greed and BIG BROTHER politics, the remake plays it straight as a largely serious explosion of action.  As such, it's a flat, boring, painfully repetitive exercise in boom-bang-kapow.\n\nInitially, I thought there was promise as Samuel L. Jackson is a pundit/reporter who frames the film with his SNAKES ON A PLANE/DEEP BLUE SEA speechifying.  His reporting leads us to an effective sequence in Tehran in which we're introduced to OmniCorp's experimental robot police state.  Reminiscent of DISTRICT 9, I thought we were in for a fresh spin on totalitarianism.  The intelligence pretty much ends here.\n\nCue Kinnaman as Alex Murphy, a cop who is nearly decimated in an attack.  Looking to launch their robots in the U.S., OmniCorp identifies Murphy as a prime candidate - happy husband/father, all American, yadda yadda.  The aftermath of said attack is brutal and provides for some memorable imagery.  For a second there, I really felt for Murphy's plight.  What follows, however, for the remainder of the film is our title character cycling around and shooting people...nonstop.  THE END.  It's a numbing experience.  There's nothing left to say about it.  See the original and ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN and you'll thank me later.",

They tried to make the story different than the original film but from the start you know what's going to happen and movie feels weak compared to the original film. One big reason this reboot feels weak is because it has a PG13 rating unlike the original which has a hard R rating. \n I did enjoy seeing the Robocop program but it would have been nice to see some failed projects. I also like that in the reboot they made Robocop have more emotions and show that he does have a human side. The first person shots are amazing; the C.G. is really well done although final big battle feels more like a super hero movie.\n The cast is made up of talented cast with actors like Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Jackie Earle Haley, Jay Baruchel and the one and only Samuel L Jackson. The problem is that characters are flat and I don't care about any of them; when they make a joke it's not funny and lame. I was happy to see when they put Samuel Jackson back on screen as Pat Novak a host of a TV show where Samuel Jackson is the yelling, angry, speech giving s.o.b. we all love.\n\n With run of the mill story, wasting almost all the good talent, the only reason to watch this reboot is for the first person shots and Samuel Jackson. This movie is a waste of time and is a good example of if it's not broken DON'T FIX IT! Save yourself some time and watch the original. Cheers and remember I watch crappy movies so you don't have too.\n\n 3 out of 10\n\n Edited by Samantha Locke\n\nLike my reviews on Facebook at:  https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews\n\nFollow me on twitter at @FatMikeTPK",

            "content": "With the slew of remakes and reboots flooding the gates of Hollywood these days you wouldn't really be surprised to see anything get that kind of treatment. Usually when it does the first question asked tends to be \"do we really need another (insert movie here)\"? I can happily say with Jos\u00e9 Padilha's reboot of Robocop that the answer is a big fat yes!\n\nPadilha alters certain elements of the 1980's cult classic (and probably to the dismay of a lot of die hard fans) like Robo's partner is now an African American male, they change his origin story as well. The changing of the partner was a minor difference in the grand scheme of things, and the changing of Robocop's origin fit better with the overall theme of the movie.\n\nWhere as Robocop in the 80's featured themes about the media, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia, and human nature. The 2014 remake covers a lot of the same ground and in fact has even more meaning today as many of those thematic elements still exist of have worsened since 1987. Furthermore Padhilha's remake touches on drone attacks, removing the human element from work, and privacy (all of which are very hot topics).\n\nSo Robocop has the themes locked down. How does it play as a film? To my surprise it easily surpassed the bar I had set for it. Originally this movie was not pre-screened for critics which is usually a bad sign about how well it will be received. But after it's conclusion I found myself excited and eagerly awaiting a sequel (something that the ending leaves plenty of room for).\n\nWhile it isn't a gory as the original this new incarnation of Robocop packed in a ton of great action scenes, and while it shied away from being overly gory it certainly wasn't your standard \"PG Style\" action. From a cinematic standpoint everything looked great. The visuals looked solid throughout.\n\nWhat really hooked me was how much Joel Kinnaman brought to the role of Alex Murphy/Robocop. As Robocop he certainly channeled Peter Weller at times but brought his own thing to it. In fact I feel like he added more humanity to the character and even maybe deepened it a bit more.   I was truly caught off guard how real he made such a ridiculous character seem, he took what could have been some really awful scenes and totally made them work.\n\nMichael Keaton   also gets a ton of credit as Raymond Sellers the big bad guy in the film. Keaton really manages to walk the line of \"he's a bad guy, but I can kind of see where he is coming from\" and those types of villains are the best villains in the world. As the movie draws to a close there are a few moments though where he starts twirling his mustache a little bit too much.\n\nGary Oldman and Sam Jackson in secondary roles are both pretty darn solid throughout the movie as the voices for using Robocop to his fullest potential and for remembering that he is still a human being and should be treated as such.\n\nEven though there are some flaws that might be worth quibbling over the ultimate result is a movie with a relevant message while still being a fantastic science fiction action movie with lots of PEW! PEW! and BANG! BANG! but it is also well made, and obviously with some love for the original.  Given that you have no choice in whether this film would get made.......what more could you ask for?\n\nOh and hardcore Robo fans....... Don't worry to much about that black suit Alex Murphy dawns for the majority of the flick...... Let's just say it doesn't make until the end credits.",

            "content": "It is impossible for the new \"RoboCop\" film to avoid comparison to the 1987 original version, particularly for die-hard fans prepared to analyze the reboot with scrutiny and a sense of disillusionment for recreating a sci-fi classic. It has been years since I've watched the original \"RoboCop,\" and while some of its most iconic quotes and satirical themes still resonate with me, I made it a point to avoid re-watching the original film as I do when preparing for any remake or book adaptation. By experience, a re-watch or re-read will result in angry outbursts at the theater for minor dialog or plot changes, creating an insufferable experience for myself and anyone sitting near me. Of course, if you've never seen the original \"RoboCop,\" you have nothing to worry about.\n\n\tSurprisingly enough, \"RoboCop\" launches with the promise that it is, in fact, more in-tune with our present day political issues, or rather, the political issues we will be facing in the year 2028. We are immediately greeted by the strongly opinionated television news anchor Pat Novak, played with feverous entitlement by Samuel L. Jackson as he channels his inner Fox News reporter. Novak discusses the \"robo-phobic\" mentality of American robotic forces being used for military purposes, primarily in Tehran, where suicide-bombers sacrifice their lives to destroy the massive, war-prevention machines. Unfortunately, this irony goes largely unnoticed, along with the numerous chances \"RoboCop\" has to pose any effective political statements. The film becomes all too concerned with OmniCorp, a multinational corporation striving for the distribution of robotic soldiers for war, and ultimately, as law enforcement agents. The problem, however, is that Americans do not trust artificially intelligent forces due to their lack of human cognition and emotional responsiveness.\n\nRight on cue, we are introduced to Alex Murphy, a police detective who is violently killed in a car bomb explosion. Alex suffers severe burns on over 80% of his body and loses practically all of his limbs, making him OmniCorp's best suitor for the half-human, half-machine they dreamed of creating for public support. Alex's heart, lungs, and damaged brain are all that remain, displayed with gory yet beautiful detail in glass encasings. He is kept alive artificially within his black steel armor, and his brain chemistry is altered to react more like a machine than an emotional human. He is merely an illusion of depth, much like the remainder of the film, which relies entirely on explosive mayhem and an overly complex plot to hold the attention of its viewers.\n\nEventually, \"RoboCop\" manages to find the man inside the machine, attempting to convince us that there were affirmations of heart and humanity all along the way. This attempt is ultimately futile, because \"RoboCop\" is more concerned with guns and explosions than it is with human cognition, corporate greed, or political satire-something the original film did with imaginative perfection. By all accounts, the \"Robocop\" reboot is a largely entertaining film filled with action-packed sequences and spectacular CGI. It simply plays out too generically to leave a lasting impression.",

Recreating this idea, the cast were finely chosen to do roles very suitable to their skills, and the execution of the movie is good enough. Good enough though, is not good enough for a Robocop movie. At the end of the day, the satire is very forced, the action is very dulled down to cater to the PG rating. Hopefully, very soon, remakes, reboots, re-whatevers will cease to be made, as they are endless cheap knock-offs of the originals and just not good enough.",

With 2012 dishing out quality revamps such as the sensational Dredd and the phenomenal Total Recall, I was immediately interested when I heard RoboCop was being remade. I loved the excessive violence in the original I had a bad feeling this new one would tone that down and sadly they did. However, in replacement of violence comes questions of human nature, politics and social satire and it works very well. Instead of exposition we get Samuel L. Jackson shouting at the camera about why America is so robophobic, leading huge conglomerate Omnicorp to build a half man half machine that the Americans can rally behind. When dedicated cop Alex Murphy is caught in a deadly car explosion, Omnicorp jump in and fuse his remaining working organs to a metal machine. For a 12A rating, the moment you see what is left of Alex is startling and hard to watch, that scene is definitely a 15 rated moment. I loved the huge cast, it's like a dream assemble for me, no one gets underused and I loved the dialogue and interactions between Michael Keaton, Jennifer Ehle and Jay Baruchel, they were very well performed and written. Overall I was really impressed with this remake, it doesn't put dirt on the original and it features a well restrained but smart use of CGI, I loved the explosive opening although the rest of the movie is disappointingly short on action.",

            "content": "So, we had The Last Airbender that ruined cartoon series Avatar, thanks to M. Night (I wouldn't be surprised if this is the 'last' movie of the franchise). Michael Bay's trashing Transformers with his next (and hopefully his last) instalment called Age of Extinction (Suitable title). When I first saw the title, the trailers and the photos, I thought to myself that this is one of those films that's going to ruin the franchise. What's next? MLP? *Looks around*\n\nAfter seeing that movie... I found it surprisingly good. It was better than I expected. And yet, I don't see it as the best movie of the year but it's not the worst ever.  \n\nI admit, watching this has been a lot of fun, mainly with the action scenes and the drama. Drama-wise, I found it pretty decent and realistic. The main character literally got blown away by a trap set in his car and was surgically transformed into Robocop. He's got a family who are highly concerned for him, which is natural if you're a family man. We also have a scientist who specialises in machinery built as human limbs, who also has a compassionate heart. There's also a corporate man who would do anything to get anyone on his side. It's a predictable but still enjoyable plot.\n\nAs much I enjoyed the acting, the one who sold the show, like he often does was Samuel L. Jackson. Even though he was playing a minor role of being a presenter, who hosted a show that focused on politics and the security of his country, I keep getting a kick out of it because of how he narrated the goings-on and his thoughts of each scenario. His expressions were eye-opening and the presence made people want to listen to him.\n\nNow, action scenes. It's mainly just gun shooting. The scenes where Robocop was being tested out at the beginning and middle of the movie were pretty decent. But then, the rest becomes predictable. I can understand why a lot of those action films are rated 12A and PG13 (coughkidsalwaysbringinthemoneycough) but those film makers should at least put a little bit of 'oomph' and 'spark' into their battle scenes. And maybe more blood.\n\nAnother one of the negatives I like to point out is the Robocop outfit, if you can call it that. The first time I looked at the images of that without the paintjob, I thought it looked goofy in a bad way. But then the final outcome of it at the beginning of the film looked okay while it wasn't awe-inspiring. But to have the entire thing painted black? Well, since you have Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman also taking part, why not have the whole movie renamed 'Batman Beyond' or 'Batman 2028'? That could've pulled more customers in. Another question I wanna ask is that why does he still have his human hand?  I understand why the head and lungs are still there. Did somebody in the movie explain about the hand or did I miss something?\n\nOverall, one of the films that you can either love or hate. I, for one, liked it personally despite a few negatives. I wouldn't blame you people if you don't. In my opinion, this should be best watched if you got nothing better to do, or rather want to compare this to the original... which was better but I think a refresher is in order.\n\nPS: Should the sequel for this be made, just add more blood.",

This reboot does not attempt to do what the original did. It is a far different animal but it is not a bad one. If the original spoofed consumer culture in the 80s laying on a thick lather of sarcasm and gore this more modest PG 13 rated version tries to ensconce our modern day consumer and media culture: focus groups, marketing, globalized production and the ever-present camera and cellphone. \n\nActing wise the movie is a no starter. Samuel L. Jackson plays out of type and does it horribly, Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton chew up the scenery one as a tormented scientist, the other as a Ballmer meets Jobs no-holds-barred businessman and MK Williams and Jackie Earle Haley are under if not straight mis-used. Kinnaman does a decent job as a more family-focused Alex Murphy but he is unfit for the role any way you put it. The directing is competent but not outstanding, and while the concept and story aren't bad and manage to deliver within the constraints of the  PG13 rating one cannot help but think what robocop could have been with some decent practical effects and more worldbuilding. \n\nTl;Dr Watch Robocop with an open mind and it is an enjoyable if bland action movie. Compare it to the flawless 1980s version and you're going to have a bad time.",

The remake however is very different as that goes there is a more serious and blander tone to this film there are its fun moments but it lacked that energy for me. I had my reservations about this film but I let that go and just enjoyed it. I have to say I was greatly surprised by how much I actually liked and enjoyed this film its not as good as the original but I didnt hate it. The main lead as Alex Murphy was Joel Kinnaman an actor who Im actually not familiar with who I was quite impressed with, Abbie Cornish was okay in the role of his wife her character got kind of annoying at times, Gary Oldman usually always impresses me and Michael Keaton who I like as an actor was good but didnt convince me. The only biting wit and satire was in Samuel L. Jacksons role as the outspoken TV presenter and kind of acted as narrator in the film. The film was a good it wasnt boring it had many good points but one thing I didnt like was the villains in the story they didnt scare me or was as menacing as the original and Robocop didnt do anything as far as what a cop should do it tried to be too smart for its own good and it felt muddled in plot and story.

As with any remake expectations must be tempered even with a cast as alluring as this has. Even with a PG-13 rating, director Jose Padilha manages to turn in a decent action filled new take of the ultra violent 1987 cult classic of the same name.\n\nObviously we shouldn't be expecting any Oscar nods here for acting but the cast is solid and delivers more than you would expect. I've yet to see Joel Kinnaman in anything else but I'm pleased with his performance as the title character. Samuel L. Jackson continues to do his thing and is always good for a laugh but for me Gary Oldman really gives you more than you ask for with a movie of this nature.\n\nAs is the case with any remake you're going to have plenty in the \"hate it\" camp, it all depends on how you feel about the original and what you expect with this version. The story lines are pretty much the same but are told differently enough that this version can stand on its own in my opinion. The special effects are top notch and the action is exciting as well as engrossing. I also enjoyed this version taking on more of a human side and psychological view on what happens when you mix man and machine.\n\nFans of the original can expect to hear some of their favorite lines in this version which I thought was a nice touch and had hoped to hear them. The film doesn't try to do too much, yet it delivers more than just an action movie. It strikes that tricky balance of being more than you would expect but not trying too hard.\n\nIn the end I would recommend Robocop to fans of the original, action junkies, and average popcorn flick viewers. Please remember though, don't set your expectations too high, no remake should ever have high expectations. I went into this movie with the mindset of \"this looks decent, the cast is awesome, it certainly has the potential to be good but it will probably just be a good action movie\", I advise you to adopt the same and you'll be pleasantly surprised with what you find.",

No one wanted RoboCop to be remade as it is considered a classic action sci-fi that wasn't afraid to add some raunchiness. But there is more that meets the eye to this particular remake.\n\nIn the original film, Detective Murphy was never allowed any \"humanity\". The remake has more of a focus on the side of Murphy's family. It's practically a different situation. In this RoboCop world, the ED-209s and other machines have already been distributed to other countries, but are banned in the US. And countries like Iraq are sending out suicide bombers to tell the world how bad it is, only to be covered up with what must be Samuel L. Jackson's parody of Bill O'Reilly.\n\nActing in this film is pretty much summed up with Gary Oldman as Dr. Dennett Norton and Samuel L. Jackson as the heavily biased Pat Novak. They had solid performances, and the rest of the cast was okay. Nothing to brag about. Joel Kinnaman plays a good RoboCop, not so much Murphy. Abbie Cornish, who plays Murphy's wife Carla, has proven her ability to cry on command, as she does throughout the movie. Michael Keaton always made a great bad guy to me, he and Jay Baruchel make the meeting scenes interesting\n\nThe plot is significantly altered from it's original, as it involves the family of Murphy, and it has more substance to it. There's more to it than just revenge. Murphy isn't a mannequin put into a robotic suit, he's a head with organs, and one hand. He's struggling emotionally and physically, and I will say I cared more about this protagonist than the one from the original film. Also, Michael K. Williams plays a charismatic partner while the original Nancy Allen seems less likable.\n\nEven the motives for creating RoboCop are different, besides the common factor of money. The aspect of American politics added in makes it more interesting, and the question of free will is a refreshingly deeper question for the audience.\n\nAction was a bit less impressive than you'd expect. You get to see RoboCop arrest or shoot a lot of people, but it is fairly repetitive in how he does it. Nothing will ever compare to the 1987 RoboCop bold choices in both blood spurts and dark scenarios. As far as PG-13 goes, it's perfectly acceptable, but we all wanted a rated R RoboCop.\n\nBesides the redesigning of the costume, the added plotlines, and some and a disappoint amount of blood, the remake isn't too far off from the original for me to give this a bad rating. Williams and Jackson give some of the best lines, while Kinnaman is stuck with the old catchphrases. It's a well paced, easily followed action film, that will definitely let you kill two hours.\n\nRating: B-",

            "content": "Swanner:           Since this is remake week, with no less than three remakes opening, we're starting with Robocop. Based on the 1987 Peter Weller film, directed by hack director Paul Verhoeven, this new version offers up better special effects but little more than that. When you look at how this was constructed is all starts to make sense. The director Jose Padilha has only one other feature behind him and the screenplay was adapted by first timer scribe Joshua Zetumer with a no name lead actor. How could you expect more than the mess we got? I have 100 million dollars I want to make a movie with...let go with the new guys? \n\n  \n\nJudd:                HACK DIRECTOR?!?!?  You bite your tongue, sir! Paul Verhoeven is responsible for such delights as Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and the cult-classic Showgirls. The thing about Verhoeven, and I think this is what makes him genius, is that his movies exploit the lowest common denominator, taking it so far over the edge that he's satirizing the smut mouthbreathers lap up. There's a quote from Showgirls that sums up Verhoeven's work perfectly, \"What you're doing, at least it's honest. They want tits and ass, you give 'em tits and ass. Here, they pretend they want something else, and you still show them tits and ass.\"\n\n \n\nSwanner:           Back to reality and the review of the current Robocop. The story follows OmniCorp, a multinational defense conglomerate with the money and backing to do whatever they want...except to sell their security drones in America . CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) has the idea to morph man and machine with help from Scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman).  Enter Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) a good cop badly hurt in an explosion and perfect to become Robocop. At least that's what they were hoping for...\n\n \n\nJudd:                This incarnation of Robocop focuses on the transition from Alex Murphy to Robocop. While I love backstory, in this instance it was too much, especially when it had nothing to say. Like all movies made after the 80s, when it was OK to just be a hero, we're left with a flawed, emotional man pining for his family and revenge, and of course The Wife has to have a major role in it all.  Yawn. Verhoeven's Robocop skewered Regan's plans to privatize the military, corporate corruption and the idiocy of American culture. Padilha stripped out all the social commentary and added more 'splosions that the brain dead public remembers from the original. What little lampooning Padilha did came from watered down stock corporate slime balls, Jay Baruchel and Jennifer Ehle. Samuel L Jackson as a Fox-style blowhard was the closest thing to a message this movie had. \n\n  \n\nSwanner:           God darnit, Mr. Judd, you use your tongue prettier than a twenty dollar whore. You certainly are passionate about this one. I just found the first half boring and the second half, I just wanted it to end. You're right; there was no underlying story here. This film wasn't about anything, after the writer pithed the brainstem of this story all you had left was a lot of action sprinkled in with some tears (for the women). The equivalent of a Big Mac. Bulk with no substance. \n\n  \n\nJudd:                Robocop is one of my favorite movies, seriously and non-ironically, because of what it says and the way it says it. The first was a movie with great heart about an (mostly) emotionless cyborg. This remake is a heartless movie about a ridiculously emotional cyborg. While I really liked the way they showed us what was left of the man under the suit, it added a level of pity that was unnecessary. Verhoeven and Weller were out to kick ass and ask the more perceptive of us to reflect on our society.  The remake is an extended prequel for a franchise that feels like it was written by a focus group. It's got something for everyone and nothing that makes it special.\n\n  \n\nSwanner:           *\n\nJudd:                *",

But, like most remakes nowadays, it's not without it's flaws. The original is famous for it's satire of America's culture, mainly concerning the Reagan years. The new one has an interesting tidbit on drone warfare and a Fox News-esque tv host, but that's about the size of it. The reboot decided to be more of a straight-up, modern day action thriller, with less of the social commentary. The 1987 version's over-the-top violence and intriguing statements on government and free will are what made it so memorable, which is what the new film, again, like most remakes, lacks.

Poorly executed pacing, Sam Jacksons character evolves into more of a bleeding heart liberalist than an omniscience political news reporter. Badly timed pacing simply slows this film down to a grinding halt. Cutting to Sam Jackson right after fight sequences-it's like a frustrating rollercoaster ride where you're reaching that climactic sequence then, then-BAM the brakes are slammed on. I must admit at least they were consistent with Sam Jackson's monologues. Don't me wrong I dig Sam's talking but I came to see RoboCop kick some ass. Otherwise, this reboot was difficult to sink my teeth into and I wanted to. Some acts were great but nothing mind blowing. Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman attempted to smooth the rough edges out with their protagonistic and antagonistic performances but it wasn't enough script meat for a \"wow factor\".  \nThe emotional connection between RoboCop and his wife (played by Sucker Punch's Abbie Cornish) just wasn't there-it felt strained and fraudulent. Trust me. Abbie Cornish is very easy on the eyes and bad girl sexy-but I think she was casted as the wrong woman for this part. Maybe, Emma Watson or Natalie Portman could have added a strong emotional ying to RoboCop's yang. Joel Kinnaman (RoboCop) didn't fill the shoes, fit the part anesthetically (well there's not to much see when he's RoboCop), he seemed very shallow and confused while playing this role but again blame it on the script. He was very stoic, overwhelmed and unattached even as Alex Murphy, especially after watching his partner get shot in a horribly choreographed gun battle. Overall, didn't seem dialed in or excited about playing an iconic 80's character. Alright, the action sequences were sloppy, not logically sequenced, and the tight camera angles just make your eyes freak out with trying to sort out the action. The only action sequence that was slightly entertaining was when RoboCop has to pass the final exam with The Watchmen's Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) that was well done and then flat line. The plot of revenge was boring, clich\u00e9 and super predictable which that's acceptable but too obvious. The tech heavy and politically charged explanations were over the top and way too often-again let RoboCop kick ass. This is a dead in the water franchise-I highly doubt if a sequel will happen-the budget, marketing, promotion, percentage pay outs will be barely met and overall the film is dismissible. Too bad-the black suit was sick. Sadly, I must admit --wait for Netflix.",

            "content": "ROBOCOP\n\nLength:- 1hr 48mins\nGenre:- Action, Crime, Sci-Fi\nYear:- 2014\nDirector:- Jose Padiha.\nWriter:- Joshua Zetumer\nCast:- Joel Kinnaman (Alex Murphy / RoboCop), Michael Keaton (Raymond Sellars), Gary Oldman (Dr. Dennett Norton), Abbie Cornish (Clara Murphy), Jackie Earie Haley (Rick Mattox), Michael K. Williams (Jack Lewis - Murphy's Partner).\n\nIt's very hard to write a review of a movie that is a re-make without comparing one with the other!  Robocop 2014 has change the original script quite a bit.  With Robocop's partner now being a male African / American, played by Michael K. Williams (Jack Lewis - Murphy's Partner), instead of a  caucasian female (Officer Anne Lewis played by Nancy Allen) and featuring in it less!  I felt that there was next to no bonding aliment between Alex Murphy and his partner as there was in the original and once he became Robocop, his partner take a big backseat! There are new characters and some not as prominent anymore! The story revolves more around Murphy coming to terms with his life as a cyborg and how he functions - (am I man or machine?), than that of fighting crime. Which is the trade off when staying within budget of the film!  Off course if a sequel is made (and they may have had that in mind when making this), they will have plenty of time to work on the 'Fighting Crime' side of things!\n\nThey changed the way Officer Murphy (Robocop) was critically injured making him allegeable for the Robocop cyborg program, which I didn't think worked as well as in the original 1987 film. It was way more personal in the original when it came time to get back at the criminals that 'murdered' him, giving him better reason and ability to overwrite his software program enabling to keep his human aliment.  As a stand alone movie, without comparing with the original film, it was a descent script!\n\nJoel Kinnaman played Alex Murphy / RoboCop in the re-make, taking over the role from Peter Weller from the original.  Again; not wanting to compare actors playing the same role, (but I will) I have to say I personally preferred Peter Weller as RoboCop!  Joel Kinnaman didn't do a bad job, I just thought Peter Weller got the voice and the walk spot on!   Peter Weller looked and moved like a cyborg where Joel Kinnaman came across more like a man in a suit!  In saying that, they both did a good job at the role!  I think the audience can rally more behind the original Robocop character as his demise was far more gruesome than in the re-make!  As with most re-makes, different writers / directors come from different points of view, giving a completely different spin or take on the original, as was the case here!\n\nNow for my favourite subject, the special effects!  Although there wasn't a lot in the film, what they did have was awesome!  Special effects have come a long way since the original film in 1987, that's 27 years ago; and as a result, the effect are nicely polished!  No more model framing jerky animation!  The ED209's were flawless in their moment, and Robocop 'NEW' suit was well received!  But I still think that for 1987, they did an outstanding job for then.\n\nMorally is it ok to permanently wire a person into a machine to prolong a persons life?  Hell yeah!  We do it every time we put someone on a life system in a hospital!  The ethical or moral question here is were do you draw the line!  If it was possible to put say a persons brain into a robot, should it be done?  I mean it would be prolonging life right?  The movie raises more of a question then giving you the answer!  I'm not going to debate this here, but it is food for thought!\n\nEntertainment wise, I think it did an 'ok' job.  Not a WOW factor, but I did enjoy it.  I believe the original is a cult class with it's one liners and quirky funny commercials.  (I'll buy that for a dollar\") Which they managed to squeeze one in very poorly in the re-make, maybe as a small recognition or tribute to the original.  The characters aren't as deep and rounded as in the original, and you weren't able to connect to the characters as well either!\n\nCONCLUSION: It was a fun Sci-Fi film that took me back to when I was a kid, but it wasn't any Terminator 2 film which left you begging for more!  A sequel would be nice, as this was more of an introduction of the character than anything else!  If they did do a sequel, and now that they have the introduction done, I would except a well written, fast pace, action packed movie this time round!  Overall, an ok attempt of a class re-make!\n\nSTAR RATING: 3.5/5",

            "content": "\"Robophobia\" Samuel L. Jackson really? What was this mess? Essentially this film emphasizes the fact that the American people are on the fence about having law enforcement replaced by machines. And for good reason, emotions and compassion would make them hesitate. On to prolonging the life of the almost tragic nearly blown up hero Alex Murphy. Joel Kinnaman was perfectly cast for the cold and robotic parts of this film I have to admit but I think my biggest problem had to be Gary Oldman's confusing bedside manner. Who shows a trauma patient right after he wakes up that he has completely lost his entire body? And you expect him to NOT freak out? Anyway the lungs in a fishbowl idea was a nice graphic, as well as the design of the armor. But I felt no connection to the family or the main character. I was indifferent to Michael Keaton as the eventual villain and neither here nor there about the plot. The script didn't have any flair except for maybe Jackson's dialogue in the Novak report or whatever it was called. Unilateral and biased in his statements but that was probably the point. This movie flies well under the radar for me. Even the soundtrack was nothing to shout about.",

            "content": "His Review:\nThe year is 2028 and the multinational organization OmniCorp has supplied the world with law enforcement robots/machines that are lowering the crime rates to basically nothing.  However, in OmniCorp's home country, the United States, there is a bill in place that prevents the use of such robots on American soil.  Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), head of Omnicorp, realizes that the only way around this bill is to change public opinion to get the bill revoked.  In steps Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), who is a Detroit cop who was badly burned within an inch of his life by a criminal he was very close to catching.  Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman), who works for Omnicorp, gets Murphy's wife's (Abbie Cornish) permission to turn her husband into a crime fighting robot... but one the American people will love due to the fact that he has a conscience.\nBased loosely on the 1987 movie of the same name, Robocop offer a new kind of crime fighter that this time dons a black outer shell rather than sleek silver we all know.  Robocop dives much deeper in the word of humanities and politics that I would have liked.  Starting right off the bat with a political news report and debate about whether or not this practice is right, the movie never seemed to let go of the \"right or wrong\" aspect.  After the opening 20 minutes, which in my opinion were the most interesting, the movie just gets weird.  The scenes where it's basically a face on a pair of lungs is just poorly created and creepy.  Omnicorp can't seem to handle Alex Murphy's emotions and his pesky wife keeps getting in the way.  The people who want to see the Robocop project fail are just annoying and by the time we finally get some action, it's in the form of a training exercise with no true fight.  One shot and you're dead isn't fun to watch, and I'm really sorry but that black suit basically turns Robocop invisible as if he isn't even their.  You end up just seeing guns fire themselves as the shaky camera goes back and forth.  Another aspect I think hurt this film is the lead.  Who on Earth is Joel Kinnaman?  I had no relation, care or worry about our so called \"hero\" that the thought of him dying in battle didn't bother me.  I honestly can't think of 1 good point to make about this movie that was better than the original.  I mean they don't even wrap up the story surrounding Murphy's own \"murder\" even though he does revisit this later on in the movie.  It was nice seeing Michael Keaton back in a movie however, so that was a plus.  At the end of the day, good quality action we are all wanting to see is missing and this movie acts more like CNN than something trying to entertain.  I strongly would say, go watch the original.  Now that movie has shocking moments!  Co-starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Jackie Earl Haley, and Zach Grenier.\n5/10 Stars - This movie was too political with not enough quality action for my taste.  A remake that was unnecessary!",

In a reboot, OmniCorp is looking to bring their robotic police force to Detroit, but Americans don't want it because they don't like it doesn't have feelings. So they look to do a bit of a hybrid, and Robocop is born after he is blown up in a car-bomb at his home. Then in typical fashion, he is built and tested in China and is made to be as efficient as the robot while minimizing his feelings. I actually liked the first half of the movie despite me holding the original in high light and not looking forward to this film, but it made the story its own without being restrained by the original. However, it starts to follow the story a little too much in the third act or so and it just felt weird and out of place tonally. Kinnaman and Keaton are solid and Jackson provides solid comedic relief like only he can. Still not a fan of the black suit, felt too much like a dude in a suit, rather than a robot. They can add in heavy steps and robotic noise all they want, but all I see is a guy in heavy tactical attire. Really wish this went completely its own story instead of following so close to the original near the end, could have been so much better. Maybe if they do a sequel, but I doubt that will happen.",

Nope, this is fiction (or is it)\n\nSo this is a remake of Robocop of the 1980's, pretty much the same story with a few twists and while watching remakes, we tend to compare the original to the remake, it's better to go into this movie and enjoy it for what it is, an updated version with its own take on the story. The premise is pretty much similar in that Alex Murphy is involved in an accident that  takes way pretty much the whole lower half of his body, which paves the way for OmniCorp to finally try out it's experiment of putting a man into a machine. \n\nOverall, the acting is as good as expected and the movie provides some neat turns in that Robocop goes a little Rouge in going after the people responsible for putting him in the situation of having to be transformed into a machine, which includes corruption within the police department, which then leads to the head of OmniCorp to want to permanently pull the plug on Robocop and Alex Murphy.",

Hollywood, take note: when setting out to remake a well-liked film from the 80s (I'm looking at you, Terminator reboot), try and do something original with the material. This version jettisons the original's satire and religious elements (sorry, no RoboJesus here) and aims to use the Sci-Fi elements for a thoughtful commentary on free will and humanity, when man and machine are combined, and whether America's interest in robotic war is leading us into worse imperialistic tendencies. Unfortunately, Robocop needs to have his sights checked, because the movie consistently keeps missing the mark. The parts of the thoughtful commentary are all there, but the film never really does anything with them, leaving talking heads and exposition to do all the work. Even then, the characters are terribly inconsistent in both their actions and motivations. One minute, Gary Oldman's doctor has sold his soul to the devil and conspired to rob Alex Murphy of his free will, the next he's saving him only to turn around and try to stop him from bringing the villains to justice. Meanwhile, Michael Keaton's greedy CEO (is there ever any other kind in Hollywood movies?) goes for a massive conspiracy and cover-up that's this side of cartoon villainy. The poor aim of the story tellers extends into the action, where the film fails to capitalize on modern effects technology to create something more interesting than what came before, settling instead for some thinly-disguised retreads of sequences from the original. A lesser sin is the half-hearted nods to the original thrown in. Almost all are awkward and amount to nothing more than winks to members of the audience that might be nostalgic. I would have rather the filmmakers had spent a bit more effort and time improving their film's story and plot, than on almost-clever nods to the original (look at me, I just used that \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" line).",

Robocop is a completely unnecessary, lukewarm remake of a stellar original that lacks in pretty much every conceivable department (except for its technical specs).  While Paul Verhoeven's 1987 action classic was an edgy violent, daring, bitingly satirical, merciless, take on corporate greed and the cost society bears, Jose Padilha's unconvincing remake tries very hard to demonize today's media culture and take another shot at the whole corporate shebang amidst an action plot with no discernible purpose.  Alex Murphy (Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman, best known for the TV series The Killing) is a good cop who, like in the original, is left for dead after attempting to take down a crime kingpin.  Omnicorp, a company attempting to bring its robot killing machines to America, fashions him into a crime-fighting cyborg, which doesn't quite perform the way they envision.  The film moves at a good pace, and a few of the action scenes are handled with aplomb (the gunfight in the dark at the villain's lair is handled with notable style and grit) but the movie fails to take off and turns into a damp squib.  None of the bite of the original, which continues to make for powerful viewing even today, has transferred to the new version.  Instead we are treated to a rather threadbare plot that tries too hard, a bunch of underwritten characters and a few action scenes that hold this together.  The cast is the only silver lining here, with some great work by Gary Oldman, Michael K. Williams (Chalky White from Boardwalk Empire), Jackie Earle Haley and Kinnaman.  In fact, this comes off as a passable American action flick - which is criminal considering how stunning the original still is.",

What's the point in parodying American rah-rah and right-wing nuttery if there's no real point? This new Robocop is all surface. In for Peter Weller is Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy, best known for AMC's The Killing. Kinnaman certainly looks the part just fine. When it comes to police work he's all business with some edge. He gets softened with a wife and child in the form of Abbie Cornish, who carries the certainty that her husband is still the man she fell in love with, whether man or machine. Scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman, adding some gravitas to the mix) thinks he's a good man with his heart stil lin the right place as well. Before things get too mushy there's Michael Keaton as the standard evil corporate suit and Samuel L. Jackson as a right-wing-ish commmentator of the future (2038 to be exact). Even the action scenes are saddled with PG-13 sheen that can't hold a candle to Verhoeven's madcap R-rated violence (he was esepcially fond of seeing fake bodies pummeled with bullets). A rebooted Robocop could have worked but at the same time feels more sad than anything given its Detroit-in-decay setting and themes of corporate chicanery that are more a reality than they were in 1987. This Robocop is trying to have it both ways by trying to channel Verhoeven's genius and get all emo on us. Neither works.",

            "content": "The original 1987 film is one of the seminal films of my youth. It still stands today in my top 5 favorite films of all-time. I was never much of a fan of its equels. Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were pretty terrible films, especially given the classic status of the original.\n\nI must admit I wasn't particularly thrilled with the news of this remake, but they won me over with the cast-list. Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L Jackson, Michael K. Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Jay Baruchel. That is one heck of a cool group of actors!\n\nAfter having sat through it, i have to say i didn't hate it. It was easily superior to any of the ROBOCOP SEQUELS, and a decent action film in its own right. The classic tale of corporate greed is decently updated for the modern militarized world, and i thought it took a fresh take on its look at the humanity of Robocop.\n\nAbbie Cornish was a surprise to me here. I really liked her performance as Clara Murphy. I wasn't such a huge fan of Joel Kinnaman in the Alex Murphy role, but was satisfied with his performance once he becomes Robocop. \n\nThis had some decent action sequences, and some terrific visuals and effects. I thought the ending was kind of rushed/abrupt and could have been played out better, a-la the wild west showdown of the finale, but still.....\n\nI didn't hate this film. In fact, I kinda liked it. Its not the original, but its a good action movie that stands on its own. 7/10",

It's not perfect - the action scenes are okay, and it drags it little in the middle - but it's a far better movie than a lot of recent mindless action flicks.

The ending was near great - in the last few minues, but was to late to redeam its NAME.  I love SciFi - if they were to call the move \"Cyborg Tatical Cop\" or someting - I could give it a much better rating as a High Def chessy SciFi move.  Loved the original sound piece that they played at the begining , hoping that they were going to use that thoughout the move-  they used it once, then used a softer less dramatic music piece. The introduction to Robo cop was lame(the first ime he is seen on screen). I saw this last week, but if my memory recall corect-  he is straped to that body harness.  He is first swa as a helpless Victum, NOt a Robot COP about to kick bu** and take names.  I personally did not like the full face look, I perfur the eye visor.  One of the things that made the movie DULL - was they took his glam.  the suit he starts out with is great.  it is eye catching , Shinny, tough looking, futuristic..ect.  BUt \"lets paint it tatical black- all of it...  Ok now he is prepared to be a \"cat burgurlar\".  He lost his apeal.  NO more gloss, shine , or even two-tone.  just flat black- and boing.  There were some cool shooting and gun fighting sceens, but with the back and fourth of \"he is a rouge, crazy robot out of control - TO he is awesome and everybody is going to love him\" - built on that to loong - confussing ...ROBOT COP is not a faluar- the Movie was..!!!  I loved that that made it pg-13 and cut the F** bomb out ; that and it had \"Robo Cop\"  -other that that.  DONT WAST YOUR MONEY.  FIND, RENT, BUY , STREEM, whatever..

Some say it should never have been made, some say it's okay but not as good as the original, and some say it's just a pathetic cash cow. I, however, disagree. While the film itself is mainly hit-or-miss, the CGI available today is able to make the robots much more believable looking and give some credibility to the bionic/robotic aspect of things. On the same note, the modern applications of synthetic prosthetics also give the film that much more realism. Unfortunately, the CGI is also a downside, as it gets used so much that it nearly pushes the boundaries of believability at some points. Still, the glimpse at the man inside the machine is a nice touhc that was missing from the original and, along with the \"modern\" glimpses at other robot prosthetics used in the film's world, really helps to keep it grounded, realistic, and above all, good.",

There isn't much of a story, the pacing is fairly slow, the characters aren't particularly interesting, and everything is too watered-down and justifed as to not offend. That said, it isn't as bad as some other remakes of classics (such as 'Total Recall'), and is, if you were going to give it 'a' positive, 'watchable' (to a degree).

Granted, that is no reason for seeing a film, let alone remake one, but if I am totally honest, there are some nice little touches here and there updating the film to make it more relevant to our times and furthermore, the narrative doesn't totally rehash everything from the original (another reason for the total fail of Total Remake - sic) and tries to do something slightly different in the new version in order to justify (albeit not wholly successfully) this film's existence. The cast is solid - Oldman is watchable, reprising a role not dissimilar from his in the Dark Knight trilogy and Kinnaman is visually pleasing and reasonably competent, acting-wise. Replacing the humour with satire might not have worked perfectly but it is the more bloodless (12 certificate) violence, that takes the thrills (and joy/fun factor) away, turning those scenes into watching someone else plays a videogame (the amazing graphics are cute and useful narratively but is almost too slick here). In the end, the film peaks too early and left us with a slight whimper in an anticlimactic climax. Just because you can doesn't mean you should - and while this is not a Total (Recall) disaster (in fact, it makes this look like a masterpiece), it still ultimately feels a little unnecessary and redundant.",

            "content": "The war on terrorism saw the rise of drone warfare that not only saved lives of soldiers on field but also improved the military's attacking prowess. The future portrayed by director Jose Padilha (Elite Squad) is much more sophisticated with droids and weaponized machines taking the place of real soldiers in combative warfare. The essence of both the original Robocop and its remake is that they are reflective of their times. Padilha exposes the need for human emotions and sensibilities that are lacking in even the most advanced machines and how that need becomes completely irrelevant when politics and mean businesses are in control of who or what is on the street, protecting civilians. Alex Murphy is as human as a robot can get and the movie deals with his conflict between a controlling software and the brain's emotional impulses. His family wants the human, Omnicorp desires the Robot while American citizens are shrouded in political darkness.\n\n\tIn a live report covering Operation Freedom in Tehran, Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) asserts the success of robots in peacekeeping abroad while questioning America's reservations against employing the technology within its borders. Novak maybe overly patriotic but his allegiance to Omnicorp soon becomes ridiculously obvious. Sellars (Michael Keaton) brilliantly plays the head of the robotics conglomerate Omnicorp that employs Dr. Norton's (Gary Oldman) genius in robotic prosthesis to create the most human-robot peacekeeper that can win over Americans. After a suspicious explosion, Murphy's salvaged organs are then given a Robotic body that keeps him well alive but devoid of sensibilities that often try to overcome his programmed actions. His wife, though glad of his survival, is cynical of Omnicorp's real intent and Murphy's whimsical attitude towards his family. Meanwhile, Robocop is a hit for the citizens of Detroit as he nabs numerous law breakers in a short period. As he investigates and closes each crime incident, the inevitable occurs when his own accident comes under his scanner. Murphy's persistence in finding the mastermind makes him a nemesis of both Omicorp and the law. That's when Robocop goes crazy.\n\n\tJose Padilha's screenplay and direction question morality, justice and freedom in the application of robotic warfare. Constantly, it is Murphy's inquisitive human nature behind the stoic and methodical Robocop that becomes the distinct feature of this installment. The battle between man and machine is well delineated in both emotional and physical aspects. Jose's take on this 1987 franchise is of course technologically advanced and while the shoot-out sequence in the abandoned warehouse is thrilling enough to be the best of the movie, there's little else that impresses much. Today's suit could be loaded with weapons but we mostly have Murphy pulling out the gun from his thigh as expected. But damn! That Motorbike......\n\n\tJoel Kinnaman doesn't create the greatest appeal in Robocop's shoes but give him time to play the emotions that range from shock, devastation and anger to see what he is capable of. Gary Oldman is excellent in his dedication to helping mankind rather than supporting malpractice and he would be quite a pillar in this franchise. Samuel Jackson is lavishly over-the-top but that's not his fault. Michael Keaton convinces us of his ambition, greed and confidence in his technology to the extent that he is at times, not wrong. You dislike what he does to the Murphys but you still support his initiatives for America. \n\n\tMurphy's inability to be with his family and his struggle to overcome the shock of his accident are the emotional platforms on which, corporation evil and politics make up for \ndirty business. The proceedings get predictable and may even drag the film between action sequences but clearly, MGM & Sony Pictures' intention is to tease with sequels that can build on the platform.\n\n\t- 6.882 on a scale of 1-10.",

There are even times when the movie is presented with opportunities to make this version work but completely chokes each time. What keeps this movie from being total trash is the acting and cast. Joel Kinnaman does a fair job as Alex Murphy but no one would have come close to Peter Weller. Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson nail their roles. Michael Keaton as well but the script at times felt like it was just under using his character. Nice Batman reference to wanting to go in black however. And where the hell was Ann Lewis and all the pain the original Robocop suffered. Going to stop there because I can go on about it with spoiler after spoiler. In conclusion this movie set a very weak stage and if there are any sequel hopefully it can be taken in a much better direction with as little as it has at the moment.",

            "content": "When a trailer for this remake of \"Robocop\" started airing, people were scared or outraged and I was myself feeling pretty uneasy about it. How do you remake the masterpiece that is Paul Verhoven's ultra-violent satirical sci-fi film? Well, if you want to do it right you pay attention to what people loved about the first film and you decide to go in a completely different direction, focussing less on a comedic tone and more on the action and on the psychological components. I'm not going to say that this one is as good as the original, far from it. However, this new model of \"Robocop\" is a clever update that pulls its share of new tricks, has some good action scenes and will keep you entertained. The story is vastly different here, with only the bare premise in common so let's start with the setup: It's the near future and OmniCorp, a robotics development company is trying to find a way to sell its products to the United States for use in law enforcement. The problem is that the Dreyfus Act prevents robots from being used in situations where human life can be taken. Their way to sell the idea of robots as law enforcement to the populace is to introduce a hero to the city of Detroit. Half-man, half-machine, this proposed \"RoboCop\" will have the efficiencies of the tactical officers OmniCorp is already using all around the world but will still have that element of human judgement. When policeman Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is gravely injured by crime boss Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow) he is rebuilt and sent to clean up the streets. But what is Alex now, is he man, or machine and if he is both, where does one component end and the other begin?\n\nThis movie has its share of problems, particularly towards the end of the film where the villains become way too villainy. Yeah they're sleazy businessmen and murderers, but they push it a bit too far and treat life as if it's just slightly too cheap to be completely believable. In turn, this affects the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, which turns the plot into a fairly routine action film. Aside from that though, the film is quite well realized. The thing is that this film doesn't really want to be a remake of the original 1983 movie. It just takes the idea of a cyborg cop and asks: what can we do with this? Why would someone build a cyborg police officer? What kind of moral dilemmas and decisions would be associated with this? How would the process affect the man and the people who love him? and how does a machine with a man inside compare to a purely mechanical counterpart? These are some really solid ideas, most of which were only glanced at in the original movie so this film feels fresh. You might be weeping at what you perceive as an immediate sign of trouble, the \"PG\" rating but let me assure you that this rating is only there because for a significant part of the action Alex Murphy is battling other robots and even the most brutal dismemberments of machines doesn't affect the MPAA very much. That's not to say that there aren't confrontations between Murphy and regular people, there's a really cool, fast-paced action sequence where Robocop is facing dozens of opponents and takes a real beating. Most of the human confrontations take a more dramatic form however. Case and point, the lead scientist in charge of the Robocop project, Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman). The doctor is forced to make some decisions that are morally questionable in order to get the \"product\" on the streets but he retains the idea that inside Robocop still beats the heart of Alex Murphy and this constant battle between him, the higher-ups at OmniCorp and Murphy's struggle to figure out who or what he is make for some good breaks between the action sequences. We've also got a nice sub-plot about Alex's family dealing with the fact that the man they knew and loved is pretty much gone. Though his soul remains at least partially there, he's been replaced with metal and he isn't exactly the typical dad anymore.\n\nAdding to the movie's charm are some interesting side characters (including Samuel Jackson as a loud-mouthed talk show host who's a big fan of robots), a nice variety in the opponents pitted against Robocop (varying from the updated ED-209 to human-sized androids, common criminals and elite tacticians with a bone to pick with our hero) and some pretty solid special effects too. One of the things I found most interesting about the film is that with the updated technology and special effects, this Robocop was able to move faster, move fluidly and take a big beating while in combat. Setting aside the comedy and the satire and focussing more on the drama gives us a hero that in his own way, feels more vulnerable than you would expect a cyborg to be. I'm a huge fan of the original fan and let me tell you: there's plenty of room on the streets of Detroit for 2 Robocops. One in his old beaten-up cruiser wading through criminals like a tank and blowing them away with his hand-cannon while reciting one-liners in his monotone, synthesized and the other on his speedy motorcycle and red visor, taking aim at criminals and bringing them down while duel-wielding pistols, doing his best to measure up to the expectations of his supervisors (and audiences).\n\nI say go check out this 2014 version of \"Robocop\" and you will be pleasantly surprised. It's different enough that it doesn't feel like just a re-hash and there are plenty of moments that will have your blood pumping. You'll leave the theatre with that awesome theme song in your head, a smile on your face and while we're waiting for a sequel to this one, there's nothing that prevents you from visiting that old classic again.",

This movie did a good job with the action and visual effects and had a good story, not great, that makes it a good watch. But the immersive graphic environment of the first movie has not been matched to date and until someone steps up in the movie industry and makes a serious R-rated action sci fi film, like Dredd, with this franchise it is always gonna be a less than it could be movie franchise. I enjoyed the movie, it is definitely worth taking 2 hours out of your week and watching. It will not make you think deep thoughts about the universe or change your views on the world, but the movie is a good piece on entertainment, which is not a bad thing.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS UNTIL THE WARNING.\nRobocop 2014 stands above the majority of cookie-cutter action movies which are churned out by Hollywood. \n\nIt's been deeply flawed though, by the heavy hand of Sony. The story has concessions to be an entertainment movie, the most obvious one is to be a PG-13 movie, which cuts down one of the pillars of the original, which is no-holds-barred explicit violence. \nCrude violence is not gratuitous in the original narrative because it serves to paint the bleak picture of the failure of the state to keep an orderly society. It is an integral part of the original narrative.\n\nBut Sony just HAS to sell toys, so that's cut off, and the movie is flawed with other problems in the argument and the story development, climax and epilogue. Shame on you, Sony, and your heavy hand.\n\nIt has redeeming qualities though. The filmography is very well executed. It draws in a visual language of FPS games in action scenes which will tune in with the new generations. \n\nThere is a rather large amount of screen time dedicated to character development - although that development is sometimes stinted by the hand Sony, not going as far as it could. Still, it goes above and beyond most action movies, and is worth noting. \n\nAs far as the director is allowed to go in social commentary, it is commendable that he manages to touch several very up-to-date issues which are a very real concern to world politics in general. In the context of Hollywood blockbusters, the message contained in the movie is sound. In the context of the Robocop legacy (inevitable comparison) though, it is too timid and shy. It rips off the bandages like a nurse in PMT which just lost her boyfriend for the neighborhood hottie, but does not have the guts to tuck the finger inside the wound and push the maggots out, like the original does.\n\nSo given the factors that Sony stinted the story, because she IS Novak after all, that bad remakes removes desire from subsequent remakes, and that the American audience is not that much used and comfortable with such a candid view to its own plagues, the result is a domestic flop, with overseas moderate success.\n\nThe fact that opinions are divided on the movie is telling that it is worth noting though. A movie with unanimous average reviews is very different from a movie with very good and very bad reviews. \n\nI am giving it 3 stars because it has so much wasted potential, but I think it's almost impossible to have anything better, given that the franchise is in the hands of Sony. \n\nMy hope lies now in seeing in the future a 'director's cut' with a PG-17 or M rating, like it should have had from the beginning, giving the director more leeway in the story than it was allowed to him in this initial release. \n\nGiven the box office flop though, I think it's very unlikely to have a Drirector's Cut anytime soon. \n\nHERETOFORE SPOILERS ABOUND:\n\nWith the spoiler tag behind me, now I can talk about what bothered me most. \n\nThe movie forces characters in 2D good-vs-evil characters too hard, without enough justification. \n\nFirst Beef: Mattox, the military guy who programmed the EM208 models (and presumably ED-209 too). He is too setereotypically boisterous and arrogant, with too little redeeming qualities, pushing him into the evil-nemesis-bound-to-be-killed-at-the-end corner in a few shots. \nAlso: he programmed the AI? Alone? Where is his programming team etc.? While it's OK to have a muscular ner sometimes, he is a typical grunt/sidekick for the 'covert villain'  that is Sellars, to whom I will spare my punches for a later date. \nAlso: taser vengeance between him and Murphy was tacky. I sense Sony fillers in here.\n\nSecond Beef: The fact that the original Robocop had his family's memories erased and the he slowly begins to recreate/rediscover his identity is a powerful motif. It works wonderfully in the original movie, and we feel his pain as he goes back to his abandoned house in the original, and recovers small, scattered parts of what he used to be, before having a fit of anger while trying to deal with it. \nThe introduction of a family and the implications on how he is/is not a product are squandered though. His wife and kid are cardboard cuts, so much bidimensional they are. Wife is a bad cast, she never convinces the audience of her suffering. Boy similarly has no opportunity to show his grief, or perhaps naive detachment - what if he found it cool to have a robot dad? He could just be an 8-year old and just not having enough emotional baggage to understand the full personal implications of losing your organic body, even if it is to get a kickass-robot one. \nThe wife complaining to the media has little consequence to the story. If she was better cast, she could have had a more prominent, non-action, whistleblowery position with more impact.\n\nThird beef: That should have come before really. A CAR EXPLOSION. It tears away one arm and one leg and burns 80% of his body. But... an explosion should expand outwards and upwards! His body should be blown to smithereens, especially his head should be severed/gibbed, given the nature of the explosion. \nAnd... No facial scars. STILL HAS HIS EYEBROWS HAIR even though he has been through an explosion which burned 80% of his body. \nYeah children must like him, must sell action figures. Eyebrow hair, no facial scars. \nMaybe, just maybe, he could have like dropped his keys or phone while he was moving to close the door, so that the door acted as a shield to his face - partially. But that would be enough just to have his head to be severed out, not to save him from burns of the rapid energy release of an explosive device, which would engulf him, door or no door. \nThat is a moment which could have made use of a bullet-time, MAYBE. \nRedeeming factor:  the explosion was a nice, unglorious depiction, of an actual explosion, with his body lumping at the house stairs. \nThe commercialy-driven concessions made to the damage to Murphy's body are regrettable though. The eyebrow-less, stretched skin of the original are superior.\n\nFourth beef: ED-209 not going rogue on innocent americans or police force. Should have payed service to  the original here, not just blowing up a middle eastern holding a knife in the beginning of the movie.\n\nFifth beef: The wife is blondie, and the corrupt police Chief Karen Dean is afican-american. We alreay have two other bad guys, with her three, which are non-white. And ALL higher-ups which are non-white are bad. Only his partner is a 'good' black guy. \nMaybe if his wife was afro-american and the comissary  white, it could be a better story. \nRedeeming factor: the 'at least now you are the right color' joke seemed to be fit to me. \n\nSixth beef: Final face-off at the top of the tower.\nSellars pulls an all-out BAD GUY SPEECH at the end? SERIOUSLY?\nSomeone should have given him a red lightsaber and black cape, or some white paint and a green wig (and purple tuxedo). And borrow Christian Bale's sore throat voice.\nThat was the most cringe-inducing moment. Threaten Murphy's family at THAT moment? For what purpose? It was completely unnecessary, as was his death. \nThat polarization of the character only serves to paint him as an all-out bad guy, to make the movie more 'upbeat' - bad guy gets punished in the end, is dead, game over, end of story. Shame on Sony. \nHow Murphy mysteriously is able to override the RED ASSET directive is never made clear. It's just spooky magic, to the detriment of the story, a big WTF moment. \n\nThe  movie could have had a darker ending, with Sellars never getting out of the 'vilalin closet', Murphy getting in fact shut down at the helipad, and later his wife whistleblowing the RED ASSET as a military directive which was intentionally introduced in Robocop's programming in violation of police protocol and the law, since Murphy was unable to make his arrest as he should be able to as a cop. \n\nOCP would cut down the funding to the Robocop program, but be barred from shutting down life support for Murphy, as that would be murder.\n\nShe should keep fighting along with Dr. Norton to force OCP to live up to the contract they had with her and completely rebuild Robocop, and to have free access to her husband, as Sellars tries to buy his way to freedom or 'house arrest' in a very comfortable penthouse, which would amount to practically nothing, as he would keep doing business as usual. \n\nIt would be bleaker, but open-ended, paving the way for a sequel. \n\nInstead, what we got is a shitty 'villain dies in the end' superhero movie. Granted, the bad guy dies in the end of the original too, but in a more grandiose way. If Sony just let the movie go harsher in real-life parallelisms, money should have helped the bad guy get away.",

This has some pretty good (albeit difficult to see with the excessive amount of in-your-face shaky cam) action scenes and some fairly compelling ideas, and to the film's credit it doesn't try to stick too closely to the original, but it is nowhere near as good as that one. Making this PG-13 was a choice that will make them more money, but hurts the movie. This is fairly solid entertainment in a dead period of theatrical releases, but Verhoeven's RoboCop is superior in every way.",
