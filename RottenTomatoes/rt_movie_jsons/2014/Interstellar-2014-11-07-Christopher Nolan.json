Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.",

            "content": "I was absolutely enthralled the entire way through and couldn't bring myself to leave my seat despite needing to use the bathroom for the last hour or so of the film. A compelling and fascinating sci-fi experience that examines time, family, loneliness, fear, courage, and moral responsibility. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is also fantastic. A must-see for any sci-fi fan.",

            "content": "A nice movie with very good visuals, which reaches its greatest when defining a world in decadence with extreme realism, but its lowest when recurring to storytelling mechanisms that have become a bit too obvious for audiences familiarised with time-travel sci-fi. In general, I recommend it. The best: the way Nolan depicts a decadent humanity without either the use of guilt and blame characteristic of climate change-based accounts nor the exaggerated thunders of catastrophic events movies; just a slow, unavoidable path into decadence, where civilization has to fold on itself \u2013or not.",

            "content": "An All Time Classic. Phenomenally edited and incredibly imaginative cinematography with a epic story to back it up. the music is very good but I wouldn't call it catchy, though it is very memorable. The pacing is a perfect slow burn that suits the complicated story perfectly. The acting is phenomenal as well. though it takes some time to warm up to everyone, once the slow burn builds momentum the acting builds right along with it. This is a film everyone should see once. The less you know about the story the better.",

            "content": "In November of 2014 I was 8 years old; my parents were never particularly cinephiles. As long as I have lived with my parents, they pressed quality cinema and literature upon me. My Mother can't recall what possessed her to take me to the movies on that unusually warm November night. It wasn't often that my parents would let me spend time in front of screens or eating junk food and candy, this was a rare treat. I was wide eyed and happy, oblivious to what I was about to witness. Often in this age of the internet we forget that our access to knowledge and news was constricted. Being an elementary school student without access to any computers or phones I had no knowledge of what I didn't see in advertisements, hear in school or learn from my parents. One of my main memories from that first viewing was confusion and drowsiness. A run time of nearly 3 hours and I had stayed up way past my bedtime. But what that night did was it laid the foundation. I have never written a movie review before; for a while I have considered diving into scriptwriting and involving myself further in cinema, but I couldn't find the right channel. I recently realized that reviews, even if they remain unread, are a great way to channel my passion. I chose to review this film for a single reason: it's stunning. Christopher Nolan is perhaps one of the greatest filmmakers ever. Interstellar's incredible cinematography and attention to detail with the addition of Hans Zimmer's greatest soundtrack demands the viewer's full attention. I look forward to the day that Interstellar will be passed in excellence by the next masterpiece. However, for now Cooper's journey to find home is the greatest movie of all time.",
