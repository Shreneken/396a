Caught in a forbidden love, Hercules is exiled by his stepfather, the king, and sold into slavery. The legendary strongman endures harrowing battles and death matches in the gladiators arena, and must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom, overthrow its traitorous ruler and restore peace to the land.",

Swords missing from bodies, cuts and wounds magically gone.  It was great.\n\nThere was no real plot - people went and did things - then went and did more things for no reason.  They never made you care about anything they were doing.  For instance - Hercules was a gladiator and suddenly he was the best gladiator...after one fight and no story building.  Things sort of just popped out of nowhere and happened - and porn stars tried to act for longer than their standard contractual obligation.  It was head scratching.\n\nThis could have been a good movie - with different actors, a story, something to care about, and a script that wasn't written and directed by Hayden Christensen. \n\nIn closing - porn stars should not act.",

I watched it twice and the second convinced me that this is still a movie to see, it's true there is no Brad Pitt (Troy), nor Russell Crowe (Gladiator), nor Clash of the Titans , etc., but it's still a movie to watch, there are fights in the arena, homeric battles with great special effects reinforcements, for me it's a good movie, and I rate it 8 stars out of 10 , like what all tastes are in nature, it's up to you to conclude, it's done and it's OK.",

They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind.",

You will not believe how stupid this all looks, it will blow your mind.\nThe movie has no plot what so ever but it kind of feels like this we see Hercules with another name which you won't remember or care for, his brother takes credit for killing the lion that Hercules kills is going to marry the princess but she doesn't want to marry him cause she loves Hercules, Hercules is presumed dead. But he does a gladiator type thing gets kidnapped and bands an army who will fight beside him to stop the king and his brother.\nThere was another Hercules movie that came out after this one and while I don't like it and consider it to be kind of bad, I honestly think that was a better adaption of the legend of Hercules then this. All this film seems to be is some sort of Greek film with a famous character with one poor action scene after another that consist of slow mo when you know for a fact it isn't needed. Along with all the other horrendous movies that have come out this year it like the actors are sleep walking or are a loaf of bread.\nWhen I think of a movie that says the legend of(insert famous character) I'm always hoping it will be awesome but it never is.

            "content": "Unoriginal, abysmally uninspired, and unintentionally hilarious, The Legend of Hercules is lifeless (expect some laughable parts) and uninteresting in every way.\n\nPlease stop me if you heard this before. Hercules (Kellan Lutz), who is the son of Zeus, is a half-god, half-man blessed with extraordinary strength. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King (Scott Adkins), and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers to fight his ways back to his rightful kingdom. Through harrowing battles and gladiator-arena death matches, Hercules embarks on a legendary odyssey to overthrow the King and restore peace to the land.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules is one of the worst fantasy action films in years. And plus, it is the worst film that I saw in 2014. It is baffling that someone like Renny Harlin (who gave us Die Hard 2- which is a better film) made this film and release it into theaters into the dumping-ground of January. Not only that, the movie did not make its budget back. Which leads to the question: where did the seventy million dollars when? the actors? the effect? like where?\n\nSpeaking of the effects, they are not good. The effects are some the most terrible effects I have ever seen. I never seen effects wholly inept in every way. It is just that bad. \n\nThe movie is just unoriginal (like I said before). It borrows from Gladiator and 300 (which are better films that I could have been watching instead of this) especially 300 because of the super stylized slo-mo action. And speaking of that, enough with slo-mo already. I really hate when bad movies use the slo-mo to their effect and make it look cool. Yes, they use it in 300 but it really works in that film. However, in this film, it is like Renny Harlin said, \"Let's see how can I make it worse.\"\n\nThe costumes in The Legend of Hercules look very cheap. It is like they went to Goodwill and brought the costumes there. It is just lol funny. And no the acting wasn't any better. In fact, the acting is much worse than the costumes. Kellan Kutz might be handsome guy (which I don't mind sometimes) but he is not a strong actor. Plus, he was from the Twilight series. So yea..... And no the rest of the cast was not good either. Plus, everyone in this film yells and growls including the bad guys.\n\nAnd lastly, the green-screen is just one of the worst things I have ever encountered. It is like the filmmakers including Harlin did not make an effort to make it better. How can Harlin make a movie this bad? But I guess they ran out budget. \n\nThe Legend of Hercules is an incredibly awful film in every way. There is not one good or decent thing about the entire project (if you want to call it that). If anyone want to make a movie, please watch this film. It will show you how to not make a movie. Everybody else, please watch the animated film. It is so much better.",

By attempting to model itself on previous battle arena based films it's very unlikely that it will prevail, but it did have a moderately watchable storyline that could be followed if not always enjoyed. I don't think I was aware of any of the actors or actresses in this but that's not to say they didn't do a good job. The lack of emotional impact made this film suffer, whilst there was too much love themed interaction, and not enough battle based footage. I was left a little confused by the end, and it certainly looked like its scenes were made for the 3d viewer as opposed to the film critics amongst us. It will no doubt be (if it's not already) a forgotten entity that is not in the league of Clash of the Titans and such like. I think these movies have had their time and I can't think of a suitable target audience for this anymore as teenage boys are no longer into action figures or strong powerful warriors as its all about girls, fast cars, and non stop action - why do you think they have made a countless number of Fast & Furious movies to date? With the high tech special effects and weopanry, there's enough to keep us amused for a short while, but this movie lacks a cutting edge, lacks familiar faces, blood, and basically any real purpose.

If that wasn't enough, the visual aesthetic is very much a CGI-heavy melange of 300, with the super stylized slow-mo action standing in the way for plot. A sword-and-sandals epic should not be on the verge of putting you to sleep, but Hercules goes there. Kellan Lutz (Twilight) might have the right build to fill out the character but he's too limited as an actor to do much beyond the fight choreography. The only reason to see this movie is if you're trapped on an airplane and it happens to be on. Who would have thought that the flawed Brett Ratner-directed Hercules movie would look even better?\n\nNate's Grade: D",

This movie butchers its story so badly and the filmmakers did not care whatsoever about what they were doing and they made everything dull in this lackluster film. Every performance seemed fake, every line of dialogue was delivered in a bland way, and the action scenes were so poorly directed. The cgi and green screen were so god awful that I felt like I was watching a film from 1965. The action sequences were really bad because there was too much slow-motion going on and it added absolutely nothing to the fight scenes. Kellan Lutz may be built for the role, but he can't act worth a damn and he had zero charisma throughout. Liam McIntyre and Scott Adkins are the worst in the film in my opinion and every time one of them delivered a line of dialogue it was laughable and cringe-worthy. The costumes looked so cheap and they didn't look right in the movie, because all the clothing looked brand new and was just prepared too nicely on every scene because that is not how clothing should look back then. Overall, this is absolutely the worst film I have seen in 2014 and it most certainly the worst Greek mythology movie out there.",

There's no need to give a plot synopsis because everyone knows the story of Hercules already. Let's start with the acting in this three course breakdown. First off, everyone is terrible. There's no sidestepping that fact. Secondly, and most importantly, Kellan Lutz is a horrible, uncharismatic actor. He's about as wooden as Hayden Christensen. Then there's the pacing. You have the cheesy love story thrown in with the usual hero returning home to rid the kingdom of evil and, well, you know the rest. The problem is, it's so poorly written that it just feels like it drags on for hours upon hours. And to help make the seemingly never ending runtime even more unbearable are the horrifying visual effects. I understand it's in 3D, but these visual effects look like they're ripped right out of a very bad Syfy film, which is an insult to Syfy films. By the time it ends, it's clear why this was put out in the movie graveyard earlier in the year, because this is a horrible, horrible film.",

The mythology can be ambiguous and include several historical figures' fates, all with their own rich and diverse back-stories, which can be perplexing. Somehow, the script must take on this complicated task, simplify it and yet retain the tale's integrity.\n\nThere are many things that are at fault in The Legend of Hercules, first of which is the story. King Amphitryon is a loathsome tyrant whom Queen Alcmene despises and wishes to overthrow somehow. Born and conceived to be the savior of Ancient Greece by his mother Queen Alcmene with Zeus, Hercules is a prince. Hercules' older brother Iphicles resents Hercules for his strength, leadership and mother's love. Hercules' paramour Hebe, the Princess of Crete, is to marry his brother Iphicles as a union of their lands. Hercules and Hebe dare to pursue their love in spite of the arrangement and a clash of sovereignty gets underway.\n\nAt face value this is what happened in the film. This is also only the first twenty minutes of the film, your guess is as good as mine for the rest. Besides the mythological origin story of Hercules there is little mythology anywhere else. Hera is reduced to a melancholic prophetess witch. And Hercules is instead in the middle of a political upheaval for power.\n\nSecondly, the characters are pretty abysmal. The story has no development of any relationships and you sense no history between the characters. Hercules is reduced to a stoic barbarian. Kellan Lutz's impression of Hercules can be summarized as a muscular man who speaks loudly, lacks any emotion, always runs into battle scenes snarling, and scrunches his eyebrows.\n\nThird key feature causing the inevitable demise of this film is the action scenes! This is an action movie, and they are horrible. Any chance to marvel at the abilities of the actors and stuntmen is ruined by Renny Harlin's decision to always have the action sequence in slow-motion, in every single scene, every single time!\n\nHarlin also overly stylizes the film, ripping off movies like 300.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules wanted to be an epic film packed with intense battles and a simple story of love and one man's purpose. It was instead a big disappointment and waste of time.",

This take on Hercules borrows too much and results in nothing; it barely holds itself for an hour and a half, because one minute more and it would be unwatchable.\r\n\r\nThe movie looks cheap, really REALLY cheap. This is something a YouTube filmmaker would do in special effects. It is understandable, as it's an independent production for a website, and it's only looking for recognition so it can have an opportunity in something and for those standards, it's high. But this is a Hollywood film, so it begs the question why this looks so bad. It's a large combination of bad elements, which all ultimately forms the conclusion that the guys making this doesn't know what they're doing. The film is shot dreadfully, as the shots lack any wonder or Golden Composition. It stablishes nothing. The action scenes have too many quick edits that's hard to tell what just happened half the time. If that wasn't enough, there's a lot of slow-motion & speed up shots that really got tiring even before the film shows them. Also, these guys don't seem to know what lighting is for in films; there's a lot of shots with too much bright and barely have multi-colors on those.\r\n\r\nAnd this film lacks any originality: the story is generic and bland, there are no characters, there's no more story other than a plot, and when it comes to styles, this film steals from many other sword & sandals movies, most notably Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus, William Wyler's Ben-Hur, Zack Snyder's 300 and Ridely Scott's Gladiator, and even the TV Series Spartacus and Vikings. It steals so much it might as well be a compilation of clips from all these movies. Some of the action scenes almost work, but they're shot so dreadfully and deliver so little impact and emotion that they're nothing but a desperate excuse for entertainment when the film has literally nothing to offer. It's a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and IS bad. It's literally nothing but rip-offs of other movies you've seen a million of times. If you thought Disney's Hercules was too much of a change, well, look again!\r\n\r\nThe Legend of Hercules is pure emptiness and simply nothing to worry about, as surely nobody will remember this after a few days, and it will let itself be forgotten by history. I can't believe I will ever say this, but given the result of this one, I really hope Brett Ratner does better...if a film makes you say that, it means either you or the film reached the rock-bottom.",

The leading character certainly had the physic of Hercules but, he didn't have any screen charisma at all. The storyline wasn't that bad and the fighting scenes were impressive, but it the characters really let the film down. I honesty think that it came out to near the release of Hercules starring a The Rock, which will obviously get the audiences running to the cinema. Anyway, it's not bad if you just want to see some fight scenes without much depth but, if you expecting the true story of Hercules then you will be let down. Average!\n\nRound-Up:\nWith such a big budget, the director should have invested in some decent actors. The guy who plays the lead, Kellan Lutz, also starred in the Twilight franchise and he played the lead in that awful movie Arena with Samuel L. Jackson. I don't think that anyone will remember any of his previous roles and I doubt that this film will make his career blossom. You might recognise the girl who plays his mum, Roxanne McKee, who was in Hollyoaks and Eastenders. Anyway, with such a high budget, I was expecting a Troy like movie but, this film will be forgotten after a while.Â \n\nBudget: $70million\nWorldwide Gross: $61million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic tales about Hercules using his strength and power to free himself and his friends from captivity. 3/10",

Add in other more specific bits like the bad guys blackmailing a character into giving them information on the hero's plans by the threatening the life of their kid (leading to the hero's capture) and a scene with the evil brother giving up on trying to win over the leading and lady and outright telling her he is going to have her and conceive an heir, and it all seems particularly shameless. Now you pretty much know what this movie is. It's what you would get if you had had the Sci-Fi (oh wait, now it's \"SyFy\", because poor literacy is cool I guess) Channel had made Ridley Scott's acclaimed epic \"GLADIATOR\". (Which I hope that synopsis made obvious) It's visual style feels near directly ripped from Zack Snyder's \"300\", the presentation of the characters of Hercules and Iphicles feel like they are channeling (aside from Maximus and Commodus that is) Thor and Loki from the Marvel Studios films (Kellan Lutz at times feeling like he's actually doing a Chris Hemsworth impression), and my dad even amusingly pointed out that at a point it also seems to draw heavily from Kevin Costner's \"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES\" of all things. Now harkening back to previous films is nothing new, and doesn't make or break a movie in of itself. Even \"GLADIATOR\" itself took strong influence from swords and sandals epics from Hollywood's golden age. Namely \"SPARTACUS\", \"BEN-HUR\", and \"THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\". However it in spite of that also manages to tell it's own story and tell it extremely well. With its own themes, ideas, and characterizations/character arcs. Making for an all around great film. This movie by comparison just feels very cookie cutter in how it's put together. The story feels very rushed, with a number of plot points feeling under-developed. Top that off with what consists of mostly poor acting, dodgy what looks like TV level CGI, as well as cheap looking sets and costumes and you are left with what is mostly a sour film experience. So that begs the question of whether or not there was anything I liked in this movie. Well, I was hoping that it would be a lot more funny than it was. With a 3% here on the Tomatometer I was hoping we'd get a hilarious disaster of \"PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE\" proportions, but alas it wasn't aside from a few moments. The biggest being how fake the Naemean lion looks. Scott Adkins, who plays the film's lead villain, is amusing in an ironic way. As they not only try to make him look like Gerard Butler's Leonidas, but he tries to desperately act like him as well. Going so far as to try to shout all his dialogue ferociously. (I mean come on man, even Gerard Butler reigned it in every one in a while. haha) A couple of the action scenes can admittedly be serviceably entertaining in a bare-bones sort of way, but they're nothing spectacular. (Like say the ones in the films this is clearly channeling) However the slow-mo is abused to no end, and not used with the same level of technical ability as someone like say Zack Snyder. If I were to try and grasp at straws for anything good to say about this movie I guess I could bring up that Gaia Weiss is pretty easy on the eyes, but let's face it. This is Hollywood and that's almost always the case at this point. Add on the fact that her performance is pretty bad however as well. (LOL, sorry I just couldn't resist) Anyway, what is easily the best thing about this film is Liam McIntire, who plays Hercules' closest friend and ally throughout the film. (Best known for being the second guy to play Spartacus the eponymous lead of the Starz television series, which I admittedly have not seen at this time) He gives a legitimately good performance and has a likable screen presence. Giving a lot more effort than the film feels like it deserves, or that most others in the production did. So at the end of the day, I'd say you can easily skip this one. As the guys over in the Spill Crew put it, the film feels like a Direct-To-Video mockbuster that was actually released in theaters. As if to ride the wave of a bunch of other swords and sandals films that came out this year (\"300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE\", \"POMPEII\", and of course most obviously \"HERCULES\" starring Dwayne Johnson) to try and make a quick buck. It's too lazy, uninspired, and done in a sub-par fashion to recommend, but is not so in what can be seen as a campy/ironic way. Though keep in mind that this is of course all just in my own opinion.",

            "content": "So every few years or so, a new mythological movie comes out. Examples have been Troy, 300, 300: Rise of an empire, The Immortals and so on and so forth. Hercules has always been one of the most famous topics for film, animation, books, comics, games and shows. But then this year brought us possibly one of the worst Mythological film disasters ever, The Legend of Hercules. This film was directed by Renny Harlin, do you remember this guy? Well he did Cliffhanger, Deep Blue sea and Die hard 2. So not so much a bad lineup of films (not a good line up either) so you should expect something half way decent. Well that my friends is a brutal thought to have. Hercules should be something exciting and over the top and Harlin managed to make a film that was dull, lifeless, full of errors and just totally terrible. How, Might be the question you are asking. How could you make a bad film about Hercules, well if you truly want to know watch this film and find out.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules stars Twilight boy wonder Kellan Lutz as the Demigod Hercules; and straight to DVD action king Scott Adkins as King Amphitryon. Kellan Lutz is so uninspired in this film, he walks around with a blank expression a majority of the time. It was like someone had taken a picture of him with a blank stare and Cg'ed that same empty expression on his face the whole time. His acting is bland, and I couldn't buy him as Hercules. Who made that decision? Well regardless there are some good things about this movie and I will focus on it now. Surprisingly, Scott Adkins is actually the best part of this movie. He gives you something to look forward in the droll events that happen when he is off the screen. I would have almost been willing to have cast Scott Adkins as Hercules. He has so much energy as well as intensity; he basically carries this whole bland affair, but that's the only good part.\n\nThe story line is very simple, in Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, who is Hercules knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time.\n\nThe story seems simple enough, but the action is poorly executed. Hercules stabs someone with a spear and I could actually see the guy holding the spear in between his arm and his rib cage........was this film seriously that strapped for cash? It must have been, because the CGI is terrible. The whole movie looked like an episode of the Deadliest Warrior on Spike Tv.  It is staggering to me that with mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time. What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. I can say that Kevin Sorbo did a better Hercules than Kellan Lutz. All and all this maybe the worst film of the year so far.\n\nFINAL RATING 1/10",

I disliked Hercules (2014) but compared to this movie, that movie is a grand masterpiece.\nI cannot even begin saying how much the CGI is used and abused on this movie. For god's sakes, it is 2014! Stop using the CGI so much! It's time to go back to the basics were worked was actually required to do these things. God!\n\nThe editing is bad, the graphics can be decent at times, and at other very f***ng CGI'd. I hate this movie. Literally, I hate it. I find it repulsive and a big waste of almost 2 hours. Units seem to disappear and re-appear, the people cross bridges only to be back before it and then after it as if magic! Oh wait, it's just bad CGI! Christ!\n\nAnother thing I hated? The slow-motion. I thought 300 was annoying with the slow-motion but this has a most annoying habit of showing up every single time Alcides (I refuse to call him Hercules) was doing a bloody stunt. Damn him and the movie. \n\nThe inconsistencies, bad editing, poor dialogue and emotion, and the abuse of the CGI just ruined this movie for me. No matter what else is left. Oh, and also? Scenes just skipped and ended so fast you could not even get invested on them. \n\nThis movie is an aberration. It's a 1 out of 10 (.5 stars) and that, once more, is giving it TOO much credit.",

            "content": "Although I was a fan of Renny Harlin, the main reason I wanted to see The Legend of Hercules was because it was an example of a film with a massive budget which was seriously critically panned and I just needed to know how it went so wrong.\n\nIt is clear that The Legend of Hercules is attempting to cash in on the success of 300 and more specifically its recent sequel 300: Rise of an Empire because it follows essentially the same style. But its success is a lot lesser because the excess of visual effects in the film and the lacklustre locations that the film is shot on fail to give it any kind of legitimacy. It just makes it all look cheap, and it is too eay to believe that the film takes place in the modern day because its cinematography is conventional and its definition is high quality which means it is really easy to pick up on the cheap aspects of the setting. Essentially, The Legend of Hercules is a very unconvincing and cheap looking film which spent the majority of its $70 million budget on lacklustre visual effects while the scenery and costumes seem to be recycled from the recent film Immortals. The \nI don't understand how Renny Harlin, an accomplished film director who has created films with fun visual effects such as Deep Blue See could not realise just how lacklustre the visuals are in The Legend of Hercules. It is so clear that the actors are interacting with greenscreens the entire time because as well as the fact that they are so disconnected from the entire world around them. The Legend of Hercules could have been a good guilty pleasure if the visual effects were toned up more. I mean, they establish some decent action scenes at times, but all in all they just were not impressive. Renny Harlin could have used the visual effects in moderation in The Legend of Hercules at the right moments and focused more on live action scenes, but his excessive dedication to them and lack of focus on establishing strong physical elements that exist beyond a computer studio end up being the central problem in The Legend of Hercules. To a certain extent, I was able to look beyond that. But not to a point where I would consider The Legend of Hercules a good film.\nThe only thing I hoped that would be any good in The Legend of Hercules was the action. Although the action scenes were choreographed well and managed to use a touch of visual effects to a decent extent at times ,the issue is that they seem too artificial. By that I mean they are largely unrealistic in nature even when they are simple close contact battle scenes, and the characters do not go through a touch of blood or gore in the process. The fact is that the action scenes have a certain extent of entertainment to them and frankly they were better than I had expected, but the cheap visual effects has a habit of showing a bit too often. I guess I didn't mind too much because in a world tainted with terrible action films, The Legend of Hercules still stands out as a better film than A Good Day to Die Hard, Taken 2 and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. It is a poorly made film, but it is certainly underrated and does not deserve the kind of flack that it received. The simple fact is that it is not a story of Hercules, it is an excuse to dress up Twilight actor Kellan Lutz in revealing clothing and have him show off his abs as he fights off other poor actors and terribly rendered CGI lions. If you can look past that as well as the total lack of sense in the storytelling then perhaps you may enjoy the film. Its best qualities are that it has some decent action scenes, although there is a feeling that there could have been more of them and that they did not rush by so past. If you go into the film with really low expectations like I did, you will not be surprised at scenes depicting Kellan Lutz randomly diving backwards into a waterfall and rescuing his girlfriend from drowning in a river. It is clearly marketed at the teenage audiences, and it is believable that many are dumb enough to fall under the spell of the film while they're busy swooning for the former Twilight star to fight off his opressors. The point is, there is definitely a certain level of dumb fun in the film, and the amount that the audience is actually able to locate will explain precisely how much they end up enjoying The Legend of Hercules. But the most picky of people will look at it and say that it is crap, because in actual fact it is.\nThe script of the film is terrible, and the acting is no better. But considering that the only cast members are underwear models, former Twilight actor Kellan Lutz, Jean-Claude Van Damme's right hand man Scott Adkins and essentially nobody else you would have ever heard of, that's practically the expectation. There are really no characters in The Legend of Hercules and the film is not in the slightest about Hercules, it is a mockbuster of 300 with a higher budget and yet lesser quality visual effects. It delivers some decent action scenes which are entertaining while the rest of the qualities in the film ranging from storytelling to the script and to the acting are so poor that they are laughable, as is the general visual style of the film. You cannot have expectations for a film like this to be good, even if you are a fan of Renny Harlin because it simply cannot be when it is a front for Kellan Lutz to parade around shirtless. But he makes a decent action hero and has me thinking he might be good in The Expendables 3, so at least it left me optimistic.\n\nSo The Legend of Hercules is crap because it is poorly acted, thinly scripted, cannot tell a story and looks surprisingly cheap regardless of its high budget and could not really have any less to do with Hercules himself. But if you go in with the expectations of it to have quality of a film by The Asylum and hoping for some slightly decent action scenes, you may not find yourself to be too disappointed.",

This has some of the worst CGI I've seen in years, as far as the standard Hollywood blockbusters go nowadays, the script is sloppily written, and it is not directed very well either, which is a shame due to who was at the helm. Renny Harlin is not the only one responsible here, but he should have chosen a different film to work on. \"The Legend of Hercules\" is everything you would expect it to be and less.

All it is is 300/Gladiator/Pompeii shoved into one movie. Oh, and don't even get me started on the acting. This movie isn't even laughable, which would have made it a GOOD bad movie.

Have you ever gone to the theater to watch a film and thought to yourself, \"Why was this film ever made?\" Normally, January is the dumping ground for garbage Hollywood films, but some should not even exist, and The Legend of Hercules is one them. Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2) has made some real stinkers in the past (12 Rounds, Exorcist - The Beginning and Deep Blue Sea), but this film is an epic failure and a major insult to intelligence. \n\nOur story begins with Hercules (Kellan Lutz), who is betrayed by King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love. Now, Hercules must fight his way back on top to overthrow the king and to take back his rightful kingdom. Sound familiar? Lutz may have the brawn but his performance is dull, along with all the other actors in this film. Scriptwriters Sean Hood (Conan the Barbarian ... the remake) and Daniel Giat cannot even muster up a half-baked script, instead opting to rehash old story lines with nothing new to add. It's basically a mediocre imitation of films like Ben-Hur (a hero put to work as a boat rower), Gladiator (thrown into slavery only to redeem himself in the arena) and Spartacus (a prisoner rising up to lead a mass revolt against barbarians). With lazy writing, awful dialog and amateur acting, \n\nHercules fails to be called a brainless action film or even a dramatic one. On top of that, Harlin throws in cheap-looking slow-motion action scenes. The slow motion may have helped the Spartans look cool in 300, but here it makes Hercules look amateur. As if things could not get any worse for the film, Harlin also decides to turn it into a bloated 3-D flick. Now I am beginning to see why this film was not screened for advanced critics. It currently holds a 3 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. If you want to keep your sanity and not waste your money, then I would advise you to stay away from this film.",

Without getting too deep into the details, because it is absolutely unnecessary, this is a reimagining of the Greek hero, and I promise you that you haven't heard this story told this way before.  Here is what this movie is: if a Shakespeare impersonator was contracted to pen a story about a mythological figure, but then told he only had 3 hours to submit the final draft, he would scramble and put together something like The Legend of Hercules.  This is directed by infamous schlock director Renny Harlin, who would be on the same level of Uwe Boll, but he is a modicum more competent behind the camera, which at least makes his movies watchable.  He gets all of his actors to deliver some truly atrocious lines of dialogue not only with a straight face, but with conviction, which is a flabbergasting feat, all things considered.  Despite itself, this story keeps moving forward, giving you one outrageous action sequence after another with loads of Zack Snyder-esque speed up/slo-mo shots and shameless 3-D usage.  Having just watched Pompeii and 300: Rise of an Empire, I can honestly tell you that I would rather watch this.  You will at least get entertainment value here because it is constantly surprising you with the preposterous, which makes it the perfect movie to watch with friends over drinks, especially if the Rifftrax guys ever choose to cover this.",

To be fair though the name Stelios aka  is Greek as well as some other names in\nthe movie so kudos on that! This movie is a delightfully horrible mixture of the following movies: 300,jesus of nazareth, thor, highlander, braveheart and  gladiator with the subtle yet obvious influence of god of war. I think that sums up the epicness of this movie. 4/10...Got to see what The Rocks pulls out with his version of Hercules in July.",

The story goes very simply: Queen Alcmene is knocked up by the Greek God Zeus one night and the King Amphitryon exiles the son of Zeus who is known as Hercules. He exiles Hercules because he fears of being overthrown which is what exactly happens so expect the predictable. \n\nThe movie is bombarded by cliches from the film 300 and the television show Spartacus.

Évezredek óta mindenki a hatalmat akar, a politikusak, a rendez?k, a színészek, az énekesek, mindenki. \nEzért is az ember a legkegyetlenebb faj a világon, mert teljesen mindegy, hogy 204-et vagy 2014-et írunk, a hatalomra mindig is szüksége volt az embereknek.\nHa van valamid, ami értékes, akkor befolyásod van, akkor nagy ember vagy, ha nincs semmid, akkor elmehetsz a fenébe.\nEz van Herkulesnél is, Zeusz fiánál, akinek féltestvére a királyi trónra akar ülni mindenáron, de természetesen f?h?sünk ebben nem meglep? módon megakadályozza.\nÉs mit is ér egy Herkules film ?rjít? szerelem nélkül? Hát persze... A forgatókönyv oly módon rossz lett, hogy egy háromévesnek is b?vebb szókincs jutott, mint a drága íróknak, a speciális effektek pedig b?n rosszak, s?t, ez a film egyenesen b?ncselekmény.\n\nEgy b?ncselekmény, ami ellen nem lehet tenni semmit. Mindig lesznek bátor egyfilmes rendez?k, akik beletesznek néhány effektust és szerelmi jelenetet az alkotásba, mehet a vágószobába, onnan pedig, ha támogatást kapnak, egyenesen a mozikba.\nA baj csak az, hogy ez nem igaz. Egy viszonylag tehetséges rendez?vel volt dolgunk, aki nem más mint Renny Harlin, aki a Die Hard 2-?t és a Cliffhanger-t is rendezte.\nSosem értettem, hogy egy olyan rendez?, aki életébe legalább egy normális produkciót kiadott a kezéb?l, hogy csinálhat értékelhetetlen, s?t, kritikán aluli filmeket.\nMert a zsigereiben érzem, hogy ez a film még egy billenty?leütést sem ér, de gondoljunk bele, miért is lenne jó?\n\nA szebb napokat is megélt Kellan Lutzért, Hercules szerepében, vagy az említésre sem érdemes kibontakoztatásért, vagy a forgatókönyvért?\nNálam akkor telt be a pohár, amikor még a film elején megláttam azt a borzalmas sivatagi effektet. Legszívesebben belevertem volna a fejemet a vászonba, de inkább mély lélegzetet vettem, és végignéztem.\nNem változott semmi, s?t, talán az eleje még \"jobb\", mint a közepe és a vége, tehát akinek már az els? része sem tetszett, mint nekem, ne számítson túl sok jóra.\nAz egyetlen, ami megmenthette volna Hercules-t a biztos bukástól, az a díszlet. Oké, attól, hogy minden gyönyör?en fel van építve az egész, attól ez még egy pocsék movie, de akkor is jobb.\nSajnos aki a szebb díszletet várja, annak is csalódni kell. Igazából az egész film egy nagy csalódás, a színészekt?l át a kellékes feleségéig. Egyszóval szégyent hoztak Herculesre, szégyent hoztak a Lionsgate-re, szégyent hoztak az egész szerepl?gárdára és a stábra, szóval aki ennél a filmnél nem kap epilepsziás rohamot, az tényleg igazi ember.\n\nKiknek ajánlom:\nAkik vezekelni szeretnének elkövetett b?neikért.\nAkik egy brutálisan rossz filmet akarnak látni.\nAkik még nem tudják, mi a jó és mi a rossz. (Néha úgy érzem, az ilyesfajta emberek szerencsések)\n\nKiknek nem ajánlom:\nAkiknek van egy kis csöppnyi eszük.\nAkik értékelik a jó filmeket, és nem akarnak depresszióba esni.\nAkik tudják, ki az a Kellan Lutz.\nAkiknek még jelent valamit az, hogy film.\n\n10/1,5\n5/0,5\nF",

Here I was looking forward to watching an incredibly shitty film for me to tear a new asshole, and instead I end up liking this nonsensical sword-and-sandals film.\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting to, considering this film holds a shockingly awful 3% fresh here on Rotten Tomatoes, with a dismal 37% approval from the users (At the time of this writing, though it will probably drop into the low 30's or possibly even the 20's range). So, imagine my shock when I found that I actually tolerated one of the year's worst-reviewed films.\n\nIs it schlocky? Yes. Is it something you've already seen before? Yes, if you've seen films like 300, Gladiator, or any film or TV show with similar ideas, you already know what's coming. Are the special effects bad? Yes. Is the plot filled with soap opera theatrics? Indeed. It has all the makings for something I should hate (And everyone else rightfully hates), and yet, I can't bring myself to hate it, even though I should.\n\nThe plot of course, focuses on Hercules. Wanting to stop her husband's reign of terror across the land, the queen asks the gods to find a way to stop him, and she is granted this wish in the form of birthing a child named Hercules who will be both human and god, who will also be fathered by Zeus.\n\nThe king is furious to walk in on his wife during a strange and unintentionally hilarious sex scene where Zeus, who is invisible, proceeds to have sex with the fully dressed queen (Who is moaning with pleasure and gyrating from the awesome dry humping sex with a god), and thinks that there is a man who managed to escape from the room and doesn't know of his wife's prayer or her deal with the gods.\n\nHe disowns his newborn son and names him Arsades, even though his real name is Hercules, and he will never be able to rise to the throne. As he grows up, Hercules is treated like crap by his older brother and his father, and also falls in love with a princess named Hebe, whom he can't be with as she is about to be wed to his own brother.\n\nWhen Hercules and Hebe try to escape, they are caught and Hercules is sent to the battlefield with a very small army, which is then destroyed except for him and army's commander and the two are sold into slavery and forced to become fighters. The two end up fighting their way to victory, and now Hercules and his growing following must stop his father's reign and win back Hebe before it's too late, while also discovering his awesome god-like powers along the way.\n\nWhen it came to the acting, I felt the actors did a solid job considering how cheesy and cliched the script was. However, their performances can only take them so far before the script completely hams up their performances through ridiculous scenes (Like the sex scene I mentioned).\n\nThe action itself is filled with all sorts of over the top moments, lots of slow motion, some poor T&A inserted in (PG-13 T&A doesn't add up to much, that's for sure), ham-fisted romance, soap opera-level drama, and lots of unintentionally funny moments, which for me, ultimately saved the film from being a loss.\n\nUnless you're up for a poor man's PG-13 version of 300 or Gladiator, mixed with a lot of cheesy scenes, a cliched and dumb script, and cheesy drama, this is not for you. But, if you can stomach some pretty dumb films and are a hardened B-movie fanatic, there might be something you can find in this nonsensical film for unintentional humor purposes. I actually like it, even though I shouldn't.",

The action was perfect,  the fighting styles accurate, and over all a great action movie. The acting was great,  don't hate on Kellan Lutz just because he's new to the game. He did a great job,  as did Liam from Spartacus. He brought a bit of that into it which showed he was more then capable for the roll. For all the reviews I've seen about a bad CGI Lion... just don't write reviews alright? Don't discredit a movie due to one animal in one scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  Hercules was the perfect balance of mortal and God,  people would be complaining if he had to much God power for crying out loud. The whole point of Hercules is that he's a demigod. Half mortal,  half God, son of Zeus and a mortal mother. Not more or less either way. What are you mad a giant hydra didn't pop out? You all complaining about the bloody lion would of complained about how many heads the hydra would have.... having to do nothing with the movie along with the lion. The action was great, casting was great, my only complaint was that it got discredited by a pack of fools. The same fools who will comment on the next transformers movie saying that there's to many robots fighting.....enjoy a movie for what it is,  a great action,  mythology movie.",

It's only a notch above that, but being that as it may, it's still not a good movie. The most disappointing thing for me is that it's sad to see Renny Harlin in a situation wherein he has to make movies in the style of more popular movies. Not that he's the world's greatest director, but there was a time when Renny Harlin was, dare I say, cutting edge and had some fresh ideas on how to approach making movies. Now I may have this all wrong and the studio behind this film may have pushed him into making the film look like a Zack Snyder/The Lord of the Rings/Gladiator hybrid, but who knows for sure? The movie looks fine, but there's nothing fresh or appealing about it. We've seen all of this before, ad infinitum, and without any passion or any creative spark behind it, it fails. I can't even say that it's so bad that it's funny either, which would be the movie's only saving grace. But when you get right down to it, it will ultimately be a mostly forgotten movie. I'm sure that young men, specifically in the 13 to 23 bracket, will find some enjoyment out of it, but most everyone else just won't care that much.",

Though this movie was destined to bomb at the box, the instant Kellan Lutz was signed on as the Lead. Lol Incidentally enough the Casting Director himself has even stated that Kellan himself was no Hercules... prior to production... which makes just about enough sense as this film.\nThe only thing I even bothered remembering about a the Legend of Hercules, was that the actor who played Spartacus (Liam Mcyintyre) was a supporting role... which was a mistake because even Liam's acting presence was stronger then Lutz's... \nI would've been more upset at the fact that I wasted 2 hours of my life, but because I Downloaded that Piece of Shit movie for free...

Oddly it strives to be anything but a story about Zeus' demi-god son.  Instead it simply rips off other movies.  It's like \"Gladiator\" meets \"300\" meets \"Thor\" meets \"Twilight\".  The combination is not a good one.\r\n\r\nSince Zeus covets the lovely mortal Queen Alcmene, Hera approaches the Queen and says that she might as well have sex with the god, so that she can have a big strong strapping baby boy.  Zeus has his way with her and nine months later Herc is born.\r\n\r\nHercules (Kellan Lutz) grows to be superior to his conniving older brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan), who just can't wait to be king.  He starts plotting to marry the heir to another kingdom, even though she only has eyes for Herc.  Meanwhile, Iphicles evil father banishes Hercules to Egypt where he is captured as a slave.  There he must fight in arenas for his freedom.\r\n\r\nAnyone else notice the similarities to the movie \"Thor\", especially with the evil, older brother who just happens to look and act a whole lot like Loki?  Lutz proves himself not much of an actor.  He barely manages to do his best Russell Crowe impression while he growls his way through his screen-chewing speeches.\r\n\r\nWhile some money went into the \"300\"-like effects, the action sequences are shot in an extremely annoying fashion.  It continously slows down everytime something is happening, so that the audience can, presumedly, relish in the awe of the agonized looks on the actors faces.  I'm positive the film would have only been about 45 minutes without the slow motion.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/LegendofHerculesThe_zps4453981a.jpg[/IMG]",

Kellan Lutz can't fight. This isn't a knock on him necessarily. He's so huge that no stunt double would be believable but between the director and editor they managed to destroy the continuity of every fight scene to the point where I don't know who I'm looking at. For example, there was a mud fighting scene where the two fighters looked almost exactly alike. And when the camera randomly cuts to another angle to make up for the stiffness in Hercules' fighting style I have NO IDEA who is who or who's winning, and after about a minute of this I didn't care. \n3. The story has huge holes in it. \na. Hercules comes back from being sold to slavery and it is much too easy for him to win the affection of the people. \nb. Hercules kills a lion who his brother takes credit for. In the final fight scene he has it on though. How? The brother never gave him the lion's mane and he wasn't shown stealing it. \nc. Hercules' love interest has a knife to her heart held by Hercules' brother and in an act of sacrifice, pushes in the knife herself so that she can't be held hostage. Later on I notice two gigantic holes: \nc1. His brother magically got knocked out. \nc2. His love interest DIDN'T sacrifice anything because she's having his baby in the next scene. How can she have his baby with a hole in her heart. This wasn't a modernized version of the tale. Even today, if you get stabbed in the heart you're in big trouble. Not her though. Apparently she's half god too. \n4. The villain, Hercules' brother, wasn't scary or impressive or even mildly threatening. I've been more scared of crossing the street while intoxicated. \n\nBad film. High production value. Also, I kept thinking formulaic when I was watching. It is less exciting than 300, less dramatic than Troy, and less",

The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse.

The film wants to be an epic tale about an epic Greek warrior who was the son of a god but it ends up only being epically bad as its story is all over the place and its lead actor (Kellan Lutz - Twilight) doesn't have the dramatic chops to pull this one off ... although he does have the Herculean muscles to brandish a sword and shield.  The film takes some of the Hercules myth and tries to create a story out of it but it strays so much from what has been told that the film is a waste.  It has a lot of fighting and set pieces ... but the recent television series Spartacus did most of this a lot better.  The film changes a few names and events of significance and comes across as wholly unnecessary.  Hercules has another film coming out this summer starring Dwayne Johnson ... that one will surely be better than this one.",

            "content": "The film formerly known as 'Hercules: The Legend Begins' which scarily makes you think there might be sequels in a possible beefcake franchise. Aaaaaand also even more scarily known at one time as 'Hercules 3D' which not only makes me shudder at the thought of how ridiculous a gimmick that would be, but the fact they would probably make 3D sequels too, brrrrrr! me blood runs cold at the thought of it.\n\nSo round one, lets see if this Hercules film can...oh it can't. So in ancient Greece Yuri Boyka...aka Scott Adkins, the man who makes pure straight to DVD films for a career, is the baddie King Amphitryon. This guy is apparently running things badly and no one likes him, the film shows none of this but we are made to believe it because he shouts and growls a lot. He's gonna marry off Hebe the Princess to his slimy son Iphicles, problem is Hebe is in love with mighty Hercules played by...Kellan Lurch? Putz? Yutz?, this makes them both rather upset. So in typical Romeo and Juliet style they try to escape together, get caught, and Hercules is banished to fight in Egypt. Naturally this is all a ruse by the naughty King to try and kill off Hercules because he has also been foreseen to bring down his kingdom.\n\nNow I don't really know the full ins and outs of ancient Greece as its extremely complicated, but I'm pretty sure this film is not historically accurate. I take a wild swing with this statement as King Galenus at the start of the film who is killed by Amphitryon was actually a Greek physician and philosopher, unless they just used the name. Also Hebe was the daughter of Zeus and Hera which I don't believe is used here, but anyway you wouldn't use this film for a history lesson.\n\nIf this were a TV movie then I'd be a bit more positive here, the fact its a big budget flick directed by Renny Harlin is a bit embarrassing really. By the chariots of Zeus! the visuals are drab, really drab!, its unbelievably poor looking in every aspect. The costumes are bland and lifeless, but I guess the excuse there could be its a more realistic take. Lots of bad greenscreen, the few real locations used are unexciting whilst most other landscapes we see are CGI and the sets are so darkly lit my guess is that its to hide the fact they look like foam and rubber. Most of the film uses CGI to make up the backgrounds foregrounds...everything! and its obvious, hell the CGI looks like it was done ten years ago.\n\nThe first bit of action that really nailed home how poor this all was was the sequence where Hercules fights the lion. Holy Mufasa! this sequence looks terrible, the lion must be a joke right? isn't it? how big was this budget?. The acting in this film is laughable it really is, putting the constant growling and gnashing teeth of Adkins aside, it feels like you're watching a sci-fi B-movie from the 50's. No disrespect to those classics but in this day and age you come to expect a bit more for a major release...don't you?!!.\n\nThere is very little action in the film which doesn't really help its case, especially when the acting realism and visuals are so bad. What action we do get is done in the most horrendously pointless needless and shameless rip off from the '300' franchise ever to grace the cinema screen thus far methinks. It wouldn't be so bad if it actually looked half as good, or if it was even necessary, but it just feels so futile, so totally meaningless and clearly done just to try and make everything appear more thrilling because otherwise it would be lame. Blatant leeching off another films concept.\n\nThe other thing is I don't know what this film wants to be, a serious historical epic? a bloody sword n sandals action flick? a drama? a fantasy? what?!. There are hints of a blood soaked action flick but it never materialises, it just cuts away at every crucial moment, there is no blood or gore at all really...so maybe its for the family?. The gladiatorial battles are laughable bad with cliched corny choreography and characters, the six undefeated warriors were pathetic and frankly I'm unsure how they became undefeated. One of the warriors was even a woman! women weren't really seen in the arenas, especially with the male gladiators, it didn't happen, but naturally Hercules doesn't kill her pfft! wuss.\n\nLove the short sequence just before the battle with the six warriors. Chiron and Hercules mate Sotiris reach the arena and look down on it from this massive cliff. They must be a gazillion feet above this arena in one shot...but by the pecs of Lutz! in the next shot they're in the arena just in time to watch Hercules do his thing!. They don't even look tired or sweaty!, that's some ancient Greek magic right there. Oh did I forget to mention that these arena battles are set up by a character who is clearly a rip off from Oliver Reed's character in 'Gladiator', the guy even looks the same with his facial hair and costume, is there a lawyer in the house?.\n\nThis film is such a mess it really is, most of the time it comes across as a lifeless dull drama with little bits of tame bloodless '300' wannabe style action. But out of the blue we get a couple outrageous sequences of fantasy involving Hercules using two massive boulders on chains like nunchakus in true Marvel style. And then a sequence where he summons the power of Greyskull and proceeds to kill hundreds of warriors using a lighting empowered sword...wut?!. After all that its back to being a dull plot hole ridden drama/historical epic/'300'/'Spartacus'/'Gladiator' wannabe cash cow franchise (well that ain't happening anymore).",

As a starter, even an action-junkie would be completely disappointed by the way Hercules defeats the Nemean Lions. Bringing down their fight to a joke, director Renny Harlin fails to depict a simple glimpse of hope for the bored viewer until the very end. Neither the awful and dull performances of Kellan Lutz (Hercules) nor Gaia Weiss' (Heba) attempts to play Lutz's beloved Princess Heba and their ridiculous romance could save this movie from being a total disaster. \n\nWriting even this review is more than The Legend of Hercules deserves. A complete disappointment from a well know action director from the 90s such as Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, The Cliffhanger), this is a movie to be avoided by absolutely all means !",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is an insult to not just Greek Mythology, but common sense. A rush plot that overuses cliches and overlooks the basics of storytelling like context, characterization, and anything resembling human emotion. The action scenes that don't include Scott Adkins are uninspired, insipid, and sucking any shred of entertainment away. These Greek set action scenes are the most over the top ever depicted in the era yet provide nothing to dissect. Avoid this film! Done and finished like that. If you're expecting anything informative you better stop reading now. Now clearly I have allot more to say about the film seeing the length of my rant. What better way to best get across my hatred than express my same exact thoughts while viewing the film. I'll leave no stone unturned because there are some bad movies worth viewing.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the opening of the film which is an unimpressive one track wide shot of Greek civilizations going to war with each other into the ancient land of Argos. This one track shot highlights the plastic looking CG environments, blurred explosions, and humans that look smudgy regardless how far the CG is from the camera. However, despite a poor first impression the film is gracious enough to give us SCOTT ADKINS! He's so awesome that in fact, the extras in the opening scene just started cheering upon seeing Adkins appear despite being told not too. Coming into the film with a action scene that overuses slow motion and cheap props (like all the action scenes), but nonetheless Adkins presence makes it awesome. Full of energy he's able to sell an opening action scene that had no context (no seriously, it's glances over just about every detail you can think off regarding a war) and makes it exciting. At the end there's no question that Scott Adkins wins the fight, his opponent kingdom, and thus has the opposing army and his own army bow down to his greatness. Truly this man is a legend among legend and....what eleven minutes that's it. Adkins is just a supporting actor despite clearly selling a action scene that should not have had worked on any level. BOOOOOOOOOO! Put Scott Adkin back on screen. If you seriously think I'm going to buy \"I got pregnant with a God child to put end to your reign because you are just too demanding\" plotline without developing character, context, or the conflict you are wrong. I still have a functioning brain cell intact after viewing this. At some point you might expect me to flip the switch and go back to my formula with an attempt to be fair, but then Kellan Lutz appears around the twelve minute mark.\r\n\r\nFast forward the plot twenty years later and Kellan Lutz appears on screen for the first time in the film riding horses with plastic doll Gaia Weiss. I didn't think it was possible, but these two actors manage to make the simple task of horseback riding difficult to buy. Once they reached their destination at some pond they have a \"romantic\" moment. The scene gets across Hercules love Hebe despite this being the first time we see them together. For those wondering nope the film never develops the romance nor any of the characters to sell the romance. The only thing that happens at the pond is Hercules gets a necklace from the women he loves which on itself could metaphor Hercules commitment by wearing, but he's does not hold it to any importance rendering it meaningless. After Hercules brother, Iphicles, comes into the scene he tells his men to take Hebe back to the kingdom of \"Just Make Things Up As We Go Along-dom\". \r\n\r\nRiding back to their proud kingdom at day time, yet for some reason wait until night time to actually start moving the brothers hear a noise. Getting off their horses the brothers arm themselves to fight a foul beast. A lion appears making his presence known to Hercules with his loud and furious roar that shakes the land. The fact that his opponent is Kellan Lutz further boosts the beast ego so much in fact that when HERCULES THROWS A STEEL SPEAR AT A LION IT DEFLECTS IT WITHOUT A SCRATCH! How is the lion killed you asked? By being choked to death by Hercules. Nope, I'm pretty sure the CG Lion couldn't handle putting this on his resume thus ending his career on screen. CG Lion number 06-27-1997 will truly be missed. Before I move on the lion Hercules fought wasn't ordinary. It was in fact the legendary Nemean Lion who has golden fur that's impervious to attacks. I'm telling you this because the film does not explain this meaning unless you know what the Nemean Lion is this scene is various degrees of silliness. \r\n\r\nUpon returning to their kingdom together. Iphicles takes credit for killing the Nemean Lion and tells in front of a crowd that Hercules ran away from the first sign of danger. Remember this is Kellan Lutz's Hercules not Arnold Schwarzenegger so it's not hard for anyone to buy that Hercules ran away from danger. Heck I believed it even though I clearly saw what actually happened. Thus the almighty KING ADKINS (I know his character has a name, but I like the sound of KING ADKINS better) announces to the crowd that his son, Iphicles, will in fact marry Hebe in three moons. Three moons? I could help with that just give a minute to unzip...what you meant days not the other kind? You modernized 90% of the dialogue so why of all things \"wed in three moons\" is kept as is. By no surprise Hebe is dissatisfied with the announcement of whom she'll be force to wed. I totally could get behind Hebe in this situation because she's not marrying King Adkins. I mean when the only man throwing himself at you is Kellan Lutz could you really blame Hebe for running away. Hercules goes after Hebe and promises her they'll run away together. Out of kindness Hebe says yes in the hopes this will make King Adkins jealous (my made up plot sucks I know, but much better than what the film provides). Thus the two ride off into the night, but wait until daytime to actually start their journey. Are you kidding me Daniel Giat, Giulio Steve, Renny Harlin, and Sean Hood? Four freakin writers? Not one of them thought to themselve \"Wouldn't it make sense for Hercules and Hebe to run away right after Hercules makes that proposal. It's night time making it difficult to spot them, none of Adkins guards are chasing after them, and they have a head start\". \r\n\r\nAfter a bad chase scene void of any excitement and zero technical prowesses King Adkins sends Hercules to war in Egypt. It was at this point that I realize Hercules character is so poorly written that I was actually cheering for the \"villain\" of the film. For Adkins character we at least saw he led an army to gain an entire kingdom even if it was just for gold as oppose to Hercules who in the film has only killed a lion thinks he entitled to anything he wants. Out of those two I would cheer on the bloodthirsty tyrant who has a right to constantly be pissed off at Hercules because he worked hard and violently killed to get the things he got. Hercules on the other hand thought process is \"You just don't know how difficult it is to be the son of a king with no responsibility having the power of a God. I hate you\". You could labeled Kellan Lutz as a hero all you want in the film, but he just comes off as a drama queen who got a sex change into a man. It's also upon this force return Hercules learns from his mother he's the son of Zeus. This shocks Hercules upon hearing the news since Kellan Lutz's Hercules is that slow in head. Really movie? You know just force me to compliment Disney Studio writing which by my standard guarantees you just failed in the written word of storytelling. In Disney's Hercules he knew he has super strength and was conflicted about his true origin. This Hercules does not face emotional conflict, has no desire to learn about himself, nor does he ever goes to speak to Zeus unless he wants something without earning it. \r\n\r\nWould you believe me if I told you the previous paragraphs vaguely summed up the first thirty minutes of the movie. I got that much material to complain and rant on in thirty minutes. This is just a fraction of my feelings as you could only imagine how poorly I view this film in its entirety. Pass the thirty minute mark the four writers gave up on writing dialogue. ARRRGGGGGHHHHHHH, EEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR, BOOOOOOOOOOOOO, is what makes up the rest of the film dialogue. Just a constant barrage of men shouting from the top of their lungs. Moving on, in the next twenty minutes little happens. Hercules goes to Egypt to fight with his father army and with one other soldier are the only survivor of the battle. Captured, Hercules and General Goodlooking (who's too young to play a veteran war general) are force to fight other prisoners. This plot point is a poor ploy to just have the following eighteen minutes consist of action scenes. All of which rely on wire work that Pinocchio would call dated. The action scenes are unexciting because Kellan Lutz barely gets hurt. Fun fact, in the action scene where Kellan Lutz enters an arena the crowd boos when the announcers introduces Hercules was not scripted. According to the extras on set they said they were lied into believing they would see Dwayne Johnson in the movie. To be fair though the extras are justified for their boos. Hercules strikes a deal with his master to let General Goodlooking go scot-free if he could wins his freedom against six undefeated Greek warriors. Why that actually sounds cool. The film took many liberties with the legend already so maybe in this one scene Hercules will face Achilles, Jason, Perseus, Odysseus, among other worthy opponents. Oh man the possibilities are endless. One over the top, dead of excitement, and predictable fight scene later. Damn you writers I actually expected something decent from that scene!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Argos news spread across the land that Hercules died in battle. Lets take moment and mourn the loss of Kevin Sorbo's Hercules who will be missed. Or damn it, thinking of the wrong Hercules again. Actually what I meant to say was bring on the champagne because Kellan Lutz's Hercules is pronounced dead. YEAH! Afterwards King Adkins speaks to his angry wife whose hatred for him is far from subtle. Adkins wife tells him that she gave birth to Hercules to end his tyranny. Of course given Kellan Lutz is the person she gave birth to King Adkin takes it as an insult (like anyone would) and kills her on the spot. There is also a scene of Hebe stating continually (it's the only thing she talks about in the movie) how much she loves Hercules (just pretend it's Dwayne Johnson she's talking about to buy it) when speaking with Iphicles. Once Iphicles gets across Hebe has no say in the matter will forever be locked in a loveless marriage she attempts to commit suicide. In the context of the film Hebe feels sad that Hercules got killed, but in my version I actually believe Hebe came to the realization that her failed planned to make King Adkins jealous thinks a world without Adkins is not worth living. Of course Old Man (he's is not that important of a character) stops her and tells her Hercules is still alive and planning to overthrow King Adkins. \r\n\r\nSkipping towards Hercules overthrow you'll be hard press to read that nothing else happened in between. Reaching the fifty minute mark you think seeing a God attempting to rally supporters to overthrow King Adkins would on some level be interesting. All that happens is General Goodlooking finds his wife murdered, Iphiles captures General Goodlooking, Hercules is captured, Hercules gets chained up, and whipped for being a very, very bad actor. Despite these events there's no buildup on any kind and the bad attempt to sell the romance with sex. Although, I do thank the director who despite showing his stars (any male actors) togaless for more than half of the movie does not show Kellan Lutz likely bad interpretation of a sex scene. So Hercules, just because he asks, obtains his full strength from Zeus without earning it. Kellan Lutz goes \"God of War\" (Kratos, the protagonist, fights with weapons connected by chains) on his opponent and is just as lame as everything else in the movie. Witnessing this King Adkins retrieves to his castle because Hercules showing off his strength bored him.\r\n\r\nIf you read this far we're finally at Hercules overthrow. Music in this film in general is unnoticable because it's only purpose is to be loud. There's no composition nor instrumental arrangements in anything that is heard. So while people were getting killed on screen I was to listening to Aya Hirano \"Bouken Desho Desho\" to lift up my spirits and worked to put me in a good mood. Who knew listening to cheery and upbeat music for a an action scene would worked so much better than a random arrangements loud noises. Hercules army march towards King Adkin front gate and by sheer luck some of King Adkins arrows men turn to Hercules side. Man is that lazy writing and pure convenience that even though the arrow men could easily kill Hercules just turn to his side. Motivation is simply because he's a great hero, even though throughout the movie everything is a cakewalk for him. So when Hercules enters King Adkins temple he walks straight into King Adkins trap. King Adkins, despite the rain pouring down, is able to create a wall of fire because he's just awesome. So picture this, Hercules and his men surrounded, outnumbered, and ensuring that there is a high possibility Hercules men lives will be lost. Now picture Zeus just giving Hercules a lightning whip to easily killing a dozen or so men by himself. I've been avoiding discussing the idea of Hercules saying in a previous scene he's no God, but a mortal. Why don't you remember the last time you raised your hands up at the sky, physically grabbed lightning, and used it as a whip? I do it all the time because according to this film I am a mortal. \r\n\r\nThen finally it comes down to climax which is made exciting because of SCOTT ADKINS! So who'll win this fight; on one corner you have SCOTT ADKINS who in the film is a conqueror of kingdoms, commands respects looking pissed off in every single scene he's in, and most importantly age holds no meaning to him. Despite the main story taking place twenty years after the opening scene the only thing he has to show for his age is a clearly fake beard! And on the other corner you have Kellan Lutz who plays Hercules accomplishing...um no wait let me think. He went to war in Egypt despite only having eighty troops and survives...although it's technically his fault they died since he suggested to rest in a area that guaranteed their enemies to ambushed them and left themself no way to escape. Oh man that's bad. No wait, Hercules has the strength of a God and can wield lighting which he never uses in a majority of the film. Ummm....he has muscles, but no personality of any kind. Ahhh...this guy sucks. I honestly tried to make Kellan Lutz sound good.\r\n\r\nThe climax is actually decent because of the fight choreography actually allows Kellan Lutz opponent to be on equal ground. You might question Hercules strength as he gets tossed around during the final action scene like a rag doll, but remember his opponent is SCOTT ADKINS! Before Kellan Lutz has a chance to choke King Adkins to death Iphicles comes into the fight threatening to kill Hebe if Hercules kills King Adkins. Knowing the small possibility that Hercules could save her Hebe takes stabs herself in the chest because a life without Scott Adkins is just not worth living and a life with Kellan Lutz is worth ending your misery. This scene, like everything else, leaves as little of an impact as possible. The fight resume and if the film wasn't unrealstic enough Kellan Lutz kills King Adkins. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Unbelievable the filmmakers had the nerve to kill off the only decent thing to be found in the movie. Yes Scott Adkins only screams in the movie, but he has energy, charisma, acting talent, a martial art background, but most importantly is not Kellan Lutz. I kid you not when I say Kellan Lutz starring in this film is the equivalent of a sleeping pill; the longer you are expose to it the more you'll want to go sleep. \r\n\r\nHebe wakes up and lives happily ever after with Hercules. Of course with my hatred towards the film I pretend Hebe became blind thinking Hercules was Scott Adkins. Finally this is the end of the review. Without question if it wasn't for the over top performance and glorious presence of Scott Adkins this film would have earned a zero. Whenever Adkins is on screen he's brings excitement to the film working against some incredibly poor production values. Adkins was in the film long enough to earn a ten percent rating. He's the film biggest appeal even in a traditional sense his performance is bad. Unfortunately the spotlight is given to Kellan Lutz whose performance has the same effect of a sleeping pill, charisma of a corpse, non existent acting talent, and finally just sucks at his job. He doesn't look convincing in the part, he can't act, has no charm, and personality of any sort. So like I said in first paragraph there are some bad movies worth seeing and this film, under no circumstances even if you're held at gunpoint should not be seen.",

He's a fine stumpen alrite. heeheh. But as far as the plot is concerned twas quite on the challenging side of figurien it out. Normally I don't read up the reviews of a film I go to see for the first time. Now I must admit, I had a sneak preview on IMDB. Link will be provided below as per usual. But from what I could understand in the movie of where I got the plot fully is as follows. Hercules is born as a god like the way Jesus was. as in I think a demi-god like Percy Jackson(Son of Poseidon) to a Queen. The King thinks the Queen had an affair and as naturally is mad. He forces his son Iphicles(Excuse the spelling) and Hebes to wed. However there' s a slight problem, and that problem is my sexy hunk Hercules. Hercules is in love with Hebes. \"Even if he is a memory to me, I still love him\". I went to the film, as it was described as \"Twilight heartthrob... Kellen\". By George did that live to its description. He is some heartthrob alrite. So Hercules found out that the King killed his mother ie the Queen. Initially throughout the film, he wasn't acceptance of his Godship not even acknowledging his father was a God(Zeus). So when he had heard of the murder of his mother and now his mentor(the Auld fella - Chiron I think) Hercules goes on a rampage. Overall a wonderful film to a great history lesson.

Hera agrees which makes no sense, even offering Zeus as the father. To be fair Hercules' conception was actually kind of amusing and over the top.

I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time. What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure. \n\nIn Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

            "content": "It's hard to know where to begin after you've just experienced a mountain of sh*t. Greek mythology has always enticed me. It's interesting to say the least, not to mention beautifully poetic. Films like, Clash of the Titans  and it's sequel, make my blood boil. Once again, here is yet another mythology baed film that utterly fails. \"The Legend of Hercules'' is directed by Renny Harlin, and stars: Kallan Lutz, Scott Adkins, Johnathon Schaech, Liam Garrigan, Gaia Weiss , and Roxanne Mckee.\n\nQueen Alcmene (Mckee) is impregnated by Zues one night, as was foretold by the goddess. Her husband,  King Amphitryon (Adkins) believes she was with another man, and becomes exceedingly angry. He is so enraged that he grimaces throughout the entire film. The queen names the child Hercules, by order of the goddess. Years later, Hercules (Lutz) and his love Hebe (Weiss) are fooling around in the river. Suddenly, the brother of Hercules named, Iphicles (Garrigan) discovers them in the woods. He brings them back to the king, where they are told that Hebe will be wed to Iphicles, for Iphicles will be the future king. Obviously, the two lovers are devastated, so they run away together. This results in them being caught, brought back, and punished. Hercules must leave and go fight in Egypt.\n\nOne would imagine that the actor playing Hercules would be strong, gruff, and in charge. Kallan Lutz is the worst actor one could chose for this role. He is utterly bland, boring, and lifeless. He isn't likable--as the character should be--nor is he a guy you want to root for. He is not even tough. Honestly, he comes off as soft and weak. The second worst performance comes from Scott Adkins. His performance as the king was just ghastly. He was constantly grimacing, yelling, and shaking his fists. Every single performance was dull and flat, without exception. The characters are lifeless and dull as well.\n\nPerhaps the worst element of this film, is the production value. Seeing as this is a film about Hercules, the expectation is that there will  lots of action. There is, and every bit of it is awful. The sword fights, fits fights, and battles are all weighed down by constant annoying slow motion shots. I am not against slow motion shots, as long as they are used in moderation. In this film, they'd use a somewhat appropriate slow motion shot, then follow up with several more that just didn't work. It's painfully obvious this film wanted to be like 300. However, the action is so poor that it pales in comparison.\n\nThere are allot of special effects (CGI) in this movie. Several of the special effects shots looked okay. The rest looked absolutely horrible! You can tell that they're using green screen, and you can tell that they're using CGI. Whoever was in charge of the special effects was extremely lazy. That is the best way I can describe this movie. It is very, very lazy. Even the costumes and weapons are poorly made. Several costumes looked passable, others looked like they were off the set of a high school play.\n\n\"The Legend of Hercules'' is a dull affair, full of flat performances and uninteresting characters. The only redeeming value--if you want to call it that--was the surprisingly decent camera work. Besides this, nothing is impressive about this movie. The romance is an utter joke, the costumes are horrible, the sets are obviously sets, and the special effects are lazy.",

It's when studios release the bad movies they spent too much money on and need the films to have a theatrical run so they have some sort of life on home video... Enter The Legend of Hercules. This latest Hercules from director Renny Harlin stars Kellan Lutz as the son of Zeus. My question is who gives Renny Harlin this kind of money anymore?\n\n \n\nJudd:                The last Renny Harlin film I saw was boy-licious The Covenant, which explains the amount of beefcake in The Legend of Hercules. Granted, these sword and sandal epics traditionally feature a plethora of glistening pectorals, but I don't recall one scene where Kellan Lutz is covered up. Not that it's a bad thing. At least he knows where his appeal lies - Taylor Lautner should take a lesson. However, anyone expecting to see anything remotely based on the traditional stories of Hercules is going to be in for a rude awakening. Actually, the movie is so boring that awakening may not be the right word.\n\n \n\nSwanner:           Hercules does look like it's been directed by Joel Schumacher. Did you notice how forgettable the whole film was?  I was trying to remember a couple of scenes and it's just gone. The only positive I can say about the film is that it was short. The film appears to move well but then all the exposition just weighs it down so I stopped following the story. They were trying for that Spartacus look and feel, but Spartacus had time to develop characters and storylines. Spartacus also went there with the killings where Hercules is wrestling for that PG-13 rating, so we don't even get the blood and guts to brighten up this turd.  \n\n \n\nJudd:                It may only be 99 minutes long, but they are some of the longest 99 minutes I've ever experienced. You mention the lack of blood and guts, and while that shouldn't make or break a film, The Legend of Hercules is noticeably bloodless. People are getting stabbed, beheaded, whipped and no one bleeds. It's off putting. The movie could have had potential of it were more campy. There are times when it tiptoes with the idea, but it seems that Harlin was afraid to go full Immortals - which Kellan Lutz was also in, as Poseidon, and wore the most FAB-ulous hat.\n\n \n\nSwanner:           That's what I was trying to say...no comment! Make the film bloody and violent or make it so silly we can't help but like it. This was just a bad script mixed with some bad acting. Before you start bad mouthing Taylor Lautner just remember that Taylor has that beautiful face where Kellan looks like a goof. The Italians use to make these kind of films with bodybuilder but they didn't give them any lines. Just a grunt here, a grunt there.  If they were ugly, grow a beard and no close-ups. These movies were successful because they didn't take themselves too seriously. Harlin, on the other hand, still thinks his shit don't stink, but his movies do!\n\n \n\nSwanner:            1/2 \n\nJudd:                No stars",

Not only that, but all the audience saw was Kellan Lutz's nipples the whole time. The leading lady wasn't anything to write home about... It's like the producers had such a hard time selling the script that they couldn't even convince a hot bimbo to take the role. Watching the actors stumble through their lines felt like watching a middle school play... Except most middle schoolers could probably pull off fake accents better.

            "content": "Movie Review Maven grade = C\nIn a Nutshell:  I used to get a kick out of the old Kevin Sorbo TV show \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\".  Well, this is nothing like that.  You know that awesome Disney movie \"Hercules\"?  Well, sadly, it's nothing like that either.  Instead, this is a disappointing retelling that has no sense of humor and the worst movie extras I've seen in years.  You know a movie is bad when you actually notice the extras.  My 8 year old nephew walked out of the movie because he was bored.  Yikes. \n\nIt feels like it wants to be the movie 300, but just can't pull it together past 200.  It also reminded me of a cheesy version of the movie Gladiator. If you're interested in watching lots of massive arms and muscular thighs fighting for an hour and half, you're going to love this movie.  I'm thinking that King of Thrones fans will enjoy the stylized production sets and epic scenery.\n\nUplifting theme:\n\tA little help from God can make all the difference.  (wink)\n\tI need to work out more.\n\nThings I liked:\n\tI thought Queen Alcmene's hairdos were super cute.\n\tHercules and Hebe share some very romantic vows of love.\n\tThe aerial view of King Amphitryon's kingdom looked amazing.\n\tNice 360 degree camera work during the scene when..SPOILER ALERT...Hercules is tied up with the Captain.\n\tCool electric whip at the end\n\tSome of the fight scenes featured slow-motion action that impressively showed off skills and CGI.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\tHercules' rousing speech could have been Braveheart worthy, but it was so rushed it was a yawn short of inspiring.  In contrast, I thought the speech given by the Princess of Crete to Iphicles about how much she loved Hercules was touching.\n\tKellan Lutz' pretty-boy baby face and blonde hair didn't scream Greek demigod to me.\n\tThe lion CGI looked totally fake and cheesy.\n\tThere were flurries in the air in several scenes.  Is it supposed to be snow? Cotton in the trees?  \n\tToo many lines were growled through clenched teeth\n\tI hate fake flying, especially in fight scenes.\n\tThere are some dumb lines like \"Get out of my way, woman!\"\n\tWhat kind of accent was Jonathan Schaech going for?  Terrible.\n\tHUGE SPOILER ALERT...so Hebe stabs herself to kill Iphicles behind her...she survives and he doesn't.  Tell me how that works?  Lame.\n\nFunny lines: None.  This film took itself too seriously.\n\nInspiring lines:\n\tThe Captain was asked \"How is it you survived those places?\" He answered \"Hope.  I was given hope.\"  Hope is a very powerful thing.\n\tThere were a lot of references to Hercules as Jesus Christ and Zeus as God the Father.  For example, Hercules is chained with his arms outstretched, immaculate conception, and even called a \"so called Savior.\"  In a speech reminiscent of Pontius Pilate, King Amphitryon mocks Hercules and asks \"Do you offer these people salvation when you cannot save yourself?\"  Hera says to Hercules \"Your father has always been there.  You were just not ready for him.\"  Another reference is when Hercules looks up in chains and cries \"Father.  I believe in you.  Grant me strength.\"\n\nThings to look for:\n\tThe pretty golden eagle that is a sign from Zeus \n\tThe fun vertical braid hairdo on the guy in the rock pit fight scene\n\tBlue fuzzy Trojan hat worn by an extra in a crowd scene towards the end\n\tCool arrowheads\n\nTips for parents: \nChildren familiar with the Disney telling of Hercules will not recognize this story or character.  There is a lot of fighting, but it is mostly bloodless.  No profanity, but there is a sexual scene when Hercules is conceived by an invisible Zeus, which is a bit odd and awkward.  Hercules and Hebe are mostly covered in a love scene in a meadow.",

No such thing, except a few bared chests. The critics should google \"Greek Statues\", this was the self image of the times and your lucky if they're wearing anything. Some complain about how the movie was not true to the myth of Hercules, Stop... think, hmmm took liberties with a fictional character from ancient times. Really?

It felt like the writers spent too much time drinking Red Bull, watching Gladiator on repeat and playing the video game God of War. There really wasn't an overall theme and I feel the movie suffered. It was trying to be about FREEDOM ('murica) and then you had the FAITH element and then there was the REVENGE element plus the doing it all for LOVE! None of these themes were developed particularly well and just felt scattered.\n\nThe acting in this movie wasn't really that bad, all things considered. You have Kellan Lutz playing Hercules whose sole job in the movie was to stand there flex his mighty pectorals and grunt. He did well, truly an excellent job of showing his acting chops. Ladies a little eye candy for you if you like that thing. Scott Adkins was probably the stand out performance as King Amphitryon but that was in the first five minutes; it went downhill from there. Liam Garrigan, who played the eldest son of the king, was channeling Joaquim Phoenix from Gladiator. He had the crazy eyes down but was lacking the same intensity and never felt as creepy. I noticed that the story often felt disconnected and the characters weren't given enough time to develop and their motivations often felt confusing.\n\nThe thing I did like about this movie was the hint of supernatural elements. I would have liked it if there were more of it. I must admit I was bummed that they made the story of Hercules an EPIC war movie instead of a movie about a man trying to become something more through select tasks. I think a fun Hercules movie with a plucky sidekick and a lighter tone with more humor was the movie I wanted. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a TV show like what I described that was fun, corny and a good sense of adventure? Oh you know, there IS a TV show like that. Personally I say you should go watch reruns of the TV show and skip this movie.\n\nVerdict: Found Wanting",

            "content": "There's been no shortage of films portraying the mythological Greek hero, Hercules.  Sadly, nearly every single one of them is either embarrassing and/or outdated to the point there isn't really a film to point at and say - that's the best Hercules movie.  Some could make a case for the Disney animated feature from 1997, but other than that, Hercules has been best defined by Kevin Sorbo's portrayal of the character in the television show, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  And, if director Renny Harlin thought he was the man to reinvigorate the character in his film, The Legend of Hercules, then epic fail applies here.\n\nIn The Legend of Hercules, Kellan Lutz stars as Hercules, the son of Zeus - the father of the Gods.  The film begins with the introduction of King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), as he easily adds another kingdom to his empire.  He is a bloodthirsty man that will do anything for power, a trait that his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee), finds to be revolting.  She prays to the Gods to put an end to this King's rule so there may be peace.  Understanding what she is asking for, she is then \"impregnated\" by Zeus - and prepares to have a child that the king knows full well is not his own.\n\nFlash forward many years and Hercules (who goes by another name that the king picked out for him) is in the middle of a tryst with Hebe (Gaia Weiss), the daughter of a king from a neighboring rival kingdom.  However, she has already been promised to Hercules' diabolical brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan).  Naturally, the brothers become at odds with one another, prompting the king (who shows favoritism towards his one true son) to send Hercules off on a mission of war that is doomed to fail and lead to his death.\n\nAware that he's has an uphill battle to contend with, Hercules is desperate to return home before his brother marries his true love.  Along the way, he must face down an army, slavery, various battles, and eventually, his own \"family's\" hatred towards him - not to mention the unexpected realization that he's the son of the most powerful God of them all. \n\nDoesn't that sound exciting?  To some, it might actually sound appealing.  Well, shouldn't buy into it and don't you dare waste a single second thinking about watching this monstrosity of a movie.  The odds are usually going to be against a film succeeding when a sub-par director, like Renny Harlin, signs on to helm the project.  After all this is the guy that's is most notable for directing films that include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Driven, and 12 Rounds.  The quality of those particular films speak for themselves and provide enough information to know this Hercules film is not to be taken seriously. \n\nIf the directing wasn't bad enough, the acting doesn't do this film any favors either.  Leading man Kellan Lutz, who some might recognize from his small supporting role in the Twilight films, might look buff and ready for action - but terrible action sequences and mediocre visual effects really kill any ability for Lutz to show his acting skill.  For reasons behind understanding, not one single role was given to a major Hollywood player - limiting the film's advertising capabilities and general appeal to a wider audience.  It's difficult enough for moviegoers to invest their time and money into major films (who have an above average chance these days of being terrible) with A-list actors, so apparently the people behind this film didn't learn very much from 2011's Conan the Barbarian debacle (which also starred an unrecognizable leading man in the lead).   \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's absolutely nothing (and I mean nothing) about Lutz's character that makes you care about him.  These characters, along with Luz's love interest, portrayed by the forgettable Gaia Weiss, are completely devoid of emotion - and if you need proof (the poor folks out there that have seen it know what I'm talking about), then look no further than the shrug-worthy villains.  Both King Amphitryon and his son, Iphicles, attempt to be grandiose, but simply appear to be just as cheesy and unbelievably annoying as the \"good guys.\"  Frankly, each and every one of the characters could either live, die, or become bean farmers for all I care - just as long as I never have to watch this movie ever again.  If you couldn't already tell, this is one of those generic hero-worshiping movies where the good guy lives and the bad guys die - meaning the only question that viewers will be asking themselves is how long will it take to get through it all and to the credits? \n\nOverall, The Legend of Hercules starts out badly, gets worse, rips off Gladiator (in cliff note fashion), and eventually ends on a terrible note (featuring one of the dumbest and most mishandled endings in quite a long time).   More often than not and with every passing scene, this film is a great example of how to waste a lot of money to make a monumentally poor film.  Not only is it poor, it lacks authenticity, mind-blowing effects, and characters with heart.  However, the only thing that stops this movie from being a complete and utter failure is the appeal that it might have for young boys in the 8-year-old range.  Sure, this film is violent, but it's actually tasteful violence that plays out just as a Saturday morning cartoon would - meaning there's no blood, gore, or abusive language.  In fact, the three stooges might be more violent than The Legend of Hercules.  In any event, I know it's only January, but I have a feeling this movie winds up on a lot of people's worst films of 2014 list.\n\nGRADE:  D-",

Hercules was the son of Zeus, had the makings of a demigod and did feats of strength mainly exhibited in the last fifth of the film.

The Legend of Hercules is not only going to be my least favorite movie of 2014, but I think it just made my top 20 least favorite films of all-time. Yeah! This movie was that bad. I know some people are going to say \"that this year just started and there's going to be more bad movies and who knows... some of those bad movies maybe worse than The Legend of Hercules.\" Now that could be true, but I don't think so because The Legend of Hercules was something very special, it's a movie that only comes out every few years, it's a movie that's so bad that you would rather watch all the Twilight movies twenty times then watch this movie ever again. So what went wrong? Well, everything went wrong in this movie, but I'll be more specific. First off the acting is atrocious; there wasn't a single actor or actress that could act in this movie. Kellan Lutz plays the lead role of Hercules and it was just a joke watching him play this role because he didn't do a single thing right. Now believe it or not, but the rest of the actors in the film were way worse. Every actor in the film either gave over the top performances or gave very bland performances, so either way they all sucked. Another thing that sucked was the direction. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, who's done pretty decent films in his past, like Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, but let's face it he's done more bad movies then good movies. Look at his list; he's directed such bad movies, like Driven, Mindhunters, 12 Rounds and The Covenant. I think it's pretty bad though that all of those movies are more watchable then The Legend of Hercules. So if your movie makes Twilight or The Covenant more watchable, then your movie must really suck. Anyways! The other things that sucked in this film were the costumes. Almost every costume looked ugly and cheap looking, sometimes it looked like they just grabbed old sheets and worn them as old clothes. The CGI was also really bad looking, I can tell this film was low-budget, but damn I've seen TV shows with an even lower budget that have better CGI then this movie. Now the action! Holy crap the action was really irritating to watch. Pretty much every fight scene lasted like 30 seconds and almost every fight scene was in slow motion, which was so damn annoying. I don't know what else to say other then please don't ever see this film. This film is a film that everyone should avoid, not even young teenagers that love action movies will even like this movie. This movie is the epitome of bad; this movie is the crowning achievement of pure shit. So yeah! I highly recommend that people should stay far away from this movie as possible.",

So insipid that it doesn't inspire parody so much as make you think you're watching one, Hercules makes the craptacular Z-List TV series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys look like the intellectual equivalent of The Wire. A CG-animated lion, for instance, inspires about as much fear in moviegoers as a common cold to the Man of Steel. And speaking of Superman, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will be taking on Herc later this summer under the dubious direction of Brett Ratner. As this Herculean turd slides down the screen, however, their version is starting to sound like popcorn--munching Oscar bait. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated adventure arriving in theaters 6 months before a similar such take on the Greek strongman, Hercules (Lutz) must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom after being betrayed by his stepfather, the King, and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love. \n\nKellan Lutz flexes huge muscles and delivers the right lines, but he's no mythmaker. Ripping off style from Zach Snyder (300) and material from, well, NOT mythology, director Renny Harlin presents not so much a low rent Thor as a broke ass Gladiator. If by selling this as an origin tale, the producers mean to make more chapters, then it's this reviewer's duty to relay some sound advice: Stop while you're behind. \n\nBottom line: Crap of the Titans",

            "content": "You know I do really try to walk into the theater with an open mind. Ready to give each an every movie a fair trial before I blog my judgment. But after seeing the trailer for this new Hercules movie, I just knew it was going to stink! So, I set my expectations really low. I figured if they at least make the battle scenes entertaining to watch and don't take themselves too seriously, I'd have something positive to say about it. Sadly, while the action does have its very few shining moments, I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd seen this kind of thing before. I few titles came to mind. 300. Gladiator. Spartacus the movie. Spartacus the TV show. Hercules the Disney animated movie, and accompanying promotion figurines available with a happy meal. ALL better than The Legend of Hercules!\n\nHercules looks cheap, and the acting (well .. being on the screen and talking and stuff) is laughably bad. I couldn't figure out why Kellan Lutz was even in this movie. Maybe they thought he was pretty or something. Hunky maybe? Tanned. Certainly tanned that's for sure. Or was it dirt? I had a hard time figuring that out. This movie made me wish I was back in the 80?s. At least then we'd have a proper God sized Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Hercules. Was The Rock busy? What about Dave Bautista? He's HUGE! It felt like we ended up with the son of Zeus-lite. A Hercules that does Pilates, eats his leafy greens and keeps an eye on his blood pressure. This film needed a Hercules that could bench press a cow while eating a bloody rare steak!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've seen 300 and/or Gladiator. Go watch them again and leave this one alone. Failing that, just expect a very loud, very stupid movie and lots of overly pretty men screaming at the sky. A movie that doesn't even have the good sense not to take itself too seriously.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe cheap visual effects are a bit of a let down, but this will still work best on the big screen. Just do a matinée if you can't wait for this to be available on your Netflix or Amazon Prime streaming list.\n\nWorst element for me:\n\nAll the screaming at the sky. A lost count of how many times different characters pointed their sword props at the sky and started screaming. All the shouting too. And (eye-roll) the clichéd rally the troops speech by Hercules - hilarious! I wouldn't follow him into battle, but I'd certainly check out his show at the Improv.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

I'd never seen Kellan Lutz before, but I found him completely boring to watch. However, that could be because the script didn't give any of the actors anything to work with.\n\nFrom the action that is directly ripped off from Zack Snyder (director of 300 and Watchmen) to the cardboard characters and their motivations, The Legend of Hercules is not necessarily disappointing (because I didn't have any hopes for it), but it's laughable at best.",

There were really only three \"Epic\" moments(Spoilers it's In the trailer btw lol) when Hercules harnessed his powers, which really is the point of the literary term Epic before it was blown out of proportion and every scene in a modern day film had to be a a candy fest. I think we've been spoiled a lot by the short attention span viewing that leaves little character development in modern day cinema. This film does goes against the grain and allows for a more down-to-earth realistic portrayal of the Greek Mythos and has some good character development which made the impact of power use even sweeter compared to the bitterness that starts Hercules' journey . The film had these good elements going for it , the love story(The girl was meh)  the girl was a good actor but didn't have the \"I'm going to kill everyone in this kingdom to get you back\" type of hotness/glamorization, the action and combat segments- I really enjoyed it and as I said I think being reserved with the boons/abilities is a plus for the movie and adds to the impact, and the titillating revenge/justice killing, and the visuals/CGI(very pretty). However, the down side was sadly the main character himself who was not relatable for anything other than the plight of being wronged. The main actor, not to bash him was pretty bad because he felt like the the \"jock\" in highschool trying to get his hot girlfriend back with purely brute strength rather than an underdog that develops in to a hero and realizes his greatness(E.G. an Epic). I mean I felt the grabbed the first Blonde haired chisled guy and placed him as Hercules. One thing that could have saved the movie I think was adding a comic-relief foil character. I mean they had \"Spartacus\" in the dang arena getting his ass handed to him. Even though I gushed at the star power I stand by having a physically weaker humorous character to tame the size of man that was Hercules throughout there journey. All in all, I'd watch it again...... on Netflix.",
