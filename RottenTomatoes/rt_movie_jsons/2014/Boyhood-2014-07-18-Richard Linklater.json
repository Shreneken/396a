            "content": "'Boyhood' has a very unique and intriguing concept, in fact there has not been a concept like it (with taking 12 years to make and being encompassed over 12 years as well). But that is not the only selling point of the film, despite what the detractors have unfairly said.\n\nGranted, 'Boyhood' is not for all tastes, although it was almost unanimously praised by critics the IMDb reviews are much more divisive. This reviewer totally understands why people dislike, even flat out hate it, and shares some of their criticisms, and generally hates the incredibly condescending way they have been expressed, nobody who legitimately liked 'Boyhood' for perfectly valid reasons wants to feel that it is a criminal offence to like it, let alone love it.\n\nDoes this reviewer think it is quite as good as the hype and critics say? Not quite. Does she think it is a very good, conceptually daring and in some ways misunderstood film, and towards the better end of the films released in 2014? Yes. It does have its problems, it is a case of two inconsistent halves with a great emotion-filled, honest, nostalgic and richly developed first half and a second half where the pace slackens, the story meanders and there are moments of awkwardness.\n\nEllar Coltrane's performance is also uneven, he is excellent in the first half with a real sense of honesty and integrity, where the protagonist is much more interesting and likable, but rather stilted and not as involved in the second half. The editing is also choppy in places and although a vast majority of the performances are fantastic Lorelei Linklater is somewhat dull as Samantha and would never pass for Mason's sister.\n\nHowever, aside from the editing 'Boyhood' looks very accomplished with evocative production values and is beautifully filmed. Richard Linklater directs with a real generosity and lightness of touch. The script honest, poignant, thought-provoking and sometimes harrowing, and while not everything about the story works it has a real sense of nostalgia and richly rewarding in its emotional content. Really do not agree that nothing happens, it has a long running time and is deliberate in pacing but this reviewer really loved 'Boyhood's' understatedness, sincerity and subtlety as well as its spontaneity.\n\nCharacters are interesting and developed, especially Ethan Hawke's and Patricia Arquette's. Hawke and Arquette are also the standouts in the cast, and deservedly garnered Oscar nominations which Arquette won. Arquette is particularly outstanding, with a genuine fullness of emotion and authority with no sense of over-acting or self-indulgence. Hawke also gives a compelling real performance.\n\nIn conclusion, a very intriguing and very good film. Not quite as good as it's hyped to be but it has many more merits than the detractors lead you to believe.\n\nWhile the criticisms are understandable, this reviewer is having a hard time believing that there are those who cite 'Boyhood' as the worst film they've ever seen, or one of them. There are far worse out there, that are amateurishly made, ineptly directed, terribly acted and written even worse, distinctions that regardless of whether you hate it 'Boyhood belongs nowhere near in any of them. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

This was always designed to be a very weird film, a very artistic film, something very non-traditional.\n\nAnd it excels. If you introduced this film to someone without any prompting or context, this would seem like a fairly simple film about a boy growing up and finding himself. But when you extrapolate the whole thing into what it actually is - an epic of age, growing up, and life, in both real and artistic time - it becomes something extremely unique and beautiful.\n\nAnd through it all, it has some super interesting things to say. Lots of unique political commentary that seems oddly prescient for the 2020s. Lots of nostalgia, especially for someone like me who grew up at these ages, in Texas, during those times. And the fantastic acting from all the actors is superb.\n\nIt's so hard to actually figure out how to properly compliment this film. It was both way ahead of it's time, and still remains ahead of this time. How did this film even get made? What a fantastic piece of cinematic history, and what an inherently good story to be told, all woven of complexity and teenage and pre-teen angst. I can't only watch this one time. I refuse the proposition that seeing this once is all you need.",

Filmed in short segments over the space of twelve years with the same cast, Boyhood follows the journey of Mason, not necessarily through the traditionally key moments of someone's life, but flagging up the more cultural milestones; a midnight release of a Harry Potter book, the Iraq war for example. Anchored by inspired performances from Ethan Hawke (so brilliant in Linklater's Before trilogy) and Patricia Arquette (who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Mason's Mother) Boyhood is something truly original, and it was probably robbed of an Oscar by Birdman (2014) (despite the fact that I do quite like Birdman).",

The story is told beautifully, with characters that weave in and out of each other's lives in a way that feels much more real than most drama films. The acting is alright, and it's easy to tell that the child actors get better as the movie goes on and they get older, but it's more endearing than anything. My favorite thing about this movie is how it's really a time capsule of millennial comings-of-age; I found myself connecting with memories I didn't even know I had, its nostalgia being emphasized by being set in the same time that it's filmed without the rose tinted glasses of looking to the past. The ending is satisfying and uplifting, and the whole thing never drags, despite its expansive runtime. Boyhood is a unique film on a lot of levels, but it's also just a straight up good movie.",

The only parallel that can be fairly made is with Michael Winterbottom's Everyday, shot over five years to allow for the natural ageing of the protagonists. With Boyhood, Richard Linklater realises what even one of the most innovative and visionary directors, Lars von Trier, only envisioned with his Dimension project, launched in 1991 as a film to be shot for 3' every year over a 33-year period, with a few days of shooting each year, only to be abandoned after only 6 years and released as a 27-minute short film in 2010.\n\nLinklater instead was able to reach the end of his project, and thankfully so since the final output is one of the most significant movies of the last few years and leaves an indelible mark on filmmaking. Filmed only few days every year, Boyhood was a true work-in-progress, as the script was only loosely structured at the beginning and left open to be filled with elements of the actors' lives, such as the family background of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and the director himself, as well as adapted to the natural growth of the actors and the world around. Boyhood follows Mason, a boy from Texas beautifully and naturally played by Austin-born Eller Coltrane, from age six till he goes to college twelve years later.\n\nWith the phantom of The Truman Show hovering above Boyhood, the film is not only a come-of-age excellent movie, as it might be viewed with a superficial eye, but a very delicate and yet deep study of life as it unfolds for most people, and this reflects in the natural involvement that the audience experiences during the almost three hours of the film and the familiarity that oozes from the characters and their developments. \n\nRichard Linklater is not new to film projects that have a vision that goes beyond a short-term horizon, as proven by the (so far) trilogy of Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013), featuring as well Ethan Hawke. However, as challenging as that project was, it was still a relatively traditional series, or sequels, while Boyhood is unprecedented and probably the closest thing to the adherence of life and art to have reached the silver screen.",

            "content": "I saw BOYHOOD! Along with being the single most conceptually complex movie ever made, it's possibly the most interesting and uninteresting movie that I've ever reviewed. I'll unpack that box in a minute but first let me give you the rundown of what it's about. The movie follows a young boy named Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, as he literally grows from a boy to a man and chronicles all the loves, losses, joys and disappointments of growing up in Texas along with his mother, father and sister played by Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and the director's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater.\n\nThe film is the brainchild of director Richard Linklater and literally took 12 years to make as it weaves through the early 2000s until present day. From a conceptual standpoint alone I should be giving this movie 10 stars. The style is consistent across the years, well shot and the actors grow up and grow old before your very eyes... that is except for Ethan Hawke who is apparently some sort of immortal daywalker vampire. Needless to say, this is a true achievement in film from a technical standpoint. From a story standpoint, it's a little different. The story in the film has this feeling like it was written on the fly, without any real direction as to where it was going or what it was building towards any kind of earth shattering event but here's the thing, there comes a point where the movie knows you're realizing that fact and it even addresses it but asks you to hold on just a little longer. By the end of the show, the message the film has plays a lot like real life, not every story is glamorous and dramatic, real life is what it is and a lot of times it's not super eventful but when you look back over everything, you truly saw a boy grow into a man and experience the kind of joy, disappointment, loss, and love that we all do and it was done in a real life kind of way.\n\nOverall, I really liked this movie and despite the fact that a lot of the acting by the kids was less than stellar, and the plot seemed to meander a bit over it's nearly 3 hour run time, the end product was such an achievement that I really can't knock off any points for any mistakes in pacing because at the end of the day, I got where I needed to be and honestly It just couldn't have been done better!

Nothing extraordinary happens, his life essentially mirroring that of the average child, but the film is riveting from start to finish because the character is so easy to relate to and identify with.  It's especially touching to watch it through the eyes of a parent, with the understanding that time passes as quickly as the snap of a finger and before you know it, the children have left home and you are left alone wondering where the time went.  Boyhood is powerful stuff and a rewarding viewing experience.",

I have alot to say negitively about this movie, but at the same time, I do recognize this film's values. This movie is impressive with the visuals and consistency. To watch a child grow into an adult, with the same actor, is well executed by this film. Although the acting is all over the place, the main parents easily are the most interesting and well-acted in this movie. And it's also interesting to watch the very same evolution in the film and camera techniques from the 2000's to 2012. I recognize that this movie is a labor of love from it's director...\n\n...But I still hate it. Boyhood is incredibly boring. But not because it isn't entertaining, I think Boyhood is boring because the movie is about nothing that makes me, someone who spent his entire childhood during this era, feel nothing. The Boy in this movie is highly aimless and vividly emotionless, not to show that he constantly in thought, but he feels like a plank throughout the movie. His character evolves into an indie clich\u00e9 of a \"tortured artist,\" not helped by the fact that his acting gets worse when he gets older. In fact, almost everyone in this movie is incredibly one-dimensional and cliched (there are literally two instances where the abusive, drunk stepfather is used for two different characters). And all of these problems are exaggerated significantly by a pretentious script where the dialogue feels stilted and clumsy.\n\nBoyhood claims that \"this is a movie about living a childhood in the previous decade.\" But all in all, the movie's exploration of the boy's childhood is shockingly shallow. Especially when the concept of growing up is done better in movies like \"Lady Bird.\" These movies say something about what it is to grow up and remanence about the past. But Boyhood ultimately says nothing about growing up. I just don't understand this movie.",

There are many great moments and scenes but the film is let down by some awkward acting, scenes which are not as good and almost forcing drama to make it interesting. The abusive husband aspect did not fully work. At times the leading actor is very easily shown up by the older actors. The final scene as they are hiking ending thoughtful about the now and the future is well done. The young actors appear more natural when really young which changes as they get older.

You were promised a film about boyhood and you got just that. Sometimes, it's nice to take a breath from mindless blockbusters with high stakes and just watch a coming-of-age drama that has conflicts but gives you what its title promises. The acting feels incredibly natural, to the point that this could easily be mistaken for a documentary for those out of the loop. Ethan Hawke as the dad is my favourite character. Richard Linklater does a great job directing this film and it does a fine job finding the balance between comedy and drama. Hell, this movie could've just as easily been the mother's story, focusing on her struggles with single parenthood but this movie isn't called \"Motherhood\" now, is it? While I feel Birdman deserved the Best Picture Oscar, I also feel, as somebody who tries to keep an open mind when watching movies, Boyhood isn't the pretentious, boring flick that the haters make it out to be. If regarded as a \"breather episode\" from all the big superhero movies, action thrillers, dystopian YA adaptations and sappy dramas that were all dominating the box office, Boyhood could serve as just what the doctor ordered in that regard.",

But the problem is that if your going to try this ambitious gimmick of shooting over 12 years, and making 3 hours long with no real story, than you need to make sure your script is consistent, very engaging, has good character development, and has some over-arching theme and this movie fails at almost all of that. And at the end of the day it felt like nothing more than a whatever  drama movie with a bunch of pointless scenes and a meandering story, and to add insult to injury there are some pretty bad moments scattered throughout. Overall, it's definitely a 2-star movie as this movie gets a lot of things right and is definitely trying, but it still kind of sucks.",

The movie is also interesting as it shows the evolution of the culture between 2002 and 2013.  The writer wisely opted to only write major plot points and include elements from each year's zeitgeist.  A minor criticism, Rather than film one year they should have perhaps done more than one per year during the younger scenes as the aging looks a bit discontinuous, especially for the older sister.

            "content": "What a tremendous undertaking, making a film over 12 years that tracks the span of a young man's life and the experiences of those around him seen through his lens. I was impressed by the film when I saw it, the editing was fantastic as the film moved along at a quick pace while conveying the passage of time and the performances of Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke were fantastic but I felt as though the film was lacking in some areas. The music choices were odd and the performance of the lead actor, Ellar Coltrane, significantly dipped when he became a young adult but as a whole the film is definitely worth seeing and is a great cinematic achievement from one of the best directors working today, Richard Linklater.\n\nThe film follows the life of Mason Evans Jr., Ellar Coltrane, from ages six to eighteen as he grows into a distinctive young man. At the beginning of the film he lives with his mother Olivia, Patricia Arquette, and his younger sister Samantha, Lorelei Linklater, while his father, Mason Evans Sr., Ethan Hawke, has been absent for a year. His father returns from an unknown diversion and he and Olivia split up. Over the next few years Olivia will be married and divorced twice and Mason Sr. will become a more mature father figure to his young children. Mason Jr. faces painful break ups and the usual struggles that a young man must face and he comes into his manhood but with the support and advice of those around him we are lead to believe that he will thrive.\n\nLike many Linklater films it is quiet and slow moving and no easy answers are given to the character's problems, at the end of the film many threads are left at least partially open, however unlike his other films the most interesting characters are on the sidelines. Whilst Mason's desire to be a photographer and typical moody teenager phase are relatable and can be interesting the relationship problems of his mother and his father's growth into a reliable and loving husband and father are the most engaging parts of the film. We wouldn't have the great bowling scene where Hawke describes the difficulties of life to his son if there were no son figure but it often felt like we were seeing the film through the perspective of the least involving player, a flaw in many ways.\n\nArquette is equally as good as Hawke as a loving mother who has a penchant for falling in love with the wrong type of man as we see her with an unreliable deadbeat, an abusive drunk and an ex-military man who never quite warms to her children. She is convincing as a woman who is so capable in some areas of her life and yet has a major blind spot as we see her put herself in the same dangerous situation with wide eyes and innocent expression multiple times. Arquette makes the character extremely sympathetic even in her flaws and we never doubt that this woman's greatest priority is her children. Arquette clearly changed a lot between 2002 and 2013 and watching the lines in her face deepen and her voice grow more world weary is a great experience.\n\nLinklater's direction is subtle as always as we recognize a lot of the implication of Mason Jr. constantly turning away when his mother introduces him to men and the fear and anxiety from his perspective when he is left with an abusive drunk. He never attempts to be showy with big, stylized shots but the frames are always bursting with information about the lives of the people they contain and his careful movements of the camera to convey the protagonist's joy, displeasure or any one of a myriad of other emotions is masterful.\n\nThe one other nitpick I have is the use of music in the film. The use of The Hives \u00e2~Hate to Say I Told You So' over a shot of Mason Jr. riding his bike as a child was jarring and strange, it overshadowed what would have been a simple scene. Throughout he selects loud, dramatic music and places it over scenes that are subtle and hardly need music to illustrate something meaningful is occurring. I wish he had selected simpler, softer songs that matched the tone of the film, maybe folk music?\n\nThis is one of those films that you absolutely must see even though it's not perfect because it contains some superb performances and excellent direction. Having what is essentially an arthouse film make $57.3 million is a great achievement and wouldn't it be great to see more films like Boyhood and less superhero junk.",

The concept of filming a movie over the course of 12 years and actually watching the actors grow up is a very impressive achievement, but as a narrative, I feel like that's where the film suffers.\n\nThe editing is very off in this movie. Things come and go out of nowhere and are often never mentioned again. I get it, things like that happen in our lives, but narratively, those plot points serve no purpose.\n\nThere are also some very annoying shove-in-your-face references of what year a certain scene takes place in. Whether it's someone complaining about George W. Bush (and this is coming from a guy who's not a fan of Bush, either), a girl singing a song from High School Musical, or a kid referencing his 3 favorite movies of 2008 (Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight, and Pineapple Express). Those references really date the film and it's very distracting.\n\nFor me, I'll stick to Moonlight. A much better film in my opinion.",

Boyhood focuses on a number of issues which are, don't get me wrong, prominent in our society. Such as Household Abuse, divorce and numerous mental health issues which the Mother seems to personify countless times during the movie. However, the concept, whilst different, isolates audiences which aren't interested in pretentious real life movie genre. I personally would recommend watching your own family or someone else's (not like a stalker) family grow up, because it would at least have fluidity and the characters hopefully won't be as irritating and dislikeable. If you really want to watch the same cast, which in this movie is filled with rather terrible actress and actors which have never gotten a script since, grow up, I would recommend Harry Potter as it is not widely known but the cast of Harry Potter used the script of Boyhood as toliet roll, because frankly there is no better use.\n\nConclusion, just watch 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' the concept is the same and so is the script.",

Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play the parents of the lead and the young actors, especially Ellar Coltrane is exceptional. This is a must watch for all cinema lovers.",

But if I'm being honest, the movie wasn't bad, but, for me, it wasn't great. Of course one of the highest points is the technical achievement of this 12-year project, and that certainly is captivating in and of itself. It's just too bad that after all that work I found myself strangely unattached to it all; especially to our protagonist. The older he got, the less I liked him or felt close to him. Which sounds kind of savage for me to say, but truly, I didn't find him to be a particularly enthralling protagonist. Notice, I didn't say likable, I said enthralling. I'm not saying one has to like a protagonist for a movie to be good. Unfortunately I neither liked nor was drawn to this character. If I would've connected with him or the movie more, things might've been different, but really, I spent a lot of the movie (him from age 15 onward) growing more and more distant from him. This kid's approach to life doesn't feel profound but honestly more precocious than anything else. And I'm not some stuffy, older conservative saying this. I'm a white, male, millennial, 20-something who adores art. I should've connected with this kid on some level. But I didn't. I felt like he was a real underachiever. He's not motivated by much of anything, and he's just kind of angsty and moody all throughout. The other big issue I have with this movie is the mom. I don't know how Patricia Arquette won an Oscar for this movie, and I'm a Patricia Arquette fan! Her performance is so one-note it's not even funny. She does the same things and acts the same way in every scene. I really felt like she was just showing emotion and not really inhabiting this role. The final scene between her and our protagonist should've been very emotional but was surprisingly bland. And our protagonist's reaction (or lack thereof) doesn't help. Now I'm not saying this movie's horrible. There is some good drama here. Ethan Hawke is certainly the highlight of this whole thing. I felt his performance to be very genuine, and frankly, his character was the most engaging, and deeper than the rest. His arc was the most rewarding for me, and I found myself relishing the moments with him. The resulting story doesn't get us much of anywhere though, nor leave us with anymore insight on anything, really, which is a serious bummer because that end scene is trying hard to do that for us. The last line of this movie didn't mean anything for me, which is especially sad because it was set up to do so. Richard Linklater is still a great director in my opinion, and this certainly is a great technical achievement, which is why I wanted to like it so much, but mercy if I just couldn't get emotionally involved.",

I've seen this type of movie before, and done better.

Without a discernible plot and with a running time of 166 mins, it could have been a disastrously tedious film, but with Linklater's in-tune direction, some incredibly fluid editing and a great cast, you can't help but be fascinated by watching this young man's life unfurl before your eyes. Yes, it has a few issues here and there, but the overall feeling that you are left with when it's all over makes any faults seem insignificant. Captivating, nostalgic and full of humanity.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just saw a summer film that is about as different from any other summer movie as we ve ever seen.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Boyhood was made over 12 years with all the same actors. Let s recap...\n\nSCOTT: The year is 2002 and we meet the Evans family. The head of the family is the mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette), who has an 8-year-old daughter Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) and a 6-year-old son named Mason, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane). The movie shows us Olivia s tumultuous relationship with her boyfriend, Mason, Sr. (Ethan Hawke). Olivia decides to do something about her low-paying job. She moves the family to Houston, Texas, where she will pursue a degree in psychology. This move will jumpstart her career and allow her to better provide for her family.\n\nGREG: Boyhood follows young Mason from age 6 to 18 in twelve vignettes depicting his life as he grows from boyhood to young manhood. This is not a conventional story. There is no  aha moment  where Mason makes the transition from boy to man. There is no  main goal  for Mason to attempt to acquire. This is the deliberate telling of a young man s life as a series of moments in time. Strangely, Boyhood is a sort of period piece as it chronicles what it is like to be a boy in each of the 12 years the movie was filmed. We re shown the elements of Mason s life that were important at that time. For example, Mason graduates from watching Dragonball-Z to playing Gameboy to playing with a Playstation. Normally a filmmaker would have to dig around in the archives of some movie production house for these time-sensitive relics. But for director Richard Linklater, he was simply documenting what was happening at the time he was filming a particular chapter in Mason s life.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, this is a movie that requires patience. There aren t many fascinating moments in this film, and in fact most of the scenes in this movie are depictions of simple moments and mundane details. But that s one of the main points of Boyhood. A person  life is an accumulation of many such moments, and they matter. We learn that everyday moments may seem trivial but they may later carry great significance. These simple life snippets pave the way from boyhood to adulthood. For example, there is one telling scene in which Mason at age 13 is hanging out with a friend and a few older boys at a construction site. The older boys are full of bravado about women and drugs, and they taunt and dare Mason and his friend to partake in their debauchery. The tension in the scene is magnified by them all taking turns violently tossing a blade saw onto a wood plank. Experiences like this are a right of passage for all young men as they test their mettle against their own fears and society s constraints. This is Boyhood at its finest.\n\nGREG: It s hard to say there are any real villains in this story. Although Mason s mother has a tendency to pick drunk, abusive men for husbands. Mason s stepfathers start out nice enough but fall into the  a**hole  zone pretty quickly. I have to say that as a one-off movie this is a pretty neat novelty act. Getting a group of actors to regroup year after year to perform scenes together is a logistical marvel. But as a complete story, it leaves something to be desired. Boyhood has its place in cinema history, but its message that life is a series of moments took a long time (nearly 3 hours) to tell. Watching the young man transform from a boy to a man was entertaining, yet I can t help but get a feeling of watching home movies rather than a coherent story.\n\nSCOTT: As a family hero ensemble, several themes emerge that are central to their journey. One theme is the importance of redemption in family life. The father, Mason, Sr., is mostly a ne er-do-well with an almost debilitating immaturity problem. As the years go by, we are surprised by his growing sense of responsibility as a father and later as a husband to his next wife. Similarly, Olivia takes charge of her life and assumes a responsible position as a college professor. Throughout the movie every adult figure seems to be imploring Mason, Jr., to become more responsible, but of course we witness him learning responsibility the hard way, like all of us do, through a series of mistakes. Boyhood excels in showing us how redemption and responsibility unfold across the human lifespan. Alcoholism is a primary villain in this story. The jerks in this story are afflicted with this addiction and behave atrociously toward our family of heroes. One scene in particular is difficult to watch, as it involves Professor Bill (Marco Perella) behaving abusively while in a drunken rage toward everyone at the dinner table. While we see redemption in many forms in this movie, we never get the sense that anyone overcomes alcoholism. This is a sad lesson of the movie albeit not an unrealistic one.\n\nGREG: I enjoyed Boyhood but I won t be rushing back to the theater to see it again. It was long and for me held little message. It s an unusual story as it doesn t follow the usual pattern. Which is a refreshing change of pace. Still, I think it is the novelty of this approach to storytelling that is the appeal, and not the story itself. I give Boyhood 4 out of 5 Reels. Mason ends up surprisingly well-adjusted after living a life with a variety of fathers and homes. He s a bit of a zen buddhist in his attitudes toward life. Despite all the advice to be responsible, he is in fact among the most responsible people in the movie. He settles on photography as a passion and has little interest in his scholastic assignments - yet he goes to college to study art. He s very much an ordinary young man by the end of the story. His arc is a long one and comes to a nice completion point. I give Mason 4 out of 5 Heroes. The villains in the story are of the type we might encounter every day. As Scott points out, the men in the story give Mason little guidance and a lot of reasons to become a problem child. Still Mason overcomes these villains. Unlike most of the villains we see in the movies, these villains are not complicated puppeteers. And they re not intrinsically bad. We get some background to them and we see where their villainy comes from. I give them 4 out of 5 Villains.  Movie: Villain:  Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Boyhood is a remarkable cinematic achievement for the way it patiently portrays a family s dramatic story unfold over the course of a dozen years. There are no cheap thrills, fancy CGI effects, or scintillating costuming here. There are only real emotions, real family crises, real tears, and moving moments of redemption. We see not just a boy grow up but an entire family blossom, leading me to wonder why this movie isn t called Family or Familyhood. I admired this film greatly and give it 4 Reels out of 5. The heroes were an impressive group of people who took punches, rolled with them, grew nicely, and became better people as the result of their heartaches. There is plenty of growth, mentoring, loving, crying, mending, and healing. In short, Boyhood has just about every aspect of the hero s journey, and each aspect is depicted with searing realism. I believe these heroes deserve 5 Heroes out of 5. There are a few detestable people that our heroes must navigate through on their journey, and the worst of the characters are afflicted with alcoholism. Boyhood s depiction of alcoholism is a by-the-numbers stereotype of the disease and offered an incomplete view of its progression. The addiction and its effect on the men in Olivia s life could have been better fleshed out, and as a result I limit my rating here to 3 Villains out of 5.  Movie: Villain:  Hero:",

Simply telling the story of a mother and her two children, the plot goes through the mother's unsuccessful marriages, the search for the biological father's surrender, the search for dreams, the evolution, stagnation and involution of our characters. The script is not megalomaniac, it is not complex and not full of twists, of course we have many narrative mirrors, and even some easter egg director does, but in essence it is simply portraying the footsteps of a boy, from childhood to youth , Its clarity and simplicity cause perfection in portraying all the subtleties of life, reminiscent of the recent \"Manchester by the sea\", and even the controversial \"Blue is the warmest color\", \"Boyhood\" is almost an epic, an epic Of real life. With a moral that undergoes a message that \"everything has its right time in life\", it is a beautiful message, which the film legitimates, but in a completely natural way, without wishing to lecture or make judgments.

In terms of acting we have many disasters and performances that are completely lost with the passing of the film, after all, we can not forget that the actors of the work recorded it for twelve years, but we have to mention the actor Ellar Coltrane, who during the twelve years makes An incredible performance (a pity that we will see the actor in his junior phase only in this work), it is worth mentioning also to Etha Hawke that manages to give a perfect evolution to his character but without losing its essence, and of course, I can not finish without speaking of Completely crazy and daring Richard Linklater, who has modeled the film for twelve years, and did a perfect job of directing, showing how simple and yet complicated life is, and how all its phases have an intrinsic beauty. \"Boyhood\" is certainly a unique film, we can not doubt that, it is incredible how Richard masterfully accomplished his goal, and since it is subtle and does not play with the viewer, many characters are evolved in intrinsic ways, with gestures that Are not highlighted on the screen, Richard manages to align the script to the rhythm perfectly and manages to show through his camera the life.",

That, however, is that absolute last type of film that \u0093Boyhood\u0094 is.\n \nUsually, movies such as these have a change of actor within the same character role. A child would be cast to play role of the child, a teenager would be cast as the teenager, and an adult would be cast to play the role of an adult because the movies are usually filmed over the span of a year or less. Linklater, however, made the decision to throw caution to the wind and film the same cast, for one week each year, over a span of 12 years (May 2002 to October 2013) and create a movie with an unheard of directing style.\n \nThe film focuses around the life events of a boy named Mason Evans Jr., who is portrayed phenomenally by Ellar Coltrane. As a young boy, Mason, Jr. and his sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), experience the event that no child wants to have happen, the unfortunate splitting of their parents. Olivia and Mason, Sr. (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) both love their children unconditionally but they themselves cannot live happily amongst one another and file for a divorce.\n \nUnfortunately, this leads to a \u0093broken\u0094 childhood for both Mason and Samantha. A majority of it is filled with a drunken father figure who could not give a damn about their happiness or Olivia\u0092s, who is trying extremely hard to create a good life for her children. Mason, Sr., on the other hand, acts as the laid back, free spirited dad who cusses in front of the kids, takes them to sporting events, and just wants to give his kids the best times that they could possibly have.\n \nOver time, we see the kids grow and the parents begin to age\u0085 all naturally of course. Friends come and go and both Olivia and Mason Sr. move all across the state of Texas, just trying to make ends\u0092 meet. The rebellious attitudes start in both Mason Jr. and Samantha. Olivia gets told that she is a terrible mother, that they hate her on a daily basis, and that they want to live with their dad. The same exact things that we would say if we were ever in the awkward situation that the kids are in.\n \nAs Mason and Samantha progress through their teenage years, the film begins to ask the deeper questions of life that all of us once asked ourselves. What is \u0093normal\u0094? How do I fit in with society? Will I ever amount to anything in life? We see Mason start to make questionable decisions: Drinking with seniors in high school as a freshman, talking about getting \u0093pussy\u0094 and how many times they have gotten it, smoking weed and making out with girls who are substantially older than him. All of situations that a majority of high school students go through at some point or another.\n \nEventually, Samantha goes off to school and we see a drastic drop in her screen time. It is rather unfortunate that she goes from being a main character to virtually not being in the move at all but this allows Mason to grow more as a character. He eventually gets in a relationship with a girl named Sheena, who basically replaces Samantha as the female presence in the second half of the movie. As almost all high school students do, Mason must undergo the trial of unexplained heartbreak when him and Sheena experience problems. Linklater does a great job at capturing all of the yelling, lies, and the eventual depression that sets in after a breakup occurs.\n \nTime presses on and Mason ends up graduating from high school and goes off to college. His mother describes it as being the worst day of her life, just like all mothers do when a child leaves to go to school. Mason, however, is genuinely excited to take the next step and his roommate ends up being exactly like himself. The two end up ditching the \u0093boring college orientation mixer\u0094, and pick up two other attractive girls to go on a hiking trip in the desert. Mason finally finds the group of people that will help him answer life\u0092s crucial questions that the film poses throughout. One of Mason\u0092s newfound friends, Nicole, provides a quote that sums up the movie perfectly. When speaking to Mason, she states, \u0093You know how everyone\u0092s always saying seize the moment? I don\u0092t know, I\u0092m kind of thinking it\u0092s the other way around, you know, the moment seizes us.\u0094\n \nThat is exactly what \u0093Boyhood\u0094 is. A collection of laughs, stupid decisions, deep thoughts, and heart-wrenching moments that seize Mason and his family and ultimately leave you wanting more. Who knows, maybe Linklater will try his luck with a film entitled \u0093Adulthood\u0094 and follow the same characters for another 12 years? One can only hope.",

The story unfolds as a series of snapshots filmed over twelve years using the same cast each time. This in itself is an extraordinary feat and the dedication and devotion to the project of the cast members and writer/director Richard Linklater really stand out. It makes the story feel genuine and heart-felt. The portrayal of the developing and evolving family relationships is beautifully done and the viewer really gets to know the central character Mason, his sister Samantha, his mum and her various boyfriends and husbands and his own biological father. It is a great insight into a modern family life showing all the tensions, triumphs and traumas that many people have to deal with. There is one moment when the teenage Mason and his stepbrother return home to find a devastating event unfolding that is shocking and upsetting but, on the whole, this is a gentle, tender movie with many uplifting and funny moments. I particularly liked the way in which the relationship between Mason and Samantha changes from childhood sibling rivalry and argument to teenage irritation and finally the familial love of two well adjusted, young adults. The actors are brilliantly cast with the lead being taken by Ellar Coltrane and his sister Lorelei Linklater. Both are extraordinarily engaging and credit for this must also go to Richard Linklater's direction which is naturalistic and unintrusive. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke play the children's mom and dad who themselves go through hugely transforming story arcs.

I also watch movies to learn something, or to get insight into another life or another culture, so I enjoyed this movie.  What held my interest was the dysfunctional family, and seeing how the mother handled abuse.  I did not see warning signs of these evil men when the mother was dating them, so she didn't seem to be one of those idiot-women who let themselves be shoved around by some ogre-of-a-man.  I experienced an emotionally abusive husband (he was never physically abusive), so I'm so very curious to see how other women handle this.  I had wonderful parents, so it was hard for me to understand what the kids were going through.  I tried to put myself in the kids' shoes, and wondered how I would handle such a bully of a father.  I'd like to think I'd say, \"Go away, you slob!\" and report him, but easier said than done.  A good film won't depict a character as all good or all bad, so as a kid, you're confused when they are kind.  Abusers apologize a lot and give flowers.  At first, I wondered if the the father was just disciplining the kids, making them do their homework and chores.  You do have to get on kids.  Then it went too far.  I was glad when the mother took her kids out of the abusive home.  I wanted to shake the daughter who whined because she now didn't have her own room and had to go to a different school.  Teens can be so very self-absorbed.  It made me wonder if I was this selfish when I was a teen.  \n\nEthan Hawk's character was interesting.  He seemed hyper, always \"on\" with his inner pistons going full throttle.  While he was a screw-up when he was young, he had a kind heart and matured throughout the movie.  His latest wife calmed him.    \n\nIt was interesting to me to see the aging process all in one movie.  I was surprised the boy was solid and light-haired as a young boy, then extremely skinny and black-haired as an older teen.  He went from 'average kid' to 'super cool dude.'  \n\nAll in all, this movie did what it sought out to accomplish - showing an ordinary life of a boy.",

It's a really beautiful experience to watch this kid and his family grow before your eyes. You really feel like you are with him on life's journey.

Captivating, the story of an average child and what he goes through with his aparently normal family is hauntingly tender and revealing. Without using any extraordinary resources or extravagant events, as is the custom of the indie style of the last decade, this movie relates a series of events about the transition from childhood to adolescence of a boy, abandoning \"the normal\" I previously mentioned and passing along several circumstances that are determinant in his life and many of which are reflected as part of the experiences we have directly lived. Although the film is long, it is never uncomfortable or boring, in fact it is quite catchy and allows the audience to find many matching points, sympathizing with the characters, who are incredibly original from beginning to end. The argument is divided by stages, by important memories, and each scene flows without needing to be explained what is happening; They are events that function as if they were inside someone's narrative mind, chronicling themselves without anything else. The nature of this drama is exciting, charming and leaves a good trail of thoughts of what is the journey of life, with its good and bad things, forming a project that is concretely and elegantly positioned as a great big message of what is this bit of moments that we can usually forget. 84/100",

However, if you do have children, especially around the ages of 14-18 this film might surprise you and win you over past its half way point (and its a long one). I think Linklater has a thing with enforcing his female leads to gain weight during the process? (where as David Lynch just says, well you will have to be naked). Linklaters films show evidence to back this up. I can not speak for my 17 year old son's generation but I feel this film nailed it to a tee, and that is no easy task. As subtle as subtle can get, but meaningful and asking some very good questions. Linklater puts hope and optimism on the table for our children.",

Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue.

A different movie would have had him get into a serious car accident. This just acknowledges that it's dangerous and moves on. The one part where I thought they went off-track a bit was when the second husband started going crazy. His character I thought was drawn way too extreme and didn't fit in the rest of the movie. I was glad his storyline was resolved fairly early on. It's quite a feat that Linklater pulls off filming this over 12 years so the aging of the characters is very natural. I know people who were like Mason as teenagers and a lot of the scenes rang true. Patricia Arquette won the Academy Award, but I thought Ethan Hawke's performance was even better. Yes, his character is a screw-up, but he really does want to be in his children's lives. It's almost three hours long, but I definitely think it's worth seeing.",

This is one true work of art. There is not one thing to not enjoy. I was a little worried because before I heard that this movie does not have much of a plot,I heard on that on a facebook group and well I believe he is wrong there is a plot here, and a pretty darn good one.\nThe film centers on Mason and his years from Boyhood to adulthood and all the hardships with his single mother and his friendship with his father.\nLast year I missed the opportunity to see Linklater's final chapter of the before trilogy but saw the film right after I got all three of them on Blu-ray and DVD. When I heard about this film and how he has been filming it for about twelve years. This was such a joy to watch on the theater screen from the opening shot of the film which is the poster it has t he best cinematography of any film I've seen on any film all year.\nWhen the film opens I was expecting narration but it doesn't need any monologues just great acting from actors who throughout the film can embody their character. We see the hard life-spans of each age for Mason which is what makes this film great to identify with. I felt at ease with this film feeling like maybe I can enjoy life through boyhood before adulthood and I don't have to keep waiting for the outcome. It makes the film kind of heartwarming in that kind of sense if you think about your boyhood and Masons.\nThis is no doubt is Richard Linklater's best film,and I haven't seen much from him just this and the before trilogy but as of know I think this is best. With it's beautiful cinematography,awesome camera shots and great acting. I give Boyhood a five out of five.",

            "content": "Imagine if someone captured your childhood on film, with all the seminal events that helped shape you into the person you are today. (Didn't Facebook do this with our photos and videos last year?) How would it look? Would it be compelling viewing to anyone other than you, your family and your close friends? Which events would you include - getting your first pet, performing in your first school play, having your first kiss, moving to a new neighbourhood, breaking your arm, experiencing the death of a friend? How about playing video games, learning how to throw a football, or just hanging out with your father?\n\nThis is what director Richard Linklater (the BEFORE film series) has created with BOYHOOD. Filmed over a 12-year period and using the same actors throughout, BOYHOOD follows young Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) as he grows up to ultimately become an 18-year-old university freshman. It is an interesting concept and certainly a laborious one. It is similar to what director Michael Apted has done with his UP series of documentaries (56 UP was released in 2012), except that Linklater's film is both fictional and shows us what happens to someone year after year rather than relying on testimony every seven years as Apted's films do.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing much happens to Mason. We see him drinking his first beer and pumping gas into his first car but are these really his formative moments? The closest we get to witnessing any drama in his life happens when his mother's second husband smashes a glass on the dinner table.\n\nPerhaps we have been conditioned to expect to be taken on a journey when we go see a movie. If there is a cause, there should be an effect. In one scene, teenage Mason comes home late after being at his first keg party. His mother's latest man chides him for being irresponsible. Great - drama at last! But all Mason does is shrug his shoulders and head off to bed. And the story moves on. If he gets grounded, we don't see it. If he runs away overnight, we don't see it. If he contemplates suicide in a moment of teenage angst, we don't see it.\n\nI don't want to say that this is laziness on the Linklater's part because committing to a project of this scope is anything but lazy. We're given a glimpse into his rationale at the very end of the film when a new friend of Mason's says that the concept of carpe diem is all wrong. She says that we don't seize events. Events seize us. But I disagree. Some of us do seize events. That is what is called \"good luck\". When Mason is getting ready to leave home for university, his mother has her own epiphany. \"I thought there would be more\", she says. The film's message is that there isn't anything more. No, no, no! I don't believe that we are put on this planet only to be passive players in the drama of life. True, we don't all soar and have lives beyond anyone's wildest dreams but we do have moments in our lives when we do get our feet off the ground and fly for just a bit. Sadly, Mason doesn't fly, or we don't get to see him fly. He merely exists, as events happen around him.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the film is that we get to watch Mason grow. His hair gets long then it gets short. He enters puberty and then he goes \"emo\", complete with the nail polish. The changes we see in his parents (played by Linklater regular Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) are less impressive to us because we have seen them both on movie and TV screens many times over the years.\n\nBOYHOOD is ultimately nothing more than a series of marginally connected vignettes. Nothing really gives us any indication about Mason's behaviour and motivation. Don't get me wrong about this film. I respect the director for his ambition but, for me, this film should have been called BOYHOOD: A DULL LIFE.",

Hailed \"extraordinary\" by Christopher Nolan and \"an incredible gift\"  by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the person who beat Boyhood to the Best Picture crown in a \"thank you\" email. Boyhood (2014) is the highest rated movie in the 2010s, and it was accomplished by 12 years of hard work and a mere budget of 4 million. What does this independent film have to tell?\n\nOver its 150 min runtime, Boyhood doesn't feel like a movie. Its apparently a documentary of a boy growing up in the American society and custom. From beginning to end, every scene is shot natural and genuine, with transitions and plot elements so truthful to how a person's life would be. It makes easier for the audience to relate and feel with the characters so to have a grasp of the main themes Boyhood tries to convey. There is almost zero drama, zero climax. And that is to depict life, a journey without drama, without climax, but still challenging and epic as life continues.\n\nAll the realism is further substantiated by tremendous acting. The protagonist is acting so well regardless of the age he was in. His expression is natural while being enigmatic and innocent at the same time so to provide the film a central character with a personality and attitude. His parents acted incredibly - his mum and dad are true to their roles and doesn't look anywhere near faking. Even the minor characters are being natural and vivid under the film's free-style direction.\n\nThe only thing with Boyhood concerns what it might prove to be in front of a wider audience. As typical Americans shall relate and cry for the film's characters, for other people it is a process of understanding and wondering American customs'. For instance, I felt more like I was musing over the differences of how a child grow up to be a young adult in America comparing to one growing up in Hong Kong. Here's a difference in perspective of watching a film due to custom difference between countries and races.\n\nHowever, at the end. We are all marveling at how accurately is Boyhood depicting the process of growing up and the process of living. It's film structure, having no lucid direction and telling a story by crumbling chunks of sequences about a boy in his different stages of life - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, with no foreshadowing and complexity, merely coherent and intentionally throwing in unnecessary plot points, somehow created a meaningful, realistic picture of the randomness, emptiness, goalless of life, its fleeting nature and those ephemeral moments to shine and scintillate being the elements that cause us to feel lost and to feel hope spasmodically. All in all it is one meaningful movie that thoroughly proves the power of an indie film, and the fact that sometimes the making of a good film doesn't need much money and effort. You just need time, 12 years of incessant filming using the same actors/actresses, and reap what you sow in one particular fateful year.\n\nRating: 8/10",

The greatest achievement is the ambitious period that it took to film this over, and convincing Producers to put up the money for this which they wouldn't see a return from for over decade - and probably nearer two.  It's possibly a little longer than it needs to be, but given the unique production it's forgivable for them to put as much into the feature as they have.  It's overly nepotistic for the director to cast his daughter in such a prominent role for this type of production too.",

            "content": "Filming the same actors over 12 years to show them ageing in real life is what made Richard Linklater's Boyhood famous. However the film is far more than just a clever idea, it is a phenomenal film literally about growing up. It is an engaging, funny, moving and relatable masterpiece that explores childhood and parenting in great depth.\n\nThe film has no real plot in the normal sense of the word, it simply follows Mason Junior (Ellar Coltrane) from the ages of 6 to 18. His life evolves naturally and realistically, there is no great drama or plot twists, it is simply conveying real life, which it does perfectly. The jumps in time are unannounced and irregular, instead they are shown by how the characters look and the setting. This results in the feeling similar to seeing a friend or relative after a long time, where things have changed but there is still a great sense of familiarity. Although Mason is the focus, we watch his sister (Lorelei Linklater), Mum (Patricia Arquette) and Dad (Ethan Hawke) grow and change in their own ways, making the film much more than just a tale of 'Boyhood'. The cast is the real strength of the film, Arquette and Hawke are undeniably superb and the child actors, including the many side characters, are exceptional throughout. This is an accomplishment that should not be overlooked, casting very young actors that need to have the skill to remain talented throughout is incredibly hard, as shown by the Harry Potter franchise and, to some extent, Modern Family. With their talent and the pitch perfect script, the film manages to explore and tackle themes and issues that in less skilled hands would come off as overly sentimental or irksomely quirky.\n\nOne of these themes is nostalgia, something that is challenging to do without appearing like you are trying to get a cheap emotional reaction from the audience. It is handled expertly. It is not trying to shove a toy or popular song down your throat shouting \"remember this??\" Instead the film is simply using the music, clothes, Gameboys etc that were around when it was filmed in a completely natural way. It feels like 2002 because what you're seeing is 2002. This is yet another example of how Linklater's idea and hard work really paid off. Had the same script been shot in one go using makeup and different actors to portray the ageing process it just would not be as effective or moving.",

At first I thought it was some computer enhanced aging technique, but as it progressed, it became more apparent this was actually filmed over a long period.  \n\nThis is a typical Linklater film, like Before Sunrise, etc.  It is a good film.  it is about a boy growing up, doing normal things.  However, the protagonist, Mason, is a mediocre adolescent, a slouch who wears makeup and paints his nails.  He is effeminate, and isn't particularly likeable.  So, the film evolves into a showcase for a underachiever and a high-probability inefficient, unproductive loser.  Why then, should this be a great film? \n\nThe movie is almost 3 hours long.  I thought this was completely unnecessary, given the simplicity of the plot.  A number of vignettes of a single mother family, working hard to make ends meet and making the worst mistakes possible in selecting spouses and boyfriends.  Her poor choices obviously negatively impact her poor children who lack a father figure in their lives.\n\nLinklater selects his daughter as one of the main characters.  Good showcase for nepotism.\n\nAfter seeing this movie, I thought, how would I feel about it if it hadn't been filmed over 12 years?  The answer is that this wouldn't be a particularly eventful film.  Therefore, this is a great film in that it was filmed over 12 years, but aside from this feature, there is not much depth to this flat plot.  The groupthink of critics obviously disagree with this, but I'm simply calling a spade a spade here.\n\nBy the way, this was not the first movie to be filmed over the course of many years.  \"Seven Up!\" (1964) established the genre in a documentary format.",

This may not of been an intended outcome but it definitely means you will most likely find some part of the story to resonate with.\n\nI believe that this movie is worth watching at least for the experience. It was an incredibly unique movie for is groundbreaking concept alone. Yet walking away you may not feel as satisfied as if you were watching a Hollywood blockbuster. This is due to the realistic feel and structure of the film. There is no \"payoff\", there is no specific story arc, and there is no epic climax... BUT, this is something that definitely works for the film. It is its realism that makes it so enthralling to watch for not only for the \"down to earth\" moments but more notably the humor. As a result I have never laughed so much at the theater in any recent memory. \n\nBut don't take my word on it. See it for yourself. \n\nDefinitely worth the watch.",

Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to love here, but I'm not at all convinced that this film comes close to equaling the sum of its parts. \n\nThe performances are great, with Ethan Hawke's 'Dad' reminding me of a similar performance by Mark Ruffalo in 'The Kids' Are Alright'. Arquette steals the show though and her character is easily my favourite thing about this film. It was completely realistic,  nuanced, and human and was a truly breathtaking dramatic performance. \n\nUnfortunately, I was not so impressed with the character of Mason- it's hard to fault the actor here as he is really just a young boy turning into a young adult and that is an undeniably real thing that happened and that you can see with your own eyes, however, the way that the character was written didn't impress me at all. There's simply nothing particularly interesting about Mason's life and, as the film resolves around it, that's not a good sign. I found myself constantly wanting the story to get back to his Mum or Dad and everything else just meandered along for me.\n\nThere's still plenty of great moments but the film is almost three hours long and those moments are few and far between. Sure, I get that this is a realistic execution of, what is a brilliant concept, but you can't fall back on the concept and let that dictate how the film progresses. \n\nUltimately, what I enjoyed was what I felt the film had earned- Patricia Arquette earned my attention with her fabulous performance but I can't say the same about most of the film. Was I a young boy once? Yes,. Are some of the moments in this film similar to moments that I've experienced growing up? Sure. Is any of that enough to make 'Boyfhood' a particularly special film? No.",

            "content": "Boyhood is one of those ''love-it'' or ''hate-it'' kind of movies, the critics all adore this film, and the average audience member hates it. Which is understandable, Boyhood is by no means a flawless films (as a LOT of critics claim it to be) but it doesnt deserve all of the immense hate people are giving it either. I'm neither a ''love-it'' or ''hate-it'' kind of guy, i thought it was a good movie that certainly has its moments but i also thought it was a movie that had so much potential and missed a lot of it. \nLet's start with the cons of this movie, Boyhood is empty because it lacks content and form. It celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary. Boyhood is not an entertaining film and the almost 3 hour runtime is probably to blame for it, it certainly has it's moment of wit and compassion but overall i would not call Boyhood an entertaining film, on top of that there isnt really a story, it's more like just the life of someone where things happen, and that's it. It doesnt have a solid premise either.\nNext problem, there isnt a single character to whom you feel compassionate to, (except maybe Ethan Hawke's character, he is the stand out) and the film focuses on the life of Mason, a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever. Mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep; he has no ambitions. At some point he gets his first kiss, gets interested in photography (the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people) during high school, goes to college at which point the film ends. \nBefore going in i knew this was going to be a movie about ordinary people, in ordinary situations in an ordinary life, which might turn people away from a movie like this very quickly, but not me since i'm a MASSIVE fan of Linklater's other work: The Before Trilogy, a trilogy where nothing happens and where the audience follows ordinary people living their ordinary lives. Sounds boring right? But it certainly isnt, the Before trilogy are all 3 such meticulous, astoundingly acted, brilliantly written pieces of cinema where Linklater celebrates the normality of people's lives instead of going for the flashy razzle dazzle. It sounds boring but it is so incredibly captivating, beautiful and brilliant. and since Boyhood was also about ordinary people i was expecting the same kind of brilliance Linklater had shown the world with the Before trilogy. Linklater is a master at making very uneventful but thought provoking movies, except this one isnt thought provoking.\n\nNow we have the cons out of the way, what are the pros about this 3 hour movie.\nThe performances are good, with Ethan Hawke as the standout, there are quite some exceptional moments in this movie, but that's all they are, moments, which is a shame, too little to fill the 3 hours. Boyhood captures the normality of life perfectly, something Linklater is exceptional at, only he didn't make it interesting, which he so perfectly did in the Before Trilogy. The fact that it's shot over 12 years shows how ambitious Linklater is, and the fact that he made 8 movies in between those 12 years is quite an achievement too. For a movie like this to work perfectly it would need to have emotional depth throughout the film, Boyhood has that in certain moments, but definitely not throughout the film.\n\nAll in all, Boyhood is by no means a masterpiece or a flawless films, which is something critics claim, but it also isnt as terrible as lots of people make it out to be. Boyhood is a stellar cinematic achievement with certainly a lot of great moments, but in the end falls short of greatness by being just a little too structureless and empty.",

It contains terrible actors, all of them.  I think Ethan Hawke was great in this, but Arquette was just a wooden and terrible as she is in everything. The rest of the nobody's were emotionless extras who most likely have appeared in ONE movie in their life, Boyhood. It features terrible dialog - \"Don't forget to floss\" he was randomly advised by a passer-by photography judge as they chatted after a photography competition.... It shows a lifetime of bad decisions by the main actress (I only refer in general terms to Patricia Arquette as an actress - I don't mean to imply in the least that she can act more than stand and talk and cry and fall and cry - this movie needed a stronger actress, an actual actress maybe) that are so completely unrealistic.   It contains no actual story, no point, no message, no complete thought.... I found myself wanting to watch it simply to make fun of how bad it is.

For me, Boyhood was not just as good as most people said it is, it may have been even better. In fact, it may have been one of the best movies I've ever seen. Seriously! I was very impressed.\n\nFor obvious reasons, a lot of the talk surrounding this film is the way it was shot. To commit twelve years with the same cast and crew telling a continuation of the same story is just incredible. I sometimes lose interest in what I'm doing in less than half an hour. These people spent over a decade working on this modern classic. That's simply amazing.\n\nThe story itself is what the title implies it to be. It's the story of one child's journey from boy to man, through good times and bad. There were absolutely moments in this film where you'll feel uncomfortable and for good reason. It's meant to be a completely real look at family life so don't expect happy endings whenever you see conflict. It was extremely refreshing to see things actually go wrong in a modern drama. \n\nOne of the more fun parts of the film is the way it drags you into the setting. As the story is told over the span of twelve years, there are quite a few cultural and technological changes that happen along the way. You'll continually have moments of \"oh I remember that\" and it'll help you get that much more into the story. After awhile, the characters seem to become a family that you've known for years. You know everywhere they've been and you become genuinely disappointed when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nAt the risk of going on about this film too long, I'll wrap it up here. I don't need to go in about the settings or the soundtrack as you already know them. You lived it. That's really what I love the most about this film. It's the story of this family and how they connect with our real world. We know the characters as they live next door. There's only one thing that really makes me feel sorry for the characters. They'll never be able to watch Boyhood, one of the best films ever made.",

            "content": "'Boyhood' is written and directed by Richard Linklater, the man behind the far superior 'Before' trilogy. The film works with an experiment, of filming the same boy grow over a 12 year period. It's easy to be distracted by this, and not look beyond the gimmick for all the other things that make a true 'masterpiece', that 'Boyhood' is missing. \nThe 12 year filming idea is undoubtedly impressive. It's totally unique, and it does work. The time changes are seamless, and the change in quality has been masked by some pretty brilliant editing. Also, as we journey back over the last t2 years, we are treated to a fair bit of nostalgia, which is a nice touch, albeit a little distracting.\nOne more positive is the performances of Ethan Hawke, undoubtedly the best part of the film, and Patricia Arquette, who won an Oscar for her role. Beyond these highlights, the film fails to offer much else.\nIt's a film claiming to be this truly realistic portrayal of the adolescence of a young boy, but that has been wrongfully highly regarded, when plenty of films have done this better in the past. The 12 year 'gimmick' does make it intimate and realistic, but that's really of the film has to offer. Whether Linklater likes it or not, movies do require an actual plot, and 'Boyhood' lacks one. It's true that there are minor plot points that we witness as he grows up, but there is no overall narrative outside of 'boy grows up'. If audiences wanted a documentary, there are plenty around, but film's require a plot, and characters that we care about, and this film has neither. \nWith the film's central character, Mason, we are given a boy who is not even all that likeable. Admittedly, Ellar Coltrane's emotionless performance doesn't help, but as someone who was thrown into acting at a young age, he can be forgiven. Even so, the character himself is not likeable. Linklater fails to give us someone engaging or interesting in any way, and whose way of thinking actually comes across like nothing more than a pretentious, self-righteous teenager, and in a film that solely relies on us caring about him, it fails massively. \nUltimately, 'Boyhood' is a long, plotless, tiresome movie with no real intrigue, that has been coasting on an admittedly impressive idea, and a couple of great performances in Hawke. It's worth a watch once, but it's nowhere near as important as the filmmakers and many critics would have you believe. It's three stars are for Hawke, Arquette, and for Linklater, who admirably attempted something so original, at a time when Hollywood is becoming repetitive.",

However, the lack of a climax or even a plot makes Boyhood feel more like an art project and less like a film. Boyhood relies heavily on nostalgia and life events that are so incredibly common in the life of an average American boy, they beat the purpose of the film. The film is highly enjoyable in fractions since at several points the story becomes tedious. \n\nBoyhood is by no means a bad movie, but I can't help it but to think how much more entertaining and emotionally investing would have been if instead of an average American boy the film would have shown the life of a middle-Eastern child in the middle of the civil war or a Latin American kid during times of drug wars where we could witness tragedy and colossal events that surround the life of the main character from the innocent perspective of a kid not quite understanding why is mom crying or why can't he hang out anymore with his gangster cousin... so many missed opportunities.",

That, however, is that absolute last type of film that \"Boyhood\" is.\n\nUsually, movies such as these have a change of actor within the same character role. A child would be cast to play role of the child, a teenager would be cast as the teenager, and an adult would be cast to play the role of an adult because the movies are usually filmed over the span of a year or less. Linklater, however, made the decision to throw caution to the wind and film the same cast, for one week each year, over a span of 12 years (May 2002 to October 2013) and create a movie with an unheard of directing style.\n\nThe film focuses around the life events of a boy named Mason Evans Jr., who is portrayed phenomenally by Ellar Coltrane. As a young boy, Mason, Jr. and his sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), experience the event that no child wants to have happen, the unfortunate splitting of their parents. Olivia and Mason, Sr. (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) both love their children unconditionally but they themselves cannot live happily amongst one another and file for a divorce. \n\nUnfortunately, this leads to a \"broken\" childhood for both Mason and Samantha. A majority of it is filled with a drunken father figure who could not give a damn about their happiness or Olivia's, who is trying extremely hard to create a good life for her children. Mason, Sr., on the other hand, acts as the laid back, free spirited dad who cusses in front of the kids, takes them to sporting events, and just wants to give his kids the best times that they could possibly have.\n\nOver time, we see the kids grow and the parents begin to age... all naturally of course. Friends come and go and both Olivia and Mason Sr. move all across the state of Texas, just trying to make ends' meet. The rebellious attitudes start in both Mason Jr. and Samantha. Olivia gets told that she is a terrible mother, that they hate her on a daily basis, and that they want to live with their dad. The same exact things that we would say if we were ever in the awkward situation that the kids are in.\n\nAs Mason and Samantha progress through their teenage years, the film begins to ask the deeper questions of life that all of us once asked ourselves. What is \"normal\"? How do I fit in with society? Will I ever amount to anything in life? We see Mason start to make questionable decisions: Drinking with seniors in high school as a freshman, talking about getting \"pussy\" and how many times they have gotten it, smoking weed and making out with girls who are substantially older than him. All of situations that a majority of high school students go through at some point or another. \n\nEventually, Samantha goes off to school and we see a drastic drop in her screen time. It is rather unfortunate that she goes from being a main character to virtually not being in the move at all but this allows Mason to grow more as a character. He eventually gets in a relationship with a girl named Sheena, who basically replaces Samantha as the female presence in the second half of the movie. As almost all high school students do, Mason must undergo the trial of unexplained heartbreak when him and Sheena experience problems. Linklater does a great job at capturing all of the yelling, lies, and the eventual depression that sets in after a breakup occurs.\n\nTime presses on and Mason ends up graduating from high school and goes off to college. His mother describes it as being the worst day of her life, just like all mothers do when a child leaves to go to school. Mason, however, is genuinely excited to take the next step and his roommate ends up being exactly like himself. The two end up ditching the \"boring college orientation mixer\", and pick up two other attractive girls to go on a hiking trip in the desert. Mason finally finds the group of people that will help him answer life's crucial questions that the film poses throughout. One of Mason's newfound friends, Nicole, provides a quote that sums up the movie perfectly. When speaking to Mason, she states, \"You know how everyone's always saying seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kind of thinking it's the other way around, you know, the moment seizes us.\"\n\nThat is exactly what \"Boyhood\" is. A collection of laughs, stupid decisions, deep thoughts, and heart-wrenching moments that seize Mason and his family and ultimately leave you wanting more. Who knows, maybe Linklater will try his luck with a film entitled \"Adulthood\" and follow the same characters for another 12 years? One can only hope.",

The whole scale of it is impressive and I did relate to a bunch of it since I am the same age as the main character and grew up in the same year, which made this kinda nostalgic and special for me, but there are a few problems that prevent this from living up to the hype it had, such as a few eh performances (like Linklater's daughter when she grows up), and an extremely repetitive 2nd half. I also felt Mason should have had more development, he was really bland, but what made me like the movie was how it was filmed and the parents, both of which were really interesting and played great by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. It was a very good and enjoyable film for me personally, but on an objective level good is where it stops. It's not one of the greatest films ever made like I think it wants to be and has nothing on Linklater's Before Trilogy, but as a film it is good and I would recommend checking it out at least once, especially if you are my age.",

            "content": "There is a beautiful simplicity to this movie. Filming over twelve years is an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking for any director, but Richard Linklater is up for the task. This coming of age movie follows one boy and his family, as he transitions from childhood to adulthood. Rather than making a movie with different actors, Linklater uses the same cast of actors and filmed it over a twelve-year period. There is no artificial movie magic to age the characters, and the effect is profoundly powerful. The characters not only literally grow older, but their characters evolve slowly and organically throughout the two hour and forty-five minutes of the film. The acting is superb; it makes you stop and remember how different we are as individuals at various points in our lives. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are great as the parents and Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater were phenomenal young actors as their children. All four of them handle their character transformations impeccably well. This is particularly impressive considering how different their character is at each stage of the movie. They are essentially playing multiple roles, even if they all portray the same individual. By making the movie over a twelve-year time span, the actors are paralleling their roles. It allows them to pull in their real-life energy, attitudes, and emotions into their roles; that is why it feels so genuine and realistic. The thoughtful story and a well-crafted sincere dialogue feel like watching a real family. It is not a particularly eventful story, which makes the movie more of an experience than a theatrical entertainment. The story meanders along slowly changing, similar to our own lives. Not everything is important or happens for a reason, but it shows how even snapshots of dull moments in our lives hold great amounts of meaning and can represent who we are at that point in time. It is an incredibly insightful movie, because it makes you reflect your personal journey through life, regardless of your age or generation. There is a universal quality of truthfulness to it in how it confronts the viewers with their own childhood, adolescence, romantic love, heartbreaks, youth, parenthood, and late-life mortality. It is hard to believe a movie can do all this, but it does it all and there is nothing else like it.",

I cannot fault the overall vision and uniqueness of this picture and it is hard to fault the film for the flaws that I felt while watching.\n\nAside from the parents played by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette the acting is really dreadful; it's almost painful at times. Again, it would be nearly impossible to cast Mason Jr at age 6 and have any expectations that he would blossom into an actor, but as the main character it really makes the movie a touch difficult during his scenes.\n\nAlso, did I sound so pompous when I was his age?",

I'd say it's one of the best movies ever and obviously my most favourite from the year 2014.

This provides a definite counterpoint to the usual technique of using different actors to play the same character at different ages - which was never ever believable.  Here, central character Mason (Jr.) ages from 7 to 19, as does actor Ellar Coltrane (who turns out to be pretty solid all the way through, getting more to do as he gets older).  Rather than use this set-up to make something experimental or post-modern, Linklater takes a more or less traditional approach to narrative, following Mason and his family (mother Patricia Arquette, father Ethan Hawke, and sister Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter), as they age across 12 years (the film's working title). As I'm the father of two boys myself, the early focus on parenting resonated with me (although Arquette's role as a single mom is impossibly harder) and as the kids aged, I felt a distinct sense of anxiety whenever threats were near.  I'll look forward to this in real life.  The film is sometimes advertised as a nostalgic look at the recent past, featuring music and cultural reference points from 2002 to 2013, but for me it was the common (possibly American) experiences of childhood that were the highlights.  These kids go through some tough times but end up OK. In fact, Mason Jr. ends up pretty cool (influenced by his probably too cool to be true parents).  The script, written by Linklater, tries hard but offers some clunky moments or lines.  As with the Before Sunrise trilogy, you've got to suspend your disbelief sometimes to accept that anyone would ever say some of these things - but the feelings behind these lines often still ring true.  A really neat accomplishment.",

This kid made no difficult choices, good or bad, he didn't ponder or question or challenge the world like normal adolescents would. Integrity? Selfishness? Compassion? Intelligence? Morality? Who knows? Even when there was turmoil he just existed among it - it's as though everyone involved in this project has completely forgotten their formative years. The film would have been more realistic and entertaining had Ellar Coltrane documented his own 'boyhood' for 12 years. My one star is for Arquette.",

            "content": "Boyhood is far from the perfect film. It has flaws (speaking from a subjective cinematic level). Pacing is all over the place. Characters (central, supportive, background) come in and out of focus on a whim (perhaps the most notable being the presence of the sister). And yet the film had a powerful impact on the way I view life. No matter how far one gets in the film, it is hard to avoid the essential tool director Linklater (Before Sunrise series) uses to tell his story, the story of Mason as a young boy who grows up in front of our eyes. And that tool is \"time\" itself. \n\nThe accomplishment of Boyhood is that it is filmed over 12 years using the same characters. In this sense it is filmed in real time, almost feeling like a documentary of sorts, and yet never relinquishing its hold on the idea that this is also a film with scenes, with something of a structure, with narrative. This tension (and again, some might see this tension as wholly positive or negative) is what keeps the viewer engaged, even when we forget at moments about the sheer accomplishment of this sort of cinematic scope. \n\nI will admit that there were moments when Boyhood was frustrating. When the tension falters the danger is found in viewing the film from one lens or the other (as a real time experiment or as a cinematic narrative). I must also admit that there were times where this tension became an obstacle for my ability to get lost in the film itself. And yet that was a part of the process for me. There are times in life where I wish I could reach for that fast forward button, in much the same way as the real time perspective in the film tended to get bogged down at different points. There are also times in life when I wish I could reach for that rewind button, to recapture that moment that seemed to go by far too fast when I happened to be distracted (as I watch the film with my phone by my side) or wasn't fully looking (even sometimes dozing off). This is where the film starts to truly represent something of meaning. \n\nOne has to wonder, regarding the scope of the film, whether the director had the script already layed out or whether he let it form on its own right as each actor aged and changed and developed in their own respective lives. Was the director influenced by watching and observing the real lives of the actors themselves, or was he directing them towards a singular vision as they aged? These are the fun questions (I find anyways) to ask. I doubt I will ever know, but perhaps an interview which I have not yet seen might shed some light. And yet how I navigate these questions and which assumptions I carry with me in to the viewing itself has an impact on how I receive and perceive this film. Thematically Boyhood is a coming of age story about a young boy merging in to adulthood. And yet it is also about the function (and disfunction) of family. In one scene it is about a young boy being exposed to the challenges of divorce and the emotions of abuse. In another it is about the struggles of the birth father in getting his act together. In another it is about a young single (and at times not single) mother attempting to keep her life, her family and her career afloat. In another it is about learning to deal with a complicated political American landscape in which 9/11 has thrown everything in to disarray. At yet another it is about the struggles of puberty, of facing graduation, of entering in to relationships and friendships and figuring out life's meaning and passions and future aspirations. It is all here. And it grows up faster than we might like. It is messy and complicated. \n\nAs I mentioned, with all of these themes in tow (plus many more happening underneath the surface such as issues of self respect, confidence, trust, integrity, emotions, forgiveness), the film does end up moving from one focus to another. Sometimes we are left with long spells where the development of the birth father moves far out of our view. This fits with the nature of the time as a character as the father only has select visitations and is not in the picture nearly as much as the mother. At the same time this sacrifices some of our ability to invest in the fathers own journey. The sister plays a central part early on, but as the characters age she becomes distant. Again, she is the oldest and this reflects some of the natural progression of her own life (in being the first to transition out of home). At the same time we are left with an incomplete picture of who she is. The mother's own story slowly moves from prominent to the background as well, perhaps mirroring the perspective of Mason himself as he finds his independence. There is a striking scene near the end where we are settled back in on the mother for a final moment in which she suddenly breaks down, wondering what this whole journey is about. Time is fleeting, as she points out, and facing the loss of Mason to his post graduate life signifies for her a sort of mid life crisis, a reminder that she only has so many transitions left before the grave. And yet this moment happens and then we find ourselves on the road alone with Mason as he reflects and ponders his own coming transitions. \n\nAgain, the film (on a purely cinematic level) is all over the place. And yet it becomes easy to give a degree of grace to this erradic behaviour. Perhaps because it reminds us of our own lives. Perhaps because it is refreshing to see the mess of life feeling and seeming a bit too real for comfort. The film leaves us with little in the way of a point or thematic realization. There is no great narrative sitting in plain view. And yet it does offer us perspective. It does make us wonder about our own experiences that have shaped us. And as a father, it most certainly causes me to wonder about how my presence in the life of my own boy will affect and shape his own journey in positive/negative ways. Life is not about figuring things out I guess. Boyhood reminds us that it is about the nature of time itself, however fleeting it is. And thankfully the greatest gift that time can give us is the ability to question our experiences, to wonder about the meaning, and to (at least when we pause and pay attention and remember) enjoy and learn from the moments that catch us by surprise, even when they don't seem to fit with our view of how the larger narrative is supposed to work.",

Artfully filmed in short interludes over 12 years, Director Richard Linklater's 'real time' experience creates a unique fly-on-the-wall intimacy of character engagement.\n\nA breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane, MJ is your typical school yard scratched and scrapped six year old who must endure the endless irritation of his big sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), the decisions of his single-mother (Patricia Arquette) and the fortnightly visitations of his irresponsible father (Ethan Hawke). \n\nMj's formative years slowly unfold a life as altered by normal interventions; divorce, marriage, moving, love and loss. Insightfully implying a possible answer to the average parent's question; how will my actions affect my child?\n\nThe acting is sublime with boffins Arquette and Hawke anchoring the project perfectly while first-timers Coltrane and Linklater's evolution is curiously startling. \n\nDirection is minimalist occasionally to the point of dull, as the story meanders guided by the leads personally development. Jerky time lapses are portrayed with obvious pop-culture markers like Harry Potter, Facebook, top 10 Music references and political changes.  \n\nThe Verdict: A myriad of project positives awkwardly collide with the films inert heaviness and bloated 165 minute schedule leaving this critically praised piece feeling self-indulgent, petering off without a lasting sparkle and walking the fine line with a hobble. \n\nPublished : Canberra Weekly Magazine\nDate of Publication : 25/09/2015",

I've always liked Ethan Hawke, but he's visibly aged over 12 years, and it's quite surreal to see that in a film, and know that it's genuine. \n\nEllar Coltrane though, wow. He'd be pretty unique to've had his first film (at 6 years old) also be his most recent (at 18), but still with a few in between. He's absolutely brilliant, both as a child, and as an adult. An utterly unique performance, and how difficult to cast. \n\nLinklater wrote and directed the film, but let it create itself in only lightly scripting many scenes and letting the actors bring their own life experiences into the film, and only loosely holds the reins through the most effective scenes in the film. \n\nIts more dramatic moments (Arquette's abusive marriage stands out) is where it faltered at times, even if only because these moments felt the most controlled, and the least natural. \n\nAs much about growth as it is about youth, I don't know that I've ever seen a film like this, or ever will again.

Richard Linklater has really out done himself this time with this touching drama about the life of a young boy, growing from year to year. 12 years to be exact-which was how long it took to film the movie. From year to year, we see young Mason (Ellar Coltrane) grow up with a single mom, an older sister and in Texas. This movie reminded me so much of my life (growing up with a single mom and in Texas) my only difference was that I was the older sister to my younger brother. This is a realistic film about the relationships we have with our parents, the one's they have with us, those silly fights we have with our siblings that ultimately lead to unbreakable bonds, and to put is plainly, just getting through the years of being a \"kid.\" From the suburbs of Houston and the city lights of Austin, this is Linklater's homage to not only Texas, but Texas life. He captured how I have felt and for all intensive purposes, this movie could have been called \"Girlhood\"",

            "content": "\"Nostalgic Innovation\"\nBoyhood has been on my list of movies to watch for a long time, due to its love received last Oscar season by critics and fans alike. With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes I will admit, I was a little scared of putting that amount of time into a movie that seemed so simple and possibly boring. What really could of been a poor decision, even though it truly is a good movie, was starting this movie at around 11:30 at night...\n\nRichard Linklater's Boyhood watches Mason (and the actor who portrays him Ellar Coltrane) grow up. It really is that simple which shows how truly brilliant Linklater (Dazed and Confused, School of Rock) is as a film maker that I watched this film by myself so late and never got bored. Boyhood depicts many realistic circumstances that many boys go through while going through boy hood. Everything nostalgically glorious from playing Halo 2 on the original Xbox, riding around on your bike with friends, to not so fun things like peer pressure to drink and do drugs and dealing with divorced parents. Mason's biological parents are played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, which both do a tremendous job at being superbly believable. It never shows the two while they are married but the movie uses both the maternal and paternal scope to analysis the parental role in shaping their kids. Arquette is the single mom who has been beaten down by life but dearly loves her kids even as a disciplinarian. Hawke, as the father, is a nomadic father at first who lives up in Alaska and is painted in poor light at the beginning of the film. But throughout Boyhood, Hawke deals as a vital lense into the purpose of this movie: the meaning of life. In one conversation young Mason asks the younger (probably around 2004) Hawke What the point of life, and Hawke replies, \"What's the point? I mean, I sure as S*** don't know. Neither does anybody else, okay? We're all just winging it, you know? The good news is your feeling stuff, you got to hold on to that.\" Most of the meaningful take away quotes are similar to this, in asking what is the meaning of life or what should or am I doing with it?\n\nThe achievement of filming a movie over 12 years and it ending up so smooth and fluid is an innovation we have never seen before and the most impressive part of Boyhood. The transitions when Mason would get a little older and older were refreshing and breathed so much life into this movie. There were no big jumps, which makes it amazing Linklater got through 12 years in less than 3 hours. Another real strength, which I mentioned a little earlier, was the cinematic relationship Mason had with Hawke and Arquette's characters as his parents. It felt so real and never did anything in Boyhood feel forced. Arquette won the Oscar for best supporting female role, which I didn't fully understand why until the next morning when I woke up (which was late because I started the movie so late). She seemed a 100% capable of being one of my friends parents, and she made a severely interesting character, same with Hawke. These really are normal people that the actors make you root for them so bad because of the realism in their performances. The only thing I didn't really like (used like for a reason, liked but didn't love the film like most people) was Linklater's grimness of life that he over emphasized. Let me explain...not with the circumstances because I know stuff like that happens all the time, but with the characters. Mason and his sister Samantha aren't what I would call a normal boy or girl. I think Linklater did this to be able to put a more philosophical touch and narrative on the movie, so I completely understand, but I think he used kind of a cliched cast of kids that didn't go with the realistic older characters. Very minor critique because I completely understand why he did it and still was drawn and invested into mason and Samantha. Boyhood has language throughout, sexually suggestive scenes and drug use.\n\nBoyhood may of come up just a bit short of the modern masterpiece stapled to it by most critics, but Linklater made a nostalgic, innovative and realistic portrayal of boyhood, even if it over focused on the more grim aspects. Watching the movie so late was a gamble, but it surely paid off. \n\nCheck out all my reviews at: https://reviewsbycaleb.com/",

            "content": "Although I was lucky enough to see this film earlier at the Sydney Film Festival, it has taken me a while to take enough time out to write a proper review for this movie. Looking at the review aggregates it's obvious that this is definitely a film worth seeing. I have only see a few of Linklater's movies but each one has managed to become some of my favourite movies. (Sidenote Jim and Pam from The Office US choose Dazed and Confused, one of Linklater's first movies, as their top 5 in season 2 episode 4.) \nAfter watching this film it feels like finishing a superbly filmed home video of a friend you haven't seen in a while. You feel a connection with the characters as you watch them progress from year to year, suffering through the problems that we have all been through or can relate to. Everyone associated with the film has done an excellent job being dedicated to this project for 12 years. Ellar Coltrane, the main actor who we see grow up through the film, is interesting because he is very relatable, someone you could meet down the street. Patricia Arquette is also excellent as the mother who makes many terrible decisions but is able to persevere, and Ethan Hawke as the fun father, popping in randomly throughout the film. The film starts off stronger than it finishes but this may be due to Ellar Coltrane being very cute as a kid and then growing up to be just pretty good. It also feels like the film could've ended at a few points near the end but it decides to go on which isn't a totally bad thing but does make it feel a little long even though the end is great.\nBeyond showing you the family problems and encapsulating growing up in a film, an excellent feat in its own respect, Boyhood is like a time capsule. Especially for those who grew up in the last decade, this film will be a nostalgia trip that will revive memories from the very start when Yellow - Coldplay begins to play. Other highlights included Dragon Ball Z, Halo 2 on Xbox and many others. The film perfectly captures the growing influence of technology in our lifestyles, as you see it progress from brick phones to constantly checking Facebook for updates. \nThere is a lot to say about Boyhood but the most important thing is you should watch it as soon as you get the opportunity, it is an excellent film unlike anything else that has ever been attempted. It's beyond being just emotional or just a film that makes you think, it is PHAMTASTIC. I hope it goes on to the Oscars because it definitely deserves to.",

            "content": "Have you ever thought about the idea of shooting a film for over more than a decade? How could it be done? Who will want to fund this idea? What actor would be insane enough to sign on for it? Can a director be that perseverant and ambitious? Is there a story so big and ambitious to make this happen? All of those questions are resolved in one of the most daring, groundbreaking and ambitious films in cinematic history: Richard Linklater\u00b4s masterpiece \"Boyhood\". \nWe follow a broken family composed of a single mother named Olivia, her young boy named Mason Jr and her slightly older daughter named Samantha. We witness their struggles throughout the span of twelve years/Mason Jr\u00b4s childhood (2002-2014).\nPerhaps this will be the shortest review I have written so far but one of the longest texts I have posted on this site yet. \"Boyhood\" is a film that's filled with emotion, the characters are relatable, you will definitely project yourself into one of them and you will care about them from beginning to end; the acting and the dialog feels natural with the standouts being -obviously- Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, the music is appropriate and well used, Linklater\u00b4s directing is so personal that it makes you feel like you are a member of this family and the editing is so perfect as it tells the necessary/appropriate moments of this family and leaves some of them out for storytelling reasons and it works marvelously. The only issues this film suffers from are a couple: It has no replay value and it is stretched in the second half. \n\"Boyhood\" is a film that it is either hailed as a masterpiece or an \"overrated\" gimmicky art film, due to the fact that this narrative is nothing new and could have been shot as a regular film -over the span of a year- and only because of the fact that it took twelve years to make it is hailed. This film is not about story but the experience, the choice of shooting this over that long time is everything; you are able to see a study about people\u00b4s lifestyle in the new millennium and how people struggle with life and manage to endure throughout life\u00b4s toughest moments, sure it may not be something new and capturing life onscreen has been done before but the way Linklater did it is what makes this film. I want to say that despite the fact I am didn't grow up in the USA- thus making this film an educational experience as I learned about USA\u00b4s society and educational system- this film really got me because I\u00b4m the same age as Mason Jr and this film shows a little of my generation, it reflects some experiences I had lived through, and things I grew up with (Star Wars, Dragon Ball Z, Harry Potter, Game Boy, etc.) thus making this a nostalgic experience for me and making this film something a small amount of movies have accomplished for me: Become a personal journey. Regardless of your age, you will definitely experience some nostalgia for your childhood. \n\"Boyhood\" is colossally ambitious experiment in cinema that will stand the test of time and be remembered as a landmark in the art of cinema. It will provoke a different reaction/feeling on people and some will struggle with it due to the lack of plot but regardless, this is a must see film not only for lovers of the seventh art and the millennials, but for everyone.  The most ambitious and memorable film of 2014 and it ties with \"Whiplash\" for the spot of my second favorite film of said year.",

            "content": "After his parents divorce, a boy grows up in Texas.\nI really wanted to love this film; going into it, I was prepared to call it the best film of the year and maybe even the best film of the decade. After all, Richard Linklater accomplished a technical feat - making a major motion picture over twelve years - that has never been achieved in American cinema. And this kind of film is right up Linklater's alley, small-scale, human interest drama. \nHowever, the film never gets going. I kept wondering what the primary conflict was. Is it just growing up? Could that carry a three-hour film? Not really. And when Mason grows up to become an anti-establishment hipster, we see that Linklater returns to his familiar character types. In Linklater films, there are two characters: the sell-outs and the anti-establishment types, and when Mason starts spouting the normal Linklater speeches about the \"over-determinedness\" of modern life, I knew that the film was only an achievement of the technical variety, not a real expansion of his artistic palette. And while \"anachronistic\" is not the right word, there are numerous references to the flavor of the times in which the scenes were shot - Britney Spears songs and Harry Potter book signings - that work as the filmmakers winking at the audience and saying, \"Look at what was hot during this time.\"\nThe best performance in the film belongs to Patricia Arquette whose final moment is chillingly heart-breaking.\nOverall, if you know the backstory, Boyhood is a heck of a film, but if we just ignored that the film was shot over twelve years, it wouldn't be that much to write home about.",

            "content": "One thing that film hasn't really done yet is capturing the subtleties and often unseen beauty of life that constantly surrounds us. It's the little things that we often take for granted that mainly get left by the wayside when they are approached and are only realized for what they are long after its been put out of mind. Boyhood contains and reveals all those little things as well as some big things to show an intricate portrayal of life from a young kid's perspective. With intimate detail and truthful honesty, it's unlike any film before and possibly won't be another film like it. Boyhood isn't simply just about a kid growing up, but how all life is seamless and interconnected as one. You could call it the film about nothing, which would be a fair assumption but much like the classic sitcom Seinfeld that held that unique distinction, it contains everything.\nIt is 2002 and six year old Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) is looking up at the sky full of clouds in wonderment as Coldplay's Yellow plays. He is a precocious child who often daydreams with a unique perspective. His mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) is divorced and pretty unlucky when it comes to love. She raises Mason as well as her daughter Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), a hyperactive girl who often teases her brother Mason. Mason Evans Sr. (Ethan Hawke) is their father who pops up sometimes to take away the kids for the weekend and is somewhat of a slacker who imbibes in pot, plays in a band and drives a classic Pontiac GTO. Over the course of twelve years, Mason's life is formulated and his identity is revealed to the man that he will eventually be, from first grade all the way to the very first day of college.\nDirector and screenwriter Richard Linklater is well known for his great casts and puts together a great mixture of young unknowns and well respected screen veterans. Coltrane was amazing as Mason and was just as good as and mainly better than most child actors. His growth into an adult actor was downright believable and you can see a clear progression of his talents that looked really natural. Over the course of twelve years, he showed amazing empathy, fear, confusion, anger and compassion that didn't feel overdone. Every emotion shown felt just like it should have and there wasn't one that was left out. Coltrane went over the entire composite of feelings and then went back again. The journey on seeing him grow up was out of this world and you forget you are watching the same kid from a few years ago. It's easy to see a bit of yourself in him, not entirely but we all have been in the same social situations as him in some degree with much of the same reactions. \nAfter a while, you share his distorted view of the world, or at least I did. I often get involved in my thoughts of conspiracies and government control like him while also being a sort of cynic in many ways. He was a character I could easily relate too based on his taste in music like Paul McCartney and Bright Eyes and his favorite movies of 2008, The Dark Knight, Tropic Thunder and Pineapple Express. I already want to be his best friend on some of his favorite movies alone. Coltrane played him with likability and an easiness that made him easy to root for and get behind. Lorelei Linklater, who is the daughter of Richard, was more outspoken in her role as the somewhat bratty sister. She made for a great dynamic against the more soulful Coltrane and they showed great chemistry as sister and brother. Funny and often brash, she says what no one thinks to say. \nHawke was somewhat low key but that's just how his character is handled. He has a way about himself that is just so chilled and cool which made his role as weekend paternal dad all the more perfect. He isn't around all the time but is there when he is needed, giving out advice to his kids when they don't want to hear it like safe sex, bumpers on bowling lanes and the ultimate CD mix of The Beatles singles career post breakup titled The Black Album. This may be the coolest gift of all time and possibly the greatest collection of music ever put together. The wisdom he disposes is often very dad like, helpful and he never seems to be out of that role even if he isn't married to their mother anymore. \nArquette stole much of the movie as many of the dramatic elements contained her in the center. As a single mother raising two kids by herself who is struggling for work, she portrays a view of motherhood like no other film has, where tough decisions and hard choices have to be made for her and her family. It got to be rather alarming seeing her go through these issues but continuing to go on, mainly because she can't really stop for the sake of her children. She pines for order and discipline of some kind but reaches out too far when she lands some domineering, drunk assholes as husbands. Mason Sr. was too nonchalant about being a husband and father, causing her to seek out a stronger father figure but it caused more damage than it was worth. Arquette was strong, human, and infallible and like most mothers easy to disagree and find fault with the things she sometimes says. But in the end, you know deep down that she always had the best intentions and was right for the most part. She was equal parts loving and warm while being stern and forceful with a lot of things getting out of her control causing her to become more and more harried by everything around her.\nLinklater's films usually go by the beat of their own drum and don't really adhere to the norms of many 21st century films and styles. Even then it's shocking to know that he filmed a single movie over the course of 12 years, getting the cast back together every year for a few weeks. It's original in every way and still something that fits exactly with Linklater's style. I couldn't picture him doing this any other way afterwards but would easily see many other directors failing at such a revolutionary concept. He simply knows how to stretch a simple idea into something more, giving you something you never expected.\nThis isn't his first foray into creating something unique as A Scanner Darkly showed a visual delight for the mind and eyes. He burst upon the scene with his classic Slacker but His magnum opus will remain Dazed And Confused, but Boyhood may be his masterpiece. He is surely in the top running for best picture, director and screenplay when the Oscar nominations come out and I'd be surprised if he doesn't win all three come February. The style he uses is unlike any other director as he gets to know every main character intimately, getting to know their desires, dreams and fears. He paints a great image of who these people are, unique in their own way but just a regular person you see every day on the street. His direction was subtle and incredibly nuanced with seemingly minor details being a much bigger part of the whole picture. There were some moments with the step fathers where it got downright frightening and really pulled you out of the movie for a bit. It was hard to see where it was going to go and you hoped it wouldn't go down an ugly road.\nThere wasn't much character development from the children as there really didn't need to be since they are continually growing. The parents on the other hand go through a litany of changes that jump through time so you don't get that build up that you would see in other films. How they develop isn't as important as the kids and it makes the idea of life changings in an instant in their lives more palpable. Olivia struggles to gain a balance of normalcy by going back to school to be a professor to better provide for her children and as she does so, she attaches herself to men to provide her with emotional as well as monetary support. It doesn't always work out the way she hopes and she bounces from house to house, placing her kids in new schools and homes. Mason Sr. just wants to be a better father for his kids and give them a feeling of normalcy that they otherwise wouldn't have gotten anywhere else. \nHe starts off rather irresponsible but eventually becomes the father and husband that he always wanted to with his girlfriend and son. Bit by bit he morphs into a responsible adult, getting a job as an insurance salesman and losing his cool slacker dad status but only after long having children and being married. Olivia seems to be going downward while Mason Sr. is in a slight upswing, it's pretty sad seeing her struggle but getting no admiration for it and you wait to see everything get a little bit better for her. But you can't help but feel good that Mason Sr. is being the wife and dad that he was originally supposed to be and forming a sense of normalcy. The ending may be the most disheartening of the movie as it has Olivia trying to make sense of her life; really powerful and truthful scene with a great performance by Arquette.\nLinklater is also a masterful storyteller who excels in bringing out the angst of people of all ages, no matter who they are. He knows how to bring real life situations out in the forefront and portraying them in a way that is unbelievably realistic. Boyhood may be the most beautiful story that I have seen from a film all year. It's so encompassing and inclusive that it would be impossible for none of it to touch you emotionally. The simplicity it showed and the dedication it showed to portray it to the fullest makes it one of the most developed and comprehensive stories in a long while. From moving to a new house, new school, starting over, divorce, schmuck bosses, graduation, the opposite sex, creative expression, getting a terrible haircut and so on. It reaches for everything all at once and comes down with all of them in hand. \nI easily found more than one aspect of the story to be relatable to me which touched me more so than any other film has this year. I myself hate getting haircuts but had it nowhere near as bad as Mason who was forced by an authoritative jerk step dad. It's hard to find another film like  that where it transports your feelings and emotions from a particular event and have it play out in a similar manner more or less on screen. The ups and downs including all the middles in the film makes them even more awkward, funny, heartfelt and introspective watching them from one who has experienced them. He captures what makes up the human spirit and what it means to be alive, in the moment. Like many of his films, he praises individuality while still being a part of society and being mindful not to include overly political and religious stances. It lets them happen and come about naturally and doesn't make too big a deal about it when it is brought up. \nIt packs in as much drama, heart, humor, resonance, ethos, pathos and logos as humanly possible while covering everything that a young kid would go through from drugs, alcohol and staying out late but approached in a relaxed manner or intentionally left off screen so the mom would deal with it. Everything that is happening to these characters effects them and molds them to whom they eventually will be, not forgetting that a certain thing happened. There was much immense care taken to make sure that the lives that are shaped don't feel thrown together or without reason. Linklater wrote the script as he went along every year and made adjustments to the characters based on what happened to the actors they portrayed. With a film such as this, changes are simply inevitable and warranted. The story perfectly executed and built up to highlight the monumental moments of one's young life. With every year being full of superheroes, wild action, sappy rom-coms and goofy comedies, it's refreshing to see some normal people portrayed on screen and not have the story build up to something grand and epic. \nIt was fun going back in time and revisiting some of the biggest pop culture moments of the last decade. It was like a three hour time capsule of all that America has seen and experienced. It's similar to those stupid but addicting I Love The (insert decade here) anthologies from VH1. With every year being a new chapter in Mason's life, I found out what year it was by what event was going on. Whether it was the Obama election, midnight sale of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and seeing Roger Clemens pitch for the Huston Astros. The soundtrack was also excellent, taking in some of the best indie bands and some of my favorites of the last decade like The Flaming Lips, Arcade Fire and Yo La Tengo. Knowing that it's nearly three hours, it really didn't feel like it as soon as I got into it. I happened to pause it exactly near the middle at around eighty minutes or so, took a break and went right back into it. I honestly couldn't get enough of it and wouldn't mind if it went longer.\nFew films offer an experience while watching it, but that is exactly what Boyhood is. It is simply something that cannot easily be put to words and has to be seen to realize its extensive vision and grandiose scope. One should not judge it by a short viewing and must allow it to fully encapsulate you so you see it for what it truly is. There has to be ample time for it to sink in and you are allowed to process everything that you have seen. While there is a lot, once you see the big picture, you see how enthralling it is. Mason Sr. puts life in great perspective when he breaks down a track list for The Black Album, going from partying, faith, love and pain to appreciating what we have. He stresses the balance that is needed for greatness, saying that's what made The Beatles the greatest band in the world, and it's something that everyone should utilize to achieve whatever they wanted. Mason bookends with a perspective of his own on how it's not about seizing the moment but letting the moment seize you. It's not about collecting moments that are supposedly required by others to succeed but not being so obsessed by attaining these goals that you miss out on other possibly more important things like happiness. In a film full of theologies, it doesn't stress one over the other and allows the viewer to believe what the best course is. By seeing Mason's perspective shift and mold with time, he appears to achieve what he has always wanted in life and in turn what we all want to achieve. For a film that has no plot or theme, it's the most eye opening and revelatory that movies have been in ages. Five classic Pontiac GTO's out of five.",

You're not going to see a Modern Family-like camera setting, you're simply not. This is simply a story about a boy, or rather a story about one kid growing up. Now, this movie throws you some curveballs. Some might be led to believe this film is about parents splitting up - it's not. Some might be led to believe this film is about a violent stepfather - it's not really. Sure there are elements of the aforementioned plotpoints. With that having been said, this film is simply about life. It's about a single-mother, her disobedient daughter, sibling-rivalries, learning to allow your parents to move on from eachother.

What I object to is that a movie should resonate more:  It should be profound or poignant or entertaining.  'Boyhood' is too mundane.  I feel as though I just watched a two-and-three-quarter-hour home video, and to a degree I had some empathy for the characters, but I felt they could have tightened the proceedings in a more judicious way.  I admire how 'Boyhood' reflects real life, and its observations are spot on, but they needed to do more to keep me wanting to politely tell the intimate host of this home movie that I really needed to get back home.

What it does offer is one of the most naturalistic and humanist pieces of cinema to be seen in many years. Richard Linklater wants to present life in its purest cinematic form - abstract, slight, and coherent, it gives you this little boy and lets you watch his life as he grows up. It doesn't offer a viewpoint, a perspective, or toned up Hollywood powerhouse drama, and upon reflection, you will really come to respect that. Supporting performances from Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are staggeringly nuanced, with all interactions feeling genuine, no questions asked. It's the kind of film where less is more, by not offering a viewpoint, not rushing to heartbreaking dramas, being patient and filming over 12 years to simply portray a child growing up, Linklater proves himself as one of the most thoughtful and nourishing directors in the history of cinema.",

To me, Ellar Coltrane was a much better kid actor in the beginning than he was as a teenager/adult towards the end. There never seemed to be any smooth transition from who he was as a kid to who he became. The same for the mother, and especially the sister, who seemed to really get the short end of the stick on character development. The real standout, in my opinion, was Ethan Hawke. Watching his natural progression from wild and free dad who is still trying to be involved in the lives of his kids to a more settled down and almost world weary father was a nice transition. Other than that, I give credit to those involved for sticking with the unique filming plan, but I didn't find much special with the film.",

Its an interesting look into a family life that seems to be plagued by drunk dads.  Ethan Hawk does a good job in his role and his character does develop and become better throughout.  Yet, everybody else just felt like they were just there and I just did not care about them at all.  Personally I didn't like Mason that much to be honest and felt he got more boring the older he got.  Ethan Hawk was kind of cool but nobody else, even himself a little is interesting, this lies in a problem of a cast of characters I just did not care about.  The development is very little besides them just getting older.  Overall not a bad movie, just a boring one, even writing this a day after watching the film I struggle to describe what actually happened to these characters.  Its like watching somebody's life, but just throw some drunk dads in there to spice it up and besides that most peoples lives are boring, just like this flick.",

However, trying something new (documentaries like Hoop Dreams have done this before) doesn't make it good. A story usually helps, but Linklater would rather have his characters spew philosophical musings and never actually go anywhere.\n\nIn the end, the movie might be interesting on some level in watching to see how the children turn out.

I think what resonated most for me was when Patricia Arquette sends Mason to college and she says something along the lines of, is this all there is?? Is this all life is... a series of events and then you die? (not at all a direct quote). Her words were kind of haunting in their own way because it's kind of true...  and interestingly that's what I got out of the movie... this is life... just a series of events...

This movie  makes us relate it in a nice shape, without too much drama. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are so good and so natural in their characters and make us see, how it can deteriorate or improve the relationship between separated parents. Ellar Coltrane is extremely convincing from his childhood to adulthood.\n\nAt times the pace of the film becomes a bit overwhelming, but it's necessary because projected us the childhood and adolescence of a person.\n\nNot everything is rosy in Boyhood, my big problem was the end, I think the best way to end this film was in the part where Mason is driving along the road with the song \"Hero\" in the background, but unfortunately that's not the final scene.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a jewel of the seventh art, although only shines in the hands of those who can understand it.",

It's gritty at times, witty at others, and real 100% of its nearly three-hour run time. Patricia Arquette deserved her many accolades. \nIf Tatum O'Neal won, let alone nominated, for \"Paper Moon\", I think this movie's lead [Ellar Coltrane] should've been nominated for best lead actor. His performance is one of the more memorable in last year's shelves of well-developed character studies. 'Mason, Jr.' was 10x more of a memorable character than Cooper's \"Chris Kyle\" portrayal and Carrell's near-supporting role as real-life Jean Du Pont. \nMy only concern is this film's length, as I said before.

There's not much of an opportunity to see what is going on in Mason's mind. He's portrayed as a very blank character who is just coasting through life, he's met with various challenges that he never seems to face head on. He more or less shrugs it off.\nI feel that in the end the film could have focused on more of what Mason was going through, the film is called Boyhood afterall.",

I'd hoped this was just an anomaly, and that the director would resist further childishness and focus on the film.   But, shortly after, I was subjected to swooning praise of Barack Obama, with the family members engaging in their civic duty to post Obama political signs, while stealing McCain signs.   \n\nThere was lots of gushing for Obama in the \"sign scene,\" but the director wasn't satisfied staying positive: one of the children asked if he could place a sign in someone's yard, and the owner verbally abused the child, going as far as to say he could shoot the child if he wanted to.   Then, it was pointed out that the man had a confederate flag in his yard.  I can only infer that the director wishes us to believe that anyone who does not support Obama must be an angry, racist, potential murderer.\n\nI was struggling to look the other way up to this point, foolishly hoping that something could be salvaged from the movie, in spite of the petty propaganda. Then, the father used the pregnancy of Sarah Palin's daughter as a \"teachable moment\" for his daughter, stressing how important it is to avoid unwanted pregnancy.   \n\nAt that point I gave up.   An effort was made to get a refund, which sadly failed.    I see absolutely nothing wrong with a director destroying his art with the injection of propaganda like this, as long as I don't have to pay for it (I don't, of course, and should have done more research before purchasing this movie).",

            "content": "An achievement.  Taking a radically different approach to filmmaking, this focuses on a young boy, Mason (Ellar Coltrane), and shows how he grows up and matures through the years, from elementary school to college.  The thing that is the most impressionable about this is the unconventional craft to it; Richard Linklater has been making great movies for decades, but with Boyhood, he has made what is easily his most ambitious film to date.  Short of the Harry Potter series (to which the film even gives a nod to), I don't think anybody has ever attempted anything like this before, and even then, all eight Harry Potter movies took less cumulative time to make than the twelve years that Boyhood took.  There were no guarantees that this giant gamble was going to work out in the end.  For example, this is an intimate family drama, it's not like you can just replace an actor should they become incapacitated or worse.  Obviously, it was a bet that paid off in spades, and Boyhood is something special.  The thing that is the most remarkable about Boyhood is the scope of it all; you have to have vision in order to make everything come together on a project this expansive, and what's even more impressive is that everything about this rings personal and authentic.  While you may not know these people per se, you have people in your life that fit into these molds, which makes it very easy to relate to.  Not only do you get to see everybody here grow up, you also get to see how much has changed since 2002, like how big the cell phone boom was, as well as staples from the past, like a Nintendo DS before it was a 3DS.  This could have just as easily been called Parenthood, and this is one of the most genuine looks at divorced life.  It's always shown through the eyes of a child, and it is intriguing to watch how adults justify all of the little things to kids.  It's also really cool how you see perspectives change, like how parents are viewed almost solely as authority figures at a young age, but then, as children grow up and become real people, they look at and talk to their parents more maturely, like friends; Mason becomes increasingly more upfront with them as he grows older, and you are always interested in what comes next.  You also get to see these children grow as actors in one film, which is something you seldom ever get to witness.  What I think Boyhood is being sold short on is how good the script is; you wouldn't care as much if it was an uninteresting story, but you really get to know this entire family and grow with them.  My only minor criticism is that you do feel the length to this movie, but it is a small nitpick when you consider just how much time this is covering, and it still moves fast.  This is a really nifty experiment that you're not likely to see repeated ever again.",

I will admit it I enjoyed watching the actors naturally age and grow throughout the film, but it almost felt as though the cast lost interest in the film as it progressed. The movie failed to keep me engrossed as it carried for what seemed like 4 hours.  The only time I felt engaged in the movie was during the time with the abusive, drunk husband. This was the one time in the movie where I felt things got interesting and the acting seemed genuine.  I'm not sure why they didn't expand upon this.  Instead, the mom and her kids leave, and there it ends.  I wanted to know what happened to the other two kids, were they just left in the abusive situation?  The couple lines of dialogue about this between the mom and the girl with the annoying hair in her eyes was not enough to end this period in the boy's life.  Overall, the acting was subpar, except for Ethan Hawke who was consistent, and believable.  I don't think this was the worst movie I've ever seen, but I hesitate to call it \"good\".  Instead, I would rate the film as disappointing.  Maybe it's just me, but slapping together a couple days worth of filming over a 12 year period doesn't automatically make an innovative concept a great movie.",

Life might be interesting in movies to make us watch them, but to see 12 years of a real person's life on screen it's not going to be very interesting. We go to school or work, we eat dinner, come home, go to bed. We get married, divorced, we fall in love, break up. When you see these 12 years being crammed into a 2 1/2 hour movie it's not so interesting. It doesn't excite you. There's nothing that actually hooks you to the screen and makes you want to continue watching it. \nThis movie is epic in one way, and one way only, it actually took 12 years to film it. This could have been a coming-of-age story about a boy who you see growing up in 12 years time where there's 12 different actors playing the same boy, but then this movie wouldn't have been as epic would it?\nThis movie took 12 years to film just because the director wanted to use the same actor for all of the characters as they age these 12 years. Even some actors who are only in about four scenes, you still see them age throughout the movie. Despite the movie not being that gripping or exciting I find this absolutely remarkable and therefore it will always be a masterpiece.",

I have to be honest - I fast forwarded through a lot of parts but still didn't miss anything.   Some of my reflections on this movie are really not about the movie per se, but instead how important it is for kids to have sounding boards in pairs of parents, friends, other family, mentors, etc.  I cried at the end when Patricia Arquette's character (the mom) said she dreaded that day when her son left for college because it put a spotlight on her life and made her question what her life has been about.  Sad really, because if a person has a true identify with life in a spiritual (not religious) way then it's not a let down when you learn we are vunerable and sort of not to important in the scheme of life.

            "content": "\"You don't like me much, do you Mason?\nThat's okay, neither do I.\"\n\nAs a concept movie, \"Boyhood\" definitely can be called a successful experiment. It took Richard Linklater no less than 12 years to realize this film. It's a registration of the daily life of an average American family with characters interpreted by the same actors or actresses in different life cycles. Is this an unique concept ? Unfortunately not. In 2001, the Harry Potter saga started with the main characters growing up while the story progressed. So that gimmick is already used. \n\nI'm also the proud owner of a whole collection of home videos I made for years with my Sony Handycam. Would the result be similar to \"Boyhood\" if I'd edit these nostalgic film clips into a motion picture ? No of course not, because my creation wouldn't be right. The synchronization between the different periods would be wrong. The themes wouldn't be in harmony. The continuity wouldn't be guaranteed, especially regarding the overall atmosphere. In terms of content, there might be similarities, but ultimately it simply will become a banal family documentary, dominated by triviality and platitude. What I'm trying to say is that probably there will be some who'll portray \"Boyhood\" as an extra-long home video, while for me it's not so evident to come to this result. Ingenious and phenomenal at the same time.\n\nDon't expect truly earth shaking events or developments. You only witness the calmly on-going life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane). A life like most of us have experienced it. A life full of ups and downs, with its euphoric moments and sad moments. A life that forms you as a human being into the personality you'll finally be when reaching adulthood. Also Mason goes through all these stages : first a carefree teenager, school troubles, domestic problems, puberty, an exceptional father who occasionally crosses (during major and minor moments) his life, teenage love, his heart being broken and than the final step to adulthood. 12 Years interwoven with no visible indication in what time span it's happening at that time and this summarized in 165 minutes. Together with his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), daughter of Richard Linklater and a teenager with an attitude, and his mother (Patricia Arquette), who won a gold medal in the Olympic discipline \"choosing the wrong guys\", a touching coming-of-age story unfolds itself. Afterwards you realize how volatile time is and how our life goes on with an irreversible pace.\n\nEllar Coltrane plays literally and figuratively the role of his life. The beginning was a little bit sluggish and lethargic. It seemed to leave him indifferent which made him act quite apathetic. But as he grows older, I appreciated his deep philosophical musings more and more. His argumentation while driving on the highway about humanity functioning in modern society as self-healing and reproducing robots, because the manufacturing of cyborgs would be too costly, I found funny but at the same time I realized that it was uncannily accurate and that there's actually a little truth in what he claims. Again something I could identify myself with. Lorelei Linklater grows into a rebellious and wayward teenager. Arquette's roundings expand as the years pass. The only one whose looks remain timeless, is that of Ethan Hawke. Although it feels as if he plays an ancillary character who pops up occasionally into the life of Mason, I found this the most beautiful role in \"Boyhood\" and for me the one who exerts the most influence on the development of the person Mason. A brilliant interpretation: serene, vulnerable and supportive. And maybe it's my imagination, but I thought Mason resembled more and more Hawke as he grows older. What a coincidence.\n\nThe final conclusion is that it's a brilliant concept with delightful characters who grow and unfold themselves as time progresses. So what's wrong with it than ? Absolutely nothing, except in the end it's just a dull affair. You can't say there are many startling things happening. Despite the chaotic periods Mason's mother is going through , you can't detect any real traumatic experiences. Every average family's life looks like this. And yet this film is praised to the skies. And that's because everyone sees something in it they can relate to and finally think something like \"Hey, I also experienced it like that\" or \"Damn that happened to me also in that period\". And that's the strength of \"Boyhood\". A mirror is held up in front of you and you'll come to one conclusion : Life is a concatenation of moments you need to enjoy fully, because there comes a time you'll realize that those moments have passed. And that's perfectly summarized by Mason's final sentence: \"It's the constant moments, it's just ... it's like always right now\". \n\nMore reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

            "content": "This film started very good, but for some reason I started disliking Mason after the bullying scene. But even though I disliked him for some reason Mason reminds me so much of myself mostly because he grew up in the same time period and because he grew up in a house with his sister and a single mom like I did. The differences between us are that he actually likes his dad and I've never smoked weed and I have never been a big fan of my dad and will probably NEVER get along with him. And the other difference is that his mom was someone who thought she needed to have a man in her life and she made some pretty bad choices when it came to that. This movie makes me grateful that my mom didn't make such bad dating decisions. One thing I actually loved about this movie was that the director put in some things that I found very nostalgic and seriously tear jerking even though they weren't meant to be. The fact that he had Mason watching Dragon Ball Z and that he was a huge fan of it was something I found awesome. Because I felt that on some level I was actually connecting with Mason over pop-culture back in the 90's and 2000's. And his hatred for the Brittney Spears song that his sister sings is something I could relate to a lot as well. Because my sister loves to sing and she has sang some pretty annoying songs over the years. The Directors attention to pop culture back in the early days when the internet was not as big as it is now was accurate and well just the fact that I felt nostalgia watching the movie is something I enjoyed very much about the movie. However as soon as we start to get into his later years of life I started to dislike Mason and was wanting to send that disrespectful little turd to military school. The most admirable thing about the movie though is the fact that Richard Linklater spent a HUGE chunk of his life and his actors lives making this movie. And it really is something to watch the characters grow older over the years to learn and to experience new things. And the director could have just hired new actors to play the older roles, but he chose to go the way that he did and he did is so well. I admire him for being able to do something like this. And on one final note. While I wasn't a fan of most of the characters and how they treated each other what I did like was how they perfectly ended the movie. When his mom tells about her life and all she has to look forward to. And then Mason's soon to be girlfriend we see that time is both an illusion and something that is always present in our lives. We change, we grow and we learn more as time goes on. I feel as though that has been my journey for most of my life. Learning and growing in my walk of life. Great movie but really unlikable characters.",

Most have been called \"excellent\" and \"visionary.\" Some even called \"masterpieces.\" Most have had a dramatic impact on cinema, the way we approach films and our need for escapism and a desire to question the intriguing. And, all of these films, I have rated poorly (or at least average). Yet, none of this compared to the experience of watching Boyhood.  The Academy Award nominations and wins, golden globes, critics choice awards, BAFTAs, critics guild awards, sundance and according to rotten tomatoes, 256 fresh critic reviews with an average score of 9.3. Called \"the best film of the decade\" and \"a sprawling investigation of the human condition.\" Internationally, the film appeared on more than 500 critics best year list, with almost 150 ranking Boyhood number one. On metacritic, the film has a rating of 100. The highest rating for an initial release on the site, at least since 1999. \n\nThe project itself was ambitious,  filming these actors over a 12 year period. The technical scope is also rather impressive and the originality of the script seemed to scream everything that draws me to a film. And yet, Boyhood was a major disappointment.  I can appreciate and admire so much about the film's aims and significance to the genre, but I am one of the few people on Earth that will argue this film is not flawless.  And, in my opinion- I really must emphasise that, its far from being a masterpiece.\n\nFirst and foremost,  the visual style which was disengaging from the start. I know some may say I am nitpicking but, throughout the film's 12 year scope, the style and the tone and the aesthetics remained as mundane and simplistic as possible. And I'm sorry,  but that isn't the reason why I see films. Perhaps that's the point, but it didn't work for me.\n\nNext then, the acting. People have praised and praised and praised the acting, saying its real and authentic. So, why did I think Patricia Arquette's performance was dull and depressing, not deserving of, well, any award? Just because she was in a good film, doesn't mean she was good herself. Next, and this is a really biggy, Mason. He was a terrible actor, being all depressed and once again emotionless.  His sister Samantha was just as irritating and there were many times where I felt no sympathy for any of the three main characters. However, Ethan Hawke was very good and he is always worth a look in any film, although I'd criminally argue that his Predestination is better.\n\nOne of the major issues was, along with the aesthetics, the cinematography and editing. It just seemed so clich\u00e9d and there was nothing overly impressive about it. Its not bad by any means,  but it seems to me that it should be exquisite in a masterpiece.  The editing was sloppy and at times unforgivable when considering how much effort was actully exhausted in shooting the film. Once again, I think that it could and should have evolved over 12 years.\n\nThe biggest flaw of this film is the script. I know for many, this is an exceptionally deep film but I failed to grasp any sort of thrill or excitement or anger or fear or any sort of emotion whilst watching this. And sadly, the best and most eventful parts of this film were at the start. By the time the film concluded at a staggering 2hrs and 45 minutes, I had felt as if the film had dragged for over an hour, offering no tense moments or cleverly written twists . Richard Linklater is a very good and quite ambitious director. But I felt cheated by this, and I expected better, from an Academy Award nominated and critically lauded film.\n\nBut the tone was all wrong. At times, the scenes were so dramatic and involving with its cast, almost leaning to melodrama.  Yet in others, I felt as static and stilted as if I was meant to enjoy watching people talk about star wars. It seemed as if Linklater failed to succumb to one form or the other. As if he was picking an icecream topping, and just put both skittles and mint on top. A film which should have left me in sheer astonishment,  left me wondering how I could ever reclaim almost 3 hours lost.\n\nI guess I also had no interest rewatching someone else's entire childhood because I didnt care. Watching a child grow in such a depressing and unchanging way is not my idea of entertainment. I cared not, about the characters or the story they were telling or any part of this mess. And thats the real issue here. All I was waiting for was some dramatic plot twist, something that would drastically affect Masons entire life. By the time 2 hours had rolled over, I conceded I would never get that. This film has truly made me question whether I am out of touch with films. But I will stand my ground, because I can say with great confidence,  I will never want to watch this again\n\nBoyhood is an exceptionally crafted, wonderfully ambitious and frankly dull affair.",

Watching the characters grow and change physically is an amazing experience, which unfortunately doesn't go anywhere that justifies the whole effort in the first place.  Mason Jr. goes from a charismatic, earnest youngster to a slouching, self-absorbed near-adult.  There are lessons we expect him to learn, apologies and admissions we expect him to make, which he never bothers with. He's too caught up in himself.  By the time he reaches fourteen or so the actor (Ellar Coltrane) seems to have lost interest in the project anyway.\n\nWhat's really troubling about this movie is this: Why make a movies about boyhood that boys can't watch (not without fast-forwarding through the rough parts).  It reminds me of \"Where the Wild Things Are\" which took a kid's book and turned it in to an adult psychodrama.  \n\nMason Jr. is really just an observer of the world around him. He doesn't grow or mature morally. He just gets beaten down and world weary and more self-absorbed. He never hugs or kisses his mom or dad or thanks them for raising him, he just in the end runs away to college and joins another band of slackers who probably think the world isn't good enough for them either.  \n\nWhat's the lesson here for boys?  I watched it with my two sons (13 and 11).  I had hoped it would be a springboard for discussion, and it was a little.  But Linklater was so interested in confirming his slacker, stoner. artsey mentality that he forgets to take responsibility for the message he was sending to kids.

The story follows a boy's life with his mom and sometimes with his divorced dad as they just go around the place looking for a new person to cal daddy. The story has no true conflict and what makes it worse is the fact that they tried to add the conflict with all the abusive dads, bills falling over their heads, and just general family troubles that I could care less about. I also don't understand the internal conflict going inside of mason. Many of things he says as a teen just fly over my head because they don't make the least bit of sense. Also the natural aging just doesn't make a difference to me. I bet they would look exactly the same if they used some software, make-up, or different actors to show off the age. Also the end was one of the worst in movie history for me. He enters college, goes out hiking with some strangers and just sits and says some line, and then it ends. I mean I know it called Boy-Hood, but they couldn't have found a better spot than just his family STILL in the middle of poverty and just entering the next big step of his life that would have been way more interesting than his boy-hood. I would not recommend this, because of the unfocused and uninteresting plot, and the fact the aging makes no difference. I know others see the aging as a huge difference, but I don't.",

Rather than sticking to a standard coming-of-age plot, the movie is more about the rhythms of life itself: trying to get by, making mistakes and moving on. There's strong language that comes in bursts, including \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" One sequence involves an abusive, alcoholic second husband. No onscreen violence is shown, but it's definitely suggested, and there's a sense of threat. Sex talk comes up from time to time, and the main character is seen briefly kissing his girlfriend. Teen characters also experiment with drugs and alcohol. Despite the mature content, this is a special movie that, if teens and parents watch together, could spark many fascinating discussions about life.",

All of Mason's Mom's men become alcoholics.  Yep, but why?  Mason is faced with some life troubles due to a single mother/ repeated step dad families, but no where is there any challenges and decision made that develops Mason as a person.  Mason just seems to change with time and life happening around him.  No one seems to be really engaged except for Mom ... but then again the move is not about her else it would be titled Motherhood?  What passes as a  \"story\" is the slow burning of time; so 12 years is distilled down to 3 hours of this is what I remember happening.  Why should I care?  What  was discussed?  What is revealed?",

            "content": "It depicts a child's growth and changes in his family like an epic. It's a fulfilling movie as Richard Linklator said: \"I've long wanted to tell the story of a parent-child relationship that follows a boy from the first through the 12th grade and ends with him going off to college. But the dilemma is that kids change so much that it is impossible to cover that much ground. And I am totally ready to adapt the story to whatever he is going through.\"\nIn `Before` series, Richard Linklator made three movies by shooting the same cast every 9 years and 18 years in total. In 'Boyhood', Richard Linklater and his crew got together annually to film Linklater's script about a boy who will eventually grow up into a college freshman. Linklater's method behind production was essentially to make several 10- to 15-minute short films over the course of 12 years, each depicting a year in the life of the boy, and then edit them together as a feature film.\nNone of the actors were contractually obligated to return to the film each year due to the De Havilland Law under California Labor Code, which makes it illegal to contract employees for more than seven years of work. Had Richard Linklater died during the 12-year shoot, Ethan Hawke would have taken over the directorial duties. Richard Linklater asked her not to have any plastic surgeries, since it wouldn't make sense for her character. All of these episodes are because of the 12 year shooting period.\nRichard Linklater casted his daughter Lorelei Linklater because she was always singing and dancing around the house and wanted to be in his movies. At about the third or fourth year of filming, she lost interest and asked for her character to be killed off. Linklater refused, saying it was too violent for what he was planning. Lorelei eventually regained her enthusiasm and continued with the project.\nLinklater thought Patricia Arquette was the only actress he ever thought of for the part of Olivia as she had been a mom in a very young age while there are big changes in actors circumstances: both of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette experienced divorce and remarriage and got new babies.  \nAccording to Richard Linklater, Everybody Wants Some (2016) is a continuation of Boyhood in terms of beginning right where it ends with a guy showing up in the ending. I am looking forward to it.",

            "content": "It's true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without.\n\nThis is more than a coming of age story; the title \"Family\" or \"Motherhood\" would be just as appropriate. Set in Texas, the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of Linklater's other work: a film that begins with dialog unlike any other Linklater films evolves into thoughtful, poignant discourse not unlike that from the \"Before\" series. One character in a late-night nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady \"Waking Life.\" With that said, this absolutely is not a mere think piece. What makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is, given its scope. Without giving any narrative away, I'll say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises. I watched many films at Sundance 2014 (including comedies), and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout: we laughed, gasped, covered our eyes, and I am sure more than a few of us wept.\n\nThe characters are well developed. Don't be fooled by the title --- the spirit of Boyhood is alive here, but the female characters are thoroughly developed, distinct, and alive. Unfortunately, though it's 2014, this is a rarity in cinema.\n\nLike in \"Waking Life\" and \"A Scanner Darkly\", Linklater has again delivered true visual innovation. This time, however, his set-up is simple: shooting on film, Linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse. Has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? Linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly. Despite this, the effect is riveting.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that after I watched this film I sold all of my other tickets to Sundance films. Viewing Boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that I didn't want to tarnish the experience by any comparison. Everyone in the Eccles theater shared a special few hours together. Though this only premiered a few days ago, I am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our time.",

It would have been better though if they filmed something with an actual plot over the same time. You just follow this kid through a fairly ordinary life for for some time then the movie ends. Yeah, the kids life has some turmoil - particularly in having divorced parents and a mother who has horrible taste in men - but nothing ever really happens. She divorces the terrible husbands, they move a few times, and the kid goes on to meander through life without any focus. We don't know what happens to him because there is no conclusion. Maybe for the sequel we can watch him finish college, get a run of the mill job, get married, and  have kids of his own just like the rest of us. Earth Shattering.",

Linklater did a splendid job in telling a heart-warming tale about the 12 years of boy's life from his early childhood right up to him preparing himself for graduation and subsequently college - and following the first hour there's one hour and forty-five minutes left, which covers some potential clich\u00e9s; there's little emotion to be found on the screenplay or from it's actors, and stolid performances can be favourable nonetheless, but that's not how, I believe, Linklater hoped to get his message across. \nAs truly great and outstanding this story appears to be in its first Act, I think the second and third Acts were a tough job, which were hard to reach a conclusion unlike most similar dramas, but fair play to director and writer Richard Linklater, who dedicated a lot to this movie.",

We see his life from age 5 to 18 pass by in little under three hours.\n\nFirst off, this movie could have been called 'Girlhood' or 'Parenthood' as well. While the focus is mostly on Mason, we see enough of his sister Samantha (director's daughter Lorelei Linklater) and his mom (Patricia Arquette) and dad (Ethan Hawke) during his years of growing up.\n\nBoyhood is the second movie I've seen that is nominated for Best Picture at the 87th Academy Awards that relies heavily on a production trick. The first was the style-over-substance heavy Birdman. The trick here in this movie is that the same cast was filmed over 12 years to create a magnum opus about, well, boyhood.\n\nThankfully there is more substance here than in the other movie whose title I won't mention again. While the narrative and characters as a whole could have been more elaborate, this movie was watchable despite the length and it never got on my nerves. \n\nThat's quite an accomplishment in itself, but here it is significant because it's to the merit of the complete production value from actors to story to the excellent (if not inherent) portrayal of pop culture throughout the movie. It also has a diverse and well thought out soundtrack to top it all off. If  I had to characterize this movie in one word, I'd say 'touching'. \n\nAll in all, this movie is a good one. Not great, but enjoyable nonetheless. The 12 year production shows consistency and attention to detail, which is lacking more and more these days, even in smaller projects.\n\nPros: charming, adequate acting, production quality\nCons: long running time, somewhat underdeveloped/charicaturized supporting characters\n\nVerdict: good for a rainy sunday afternoon",

Much like one of the film's morals, you won't remember everything about the movie, but you will remember the milestones.\n\nThe performances are hit or miss, depending on the current age of the actors and who is on screen. \n\nThe unique part of Boyhood is how the same actors play themselves over the 12 Years of filming. This is really awesome to watch, and it works perfectly. You bond with the characters because you have seen them grow.\n\nThe story is told from Mason's point of view. Because of this, all of the adults come off as jerks with no parenting skills. This became incredibly annoying to me. 90% of the adults appear to be stupid, a couple of which I would have called CPS about. Some may connect with Mason over the horrible adults in his life, but I did not. I was raised by some of the best parents I have ever seen, and such, did not identify with Mason during some of the more pivotal scenes. Without identifying with Mason during these parts of his story, I found myself bored and uninterested. \n\nBoyhood prefers to show an event and let the viewer form their own options about it. These events involve things such as drugs, girls, and divorce. I was unable to identify with many of these events, which left me without much meaning for these scenes. This is in stark contrast to a few other scenes which I heavily identified with and had a lot of unconscious and conscious meaning to attach to Mason's life. \n\nI think I would have enjoyed the movie much more had I had a childhood similar to Mason's. As such, I would recommend Boyhood to those who had difficult childhoods with lots of bad adults, divorce, and emo phases.",

Instead of over dramatizing certain moments, viewers get to experience them through the lens of Mason, whose boyhood is the one we witness. \n\nWhile tropes ate addressed, such as sex, drugs and alcohol, the film doesn't give them undo attention. It doesn't glorify any certain choices in life, preferring to present them as simply real things that happen. \n\nThe acting isn't perfect from the children, but it's not distractingly poor either. Ethan Hawke as the father is perfect. He embodies the transformation that goes on, not just in Boyhood but adulthood as well. \n\nSome of the best scenes occur between Mason and his father, and there's clearly a great deal of chemistry between the two, not to mention a strong resemblance. It is truly special to watch the same actors grow over the 12 year filming run, an excellent effect and directing choice by Richard Linklater. \n\nRather than distracting from the film, the use of licensed music and products throughout plays to the authenticity of the picture as a whole. \n\nBoyhood is special. It's not perfect, but it is not a film to be missed. Go for the nostalgia if you must, but realize there's a real story with real heart just beneath the surface.",

A fantastic commitment from everyone involved, which really payed off, and made the film and characters seem ever so genuine. It described childhood so perfectly that I could feel the tightening in my throat. I highly recommend going to the cinema to watch this.",

Now I get that they casted them as little kids so they had to keep them and have them finish it out but it does take a toll on the movie. However there are some characters in the movie that are played by some REALLLLLYYYY BAD ACTORS. One scene imparticular is extremely bad when mason and his friends are with some high school seniors drinking and breaking things in an abandoned house. The acting in this scene is so bad I cringed. There are only a few moments like this and the rest of the performances range from decent- great. The second problem is the screenplay. Some of the lines in this movie seem obviously scripted as well as some really cheesy moments. This may be due to some bad actors but it takes away from the realism of the movie. All this being said this movie is still quite captivating with a few great performances from the mother and father and a variety of other characters and the gimmic of this movie over the course of 12 years is very innovative, ambitious and clever.

We see the actor (Ellar Coltrane) literally and figuratively grow up, and it\u0092s fascinating. In a way, we also see Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette grow and change not only as their characters, but as people. Like I said, it\u0092s interesting to watch and kudos to Richard Linklater and his team for making it happen. That being said, I think if you take the gimmick of the concept away, if this was just a normal movie and they filmed it all in a year or two, I don\u0092t think it would be receiving as many accolades. It meanders a bit, especially in the late grade school/middle school stage. Plus, they gave Patricia Arquette basically the same storyline three times. She just had a different haircut each time. Then, at the end, she has this great monologue about milestones in life and it really pulled everything together and put the whole movie in a certain perspective. But then it randomly cuts away and we never see Patricia Arquette again and he goes to college and falls for a girl he meets in his first 30 seconds on campus. So, I guess I was looking for a more poignant ending perhaps? Nevertheless, this is still worth a watch for it\u0092s concept.",

For the first two hours we really get a sense and remembrance of what it was like to grow up as a kid. All the memories and things come back to you while you watch this film but yet I did connect with Mason I felt once he got to the teen years he just became a complete tool. Once this happened the film practically lost me for the final hour and I wanted nothing to do with Mason anymore. Boyhood presented a great idea but most of the time it felt like they put on a camera and said \"okay do stuff\". I do think Boyhood was a great film but it doesn't deserve all the massive hype it has received and may have only gotten it because it's different. It would be cool to see in the future another film like this but with a girl as the main character, maybe even call it Girlhood. Boyhood is worth seeing and will get you sucked in at points but I can only promise it's likely only in the first half. I went from liking this character all the way to hating him. Boyhood could've been cut a lot in time and ended at a certain point when it just went on for another 10-15 minutes. Does it deserve best picture? No but it is worth watching and experiencing what 12 years in the making has done.",

He really didn't seem to have much personality. I found him to be one of the least interesting characters of the piece.\n- A kid growing up in the 2000's and he never mentioned Pokemon or played w/ a gameboy? That is the most unrealistic thing of all. :-)\n- Patricia Arquette's character had a really, really bad taste in men. It looks like Ethan Hawke was the best choice of all of them.\n- I did like how they transitioned between the years. No real transition - just sort of an ordinary scene change.

The growth of Mason before your eyes and his transformation into a somewhat subdued, but intense and philosophical young man is one that happens in an earnest light. The way he experiments with different friendships, jobs, girlfriends, and family structures shapes him and we can see how that affects his life down the road. Although the happenings in the movie are often mundane, or at least typical teenage activities, the movies remains interesting and subtly suspenseful during its nearly 3 hour play time.

However, at almost 3 hours with very little in the way of excitement, I do think the film has been way over praised. \nEarly on, Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his family read Harry Potter and go to a midnight book launch for the Half Blood Prince. In many ways, watching Daniel Radcliffe and co grow up on screen is the closest analogy to this film.  Of course, you could also just look around you at friends and family too!\nIt isn't just young Mason who grows up. Patricia Arquette has been deservedly Oscar nominated, and indeed, the changes she goes through are in many ways more interesting than the well worn teenage boy cliches Linklater struggles to avoid. Ethan Hawkes' Mason Sr. develops less as a character - and Hawkes seems to age least of the cast! While Linklater's daughter Lorelei is slightly erratic as Mason's sister - sometimes great, sometimes less convincing as an actor.\nThere are some genuinely touching moments and definitely a feeling of peeping into a real family, complete with the more mundane times. \nThe film is a one off, a novelty project but a real labour of love by all concerned. As a viewer however, it drags a bit and lacks a proper narrative. This is a movie to be admired but it didn't bowl me over the way it has so many critics.",

The characters are relatable, and the acting is spot-on, particularly from Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the parents of Mason, the center and anchor of the narrative. While it is a spectacle to see these actors and characters develop both physically and characteristically, the film just didn't feel particularly satisfying. This was likely because of a combination of the slightly overlong running time (2 hours and 45 minutes) and the low amount of entertainment value. Given the Oscar buzz and critical acclaim surrounding Boyhood, I found it relatively underwhelming.

It will win the Best Picture Oscar this year, not because it's the best film of the year, but from an artistic point of view, it stretched the boundaries of conventional filmmaking which writer/director/co-producer Richard Linklater deserves full credit for.\nFilmed over a period of 12 years, the story is a simple coming-of-age tale of a boy's life from the ages of 5 through to 18, covering the usual issues a child encounters during that time in their life. Raised by a single mother, regular excursions with the estranged father, coping with an older sister, school, birthdays, bullying, puberty, an abusive stepfather, etc.\nWith each year of the boy's life covered in average of 14-15 minutes, the film is essentially a series of short films and home video style moments which bring an air of realism whilst the performances and dialogue are incredibly realistic. It also has to be said that it's a piece of movie magic to see all the characters physically age throughout the running time without the assistance of fancy makeup or prosthetics, not only of the young stars but also for the on-screen parents Ethan Hawke & Patricia Arquette.\nThere are a few minor gripes with the film, but not enough to make it unenjoyable. The main one is that it doesn't really deal with any issues that it brings up, it only skirts over the periphery of them. Another is that it doesn't really possess any nostalgic value. It's all set over the years post-2001, so if your childhood was prior, you won't generally share the same views or experiences as the main character & will sympathise more with the parents characters especially for viewers who are indeed parents, unfortunately, Arquette & Hawke aren't in the film as much as you'd like them to be. It's not their film though, it's Ellar Coltrane who you watch growing up before your very eyes, hammering home how quickly children grow up and how, indeed, time and moments can pass in the blink of an eye.\nRichard Linklater used a similar style of filmmaking with Before Sunrise, Before Sunset & Before Midnight, a trilogy of films about the development of a relationship over three decades.\nStill, Boyhood is an admirable filmmaking experience which provided an arduous, lengthy task for its cast and crew and fully deserves all the praise it's been receiving.",

But had that not been the case, would it still earn such high praise from many critics?  Some of the characters are okay, but some are mere throwaways.  Arquette and Hawke re good, but their screen time is limited.   Ellan Coltrane was excellent and of course the real star.  Lorelai Linklater was good as his sister; although I only just learned that she is the director's daughter.  I did not care for her character, however.  As a mother, I thought Arquette's character was too weak, mostly; and Hawke's distant father seemed on-target.  But, as a non-traditional film, Boyhood lacked a true start or finish, and there was no climax to build up to.  Which was disappointing.",

I feel the first half is more interesting than the second.  The first half really feels like snippets of an evolution of a child from young boy to teenager, but then the movie tries to be \"about something\" in the second half but it never really amounts to much.  The lead character becomes more and more introspective as the film wears on but nothing really happens in his life to warrant such scrutiny.  Technically impressive, but I think the film needed a tighter narrative.  It just ambles towards the end.  Paul Thomas Anderson would have done wonders with this concept.",

It would have been incredible to film things over the span of 12 years and still make a two hour movie. What I liked the most was the fact the script wasn't showing the most important pieces of his life, but rather moments of the years. You didn't see the strife of the divorces and what not, but sometimes just a moment of the aftermath. I liked Patricia Arquette's monologue as it capped off a very real performance (but, if you're just realizing these are the types of performances Patricia Arquette gives- you are late to the party.)  Ethan Hawke has a very similar acting style to Patricia that puts the audience at ease.  I found myself, when watching and drifting mindlessly away, what would have happened if any of the actors died in the twelve years while filming?  Because I started drifting away with mindless thoughts, I can't quite say this is the Best Film of the year.  That- and I think the daughter deserves more praise for her performance. I wouldn't necessarily believe this deserves a Best Directing nod. To me- it was an experiment of- \"can I do this?\" and he did. Good job. But like \"Across the Universe\" was, it was like- \"Good job. It was done. Let's never do it again...\"",

The cast was all quite good and Ellar gives a very natural performance as should be the case with his life unfolding on screen, Overall, however, it didn't meet my expectations based on all the hype. It's a good movie, kept me interested and it was emotional in how it conveys the years that pass so quickly and the milestones in life. I felt it was too long and could have been better edited. It seemed like there was a lot of \"filler\" scenes in there that didn't really belong; they didn't really add to the story. I also felt that the dialogue contained too many \"big\" pronouncements as to the mysteries of life and that some of the dialogue was a tad pompous. Overall, it's well worth watching and I can't understand all the negative reviews about it being boring and no plot. I don't think I'd watch it again and it's really not that kind of movie in my opinion anyway but it's well worth a viewing.",

            "content": "If you tried to gun down \"Boyhood\" with a silver bullet, it would probably deflect the ammo and knock you down instead.  How do you criticize a movie that serves as one of the most ingenious experiments in the history of cinema? You can't.  You don't want to.  Richard Linklater has forged new ground before - the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy presented romance in a wordy, realistic bundle, \"Bernie\" knotted mockumentary impulses with true-crime jolts - but never before has he, or any director for that matter, made something as disparately pragmatic as \"Boyhood.\"\n\tYou know the backstory: \"Boyhood\" was filmed for over 12 years, IFC financed it on a wing-and-a-prayer, and, now, it is hailed as being one of the best films of the decade (and by some, ever), with abounding Oscar nominations to prove it.  It delivers exactly what you think it will: it directly, and honestly, tells the story of a boy's childhood, growing from a sprightly six-year-old to a thoughtful collegian, growing before our very eyes.  The unremarkability of \"Boyhood\" is what makes it so remarkable; aside from a few shitty stepfathers, Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) experiences are relatable, and if not, understandable, and the film doesn't sugarcoat that.\n\tSo many coming-of-age films would rather play it safe and venture into quirky yet emotive territory, just teary enough to make you go awww at the end but agile enough to trick you into thinking that the humor involved makes it immune to the clich\u00e9s you've come to know.  But \"Boyhood\" doesn't aim to be a typical coming-of-age film; it doesn't even aim to be a typical film.  If it isn't always as captivating as we'd like it to be, it prospers in its momentous moments.  The mundane is invigorated by the idea that, just a few minutes ago, the characters sitting in the mundane chateau of life were younger, their opinions and goals shaped completely differently since we last saw them.  You cannot say that about any other movie, and if we were to, we'd most likely be referring to a documentary (more specifically, one of the \"7 Up!\" films).\n\tWhat Linklater does here is far more profound than many would like to admit.  \"I give 'Boyhood' a B, for boring!\" my father exclaimed in an Aunt Linda sort of way when the film finished.  When we go to the movies to escape, seeing something gritty and real is far less enticing than traveling into a faraway land where The Avengers are the heroes of the world or a meet-cute suddenly becomes involving and pressing.  Seeing our own reflection in a character, a story, or a setting isn't always fun,  The truths a mirror provides can be disconcerting.  Even if we haven't had two alcoholic stepfathers, even if we haven't moved several times and even if we haven't received a shotgun, a Bible and a suit from our grandparents on our birthday, all of us, male or female, can relate to Mason because we've all grown up.  We've had that one bad hairdo, that one misunderstanding with our parents, that feeling of doubt when thinking about the future.  Maturing isn't always exciting, but \"Boyhood\" points out that our clashing identities make us a whole - our flaws, no matter how different they initially seem, are rooted in the same fears, the same ambiguities.  When Mason's mother (Patricia Arquette) breaks down towards the end of the film, pondering if life really is just a series of unexceptional milestones, we can't help but ask ourselves the exact same question.\n\tDoes the film contain great performances, great writing? Traditionally, no.  The actors don't so much portray their characters as they do fill their shoes.  In real-life, Arquette is a mother, Hawke is a father, and Coltrane is a young man with an unknown road ahead of him, and they most likely directly took their own lives into account during the filming process.  What we see on the screen is so instinctive that the cloud of illusion clears into a sky of reality; we forget that Linklater, Hawke, and Arquette are all established professionals.\n\tNot a lot happens in \"Boyhood,\" but its effect is extensive and weighty.  Linklater has made the movie of his career.  The 1970s were a time in which films were testing out their newfangled abilities to cover the screens in sex, violence, and unheard of ideas - many consider it to be one of the best eras in movies.  But it seems the 2010s are past all that, preferring to test the limits of filmmaking itself.  Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez-I\u00f1\u00e1rritu shot \"Birdman\" as if it were photographed in just one take; \"The Artist\" made the silent film cool again.  \"Boyhood\" proves that time should never be a limit when it comes to art.  No, \"Boyhood\" does not get a \"B for boring\"; it gets an A for astounding.",

            "content": "To start off, I'd like to say I that don't think anyone can deny the brilliance of this film. Ambitious and innovative in in it's concept but yet accessible and natural in it's approach. It's charm and originality is derived from the fact it is a life story first and a coming of an age movie second. Instead of presenting the story within the context of the movie, Boyhood presents the movie within it's own story. The audience discovers the movie within their own introspection of the real life moments that are fluidly being presented by  director Richard Linklater. In this sense, Boyhood has the possibility to relate to it's audience as much as it relates to itself. Speaking volumes about all the truths and contradictions of life without needing the capacity to say anything at all. But even in all of this real to life feeling taking place in the movie's ebb and flow, Linklater does not bore or presents these moments in a way that comes off as dry or ordinary. Even the most minimal and seemingly trivial scenes get weaved together with the rest of the movie in an almost  lucid fashion. Occasionally recalling me back to the dynamic and spirit of his 2001 animated film Waking Life. Most especially in the subtle cues and emphasizing of moments happening outside it's basic plot - like the man talking to himself at the restaurant or the brief monologues on time and change by both main and secondary characters. Another success of boyhood is in how it uses the model of a coming an age  film as an accurate introspection of of the reality we all live in now. Through depicting Mason's childhood in a hyper accurate and real sense (the harry potter book releases, obama's election) we also get a coming of an age of a new generation (our generation) along with coming of an age of Mason. And in itself it becomes a critique and an embracement - but all through the lense of a life story. A lense that see life through the perspective of poetic vignettes in which these vignettes are nothing more than passing moments. Thus what Linklater teaches us through Boyhood is that in which is expressed in the movie's last scene and happens to be the movie's concept as whole: experiencing life is not about living the moments of one big story but rather continuously living the story of each moment.",

The director took a chance and it paid off. Every summer they filmed for a couple of days and created this movie. There isn't really a plot per say. It's more like a bunch of short films put together that shows different moments of a boy growing up. The acting is fantastic. Patricia Arquette knocks it out of the park with her performance, Ethan Hawke is equally good, I really enjoyed his performance and I felt the movie had the most life when he was on screen. Overall it really is a fantastic movie. My only gripe is the fact that if you take the exact same script and shot the movie over a period of 2 months, it wouldn't be special, it would be boring, and it would be very forgettable, it's only because of the gimmick that the movie works, and boy, does it work!",

            "content": "Boyhood. A landmark cinematic achievement and an astonishingly powerful portrait of youth, of family and of life that I simply love more than I can say.  This quietly confident masterpiece oozes glorious humanity in its abilities to engulf viewers with a simple and patient story of life and of love. \n\nThe headline feature of this movie is undoubtedly its tender and loving craft over a period of 12 years, an undeniably astounding cinematic feat. Watching the movie for the first time, a feeling of awe was almost compulsory as my tiny brain tried to compute this essentially unprecedented experiment with time undertaken by the masterful Richard Linklater. Both the physical and emotional transformations of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and those that populate his life unfold in a rich and loving tapestry over the three hour running time, combining to mould a stunning portrayal of an average family's life and effects of time and age. \n\nA second viewing, however, allowed me absorb the film within its own merits, relishing in the sheer delight of its patient, understated and subtle ways. It is a poignant study of life and the struggles and wonders of growing up. Most impressively in my eyes, Linklater has constructed an utterly blank canvas of emotion, not exploiting or patronising viewers with prompts for when to feel and not really relying on major plot points. Instead, these helplessly relatable characters populate our lives for the best part of three hours, inviting us in to bare witness to their experiences, whether they are trivial and mundane or major and profound. In short, the wonders of the cinema are used to allow us to fully immerse ourselves and experience these lives. By the end, the imminence of time has well and truly engulfed the viewer, lending a stark and sobering sentiment to the close. On the flip-side, the movie never allows itself to stray from optimism, delivering the ultimately uplifting notion that the slight, unassuming moments that make up this movie (and equally of lives) are really our lives, often missed whilst we scavenge for a more profound meaning in our own lives. \n\nAside from this, this film amounts to perfection partly due to the overwhelming virtues of its relentlessly likeable central cast, with stellar turns from the children of the movie (especially newcomer Coltrane, who throughly embraces his gradual movement to the forefront towards the latter half of the movie and displays real promise) and the parents, with a thunderous and painstakingly realised performance from Patricia Arquette, rightfully cleaning up this awards season. The soundtrack is sprawling and runs parallel with the movie it inhibits, evoking painstaking nostalgia from the first bars of Coldplay's Yellow and closing the movie with a flourish of Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. \n\nSimply put, however, this is not a movie that can evaluated like any other. It is simply like no other. In a year of wondrous compound titled films (Birdman, Whiplash etc.), Boyhood, a small and truly independent film, doesn't so much as stand out amongst them but distances itself from the rest through its sheer uniqueness, its audacity and its utter humanity. It is an tender creation of time and one that has come to fruition through Linklater's faultless perseverance in this 12 year labour of love. \n\nBeautifully and delicately crafted, Boyhood is a film about life that simply inspires love and, in the process, shows itself to be one of the all time cinematic greats.",

I will share them with you so you can understand how I reached my conclusion that this Golden Globe winner is extremely overrated and should not win the Oscar. \n\nMy running diary of thoughts as I watch Boyhood for the next three hours...\nEdgy opening. Immediate Coldplay Yellow took me a straight back to the early Aughts. Well done. \nThe little kid talking about his rock collection reminds me of Jake Lloyd talking about midichlorians. It's too bad George Lucas didn't take 12 years to film the Clone Wars. \nThe girl is annoying. Oops she did it again. And I'm annoyed by the soundtrack already. Way too many gimmicks - Soak Up the Sun? I guess I need to lighten up. \nActing: Young Ethan Hawke > young Patricia Arquette\nBowling hasn't aged in 12 years. \nWow. Transition. Now PA has married her creepy Pavlov professor. \nBoyhood & Stepboyhood are chatting about Star Wars and now playing Halo. This sounds like my boyhood! Wait, that was college at BYU.\nFamily charades. I'm bored.\nHarry Potter & the Deathly Hallows is now out and Boyhood and siblings are waiting in line. I'm bored but I do appreciate the pop culture references to mark then passage of time. \nDouchebag high golf shorts stepdad is lecturing sister. I'm annoyed because I hate them both. \nPA's haircut is ridiculous. \nNow they're chasing butterflies.\nMid-Aughts EH is still > mid-aughts PA. \nRoger Clemons on the mound. Back when EH and everyone thought it was completely normal for a 43 year old to be unhittable.*******\nEH and Jimmy are now performing for Boyhood and Sishood. Jimmy is a douche with guitar. I'm bored. \nBoyhood just asked EH about magic and elves. Now they're talking about whales. I'm bored. \nThey're getting haircuts because stepdouche is on a power trip. Now Boyhood is faking that he's sick because he looks like an idiot. This is the first time I've truly felt sorry for any of them. \nNow they're giving the Texas flag pledge. Texas is so weird. \nNow his hair has grown back and there's been an altercation between PA and a drunk stepdouche. He's drinking at the dinner table. Drama. \"I hate squash.\"\nA \"Funny or Die\" clip that isn't funny. I'm bored. \nStepdouche is checking everyone's phones. And driving them to the liquor store. I can see where this is going. Oh, no crash. Just a near wreck. The oracle was wrong.\nPA is screaming and has just rescued the kids.\nOmg. This new girl at the friend's place is singing at the table while Boyhood and his new friend play Wii. They're moving on. Time marches on. Richard Linkletter is boring me to death. \nAnnoying girl is crying outside her middle school. Now PA just had a meltdown. Kudos to her. Boyhood is at a new school. He just met a new brah. Brah-hood. \nNow they're putting up Obama/Biden posters. I'm bored. \n2008 EH is > PA. Now he's using Sarah Palin as a hip way to talk about birth control with the kids. And now some ginger bowling girl is trying to seduce him. \nBoyhood's voice is lower. His balls have dropped. Now they're hiking. I'm bored.\nNow they're having s'mores and talking about Return of the Jedi. And now he's peeing on the fire to a hipster music transition.\nAnd now he's getting bullied in the bathroom. And now he's talking to some girl who is riding a bike as he walks over to the college where PA is now a teacher. This girl is reading To Kill a Mockingbird instead of the cheesy Twilight books. \nUgh. I would hate having late Aughts PA as a teacher. This talk about attachment theory is killing me softly.\nHooligans messing around in a construction zone. Drinking beer, talking about sex. I'm bored. \nNow one of PA's students is in Boyhood's room chatting about life. Now they're at the table listening to stories about Iraq. Now edgy student chick is playing Wish You Were Here on the guitar. \nTime change. His hair is now longer and it's his birthday. He just admitted to PA that he's been drinking and smoking. And EH now has a baby and a minivan and a mustache.  He had to sell his cool car for the minivan. Oh no. He told Boyhood he would give it to him when he turned 16. He forgot. Now they're having a fight. Drama. \nNow they're watching Gaga on the iPhone. So hip. Now EH is explaining his Beatles mix. I'm so bored.\nHe got a shotgun and a bible. What a birthday. More singing and guitar playing. \nThey're skipping rocks, but Boyhood's true passion is photography. \"Any dipshit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special.\" \nEdgy boy has painted his nails. PA's sheriff boyfriend is not pleased with that or the earrings. He needs to be responsible. \nFriday Night Lights. Beer pong. Jell-O shots. \"I just want to be able to do anything I want because it makes me feel alive As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.\"\nDrunk sheriff - oh wait, his shirt says corrections. Anyway, he is mad at Boyhood for coming home late. Now annoying PA is paying her bills and being preachy at the table. I think even mustachioed EH is still better.\nNow the manager is yelling at Boyhood for eating leftover shrimp and flirting with April. He will get a raise as long as he can handle the added responsibility. Giddy up.\nFaceTime with EH. Longer hair and some scruff. The baby bro is growing up. EH just called him ObiWan. Now I'm annoyed. The first Star Wars reference was kind of funny. Now it's getting lame. Same with the music. \nI'm soooooo bored!\nBoyhood is talking to some girl in the truck about cyborgs and how we get dopamine rushes for text messages and facebook notifications. He wants to be a real person, not just a profile. He wants to live his real life not through a screen. He doesn't want to live in an in between state. He wants to experience. Cyborgs are consciousness. Cyborgs are alive. Cyborgs are Chappie.\nNow they're playing billiards. Annoying sister is talking to Boyhood's girlfriend. College is really fun. Unlike this movie, which is boring and the opposite of fun.\nDouche with guitar in the street while someone does a hoola-hoop. When will it end!?!? This movie feels like it really has been going for 12 years because it's so boring! \nI just spaced out for awhile and didn't miss anything.\nBack. Awkward roommate walk in scene. He won a silver medal and a scholarship. His photography is his meal ticket. He has a great heart.\nBoyhood. More like mopey adolescent whines about prom and pouts to his girlfriend who slept with her college boyfriend. \"He's not a jock. He just happens to be on the lacrosse team.\"\nGraduation party!!!! Everyone's here! What a party! Toasts. A toast to the future. A toast to the douchebags. So bored. \nSam's turn. Good luck. Lol.\nOld EH is still > PA\nYou are responsible for you. Not your girlfriend. Not your mom. You are responsible. \nIt's all timing. It would have saved Boyhood the parade of drunken a-holes. \n\"What's the point?\" Of life? Or this long movie?\nThey're moving. Again. Sam is complaining. Again. Full circle. \nTime to take responsibility. \nWow. Their waiter was their sceptic tank cleaner years ago. PA changed his life. Gracias. \nBoyhood is trying to look like a young EH. That's profound.\nBoyhood is happy to be leaving. PA is sad. Her life is just a series of milestones. Now she's upset. We just thought there'd be more. \nNow Boyhood's hitting the open road to some stupid emo indie song. I'm so mad.\nAnd..... Xbox's servers just went down. I'm five minutes from the end and I can't finish it right now. I was so close. Now I'm so mad. I don't even want to finish it but I have to. \nNo achievement for me.\nAnd no, this is not a weird joke. \nInitial gut: This had potential, but it was just stupid. Way too boring. But maybe that's the point. Life is boring? No way. My life is hilarious and full of jokes. \nAfter an hour Xbox is back. Here's the final few minutes. Taking pictures of random things out in the desert. A gas station. A fire hydrant. Now he's in the dorms. He just met his roommate. His ginger roommate. They're going hiking with some babes. This one's a tap dancer. They're both artists. Seize the moment. But it's the other way around. The moment seizes us. \"It's like it's always right now.\" \nEnd credits.\nWith that hour break, it made the last few minutes seem like an encore. Initial (full movie) thought: that's it? If it wasn't filmed over 12 years, no one would think twice about it. Like Steve said, a boring movie is still boring even if they filmed it boring scene by boring scene over a decade. Although I do have to say, the edgy end credit choice of Arcade Fire's Deep Blue is perfect because it bookends Yellow from the opening credits. The edgier things get, the more they stay the same. Just like time itself. Just like Boyhood.",

            "content": "\" Art, that is special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can? \"\n\nRichard Linklater delivers realism on a scale that cinema rarely explores upon. Linklater and the story he tells through Boyhood truly revels in the magnificent and  abhorrent, the remarkable and dire, the simple and the complex. \n\nHow does one take nothing beyond the doldrums of every day life and turn it into something more for an audience? Boyhood excels at taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary. Who would have thought that chronicling a normal family for twelve years would reap such reward and promise?\n\nCarrying that story is a remarkable cast that comes together as if they really are the family next door, our family even. Lorelei Linklater offers that tantalizing but loving sibling who doesn't always vocalize her feelings. Ellar Coltrane brings to the table an inquisitive son and sibling that is hungry to find a purpose. Patricia Arquette puts forth maybe the performance of her career as the mom that only wants to do right by herself and her children but seems to make poor decisions over and over. Ethan Hawke is equally as brilliant as the dad who wasn't quite ready to be a dad. His struggle and triumph to connect with his children is heart-warming. \n\nWhat makes this cast so beyond comprehension is that fact that they make it all feel so real. The bonds they share, the journey they face, and the endless questions and answers. The relationships between mother and ex-husband or father and son or brother and sister, they are all cemented in the sometimes inconvenient truth of life. It all feels so real -- and I imagine working with one another for twelve years has forged many of those bonds to be as true and genuine as they appear on screen.\n\nLinklater, cast, and crew scrounge every crevice of life and the realism. Boyhood stands far taller than simply great cinema... It stands as art -- a window into the frail lives of each and every one us. Life lifts us up and it drags us down only to lift us back up again -- that's the reality Boyhood captures.\n\nAnd that is what Mr. Linklater brings to cinema that nobody else can.",

Where people shuffle along towards death and a realization that it was all pointless.\n\nIt's a perspective on life and a lot of people do subscribe to it and live it out but it's not the entire human condition. The part that's missing here is that within us which responds to those niggles and prompts us to fight with everything we have to dissipate the fog. And plenty of people succeed.\n\nThe blurb calls Boyhood 'groundbreaking'. I disagree. The concept of using the same actors for 12 years for a movie is unusual for the movie industry, that's all. For the rest, it's self indulgent film-making and script writing and could have said the same things in less than half the time. It's easy to write a 180 page script, which Boyhood was, but it's not so easy to masterfully edit that down to 120 pages or less and still say everything the longer version says. \n\nI think it contains some real brilliance but it's so watered down by the sloppy writing that in the end it has become not just a commentary on but a product of middle-class aimlessness.

I loved listening to some of the dialogue. Even though I was raised in a different era and had a very stable childhood, I could relate to a lot of what the kid went through. However, I struggled with the acting. I thought it was just OK. I'm not getting the awards love for Patricia Arquette. Probably my own prejudice since I've never thought she was a substantial actor. She's adequate here, but not more than that. Ethan Hawke is his usual scenery chewing self, but he's fine in the part - he fits the character well. As for the kids, I thought they did a smashing job for non-professionals. Another struggle I had was with the characters themselves. I found it hard to root for any of these folks. The young man was a bit whiny and depressing, his sister was a bit nasty, and his mother and father were poster children for bad decision-making. Yep, I realize there's no movie otherwise, but it got tiresome after 2 hours and 45 minutes. So, I recommend the movie if you're looking for a slow, languid watch on a Sunday afternoon.

Although no one gives a bad performance, I lost interest in Mason's story as he grew into a sullen, monosyllabic teenager. He may be a dreamer and free spirit, but it doesn't make for a charismatic lead character and made the latter half of the film drag.

The reality (often overlooked by those blinded with conceptual praise), is that Linklater's lifetime-long film is enough to give you growing pains. \nThe problem with Boyhood is, let's face it, none of the characters are particularly likeable, or even genuinely interesting. Our mopey boy doesn't do so much as share a single thought until he starts driving a truck and, let's face it, Ethan Hawke's frothy father (strictly in younger incarnations only) is the only person here with an ounce of bouncy enthusiasm for his sad, stock role. Then, once we step outside of the characters, we're left with little more than a maddening visual and aural catalogue of blinding cliches and look-at-me pop culture references.\nThe 'profoundly humanist' Boyhood raises one question only: are humans really this dull, predictable, and pathetic?

Broader strokes of cinematography are reserved for few scenes where they serve as effects.\n\nLinklater shot the movie during 12 years, which makes \"Boyhood\" a curiosity in and of itself. Story-wise, the extended decade of production doesn't really show- the film doesn't seem to be aware of its most marketable gimmick- but it does indeed lend the viewing experience a certain sense of authenticity. The way the characters, actors as well as Linklater's direction evolve over the course of the two-and-a-half hour so that the movie getting better and better becomes an engrossing element of its own. I was especially impressed by Patricia Arquette, who has never been one of my favorite actors. She starts off really awkward, I felt, but ends up giving a solid performance by the end of her long assignment. I still think she won an Oscar from the role mostly because of her dedication.\n\nThe film starts two years after the turn of the Millennium and follows its main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from the age of six into his adulthood at 18. Mason lives with his mother (Arquette) and elder sister (the directors daughter, competent Lorelei Linklater). His life is infrequently inhabited by his divorced father (Ethan Hawke).\n\nNothing specific or particularly dramatic ever happens, and the film feels much longer than its already lengthy duration, but never at any point does it get tedious. The true narrative occurs just beneath the surface. Linklater depicts normal life and captures the journey of growing up tenderly and often beautifully. And yes, the film seems to be in all its understating humility about nothing less that time itself. The way time molds the faces of the actors, the minds of the characters, the visual style of the film and the music we hear. The soundtrack plays a key part, but never steps forward in order to maintain the sense of everything we see being real. There is no movie magic here, and that's a good thing.\n\nWhat makes \"Boyhood\" truly alive is that trademark Linklater compassion and warmth that permeates the scenes. There is openness, acceptance and humility here that make the effect of the storytelling ever more powerful.",

His \"Before\" film series (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight) followed the lives of two adults for almost two decades after a meeting by chance on a train from Budapest to Vienna. \"Boyhood\" does the same. It is filmed over 12 years with the same cast and follows the lives of a boy and his family over that same period of time.\n\nSuch effort, without a doubt, is very ambitious and Linklater pulls it off in grand fashion in this groundbreaking tale of growing up in a family raised by a single mother while at the same time showcasing the various terrains involved in parenthood. Experimental in a certain way, Linklater pushes the bar on the art of filmmaking to a level that has not been done before.\n\nLinklater's approach is more than just a gimmick. Instead of real time, there is another way to tell this story using different actors and makeup to show the aging of characters and passing of time. Instead, he opted for a more challenging course producing better results in terms of connecting with its characters and story. Its narrative is affecting with an affirmation that comes close to its 2 1/2 hour mark. And when it is all over, there is a feeling of association to everything that just unfolded onscreen. The performances of newcomer Ellar Coltrane (Mason) and Patricia Arquette are both worth noting.",

This is not The Bicycle Thieves. \nI had high hopes for Boyhood, but before long it became obvious that Linklater was not going to let anything happen to Mason. While Mason and his family struggled to make ends meat in the world, falling from one horrible situation to another for a long time, I never felt that there were ever any stakes on the table. Linklater refused to let anything happen to his characters, and as a result, all tension was lost.\nThe character of Mason didn't help either. Always quiet, never up or attempting to change the world around him, I couldn't help but feel that Mason must have been on some form of anti-depressant. He is a blank slate from start to finish.\nAll in all, while this Boyhood's method of production was impressive, it's narrative is completely void of life and tension.",

Then there's the Before trilogy which again seemed effortless and free-flowing yet constructed with so much care that you knew this filmmaker was not only unusual, but acutely human. That he cherished experience and learning and submitted to the eternal present, surrendering to and tinkering with fate, while tending to the perpetually immediate situation with enormous sensitivity and regard. \n\nBut nothing could prepare you for Boyhood. You can't overstate the fact that it's a grand free-flowing time-lapse experiment and that most of the actors--no not actors, not performers--most of the people were cast when the central figure was a very young boy, looking up at the sky, having no idea how his future would unfold. The world might be a stage but Richard Linkater is not omnipotent. As a definitive work-in-progress, a daring collaboration with fate and destiny, who could really know how the boy's script was going to turn out, and how the wide array of voices in his life would shape him as he stumbles toward adulthood? Only a true sure-footed and fluid filmmaker, an authentic disarming innovator could raise this baby with as much beauty and wisdom. Dazed and Confused? Make room for Clear and Composed.\n\nHear the lamb howl. Boyhood is a daring experimental wolf wrapped in conventional wool. Needing to be shot chronologically, the linear time-line and 12-year shooting schedule called for a fresh and original approach to crafting a movie. If something went wrong during the many long gaps in production, say, if an actor suddenly became unavailable, or some drastic circumstance threatened to break the continuity of the boy and his family's life, there's no going back to re-shoot. No relying on special effects make-up or casting young and old versions of a character. The faith invested in this concept and the delicate handling of it's execution is a marvel to witness, blooming before our eyes. \n\nPatricia Arquette was growing up too. Aging faster than Ellar Coltrane, it appeared. This movie defies breaking up into a series of disjointed, episodic fragments. And Arquette stitches together an admirable and dedicated performance as the ubiquitous maternal defender who struggles to keep herself and her family from falling apart. Because of the blur between fiction and reality, between drama and documentary, and because of the way Linklater is able to nurture the process and allow his films to take on a life of their own, Arquette may not be acting on set any more than she has to in real life. A slight adjustment in perspective and this movie could have been called Motherhood.",

I enjoyed watching the various aspects of personhood, from childhood (Mason and Samantha's K-12 years), adulthood (Mom, Dad and the various successive step-parents), young adulthood (Mason in university), and retirement (the various grandparents). I quite liked how Linklater was able to tie them all together by showing the way young people influence older people (in both good ways such as teaching and bad ways such as throwing glassware) as well as the way older people influence the young. He spoke to friendships and mentoring and support groups and really poked around in the way human beings relate to each other. \n\nThe acting was fine, with Patricia Arquette being the obvious standout performance.

Instead of casting multiple actors to play the boy over the 12 years the story covers, director Richard Linklater actually directed the film over the course of 12 years, filming his star Ellar Coltrane as the actor grew from a boy into a teenager and eventually a young man. The tone and style of the film is very much in line with other entries in the Linklater canon, especially Slacker and Waking Life, and he explores similar themes. It's not as overtly philosophical as some of his previous work, but it doesn't need to be. His process is philosophical enough. The real key to the success of this film is the patience with which it was crafted. Hollywood has turned into a blockbuster factory line, with each studio scrambling to quickly capitalize on what the newest trend or hottest property is, often releasing sequels and remakes at a pace so breathless that very little thought is put into the content of the films. Linklater has completely eschewed this mentality and crafted what is not only a film that will stay in your thoughts for a long time (as many of Linklater's films do) but a true work of cinematic artistry.",

            "content": "Review for Boyhood:\n\nBoyhood, Richard Linklater's long and detailed chronicle of a young boy growing up from childhood to adulthood. The film literally tells the life of Mason Evans, a young boy, whose life we are introduced to at the age of six and follow him and his hardships and tribulations as we see him grow up from a small child, to a full grown adult, key word being \"literally\". Why? Because the movie takes a 12 year lifespan chronicling his entire life, seeing all the best parts of growing up, as well as all the worst parts. The movie's 12 year lifespan isnt just in camera; the film was shot in over 12 years, from 2002 to 2014 using all the same actors, reprising their roles as they grew up with age, and with the movie, giving this a legitimate timeless feel. None of the actors, look like their even acting, they dont even look like legitimate actors, even big names like Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, and watching this movie made me feel like watching a really long home movie about this family's life, as I watch them grow up and live through all the stages that life had in store for them. Richard Linklater's vision was genius and incredibly unorthodox to shoot, but the love and dedication that was put into this movie shows from all its dedicated actors, wonderful writing, ingenious directing and beautiful cinematography. I even felt a little bit of nostalgia watching this movie, as like the children in this movie, I also lived through these years and made some of the mistakes they did and seeing the evolution of social media, watching how this family grew up with all the heartbreaks and fun memories spent with one another, it even reminded me of all the hardships my mother went through, though in a different fashion, and made me love and respect her even more than one could already do. Bottom line, Boyhood is a masterpiece and I don't think I've ever seen or ever will see one that lets the viewer grow up with it as it goes along, and even when it abruptly ends and the camera stops shooting, life doesn't stop for Mason Evans as he continues to live his life even when we can't see it. He grows along more as time progresses, the same as all of us.\n\nOverall Rating: 10 out of 10!",

The whole pace of the film was slow and after watching watching 2 kids and there mum growing up over 12 years, it really didn't seem like anything major happened all the way through this 2 and a half hour movie. I was hoping that there was going to be a twist or some form of an incident which would change the tone of the film, but nothing really happens. Your basically watching 2 kids adapting to there mothers failed relationships, whilst keeping a grounded relationship with there dad. There are a couple of emotional scenes but I can't really see why the critics raved about this film. Don't get me wrong, it is well written and the actors do play there parts well and I did feel for the mum who had to bring up her children under extreme circumstances but when the movie had finished, I couldn't remember a scene which I found outstanding. Anyway, it's worth a watch if your into your deep dramas and don't mind watching normal family values for over 2 hours, but I personally lost interest after a while. Average!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie really made a serious profit at the box office and with 6 nominations at this year's Oscars, the audiences must have really loved watching this family grow over 12 years. I liked the whole flow of the movie because it really doesn't seem like so many years have passed. The only problem is that none of the characters go through a major incident like most families do. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who play the loving parents, played there parts extremely well and they made the movie seem realistic and emotional, along with the kids who adapted to ever tricky situation well, but I drifted off after a while. Maybe if I watched it again, in a different mood, I might enjoy it more.\n\nBudget: $4million\nWorldwide Gross: $44million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas which is based on a dysfunctional family, over 12 years, with the kids adapting to there mothers boyfriends whilst growing up and making new friends. 4/10",

Over the twelve years you watch the characters as they age and develop, from 6 years old to 18 and leaving home.\n\n  Although a monstrous two hours and forty five minutes the time passes relatively fast.  The constant transitioning of time periods forces the movie forwards, creating new story lines and sub plots.  Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke's stellar performances also enriches and strengthens the story.\n \n In regards to the half a star I left out - Mason throughout the first half was endearing, charming and completely captivating.  Upon his latter teenage years he was replaced with a brooding teenager who spent more time flicking his hair than talking.  I found myself not caring about him as much as did prior to this transition.  The pretentious monologues and angsty silence started to irk me.\n  Without telling ya any spoilers - the scene of the Hispanic male reuniting with Mason's mother (Patricia Arquette), seemed contrived, cliched and unrealistic - all of which I felt Linklater has tastefully avoided up to this point.\n\nDespite its minor flaws this movie is both relatable and undeniably powerful. It will leave you thinking about it for days after.  A unique cinematic experience which is a overwhelming success due to it's genius concept and accomplished acting - 4 1/2 stars",

I love movies and have never walked out in the middle of one before but it took all my will power not to walk out on this one. Talk about over-hyped!!! Apparently many have fallen for the brainwashing -- I must like this since the critics loved it! Ha. Well, the movie views like a documentary but it's NOT a documentary -- it's fiction. So it fails at both being a documentary and being fiction. The movie is disjointed - it patches together different scenes shot at different ages of the boy's life. This ruins the normal engaging dramatic flow that almost every other movie has. Also, the boy is a sullen introvert. Can't blame him for the sullen part, as he has to deal with a messed up family situation. But the introvert part makes it NOT interesting to watch the kid and not engaging to follow his life. The different events that happen as he matures are basically accurate to portray a boy coming of age, but again, the viewer could care less because of the disjointed, boring flow. Is it interesting to see the actors ACTUALLY age in real life? Sure, but a REAL documentary could do the same thing, whereas it's just a gimmick in this lifeless, boring film. And the whole single mom/rebel dad is very cliche/stereotypical, as are most of the characters in the film. In the end, the boy is so existential about life by the time he enters college that it's depressing. Life goes by too quick to be bogged down in depressing existentialism when you are only 18!!!! For the love of God RELAX and maybe try to enjoy life??!! The movie plods along boring and not engaging to watch, and then a bunch of disturbing things happen to the family, making it now UNPLEASANT to watch. Yep, a lot not to like about the movie. That's my review. Save yourself the nearly THREE HOURS this movie lasts and go ENJOY life. :)",

If I want to 'experience' 'real life', I got enough of that in my own real one, thank you very much. The acting is casual, some better than others, the characters absolutely uninteresting, the direction is what some might call minimal, I would call it visually unimpressive. What can commend here is the magnificent PR and marketing campaign behind the film. They sold it like it's pure genius, given it's 12 year shooting schedule and artistic ambition.

            "content": "There really is very little reason to see this film, other than the hype it has attracted, and it\u0092s twelve year production gimmick. Otherwise it\u0092s dull, shot like a soap opera, lazily written, and tells us nothing. Bugger all happens. The characters may grow and age before our eyes but we learn very little about them, and nothing about life, the human condition, etc. more profound than \u0091people change as times passes\u0092. Which might be one of life\u0092s great truths, but really isn\u0092t all that interesting a point to spin out over the course of one hundred and sixty five minutes. \nIf you\u0092ve heard of Boyhood you\u0092ll have heard that it took twelve years to make. You\u0092ll be aware that Richard Linklater (the guy who did over-rated teen stoner \u0091classics\u0092 Dazed and Confused and Slacker) decided he was going to make a sort of realist bildungsroman film, casting an eight year old in 2001 and then continuing to film them over the course of twelve years as he grows up, matures, and experiences- amongst other things- his parents\u0092 divorce, a drunk stepfather, first loves and first spliffs. There is a cast of other recurring characters, including the kid\u0092s father played by Ethan Hawke, and his mother played by Patricia Arquette, who also age and mature over the course of the drama, albeit not as dramatically because y\u0092know, puberty. You\u0092ll also be all too aware that the film has been lavished with critical praise and award nominations, with a 95% rating at the top of this page, and a Best Picture Oscar nomination. To take a few choice sound bites, it\u0092s been described as \u0091an important landmark in how great films are made\u0092, \u0091the greatest coming of age story ever put to film\u0092, and \u0091a masterpiece\u0092 by various esteemed voices. \nAnd yet for all that the film really has nothing to it. It\u0092s nothing more than a gimmick. The emperor has no clothes. Because as technically ground-breaking as it is to shoot a film over the course of twelve years, it\u0092s also pointless. What does it say? It stands as a documentary record of the ageing process, and very little else. Characters come and go, drifting in and out of the narrative as listlessly as our protagonist\u0092s zits and haircuts. No phase of Mason\u0092s life can be properly scrutinized, explored, or felt by the audience because within ten minutes of one potentially interesting scenario being set up, Linklater is cutting ahead another year, because look! His sister\u0092s dyed her hair now! He\u0092s got an Adam\u0092s Apple! Now he\u0092s drinking beer with emo kids! Now his Texas Hillbilly grandfather\u0092s teaching him how to massacre wild ducks!  The overall effect is to create a narrative we can only follow at surface level, and characters who we find first boring and then annoying, as the bit-part kids grow up to be bad actors and we slowly realise that the central character has less depth than an 18-36 month paddling pool. \nHis drunken step-father is a caricature, a panto villain. He seems obsessed by control, beats his wife and drinks all the time. We have no idea why he is such an asshole. He features intermittently for all of thirty minutes and then is gone. Mason\u0092s mum leaves him and that\u0092s the end of him, as far as the film is concerned. Mason\u0092s sister, played without flair by Linklater\u0092s own daughter, goes from being a stroppy brat to a mellow and well-adjusted young woman in the blink of an eye. There is no discernible character arc, just a transition as rapid as a change of scene. Likewise their mother herself appears to have no notable features whatsoever. Early in the film she expresses her frustration that she\u0092s had kids too early. Later on she starts a career as a psychology lecturer. At one point she pointlessly advises a Mexican handyman to start at night school. She cries when Mason goes off to college, complaining that she has nothing left. As far as the audience is concerned, she never had anything in the first place. She, like every other character, including Mason himself, is nothing more than a cipher. \n\nThe film is concerned mainly with adolescence. The problem is that we feel almost none of the turmoil of puberty because our main character is too grounded, too sensible and frankly too dull. Why a film-maker would choose to make a coming of age film about a mature and contented kid who seems to find almost no struggle in life is beyond me. At no point is Mason especially awkward or angsty. We don\u0092t seem him cry, we don\u0092t see him fail, we don\u0092t see in him any burning desire to express himself or rebel or break away. He just sort of strolls on through, laughing at other people\u0092s jokes, rubbing along and experimenting with his hair. His teenage years are seen only as a series of flat vignettes- forced dialogue about Star Wars on a fishing trip with his father, giggling to his mother about having been out smoking weed, laughing from the side-lines as a friend is bullied by older kids. He faces only two difficulties, a pedestrian break-up when he\u0092s eighteen with a girl we see in about three scenes, and weighing up whether or not to study photography. That\u0092s it. That\u0092s his entire life. It\u0092s impossible to like him or to relate to him on any level. \nBoyhood is like watching someone else\u0092s home videos for nearly three hours- You\u0092ve Been Framed with slower cuts and no slapstick. In its less flat moments the endless mid-shots and domestic dialogue make it feel like a second rate TV drama. When it\u0092s at its weakest it\u0092s just a series of unrelated filler scenes from a Soap Opera. The experience of watching Boyhood is like being sober at a terrible party, listening to people you don\u0092t know make small talk, suspecting you\u0092ll never see them again and feeling no remorse at the prospect. Its occasional lunges at profundity are nothing more than pseudo-hippy bollocks. In the final scene Mason walks through a gulch with some college friends he\u0092s only just met to take hallucinogens. The cinematography remains flat, and the acting barely changes despite the drugs. He sits and has a bullshit cosmic conversation with some girl we don\u0092t care about. The final line of the film is Mason saying \u0091it\u0092s like; the moment\u0085 it\u0092s constant\u0092. Nothing better exposes the shallow premise and weak writing of this film. Don\u0092t waste your time with it.",

I wish it had lived up to expectation, but sadly it was little more than a self-indulgent art project that the culture-police believe is far grander than it really is.  Mason, Jr.'s life is so remarkably clich\u00e8 because it is simply the \"new\" normal.  It begs the question: who doesn't know somebody having a near identical experience, or have lived it themselves?  One can assert that as 'the point' of the film, but is that also not just pandering to an audience seeking self-affirmation? In my opinion, it fails as a cultural critique because it merely documents the 'draaahma' of a slightly updated coming of age story but does little to expose the the mechanisms of the pernicious externalities produced by a post-modern society that has rejected the moorings of traditional 'social repression,' nor has it liberated anyone from an even worse negative spiral.  Ironically, the application of critical theory to the normalcy message of the aimlessness of the median American adolescent suggests that being the child of fully \"liberated\" parents just sucks--it is despondent and bleak.  How has the hegemony of nihlism's meme liberated Mason's family?",

The acting in this film is fantastic from everyone involved especially the mom and dad played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke respectively. I was specifically floored by the performance of Hawke and I personally think it is his best work to date.  Also the editing on this movie I can not rave about enough as the characters age we jump through time and this is done seamlessly and with no need to tell the audience how far ahead we had traveled. The plot of the film is often a complaint of the movie because there is no real plot but this fit this film perfectly as life does not have a set plot either. This movie is also criticized for being over the top in some elements of the story and maybe this is not a regular family but it is someones. This movie also neatly shows us recent history in those twelve years all the way from Britney Spears to Harry Potter and Obama's 2008 election. This being my childhood as well really resonated with me on a deeper level. This film like no other before it perfectly captures life as we are just along for the ride as we watch Mason grow and try to find his place in the world. It will make you cry, it will make you rejoice and it will make you wonder at the pure beauty of this film. This is an excellent film that really marks an achievement in cinema. 5/5",

It is best described as the work of a great painter. No, not Picasso or Modigliani, but more like Bob from Bob's Painting and Drywall. Bob may do a wonderful job on your walls, but I don't expect you'll want to spend much time sitting in a chair staring at his final product.\n\nYes, this is a well made film, and some of the acting - particularly that of Ethan Hawke - is fine, but what can you say about a movie that serves up such original lines as \"I'm glad you were born\" and \"Don't forget to floss\"?\n\nI should also mention the performance of Ellar Coltrane who plays the main character Mason. Coltrane's lethargic acting immensely adds to the soporific qualities of this film. He really could have benefited from a few cups of espresso before stepping in front of the camera. In fact, I also recommend a good shot of caffeine for anyone intent on watching this.\n\nWriter/director Richard Linklater apparently uses Turtle Pacing Technology, a revolutionary new technique wherein a film that takes twelve years to make somehow also manages to make the audience feel as if they have just spent an equal amount of time in their theater seats.\n\nThis new technology should have been nominated for a Scientific and Technical Award Oscar. Incidentally, the Academy's Sci-Tech awards are no longer broadcast on television due to the fact that they are \"too exciting\" according to Richard Linklater.\n\nSo if you are in the mood for cavalierly tossing aside nearly three hours of your adulthood, then by all means have a look at Boyhood.",

I could relate and went through some things the boy went through.  The movie could also be called life.  It shows life evolving on the main screen and the relationships that are encountered along the way.\n\nNow I thought more dramatic things could of happened, more themes could have been explored because really it just showed him growing up without a lot of MAJOR conflict.  It was cool however to see the personality change, the relationships change, and how technology changed.\nThat was what was cool to me.  Seeing how things evolved and how people change in time.  No cell phones in the beginning to texting in the end as the norm.  Very cool\nHawks and Arquette were fantastic in this film.\nThe dedication to getting this film made the way the director wanted it to be made deserves a standing ovation.",

(Tree of Life is still the worst award nominated film I've ever subjected myself to)...\n \nA plot would be nice... a story... a payoff... consistency... competent acting... believable dialogue... character development... motivation are just a few things I'd expect in an award nominated film...  It didn't take me on a journey... It showed me a series of pointless scenes to show a passage of time... Seemed like a lot of it was written (or ad-libbed) as they went (later confirmed to a degree by his daughter)...\n \nThe liberal agenda (which I mostly agree with) was stuck in there too obviously and made it feel even more like a really bad LIfetime movie...\n \nReading the reviews, it comes across as people pretending to like or understand the film to fit in, be in the know or appear smart... I prefer to take a serious look at this and be truthful...  \n \nI was looking forward to the film... I read the hype, was excited about the premise and am fan of new exciting film ideas... but they have to be well executed... (that's the thing)...I'd like to know what about this film was done well?\n \nLinklater had 12 years to plan out a script, story, plot... to direct the actors to better performances... he had a $4 million budget (with no stunts, SFX, costumes, sets, etc)... He made the most basic of films types: I dialogue-driven drama with no costly name actors... There is no excuse...\n \nIf I come across harsh, it's because this film received so much unwarranted or deserving hype and rave reviews... Had this won at a film festival and went to DVD, great.... good for them... For this to be beating out other great films for awards (and for acting and directing too?!?!?!), it deserves some questioning into what the hell are people liking about it?\n \nIs Linklater blackmailing everyone? Were all the critics bribed? Is he best friends with Kim Jong Un? \n \nThis film fails to exceed in any of the categories set forth by the awards shows... I'm so glad the SAG Awards are coming soon, so I can gauge how it'll do up against some other greats films... I don't think I can stomach the Oscars if Boyhood is a frontrunner... \n \nDoes this film have any rewatchablilty for anyone not involved with the production? Were they any \"positive\" stand-out performances? Powerful moments? Surprises/twists? Engaging story? Characters to care about?\n \nOne last question I'd like to pose...Taking out the fact that all the main actors were available to work at various points within a 12 year period; that is, no one died or decided to quit (though Linklater's daughter wanted her character killed off because she didn't want to do it anymore, to which he said 'no, it would be too powerful for the film' - so instead, nothing happens)... What exactly about his movie was done well or successful?",

If you liked Boyhood, I would strongly encourage you to check out Michael Apted's \"7 Up series\", a documentary project in which he films a group of U.K. children at the age of 7 and returns every 7 years to see how they've progressed.  The series is based on the premise \"Child is the father of man\", which turns out to be true for most of Apted's subjects.",

One could argue that life itself is too long and lacking in plot, so this movie is perfect, but if I'm going to plunk down cash for a film, I want it to go somewhere.  Linklater had twelve years (plus!) to work on the script and this is all he came up with?  Meh.  But there were fine performances throughout and the idea of taking so long in order to follow the real life aging of the family is quite innovative.",

Yes, filming over 12 years is a feat and I respect the dedication it took. But the result of those 12 years lacked resonance. I really wish I could understand why it is receiving such high praise. I'm a real sucker for emotional, impactful movies that epitomize human connections and life (i.e. Magnolia), and absolutely believed I would be a sobbing mess by the end of Boyhood, awed by its scope and ability to reflect a coming of age story similar to my own. Instead, I was left disappointed in every aspect of the film. The existential crisis Boyhood tried so hard to solve (\"What's the point of it all?\" Mason asked his father) only manifested itself in me (\"What's the point of this movie?\" I asked myself) after it cut to black.",

Really think this was largely hype, can't believe a quality critic would think the writing worked on any level in the last 2/3rds. Some scenes were embarrassing to even watch (namely the teens drinking beers in a run-down house and talking about whores). Nuts. Did I enjoy the experience as a whole? I'd say so.

At first it seems a little slow, but it grows on you and pulls you in...I mean, you're seeing these people grow up and change...the son, daughter, mother father.  You see what you've seen, in your children if you have them, or your self from years past..  Those innocent years, awkward years and years of discovery.  Maybe you see yourself as an adult...going from that young cool person who is taking on the world, the parent that schleps their child around in a mini van.  It reveals how life isn't easy...it's hard and confusing and rocky and sometimes it sucks...but it keeps moving forward.  \n\nI found myself misty eyed in this movie a few times, and I'm not sure I can articulate why....but I found it moving.  Maybe you will too.\n\nI don't know if Linklater is a genius or if he was just lucky in casting  Mason, the boy in the movie, but he was perfect in this part.  As boy, as an adolescent and finally as a young man...he just seemed right.  Ethan Hawke is great as is Patricia Arquette.\n\nNow I'm a huge fan of Richard Linklater, the writer director.  His movies Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight (filmed 10 years apart with the same actors...which if you haven't seen, should), Slacker and of course Dazed and Confused are some of my favorite movies of all time.  He has a way with making the normal, extraordinary...in a nonchalant way.  Boyhood may be his best film.  See this.",

            "content": "If you don't know the concept of Boyhood, then either you don't really care about cinema that much, or you've been living under a rock. So much has been said about the idea that Richard Linklater spent 13 years filming the same actors as they slowly developed the life history of a young boy growing into a man. So this is where I'm supposed to gush about the brilliance and daring of this entire concept, and I will admit it was interesting to see the physical transformation of the people as the film progresses. However there's another way you can see the same effect and that is by watching someone's home movies. But guess what, no one enjoys watching other people's home movies for that long, and frankly home movies tend to capture the highlights of life while Boyhood continues to capture the lowlights or even the mundane moments of life. I think the problem I had is just that this was indeed adventurous film-making, but Linklater didn't utilize it to do something interesting with the story. It's just the story of a kid's crappy childhood, and I've already experienced childhood once, I don't need to trudge through his. I swear this is just a gimmick to get all the critics worked up in a frenzy of praise for one of their beloved directors, so they can shower him with awards.\n\nOne of the things you must consider, when you start making a film like Boyhood, is that you're basically going all-in on a big bet. You are banking that these kids are going to grow up to be decent actors. Sadly they bet on the wrong horse. Ellar Coltrane's line delivery is wooden and awkward as a kid, and then it is mumbled and incoherent as a teenager. Nepotism didn't pay off either because Lorelei Linklater is even worse and only has one facial expression in her repertoire. Of course I can't throw all the blame on these kids, because even Ethan Hawke has moments that feel artificial. I think this is a symptom of a bad script, because some of the conversations are so odd I find myself totally taken out of the film and realizing they are acting because real people don't talk that way.\n\nOne other annoyance in Boyhood was the way it kept dropping little markers to denote the time as if to say \"This scene is really happening in 2005, see Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince being released?!\" \"This scene is in 2013, because everyone listened to that Gotye song at that time.\" It just felt so forced. Now I must admit that, when I hear lots of gushing praise heaped on a film I don't particularly care for, I tend to over-compensate by absolutely ripping it apart in my own review. However, if I'm perfectly honest, there were moments that I was entertained by Boyhood. It was lovingly shot, and has a nice timeless visual quality. Also there were moments where I looked back in my head and thought \"it's crazy this is that same little boy I was watching 2 hours ago.\" That doesn't really mean I liked the overall experience, though. It still was exceedingly bland and overly long. It's going to be hard to watch this one win the Oscar, but I'll totally understand why it happened.",

            "content": "So I just saw Boyhood and it was kind of stupid.  I wouldn't really recommend it.  Like I get why this movie has so much hype around it.  Conceptually the movie was daring and interesting; not many filmmakers would attempt to film a movie for over the coarse of a decade.  They were definitely things you can appreciate about that decision you couldn't in other films.  However the mere concept of Boyhood does nothing to show it's quality.  What's more important how well they executed that idea.  Unfortunately for Boyhood it's ambitions was not enough to excuse it's shortcomings.  \n  First I want to give credit where credit is due.  I was for the most part on board with the movie when Mason was still a little kid.  Despite the story lacking flow that was kind of the point.  Things kind of just happen when you're younger and we see that through Mason's perspective.  They even go so far as to not reveal Mason's Mom or Dad's name.  It was also pretty clever to show relevant events or even product placements to show what year it was without ever explicitly mentioning it.  I also loved the scene towards the end with Mason and his mom.  Even though that scene is pretty clich\u00e9 considering the stylistic choice to film the movie it felt well earned.  I wouldn't be surprised if Patricia Arquette was feeling the same emotions her character was which made her performance that more convincing.\n  Speaking of other performances, Ethan Hawke was also pretty good.  The daughter Samantha was pretty awful.  There's no sugar coating it, am I supposed to be nice since she's Richard Linklater's kid?  Is anyone going to defend her when the entire point of the fucking movie is to feel as natural as possible?  Ok sure, I guess I can give her some slack because of the choice to film this over 12 years.  Then how am I supposed to excuse characters who have literally show up for but a brief moment and can't act for shit.  That basketball man's delivery was so hollow it was laughable bad.  Let's not forgot that Mexican worker with the worst accent ever!  Apparently the movie that's supposed to be this natural experience still has clich\u00e9 bullies from the 80's.  \n  Sorry Drunk professor dad, you were not convincing as an intimidating drunk.  His body language and tone of voice never felt natural for his supposed intoxicated state.  Does anyone else not see how ridiculous it was to have him shout \"I hate squash!\" right after his meltdown at the table?  Apparently all it takes for a newly wed dad to have drama with Mason is to be drunk.  Now don't get me wrong, alcoholism is a seriously issue that you can tackle in film but when it's a consistent characteristic in what only happens to leads to a divorce with both of them then it's clear that it serves as a pathetic excuse as a plot device.  Yup, just add beer.  Instant drama.\n  The music is some of the most overbearing I've heard in some time.  Does anyone not see how stupid cheesy it is to have that guitar rift happening while Mason he's tagging graffiti?  Like wow this kid is so hardcore.  Also I get why you wanted to play popular song from different parts of the time but did it have to be over the soundtrack and not within the universe?  I don't see how Crank that Soulja boy being played over them riding their bikes has any purpose.  It's not the only time a song is played outside of the universe so why the inconsistent use of in-universe songs and soundtrack for the film?  \n  The biggest issue though I had with the film would have to be Mason when he turns into a teenager.  He turns into an unlikable douche hipster sprouting preachy pretentious lines.  Stop whining about not getting your Dad's car you little brat.  I'm fine with having a movie more centered on the characters than the story.  I'm fine with movies that are slow paced.  But when you're main character is not only uninteresting and unlikable with about an hour and a half of screen time left with the last 30 minutes being filler then I don't know how I'm not supposed to be bored.  Seriously the movie could have ended when he graduated.  The point has been made that he's going into adulthood but it's cool you wanted to beat it into me for a superfluous ending.\n  You know there's another movie in 2014 that aimed for an unfeasible scale in film making.  It's called Birdman and the difference is they actually pulled off their goal.  Everything in Birdman had purpose and was masterfully delivered.  Again I want to stress that what's important is the execution not the concept.  I understand that not everyone might be bothered by the same things I so excuse me for judging a movie for the high standards it wants to be judged on.  So if you enjoy Boyhood good for you.  You're not wrong for liking it.  But my reasons for disliking the movie aren't wrong either.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  Is it as exceptional as everyone is making it out to be?  No.  6/10",

The film is about a little boy, growing up experiencing adolescence and everything comes along with it. Yes we see that a lot of times before but this movie has something unique that no other family movie manage to make me feel like this. What makes this film incredibly special is the filmmaking technique. The filming began in the summer of 2002 with the young main character and filmed yearly all the way until last year with the same actors. So boyhood took 12 years to be done and we actually get to see through the eyes of  Mason who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips, family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all that moments make me think my own childhood journey and i believe it's impossible to watch Mason and his family without thinking about your family about your journey. I mean the massage of the film really hits you. While i was watching this film i was thinking abou the performances of the actors. They were outstanding. These performances do not feel like performances, they feel very much just in the moment, the dialogue doesn't feel like a movie dialogue, it just feel like people are talking. The real drama of this film comes from just how real it feels and the message behind it is just a series of milestones and once you hit them you are just on the next one. I'm sure that a lot of people are going to come out and say this movie isn't really that special and if it wasn't made over the course in 12 years well then it would be just some boring movie when nothing happens. I can understand that because nothing actually happened, it's a lot of really really interesting conversations between the actors and very very cool filmmaking techniques. Okay it's not that type of movie you are going to see again because is a very long movie, about 2 hours and 45 minutes and it's not the kind of movie that you poppin at a party and say hey guys we 're gonna watch this movie because is just not that type of film. Overall boyhood is a very very different and unique movie and i can't even imagine the idea of physically filming a movie for 12 years, that's crazy, definitely should be seen. So i'm gonna give boyhood 4 stars and if you guys saw this movie what did you think about it?",

            "content": "I saw BOYHOOD! Along with being the single most conceptually complex movie ever made, it's possibly the most interesting and uninteresting movie that I've ever reviewed. I'll unpack that box in a minute but first let me give you the rundown of what it's about. The movie follows a young boy named Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, as he literally grows from a boy to a man and chronicles all the loves, losses, joys and disappointments of growing up in Texas along with his mother, father and sister played by Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and the director's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater.\n\nThe film is the brainchild of director Richard Linklater and literally took 12 years to make as it weaves through the early 2000s until present day. From a conceptual standpoint alone I should be giving this movie 10 stars. The style is consistent across the years, well shot and the actors grow up and grow old before your very eyes... that is except for Ethan Hawke who is apparently some sort of immortal daywalker vampire. Needless to say, this is a true achievement in film from a technical standpoint. From a story standpoint, it's a little different. The story in the film has this feeling like it was written on the fly, without any real direction as to where it was going or what it was building towards any kind of earth shattering event but here's the thing, there comes a point where the movie knows you're realizing that fact and it even addresses it but asks you to hold on just a little longer. By the end of the show, the message the film has plays a lot like real life, not every story is glamorous and dramatic, real life is what it is and a lot of times it's not super eventful but when you look back over everything, you truly saw a boy grow into a man and experience the kind of joy, disappointment, loss, and love that we all do and it was done in a real life kind of way.\n\nOverall, I really liked this movie and despite the fact that a lot of the acting by the kids was less than stellar, and the plot seemed to meander a bit over it's nearly 3 hour run time, the end product was such an achievement that I really can't knock off any points for any mistakes in pacing because at the end of the day, I got where I needed to be and honestly It just couldn't have been done better! Plus, the movie was shot in Houston, Austin and San Marcos, three cities I call home. Taking all into consideration, I simply CAN'T give this movie any less than a perfect 5...out of 5.",

I'm obviously in the minority on this one. I think people are giving it a free pass because of the 12 year concept which is interesting and, for the cast, daunting.  But I'll take substance over a gimmick any day. The ending was abrupt but welcomed. The story lines never settled in and the most interesting aspects were the nuggets of things from the past.

Overall, the film is well acted and the characters are at least somewhat interesting. Ethan Hawke turns in the best performance of the film and newcomer Ellar Coltrane improves drastically as the film progresses. At times, \"Boyhood\" starts to head down a very entertaining path and you can briefly (albeit very briefly) see why it was nominated for Best Picture.\n\nThe Bad: But then, once it heads down that path, it does an about face. Time suddenly passes in the film and the previous storyline is an afterthought. At 2:45 the film is also extremely long and it feels it. There are far too many gaps where nothing happens and you feel like you're just watching the life of a regular every day family. Maybe that is the point, but it doesn't make for a very compelling film. Slow moving and with a highly unsatisfactory ending, \"Boyhood\" might be among the most overrated films of all time.",

Looks like the child actors lost interest and acting abilities somewhere between 2008 and 2014. What the director was trying to achieve by making this movie over so many years is unclear. Guess he lost the plot too. One should instead watch \"This Boy's Life\" starring Di Caprio and De Niro. Or better watch a few episodes of \"The Wonder Years\". Boyhood is yaaaaawwwn!",

Now.... for the film as a whole, and I feel that this will seem pretty controversial considering the awards it is winning and the reviews it got. If you take away the wow factor of how it was filmed, then the film felt a little lack lustre, it plodded on with what seemed to be very few huge events taking place. OK, there were big milestones for this family, like there is in real life (college etc), but I was expecting something unexpected, and I didn't get it... The acting seemed very natural, which I guess working together over such an extended period of time means they gelled in a very unique way. But I think for me, it relied to heavily on the concept, and not enough on the material to keep the audience gripped. It certainly deserves recognition for the dedication and approach to filming, but I was left a little disappointed by the whole thing, which I am a little gutted about to be honest.",

Even the mother's mid life crisis later on kind of validated that point and in the end, we all still have many questions unanswered about why we are living.  This movie mostly reminded me of my half brother that didn't have a father like myself, he grew up lost with no particular goal but trying to figure what life is about, in the end only realizing that exploration may be the only truth.  But unlike him, my generation had our version of woodstock 69, but he didn't.

Similarly, I want to like Patricia Arquette. She seems like a genuinely sweet person amidst that cliche sea of sociopathy that is Hollywood actors. For the sake of journalistic integrity (or perhaps in my case just plain old brutal honesty), I can only liken Arquette's performance (with her wooden demeanor and nasal delivery) to a marionette with a cold. Still, I like her. She remains likable. Oscar worthy is the descriptive statement at which I draw the line. In stark contrast is Ethan Hawke. Not personally burdened with the obligation to like him, I can say with integrity in tact that this is Hawke's best performance (at least that I have personally witnessed). That and the well-deserved proverbial applause for a 12 year filming process is about all I can positively say about Boyhood. In a time where originality and ingenuity are scarce in the mainstream arena of film, one cannot simply dismiss Richard Linklater's unique artistic process. Unfortunately this process was, for me, overshadowed by a stilted script (and/or lazy editing), sloppy directing and subpar acting, save for Hawke. What could have been immensely compelling simply fell flat. The subject matter was there: a normal, lower middle class boy traverses his formative years amidst an absent father, a mother struggling in all aspects of motherhood, step-families, abuse, etc. etc. But to watch it unfold was akin to watching a highly trained dancer miss one critical step and proceed to stumble through what would have been a beautiful and unique dance routine. Still, this review is not an attempt to dissuade the reader from watching Boyhood (as much as it may seem like that's precisely what it is). There was a point in the film, however short-lived, that I found myself commiserating with the \"Boy\". In that brief moment I connected with what (I assume) Linklater was attempting to do with this film. I related to it. And I felt something. I can only hope (for Linklater's sake, for the viewer's sake and for the sake of the integrity of the Academy) that more people will walk away feeling a connection with the characters/story than will be distracted by the convoluted dialogue and choppy storytelling. Unfortunately that just wasn't the case for me.",

While the movie deserves all the praise it has been receiving for the performances, the story features nothing that has not been done a thousand times before, just on a more grand scale. This is not to say that it is a bad film, it is quite good actually, it just doesn't do anything remarkable besides its 12 year shooting schedule. It seemed more interested in throwing out cultural references, than with developing a thorough study of the lives of the characters. The film seemed to have a very cynical view of relationships, which for me, was quite off-putting. If it weren't for the three hour run time, I would recommend it to everyone, but as it stands, I think that the other best picture candidates such as Birdman and Whiplash stand as much better films. 3.5 stars out of 5.",

It's not superbly directed, the acting is at times laughable and just bad. The storyline was not compelling nor for the most part interesting. Actually for a coming of age story it is one of the worst I have seen. \nIt's just a bleak, depressing view on a boys life. And a boring kid for that matter. He has next to no screen chemistry and walks around like lame duck most of the movie. \nThe most interesting scenes take place when the boy and his sister are small children and then it's just a downward mess for the remainder of the film. Ethan Hawk does whatever he can to salvage it, and the scene near the end where he talks to his son about ambition and time passing and life's meaning was well acted by hawk. But he couldn't save this film. \nClassic? Not even close. Good? No not really. It's not bad but mundane, simple, ill- cunstructed, poorly laid out, akward, pestimictic and for the most part lame. It really is pointless and seemed like a huge waste of time watching. \nGus Van Saint has portrayed realism In a much more convincing way and simply better.

Thought it might be gimmicky, and I actually thought it would be more documentary-like. In a time where I often nod off while watching tv, I never yawned and I got emotionally invested in this. That the final line of the movie seemed to basically match my synopsis of a movie that lasts nearly three hours tells me I think I got it.\n\nYes, there is some bad acting. A lot of the secondary characters are pretty weak...like the high school kids when the boys camp out. Real lame. But scenes like that still stand because we've all been there...someone probably older than us challenging our manhood and we maybe lie or stretch the truth to defend it. \n\nThat's the brilliance of this film. It takes a series of moments...in the \"life\" of this kid, some fairly dramatic ones, and maybe just reminds us that every moment is important. When you're growing up, or even now, it's easy to forget that. Or not see the importance. But we all have them, little regrets we may not even know we regret. First loves, school, shitty first jobs, relationships, trying to find yourself, trying to fit in, dealing with parents and independence. The difference in this movie is you see the \"real\" deal as a single actor progresses from being a little boy to a college freshman. \n\nSo yeah, you can pick out this and that and call it a flaw in the movie. At nearly three hours, that's pretty easy to do. But as a whole, the movie is very effective. Even though this kid is not necessarily identifiable to me, he kind of is. Frankly, given that he's a little out there, I wonder how many people relate to him. Because I think that was also brilliant...take a non-mainstream character and make him the one we relate to. On the whole, it was neat to watch these characters age in real time and try to figure out life. Just like we all do every day. That no one ever figured out to make a movie like this until 12 years ago...that's another mystery.",

Its intimate for sure, and (for the most part) admirably avoids melodrama in favour of semi-awkward musing and reflection. It doesn't have any easy ending or necessary high points, but then again neither does life. It just follows a particular random trajectory from which a formless child becomes an ill-defined man. The path is made general enough that nearly any relatively-privileged person will be able to identify with most of the film, which leaves the titular boy feeling a bit like a blank slate up until the final act. As if the growing actors wasn't enough, Boyhood uses cultural reference points perhaps a bit too much to purposely date itself; there's a fantastic Harry Potter scene, but the soundtrack sounds like it was cribbed from American Pie for half the film. But perhaps more deftly than anything else, Boyhood is a portrait of parenthood, with both parents having distinct roles that refuse to be pigeonholed into stereotypical descriptives (some side characters don't escape this). \n\nDoesn't matter. Words are stupid. Boyhood didn't change my world or my perception of what film can be, but the experiment was certainly successful.",

Richard Linklater is superb in his direction telling a coherent 12 year story in merely 2 hours and 45 minutes. His has captured life in such an abstract way that it seems straight forward. The film looks great as I could not tell that it took 12 years to make. The acting is great all around with Patricia Arquette providing the emotional anchor throughout the film. Ethan Hawke is also fantastic in the film. Ellar Coltrane, who plays Mason, was very good as well.\nThe screenplay for the most part is very good however it is where I start to have my problems. When we get to teenage Mason his character is kind of dull. Towards the end of the movie I felt it was getting lost and did not know how to conclude.

This may sound like a typical coming of age story, but what makes Boyhood so unique is the fact it was filmed over 12 years with the exact same cast, so the audience can literally see Mason grow up before their eyes. Although Boyhood is a tad overrated, quite slow, and lacks any real exciting main conflict, the movie as a whole evokes a feeling of nostalgia and fondness in its audience. Boyhood's authenticity is strengthened by outstanding performances by Patricia Arquette, who plays Mason's hardworking single mother, and Ethan Hawke, who plays Mason's carefree father. Unlike the many bland coming-of-age movies out there that have the tendency to be overdramatic and shallow, Boyhood is a simple and intimate look on life's precious moments.

Not a whole lot happens, to be frank - you're simply peering through a window as a boy grows into a young man. Its first two hours fly by and the \"growing up\" gimmick is smartly used; but once our protagonist turns 18, the film slows right down and the final 45 minute stretch kind of drags. Still, a minor quibble for such a unique film - perhaps this would be improved with an intermission. Elegiac and hopeful in equal parts, Boyhood is a remarkable, inimitable little film and an acting masterclass. Recommended.",

            "content": "I don't think 2014 was a great year for movies, but Boyhood is arguable it's most ambitious and most profound film I've seen.  In a way, I've been trying to make my own \"Boyhood\" style films from home movies, I bet most people do, and even more so with the Internet and ease of phone cameras to film and capture every moment.  What starts from 2002 to 2013, it's amazing to see how much the story focuses, even changing based on the world around them with almost no effort.  Boyhood isn't the most interesting of movies (and it sits at 2.75h long) but for me what makes it great is the fact that these kids are basically my age.  In a way it's a viewing glass of really how different and the same life was 10 years ago.  From Dragon Ball Z to GBA SP to Harry Potter to Wii to 9/11 to Lady Gaga, Boyhood doesn't emphasize the changes in our lives, but it shows that despite the changes, we still end up falling into similar patterns of behaviour and our lives will continue on this path beyond really our own control.  Honestly, I don't get why Ethan Hawke (the actuary?) is getting more attention as Mason's father.  He's a man you see is complete garbage in 2002, but learns to be the right man and you wish that he stuck around to care for him as he grew up.  Patricia Arquette does great work too as the mom, holding everyone as best she can, despite having her own issues in life.  The more fascinating thing is guessing who everyone is in a time jump and seeing just hoe life progresses, it's not about the explosions.  It's about understanding relationships with our friends and family and that's what makes the movie pop.  I don't think there has been a Best Picture contender (and I'm betting the winner, unless politics get in the way) this ambitious in my \"boyhood\" so see this movie.  You might hate me to think it's boring, but I mean would you really want to sit through another 2.75h of superhero telling dumb jokes?",

Linklater is able to subtly create rounded characters and tells various little stories that encompass the childhood of Mason and mold him over the course of the film. What makes Boyhood a technical marvel is the fact that it was filmed over the course of 12 years. Linklater has made various films in between but the consistency in the style of his direction throughout Boyhood reveals that he is a true master of his craft. Of the microscopic flaws in the film, dialogue is sometimes one of them; and with a running-time of nearly 3 hours, the other is length. Nevertheless Boyhood is a marvelous achievement.",

The willingness for a director and cast to see it through has to be there.  I also fully appreciated the fluidity of it.

Although I saw actors age on the screen, I didn't feel like engaging character development came along for the ride.   There were statements made on a variety of topics, but instead of finding these interjections clever, I found them gratingly heavy-handed.

It takes awhile to reach it's full charm thought. That charm being - it was filmed over the course of 12 years. In a linear timeline, the story jumps from age to age, showing key events in their lives, as a family.The actors are the same, which is amazing and makes the film feel so much more genuine and real. I loved how the film featured elements from the past, which allowed the audience to not only know the years are going by in the film, and as well have a glimpse at the past, eg. The gameboy advanced and Obama election was a nice touch.  What captivated me even further was that over the course of 12 years the actors actually got to input experiences in their life into the script. Nothing really exciting happens if you think about it, but everything that does happen feels like a family unfolding before the audiences eyes as they grow up with the world as we know it. It's relatable, and we find that we can relate to little bits and pieces. Everything about this film, to the acting, writing and scripting feels natural.",

            "content": "I went to see this given the reviews it was receiving, and walked out 165 minutes later thinking the world was playing some kind of prank on me.  I quite honestly hated almost every minute of this.  I'm going to try to elaborate on why:\n\nIt's predictable - as soon as I saw Arquette's character, what ran through my mind was OK, what's the most cliched thing they could do with this?  Oh, have her marry her professor and he'll turn out to be an abussive drunk asshole.  Don't get me wrong, no-one deserves an asshole, but right there any claims of originality I had been hearing went right out the door, especially when her NEXT guy also turned out to be a bit of a jerk.  Ethan Hawke (whom, OK, I kinda loked at first) started as an easy-going pseudo-intellectual -- gee, he hasn't played THAT before :/ -- who aged and became just as boring as everyone else.  Which brings me to...\n\nNothing of consequence happens - by which I mean, what exactly does Mason learn here?  How does he change over the course of the film, besides physically?  Yeah, the first stepfather was abussive to the mother, but what of him and his sister?  He lets them go with their father even though their chores aren't finished, and tells them they'll finish when they get back -- not unreasonable, and yet it's presented that way -- and he makes Mason get a haircut -- wow, such a mean guy (that's sarcasm).  He misses curfew and the second dad chews him out mildly -- while drinking -- and Mason doesn't seem to care but nothing happens.   Near as I could tell, he's the same from what little actual character he has he doesn't -- he's the same bland person at the start as he is at the beginning, and none of his actions or inactions impacts that.  When his girlfriend dumped him and called HIM an asshole I was agreeing with her and I don't think i was supposed to.\n\nWhat's with the mixed \"drinking is bad\" signals -- our first sign that the professor is bad is he buys alcohol.  Then the second father is drinking a beer while very passively chewing out Mason.  The film seems to concentrate on the stepfathers drinking as a sign they're assholes.  Yet EVERYONE in this film drinks and yet only those two are focused on being the bad guys because of it. Why?\n\nThe side stories we don't see seem more interesting than the main one -- How and why did Hawke decided to settle down?  The landscaper who went to college at Arquette's suggestion, he seems interesting, why couldn't we follow that?  No, we're just going to watch this kid with no real personality instead?  OK...\n\nThe length -- yeah, i get that covering twelve years this would be long, but why 165 minutes?  I was completely checked out after 120 and yet it kept going.  I was getting ready to leave when Mason got into his truck and drove off to college, but then there are TWO MORE SCENES at the college.  WHY?  His boyhood was clearly over when he drove off by himself for the first time (the only symbolism that kinda clicked when it happened -- yay, one point).  There was no reason for those last two scenes -- none.  Oh, wait, I found out later that girl was the same one who gave him a note saying he liked the haircut.  That was 9-10 years before, and we had seen this girl for 30 seconds tops.  We know nothing about her or these other characters he just met.  I also can barely recognize my own younger cousins after 8 years, let alone a girl I barely saw.\n\nThe idea is not really that original -- there's a bit of risk involved here, sure, that an actor will get hurt or die in the intervening time period, but really that's kind of it.  There's nothing about growing up that isn't covered in any long running TV series, and it's actually better there because, as I mentioned previously, you get character development which Mason did not get.  Aside from that shooting schedule, there's nothing technically outstanding in the film -- the cinematography and sound is fine, the editing is fine.  I'm not saying they're bad, but they just don't stand out.\n\nSo, yes, I unappologetically hate this film.  I get that it's a slice of life type film, and that some will get it and others won't, but usually in these films I can see what others *might* connect to in the film if I don't myself like it.  Here, I honestly don't see it, and every time someone has tried to explain WHY they liked it, it ends up being one of the points I hated about it.\n\nThat this is winning the awards this season over, IMO, much more thoughful, better acted, and well put together films such as Birdman, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, and Whiplash is upsetting me in ways it really shouldn't given that these are just films.",

Take away the 12 years it took to make this film and you are left with a boring lackluster film. This movie pans the lives of these characters but does not go truly deep into who they are and what drives them. The lead actor who this film centers around does nothing but moop around throughout most of the film and it's only until the end he developed a personality though very dry. For the true star was the older sister who for me stole every scence she was in, even at a young age. Patricia Arquett and Ethan Hawks performances are good, but once again who are these people? Why did they split up? Why are they who they are? None of these questions are answerd. What's worst is her character remarrys twice and her husband become severe alcholics without giving a reason to why. Especially when we first meet theses two men they are perfectly nice guys though flawed but still no signs of the bad husband syndrome. The big sin of this film is that there is no plot nor conflict to push this film along. It takes snap shots of there lives and before it goes truly deep into anything we are propelled ahead to a few years leaving much unanswered and most of the time filling in the blanks to what happens in there live since we left them last. This film for me is that weird piece of art or performance art that only those who are pretentious and naive will get, because they don't want to miss out on the new cool thing. This was a boring snap shot of a film that just pans through the live of these people. I think your better off looking through your mothers or grandmothers old photo albums at least that experience will have a better payoff.",

The fact that the picture spanned 12 years is incredible and something that has never been done before. Another great thing is that I believe it would prove difficult to do it again. Taking on a project like this for another director would seem almost like cheating, a direct copy of Richard Linklater.\n\tLinklater brings us a coming of age drama this year that is like none other. It really is the epitome of the coming of age film as the same actors and actresses were used throughout the 12 years the film took to make. We get to peek inside the lives of an everyday family (living with divorce, visits with dad, mom remarrying a collection of drunken assholes) and watch as they progress through the years. The fact that there is no real climax adds to its exceptional artwork. The climax is the film itself. We root on the mother played by Patricia Arquette (the best supporting actress this year in my opinion) and enjoy the scenes with the father played by Ethan Hawke. What makes this film so great is the chemistry that these characters have. They make acting in this film seem so easy and carefree. I sat down watching this movie thinking are they acting or just being themselves? I think the ladder is the answer and that's what makes the film so fluent and easy to watch.\n\tIn closing, this is my pick for best picture of the year. The directing is undeniably terrific (and, again in my opinion, worthy of the Oscar), the acting is impeccable, and I didn't see a false note anywhere to quote Matthew McConaughey at last year's Academy Awards. I give this film a very easy 5 out of 5 stars. Well done.",

While it was an enjoyable experience, the strictly slice of life perspective of the film felt like a wasted opportunity for showing depth of growth of characters in a three hour long movie. The representation of the single mom versus the dead beat father was decidedly unfair and basically sexist. The father has a long extended monologue at the end of the film which all but blames the single mother for a string of abusive alcoholic husbands and absolves him of any blame re: the raising of the children. Then, directly afterwards, the mother's last scene with her son (the main character) is short and bitchy, where the film all but confirms the hypothesis of the father. This is the culmination of a narrative that gives the single father tons of time and space to explore his character, but relegates the single mom to roles and never gives her any dialogue to explain her POV. That and you'd be forgiven for believing America is as white as Sweden with only a single Latino character who exists to be saved by the mother. Worth watching once for the conceit, but not worth revisiting. (Also, the super trite ending didn't help wash down the film either either.)",

Part of that might be the script which has him talking like no teenager I've ever met.  Sure he has ideas and thoughts like a teenager, but they are spoken in a far more eloquent way than the average teenager speaks, and it kind of took me out of the movie.

The characters don't feel like actors they seem like real people. The soundtrack to this movie is great because every year you get to hear the song that was popular in that year. The acting is phenomenal and the dialogue between the characters are great also. The story to this film is just about growing up to be an adult something simple. I think if this movie was 5 hours long I would still enjoy it. In my opinion I think this is Richard Linklater's best film.

            "content": "I have 20 minutes left of this film that I will only watch so that I can say I viewed the film in its entirety. This is not something I want to do, but I guess I have to.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I don't \"hate\" the film. I don't really even dislike it. I honestly have no feeling towards it one way or the other. I feel like I've been spying on a very mundane modern, post-new millennium family.\n\nYes, it's \"neat\" seeing these people age naturally, much like I've seen everyone in my life do over the course of the years. It's nothing new in my life, and I've been doing it by watching shows in syndication as well. The only thing with real life and syndicated shows... there are actually interesting story-lines going on.\n\nRichard Linklater takes a group of actors and films them what seems like once a year for the course of 12 years. I've no idea why he didn't take the break between shots to come up with an interesting story/script. The acting was NOT very good; and at times I felt as if a friend shot this and I was merely being supportive by viewing it. Due to the concept with filming one cast, I wanted to really love it. It's a silly reason to want to love a film, \"The cast, they age for reals, no make up!!! GENIUS!!!\" Yeah, that's not a very good reason.\n\nI'm only writing this review because I hear it's up for an Oscar. I lack the mental care and energy to search, \"Under which freaking category????\" If it's best film, I guess I won't hate the nomination as much as I hated the over dramatic, over hyped, over inflated, false sense of social issue, Hollywood lame attempt at a \"deep\" film; Crash.\n\nThe film starts out with a boy day dreaming and he gets in trouble at school. According to his mother; who is really disinterested in the ordeal, he tormented the teacher. Okay, so he goes from spacing off which apparently they treat as the worse offense, then the secondary offense is destroying school property. The boy argues with his sister and they're always at each others throats. The mom moves them to Houston to start a new life- This is where the story should pick up.\n\nThe next year she is in college and you're lead to believe she's going to have a thing with her professor. Ffwd to the next year where she's married to the professor and the boy has a bunch of new step siblings. Ffwd to the next year where the professor is abusive, and the mom with her two kids leave. Screw the step-kids. That was the highlight of the film. The ffwrds that follow are extremely boring, low key, and random. She marries another guy who turns out to be another drunk (yes, the professor was a drunk) and abusive. Then it goes to mundane restaurant conversations with the boy who's now a teen with girls that he's dating and then not dating. No mention of further altercations with him and teachers, no more day dreaming, that whole first scene was really nothing. I felt like I could have been spying on my neighbors, if they were really boring, uninteresting people. The only thing Linklater did was throw in modern fashions and technology of the year into the mix so we know that the world is advancing. Watch this for over two hours... two long hours.\n\nI still have twenty minutes left and all I can think is, \"Why am I watching an interesting little boy (for the first ten minutes) turn into a boring emo kid (that lasts over two hours)?\" The father could have been an interesting character (who has out of place liberal agenda dialogues), but then he gets married and looks like a used car salesman who has conformed to the masses, and it wasn't done in any sort of way that would appear interesting. The mom turns into a boring professor. Oh yes, I'm so anxious to see how this all turns out. :|\n\n**Update** I saw how it all turned out. The mom acted like it was good he's going off to college. Then she over dramatically cried because her life is over... Did I say over dramatic? It wasn't over dramatic, that would require acting skills. She cried like a five year old does when they're trying to get out of trouble  (I chose five because they don't know a good con cry yet). Then he drives awkwardly and stiffly. He goes to college and immediately goes on a hike with his new roommate and two girls where we watch him stiffly walk and then stiffly deliver an awkward conversation where he has no idea where to look or how to \"act\".\n\nI guess Linklater didn't want to waste time on actually giving direction, and none of the actors wanted to waste time in figuring out how to actually 'act'. I'm glad the film didn't run much longer, otherwise I might go from indifference to actual hatred. After viewing the entirety of the film, it really could replace 'Crash' as the movie to loathe.",

I had high expectations that this movie would jump out as a groundbreaking way to document a child's growth into adolescence. I was looking forward to content that I could relate to - to relive my own childhood through the eyes of little Mason and find something universal in our shared experience that speaks to my heart. But there was nothing there to relate to! With the slight exception of the relationship Mason had with his dad, the other relationships in this film are incredibly under developed. If this is an accurate portrayal of this boy's childhood then I feel so bad that he missed out on so much. There is no chemistry, no attraction, no love, no loss, no anything. And the defining moments of boyhood that Rich Linklater chose to put in the film were mere glimpses of what they (seemingly) should have. SPOILER: A potentially passionate speech of encouragement from Mason's photography teacher is boiled down to one scene in a dark room where Mason mumbles out loud about his work ethic. Mason's love life with his girlfriend amounts to several emotionless scenes of conversation about philosophy... and one moment when they got caught under the covers in his sister's roommate's bed to which Mason mutters in his quiet voice... \"so awkwaaaard\" *cut scene* That was a defining moment of boyhood? Experimentation with alcohol and drugs: scene drinking beers with \"the seniors\" kicking through wooden boards. That was it? It's difficult to believe Mason's mother loved him given the lack of chemistry between the two (although maybe this was done on purpose?) and the sister's interaction with Mason is almost non existent especially as he enters high school. The movie just passed, one scene after another, without any development of anything. I can't understand all the high ratings unless Mason's boyhood is a reflection of Linklater's - Devoid of sports, friendships with other neighborhood boys, a longing attraction with multiple women, and maternal relationship where his mother outwardly shows her care and love, and is instead replaced by distant family members and a dry sense of cynicism that leads him to an interest in art and philosophical mumbling - which it probably is. Unfortunately I can see a lot of the other film critics \"relating\" to this life too.",

The nature of the way they shot this (1 week a year for the past 12 years) really made it interesting to see the kids grow up as the movie progressed, though since they cover so much time, it almost felt disjointed at times, because storylines are abruptly resolved and/or dropped at a moment's notice.  It's not the worst thing in the world, I just think it made me realize how I like a fully contained story and not an open-ended story.  It works sometimes (like the ending of 'Inception'), but in this case, I really wanted to know how things ended up with all the characters stories, though, as my wife points out. that would make for a very long movie unless they made it a montage.

I seriously wonder if this movie would get the kind of attention and awards-buzz it has been getting if nobody knew about the unique shooting schedule. Without that, Boyhood is a long, largely uneventful, wholly unoriginal coming of age story, spiced up with some cliches about adolescence and poor acting from its younger cast members. Definitely not one of the movies that really resonated with me this awards season, though, judging by the glowing reviews from practically everyone else who has seen it, I fear it will take home the gold over other and (in my opinion) better movies.",

In fact, there really are very few momentous dramatic scenes here, although I was always ready to welcome one.  After all, this isn't documentary film-making, but a 12-year character study where we enjoy the unique privilege of seeing performances actually filmed over the years.  Linklater merely glosses over key phases of lead character Mason's child and teen years and keeps everything rather sanitized. We rarely see Mason behind closed doors and instead accompany him in frequent family car trips, restaurant work, hanging with friends, and very unwild parties. The only character expressing natural angst is Mason's mother Olivia portrayed deftly but not Oscar-worthy by Patricia Arquette and that's really only in two particularly notable scenes. Ethan Hawke is a welcome energetic ingredient whenever he appears which isn't often enough. Unless another filmmaker can incorporate all the important cinematic story  elements in a time narrative shot in actual time over years, this effort may not merit repeating.",

She doesn't seem to give a flying crap about the happiness of her children. It's all about what she wants at any given point of her life. I mean, jesus, she abandons her 2 step children that her own kids have bonded with to an abusive drunk without ever looking back once!\n\nEthan Hawke was a good dad. He actually talked to his kids and seemed to care about their well being. You don't get to see why he left, but I got the impression that he was driven away by the psychotic mother.\n\nIt's a film that you think about afterwards, but for me I just seem to get more irritated about the characters the more I think,",

Long, self-indulgent, low stakes, meandering tomes, tripping over the barren landscape of anti-establishment views.  Hours and hours and hours of them.  They're as common as cat hairballs.  \n\nSo when a movie comes along like Boyhood that has mainstream exposure and an underdog indie feel, suddenly every hipster who's been weaned on Transformers and Captain America is just gaga over the slow-paced anti-establishment setting in Boyhood.  Underneath the crunchy coating of the age progression device, and the intentionally deadly lack of pacing, there's nothing here.  And by nothing, I mean nothing.  No stakes, no emotion, no strong character, no gorgeous stage pictures, no action.\n\nThe device of age progression is a gimmick, and could have made this film profound.  But instead, we're met with a lead character who lacks ambition, and lacks any solid point of view that spurs him to action or self discovery or inner battle. The character has no special language, no unique diction.  His vocabulary is that of a hamburger.   It's like watching paint dry-- a paint that doesn't care if it dries or not.  And who wants to pay 16 bucks to see that?\n\nWhen the acting is wooden and self-conscious, it's lifeless and without emotion.  Hours of it.  Hours and hours and hours of just sitting around watching a kid make observations about the world.  That's not film.  Film is the culled essence of human drama.  If you want to see real time age progression, look up a live cemetery cam.\n\nThe first lesson in student film-making is stakes.  The stakes have to be high, or else why are we watching this art rather than experiencing our own lives? What is special about our watching this film that is a profoundly universal experience?  Age progression?  And why does that have to take two and a half hours?\n\nA confused, plodding, drama-free student film at best.  Avoid.",

The plotline can be summed up in the popular phrase and becomes this simple thesis of: \"Remember the small things in life, they are, in fact, the big things.\" There are a couple moments in this film where people are driving, especially where Mason took a short glance at an iPhone screen that I started to clutch at a little. Like, \"Oh my gosh is he gonna have an accident? Is he gonna veer off the road?\" But this isn't a car-crash movie. Nothing necessarily \"big\" ever happens in this movie. In the 3 hour-running time. Nothing convulsive or earth-shattering. Yet I related to almost everything that happened in this movie because I either knew Mason or I was Mason. Because it's about real life and it feels like real life. You are experiencing the growth and formation of this kid from a firsthand account. We see the day-to-day crises and annoyances and even the dynamics of self-discovery and satisfaction. We see his family continually having bolts break loose, boards pried off, and ultimately fail to keep the structure from collapsing, which, my gosh, was so well-directed, especially the 2nd husband sequence. We see Mason and are fascinated by the fast-flow of him taking his first slice of life from the pan and him struggling to forge ahead in this world and settle into a groove. We see the sands of time trickling through the hourglass. Also the dangling plot threads were brilliant. Showing how some things in life don't get resolutions, and how loose ends don't always get tied up. It's a stomach-hollowing soul-stirring heartwarming narrative. This earns a spot in my pantheon of films. Amazing piece of artwork and amazing that it was able to be pulled off and pulled together. The making and composition of this film is to worthy of all praise. The rock-solid casting, the cut and dry editing, the overall production value. All the stars aligned literally and this holy trinity of actors, Coltrain, Hawke, and Arquette, really springs the movie to life as it really were.",

Honestly it's a hard film to sort out my opinion toward, much of what resonated about it with me came from personal familiarity with the period the story depicts growing up in. There were some hints at broader questions of patenting styles impacting children, and gender socialization. I found the boy at the center of the story fairly unlikeable, not sure if it's something I'd count against the film, perhaps I saw some of my worst tendencies at those ages taken further in him. I absolutely despised the soundtrack, but maybe it fit with that part of America? Some of the characters' overt philosophizing felt shallow and pompous, but in a way might play as how some would approach life in their own way. The use of the same actors over the decade of filming could play as a needless gimmick, I found it weirdly effective at creating a sense of the characters at the mercy of time.",

Following a young boy's life as he endures streams of advice from adults and the gentle annoyance of his sister, the movie serves us relatable situations at every turn.  Even something as mundane as putting mustard on a hot dog takes on deeper meaning in Linklater's capable hands.  He elicits natural, deeply affecting performances from his actors (Patricia Arquette alone should win awards for aging gracefully). It's often said that Linklater films aren't about anything, but I left with the sense that I'd seen something transcendent; a film not about any one thing, but about all the things we've experienced as we transition to adulthood, and how rooted in love and loss that journey can be, on our way to boundless opportunity.",

            "content": "What went into this film is astounding. 12 years following and filming the same actors, by one of my favorite directors, Richard Linklater. The movie's length does make it feel like a life being lived, even if sometimes it seems like Mason, the lead character, is growing up a little too fast. But that's probably what his parents are seeing: their little boy going from age 6 to 18 in seemingly under 3 hours. It's a good way of showing the passing of time. The soundtrack is incredible, featuring songs from Coldplay, Wilco, Arcade Fire, The Black Keys, The Flaming Lips, and more. Linklater uses these songs to let you know what year it is in the movie, which I thought was really clever. The film is beautifully shot, and there's nostalgia everywhere, like that little digital 20 Questions game, and the brother and sister peeking out to watch their parents fight (who hasn't done that as a kid?). Like most Linklater movies, the plot is pretty simple. It's just this family, living their lives, Mason and his sister growing up, their mother going through husband after husband, Mason and his sister visiting their father on weekends, etc. Because of this, it may underwhelm you with the amazing reviews it has been getting. And I must admit, when it ended, I said, \"That's it?\" But honestly, this film is an experience like that. It's just lives being lived, and for that, I commend it. I also commend it for all the work and love put into it. There truly has never been a film out there like this one, even though I feel like the concept behind it is more interesting than the execution. Overall, I definitely recommend it because you'll get a great soundtrack, good characters, some conflict, and some nostalgia. Just don't expect it to blow you away.",

The film never tells you what the current year is in the story so you have to judge based on the families appearance and what is going on. Even though no one spelled it out for me, based on the way the boy looked I could tell when a year had passed. It 's so funny that I was sucked into this film because there really wasn't an overall plot. It is just about life. Normal human actions and reactions. That is it. I loved the story and the way it progressed until the last 20 minutes but then it started to drag. That says a lot for this movie because it is almost 3 hours long and I never felt the time till the last 20 minutes. The acting in the film isn't amazing by any standards but that didn't matter. I applaud Richard Linklater (director) on his ability and perseverance to film this over 12 years.

            "content": "I take a big gulp as I move up the staircase to a large platform. A bead of sweat descends from my forehead. With a dry mouth I attempt to speak. The crowd finally quieten to a deadly silence. I'm being stared at by piercing eyes.\n\nFinally a noise...\n\n\"I didn't like Boyhood\", I croak. \n\nAn audible intake of breath emanates from the throng. Then a pause as I stare at the open mouthed pack.\n\nThere. I said it.\n\nI'm not taking this solitary position lightly. It's not an intentional contrarian view. Going against the grain for the sake of exposure. I genuinely did not enjoy Linklater's much lauded latest release and I'll tell you why.\n\nI'm sure you know the story by now. The film follows the childhood of one particular American boy called Mason and although fictional, the director spaced out his shooting so that the film actually spans 12 years of the actor's life and subsequently we see him physically changing and growing on screen from sequence to sequence.\n\nFrom the opening spiralling shot of a young boy on grass to the final teenager at college, Linklater follows the whole family - Mason himself (played by Ellar Coltrane), his sister Olivia Patricia (the director's daughter Lorelei Linklater) and the estranged parents Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke - all of whom grow old along with the protagonist. And that's essentially it.\n\n\"Boyhood began filming without a completed script\". That fact alone tells you everything about this film. As Mason grew up, my interest faded as the film slowly descending into an absolute entertainment vacuum. The conflict and clashing needed to build the tension that is so crucial to drama was absent and without it, the film is just a documentary. And what a boring one at that.\n\nI began to ask myself why there was so much absent - the adventure, the unknown, friends (where the fuck are those important relationships made during these years?), excitement, laughter, games and most important fun - before adult foibles become an inevitable necessity.  We end up just looking at the life of a child almost through an adult prism - all the seriousness of it and that alone.\n\nAs Mason grows, the child actor slowly becomes a new Hayden Christensen - a charisma void of a lead and too much of \"I did this thing the other day\" telling rather than showing the audience what has happened in his life. Like George Lucas, who simply placed people in rooms to talk about (the more exciting) things they had done, Linklater mismanages the balancing act of visuals, narrative, construction, plot and drama. For me, it's all construction here which takes you from the film completely. I found myself thinking I wonder if they kept the car all these years between takes. If I was worrying about that then I feel that the moviemaker had not captivated this audience member at all.\n\nI'm not heartless but sadly felt no emotional connection with the characters (the sister is clearly the character we should be following) and although it is a controversial position, I suppose there was always going to be one great film I was going to stand in contrast with.\n\nFrom  Russell Maloney (New Yorker) who said The Wizard of Oz was \"a stinkeroo\", to Pauline Kael's (Harper's) scathing attack on The Graduate: \"Mike Nichols' 'gift' is that be lets the audience direct him; this is demagoguery in the arts,\" there are lauded movies that will always not connect for one reason or another with critics. Infamous contrarian Armond White said that Spike Lee's Malcolm X had \"no formal innovations or controversial content....Let the mourning begin\" and I guess this film was not the one for me.\n\nAside from the unique conceit of being filmed over 12 years, I really got the sense that there's not much here. I'd argue if this film was simply recast at ages 8, 12 and 16 I doubt I would have given the whole thing a second glance and not have noticed much of a difference too.\n\nA bold and daring experiment but so is the documentary \"7 Up\" which has followed people every 7 years for over 50 years and whose protagonists, again, have much more interesting lives.\n\nAnd nostalgia? The film presents precisely the opposite. No warmly (and maybe falsely) remembered childhood events. Almost no events at all. Linklater removes the nostalgia factor but also removes anything memorable at all. Did Mason have any part of his life worth remembering? Looking back on my own boyhood, I had a \"regular\" upbringing but I don't recall it being anything like this. I know the eras are different but for a film about time I felt that the characters barely moved on at all in their lives and it certainly wasn't fun in the sense I know the word. 12 years worth of footage and this was the most interesting cut they could put together?\n\nIf I was this kid I'd be as depressed as he is towards the end. His life is dull. Duller than most peoples' actual lives. And that's the problem. Turn it off and go and spend some time with your kids. Or with your family. Or with someone else's kids. \n\nMaybe I'll be accused of missing the subtleness. This is a gentler affair with an unobtrusive camera they'll say. Far from subtle, these shots of technology are heavy handed (we can already see the passing of time on the casts faces) so every shot of different technology wasn't needed. It should have been background. In addition, I'm not against Linklater or his experiments either. The rotoscoping in the strange sci-fi A Scanner Darkly is a brilliantly weird interpretation of the Phillip K Dick novella whilst his \"Before...\" series is a stunning look at relationships over time as well as trying his hand at commercial comedies (\"School of Rock\") and interesting adaptations (\"Fast Food Nation\") which all show his vast array of talents.\n\nBut this didn't work for me. It was just so mind-numbingly dull. They say some films reflect what you yourself bring to it. I brought an exciting childhood with me and left with the memory of a dreary and tedious one. I enjoyed my boyhood, I didn't enjoy this.\n\n6/10\n\nMidlands Movies Mike",

It reminds me of a more grounded The Tree of Life. Linklater turned out to be so lucky in casting Ellar Coltrane, he grows up before our eyes, and in his growing up reveals at the very least a competent actor and not a disaster this movie could have been. Ethan Hawke gives a very natural performance as well, but it's Patricia Arquette and her character that really gets to take hold of the film here. Her, Hawke, and Coltran all feel remarkably like real people; the dialogue flows so well you'd think most of it was improved conversations (apparently the vast majority was scripted). Also, the editing is seamless, really well done. Some really wonderful and memorable moments/scenes within as well. I hope Boyhood helps to cement Linklater's reputation as one of America's best directors.",

It's an interesting film, but it's incredibly long (exactly as long as Transformers 4) and it definitely drags a good deal. It's worth at least one watch if you're curious, and it's crazy to look at this kid at the end of the film and think that it's been the same actor since second one (we literally watch him grow up, pretty crazy).

Never before have we been able to follow the lives of a small cast of characters like this.  Yet somehow... this feels like a been there and done that affair. There's no question that these people feel lived in, but they're also mostly conventional cutouts. The single mom who struggles with the drunk and abusive husbands, the siblings who are forced to deal with the multiple changes of scenery, and the father who can't fess up to his shortcomings. Don't get me wrong, these actors are good here (and quite convincing), but there's nothing in the writing that makes them stand out as unique individuals. I can relate to a lot of what Mason (Ellar Coltrane) goes through, and I have a hunch that most of us can. The story is a familiar one, albeit expanded upon, and it forgoes inventiveness for plain old cliche. Conveniently, the moment Mason arrives at college- he is immediately thrust into eating acid laced candies and meeting the girl of his dreams.. or at least the girl of the semester. Boyhood is a nifty achievement, I only wish that the characters had more interesting lives.",

Filmed a couple days a year over the course of 12 years, Boyhood both molds together the years with seamless flow and scripts the story so deeply that the \"ordinary\" content sucks you completely into the story. The content is such that the harder you concentrate and the deeper you dig, the more ability you release from the film, which in turn allows you to get more from yourself.

The movie had realistic thematic materials from Masons mother and her kids moving frequently as she goes back to school and locating a job. Evantually, Olivia gets remarried to her former professor as the two blend their families together. Olivias husband falls back to his alcoholism and abusiveness. All these situations are realistic enough that some are able to relate or notice people in these life situations. The movie follows Mason from his childhood to his adolescence. These transitions all have that nostalgic feel. The best thing about the movie is Richard Linklater kept the same casts. Yes, we see Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Lorelei Linklater, and Ethan Hawke all age through the years.

The concept of watching this kid and his family literally grow up before our eyes has truly captivated myself and others who have had the privilege of watching this film. The acting talent of Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke is unparalleled. Playing the divorced mother and father of Mason and his sister, Samantha, (played by newcomer Lorelei Linklater), Patricia and Ethan played their roles so well, I was convinced that these were their children, and that they were a divorced couple in real life. From losing and gaining jobs, to new girlfriends and getting remarried, they both perform with an effortless drive. This film draws the line between a fictional drama and reality. Almost every family in America has endured at least one moment that this movie projects. This film is nothing short of a masterpiece; it reminds us all of the times of growing up.

On one level - an experimental level - BOYHOOD is a fascinating film well worth experiencing... but on any other objective level, it is (at best) a mediocre examination of a family over a period of twelve years.  The script is (particularly in the second act) filled with the kind of navel gazing philosophizing that gets really grating really fast, and we're unfortunately saddled with a lead character (well, kinda; the movie's really more about the kid's parents, even if he's the centerpiece of it all) who grows to become the kind of pretentious, aimless, thinks-he's-cool-and-bucking-the-system, smug, drug-using teen jerk that I couldn't stand even when I was that age myself.  Now that's obviously me bringing my own baggage to the film, which I guess is partly unfair, but it's not helped by young Ellar Coltrane's performance; he actually becomes a worse actor as he gets older, which is kind of amazing, though some of that might be because the character himself gets more and more cipher-like and unlikable.  Indeed, I started the movie indifferent to the kid, and by the end I actively disliked him in a major way; I'd wager that's not the trajectory Linklater was intending an audience member would take away from the the film (if, on the very off-chance it was, then hat's off!).  Having said all that, the performances from Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are both very good (Arquette, in particular, feels like the true heart of the movie), and there are a few individual moments that actually provoke emotion (there's a semi-lengthy sequence where the movie almost transforms into THE STEPFATHER for a bit), but in the final analysis the movie IS the gimmick.  It's a great gimmick, to be sure, but it never rises above that (for me, anyway); I wasn't on the film's wavelength from the start, and I didn't connect by the end, either.",

I was actually groaning and sighing in the theater from the pain I was feeling trying to watch these actors sell their roles like children selling candy bars to me for their class fundraiser! Coltrane is a cute kid actor but once he reaches his teens, you realize that he's awful at acting. Same thing goes for his sister in the movie. The dialogue gets cheesier as time goes on and before you know it, the last scene makes you want to burn your eyes out from how bad it was. \"We don't seize the moment, the moment seizes us\"-- what a try-hard-to-sound-deep-and-intellectual line!

Now that I've seen it, I can understand why it's such. This is an excellent film. Maybe not the best picture of 2014, (from what I have seen, that'd be \"Whiplash\", followed by either \"Birdman\" or \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\") but it's still really good. No movies made me cry for a while until this. (although it was not on the part which Richard Linklater intended, as I was crying during the first act of the film when the protagonist was a child, rather than the ending) Similar to \"Lady Bird\", this is a very relatable film, detailing the struggles of a single-parented family and of a teenager's growing needs and wants. The acting is great too, particularly Patricia Arquette's, who won an Oscar for portraying the mother. However, it is a bit too long. (some of the high school sections could have been cut off, although it might be there to detail the story even further) All in all, Boyhood is a great film worthy of it's 100 Metacritic score, especially if you want to relieve your childhood and secondary school days.

These moments in film don't have to be the stand out scenes either they can be that little piece needed so the director could tie in an earlier scene or bit of dialogue. I know for myself these moments are what I love about film, I love when I can relate and replace myself with the actor or vice versa, replace the actor with myself in this reality.\nMason Jr Evans Played by Ellar Coltrane (no film history) is a six year old in 2002 he over hears his mother Olivia played by Patricia Arquette (Medium) saying she needs more space and wants to complete her study and find a professional career. Next scene Mason, Olivia and his sister Samantha played by Lorelei Linklater (daughter of the director and her first role also) are travelling to a new town in the car. The next few scenes Mason Jr and Samantha's father Mason Snr played by Ethan Hawke (Gattaca, Daybreakers) shows up and takes the kids bowling, apologising for being away for the last 18 months in Alaska. Both Mason Jr and Samantha have dreams their parents will get back together but once Olivia gets home and finds Mason Snr in her home an argument ensues and he quickly leaves without saying goodbye to the two kids, who have watched their parent disagreement from an upstairs window.... 12 years pass over the next 2 hrs and 45 minutes, in that time we get to see the kids grow, we hurt when they hurt, we love when they love and best of all it is always the same people. There is so much I can write here but I won't not in fear of giving anything away more in the hope your expectations remain level headed.\nBoyhood is more than a film, it's an experiment done right, it's a story told so well you'd be forgiven in thinking there was no script that it was all reality, that the director Richard Linklater just started following around this family, sure the family has some very familiar faces and names but still that should just tell you how good the acting and characters actually are. How good the acting, storytelling, music and cinematography actually is. Told over 12 years Boyhood is in a league of its own, a ground breaking masterpiece. Using all the same actors over 12 years it is nothing less than a masterpiece. Linklater also directed one of my all-time favourite comedies; School of rock and is now ready to direct the TV series of the same name (which I personally cannot wait to see) The idea itself has blown me away and I for one take my hat off to this genius.\nBoyhood is a very long film and in places was a little boring, sometimes thought if they just added a few more scenes to this specific timeline it would make all the difference, but then this is a film based on life and sometimes life doesn't have that climax we get from films. It's a film you can slot yourself into, exactly the way you should be able. Enjoy this for the ride it takes you on and the amazing little actors it has brought into the world of cinema.\nI totally recommend this film for everyone, don't expect anything other than life though because if you want more you may be better off turning on and watching Die Hard for the 15th time.\nBoyhood gets 4.5 out 5 BanShee Screams\n.\nThanks for reading.\nX\n?#?Boyhood?",

The cinematography and central premise itself is definitely worth a spot in motion picture history with it's 12 year story of a young boy growing up right before our eyes. Watching this picture will make any audience member relive some of their most groundbreaking moments in life through Ellar Coltrane's portrayal of protagonist, \"Mason\" and his journey from boyhood to (young) adulthood.",

            "content": "This movie starts off like a stripped down high brow indie film, a bit disjointed, lacking narrative.  But as the movie goes on and you see the characters literally grow up before your eyes and go through life situations, you grow to know these characters and really invest yourself in them.  The moments are so small, but they speak loudly about how life is not lived between moments - life is the constant moment that we all live.  There is no narrative because so much of life has no narrative.  No matter how much we plan and have expectations for how our our futures are going to turn out, life happens and our initial hopes and dreams whether juvenile or adult do not happen.  But the point (at least for me) is to love your life whatever it is - don't waste time waxing about the past or worrying overly about the future.  Your time hasn't past, and it isn't coming.  Your time is now.\n\nI have to admit, this movie really got to me, especially the last half hour.  These days I guess I've just become more sentimental :)",

Only every other actor in more than one film does that! Like all of his other films Linklater delivers a masterpiece of boring dialogue and bad acting. Waking Life was so terrible he had to disguise every frame by painting it to make it even interesting, this film unfortunately doesn't get that treatment.",
