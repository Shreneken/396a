            "content": "In the same year he made Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan, evidentially unsatisfied with simply reinvigorating audience interest in Batman on screen, decided to also make The Prestige. Reuniting with Christian Bale and Michael Caine, it's a tale of professional rivalries getting way out of hand in, of all things, the magic business. The animosity between Bale & Jackson is very believable, as are the lengths they both go to to try and outshine the other. You're basically watching 2 bad people constantly attempting to get one over on the other. We're supposed to engage with them, but not necessarily like them. Their jealousy is what drives them and encourages their actions, and we're left to sit back and witness the horrible effects it has on them and those around them. They're both fantastic and terrible at the same time. Some elements of the film strains credulity, such as both men having identical doubles, one of whom they just so happen to find living in the same city at the same time. It also gets a little twist-happy towards then end, but as it approaches the climax the story slowly opens up and reveals its secrets to us, some of which you'll likely have guessed by that time. It's not surprising that it was overshadowed by Batman Begins, but it is unfortunate. It's well paced, well-acted and gives us a fascinating insight into the lives of not only professional magicians, but also professional frenemies.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nAs said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.\n\nWas also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.\n\nHowever, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.\n\nThe story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.\n\nFine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.\n\nOverall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

The production design - the sets, the costumes, the magic, especially the magic - was superb, and the cast did their jobs masterfully.

I became deeply invested in each of the characters, and as for the main duo in specific, I couldn't decide whether to love or hate them, but that I felt the need to do so speaks volumes in of itself. The plot was also excellent, twisting and turning and flowing - until the very end, to explain I'll use an analogy from the movie: the big reveal at the end was like a magic trick the trick of which has been revealed, it loses its appeal, but the problem is that a movie isn't a magic trick, a movie must be able to reveal its secrets, and be all the better for it, and to a certain level, I think that's where The Prestige fails a little.\n92/100",

Lo que mas destaco de la pel\u00edcula es su excelente trama, la cual me engancho desde un comienzo y que a pesar de avanzar bastante lento todo el misterio planteado mas el giro final me encantaron. Justamente me gustar\u00eda destacar el final, el cual creo que esta muy bien trabajado, ya que termina siendo el prestigio de la trama, en la pel\u00edcula se nos hizo un truco de magia, y como se dice en la pel\u00edcula, el espectador intenta adivinar el truco, pero nunca lo hace porque no investiga de verdad. Mientras al espectador lo tuvieron intentando descifrar la muerte de Angier, el verdadero truco estuvo en el gemelo de Borden, y hubo se\u00f1ales de eso en todas partes; esto demuestra que Christopher Nolan lo hizo todo totalmente visible ante nuestra vista y no pudimos verlo, al menos en mi caso. Otra cosa que me gusto mucho es como se llevan a cabo los trucos de magia, siendo algunos un poco realistas y otros en los que se muestra como se hacen realmente. Tambi\u00e9n tiene unas excelentes actuaciones junto a un gran cast conformado por ejemplo por Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, etc. En conclusi\u00f3n, una pel\u00edcula muy buena que se destaca por su llamativa y sorpresiva historia, teniendo un gran giro de trama en el final el cual muchos no se ve\u00edan venir.

This film is essentially a magic trick, and Nolan actually tells us that very early on but we don't clue in until the end. Michael Canes character Cutter explains what exactly a magic trick is, he explains and defines the three elements of a magic trick the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Nolan writes his film as if it is a magic trick using those three parts to make a mind blowing film.\n\nNolan does what every magician on the planet is known for misdirection. Nolan much like a real magician hires, or in this case casts a gorgeous assistant in the form of Scarlett Johansson to distract you, but he also uses basic film elements that also distract you from what is really happening. Nolan made this film technically flawless, with incredible cinematography and music to accompany it both of which act as distraction. He casted an elite group of actors and actresses and wrote them amazing dialogue so you would be focused on their talent and would miss details. If Nolan did not make sure that his film was flawless from a basic film making standpoint, his plot would not have worked, because if you look back through this film you can see clear indications into the films finale. \n\nChristian Bale plays his character phenomenally but you don't necessarily realize how good he is until the end. The end of the film reveals to us that Borden and Fallon are twin brothers that would switch personas throughout their lives. When that reveal is made you can go back through this film and very clearly see the two different personalities within Bordens character. This ideology was referenced during a conversation between Borden and Sarah played by the very underrated Rebecca Hall. During that conversation Borden explains the catching bullet trick to Sarah, this is when Sarah says \"Once you know it's very obvious.\" \n\nHugh Jackman gives without a doubt the best performance I've seen from him. That being said I haven't seen much of him outside of X-Men, so for me seeing his talent shine through was extremely impressive.\n\nThis film is nothing short of phenomenal and I'd like to thank Christopher Nolan for another mind blowing experience.\n\n10/10",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nAs said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.\n\nWas also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.\n\nHowever, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.\n\nThe story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.\n\nFine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.\n\nOverall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "I just finished watching The Prestige on Amazon Prime. Recently I decided to take a look at all of Christopher Nolan's films. I have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet; and now it was this film's turn. At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing. After having seen Tenet I was overestimating this film. It's nothing as complicated (though it is fairly so), and that's for a good thing.\n\nIt's funny there are three actors in this film who also played superheroes movies - Christian Bale (Batman in TDK Trilogy), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in X-Men), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow in MCU), and out of them Scarlett Johansson hadn't even come up as Black Widow yet. And since those are the only roles I have previously seen them, it was a bit weird seeing them do basic, method acting. The only one I had seen before do multiple roles is Michael Caine (Alfred in TDK trilogy), but he's in every Nolan film I've ever watched so he doesn't count. And all their acting was actually pretty convincing.\n\nThe story is what mainly carries this film. There are two magicians who have two completely different ideas about magic. Borden is more of someone who believes in making his life more devoted towards magic, while Angier is someone who believes the charm of magic is more based on presentation. Both the magicians hold grudges against each other due to an accident which happened in the past, which is the reason they are constantly trying to outdo each other.\n\nSeeing this film I got to learn so many magic tricks that I otherwise used to dismiss as simply being some complicated trick my tiny brain is too weak to understand. My take from this, especially from Alfred Borden, was that to understand how magic works, we have to go to the absolute basics. How something is happening, how we can convince the audience that we are doing what they are thinking and how we can do it so smoothly that no one suspects a thing.\n\nThis is something that we can say about science too, which was shown here by Nikola Tesla - what do you think is responsible behind what you see? If Edison had tried thinking it this way instead of trying to get to Tesla, he could have been considered just about as respectable while Tesla would have never been as famous as he is today. Though I didn't quite understand how exactly the whole cloning using electricity thing worked, I guess some things are better left to the viewer's imagination. The way Angier described how it feels to be cloned also left me in my imagination - what would happen if I am cloned with all the memories intact? Which one of us will be me?\n\nForget The Dark Knight trilogy, now this is my favourite film by Christopher Nolan. I only learnt about Hollywood movies a few years ago, which absolutely explains why I never knew about this film. But now that I do, I'm going to recommend everyone to see it once. Seeing all the tricks and, like I mentioned above, trying to figure out how to deduct an act, I also felt like becoming a magician after watching this film.",

As they confound and confuse one another, so do they astonish and amaze the viewer; half the fun is in learning how each man achieves the impossible, then watching as their rival maliciously thwarts it before a paying audience.\n\nMagnetic costars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman really wore their working boots to this set, allowing their heavyweight personalities to smash and spark from the very first word. Their performances are boosted by a string of excellent supporting players. Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson make wonderful contributions, as always, but there's something extra-special about David Bowie, in a typically small, offbeat role, as the reclusive Russian genius Nikola Tesla.\n\nWith the Nolan brothers working behind the camera, twists and turns are to be expected, and after setting the stage with a series of low-key appetizers in the early acts, they deliver a string of jumbo-sized whoppers during the climax. Expertly paced and brilliantly tailored to match the tempo and bravado of a world-class magic act, The Prestige is a high-water mark in the writer/director duo's already-impressive filmography.",

The film is unbelievable and one of the greatest films that I have ever seen, I will never forget it \n\nThe Prestige has an amazing cast, everyone did put on a great acting performance even those who were not the main character like Andy Serkis and David Bowie. Hugh Jackman's performance was incredible, this is for sure one of my favorite performances of him. Although Rebecca Hall is not the main character, most of the scenes that she was in were dramatic scenes and she killed it, her facial expressions and emotions were able to convince the audience, when actors make you feel that they are not acting that's when you know how incredible they are and that is how Rebecca Hall in this film. Finally, the great Christian Bale who for me is the one who stole the spotlight in this film, and the reason why I think that is because of a specific reason that unfortunately, I won't be able to mention so I don't spoil anything.\n\nThe film has such a great and unique story that is filled with plot twists. It talks about magic and tricks but the real thing is that the audience got tricked. I loved how Nolan treats this film and how he presented it to the audience, he makes us see what he wants us to see but the truth that there is something behind it exactly like a magic trick, the magician makes us see the magic trick but not the secret and that is what Nolan did, we saw the magic trick but we never saw the secret behind it until the very end of it. \n\nIn Addition, the film's cinematography was great, I was not surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar for \"Best Cinematography\", it has a few shots and frames that were visually stunning like the very first shot of the film where all the hats were on the floor. Also, the music score, production, and custom designs were all very great especially the production design. \n\nThe very first scene of the film was great, it grabs your attention and makes you wonder what is happening and why did that specific thing happen but then and until the first hour the film is boring and felt like there are scenes that are unnecessary. But after the first hour, everything started to go crazy and a lot of stuff started to be clear. \n\nIn the end, if you did not watch this film, I don't know what are you waiting for. \"Highly recommend\" it and this is for sure one of my favorite films ever.\n\nMy rating is 9/10",

            "content": "\"The Prestige\", written by Christopher Nolan, is a gripping film that leaves the audience in a constant state of shock and confusion. This film follows the lives of two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, who are in a constant rivalry with on another. Nolan is able to use this tale of illusion and deceit in order to depict the obsessive nature of proving oneself and being better than another, as well as the danger in secrets. Much like other films written by Christopher Nolan, as the storyline unravels within the film there are many intricacies and cleverly inserted foreshadowing elements that can lead the reader to the still shocking conclusion as the end. This film clearly shows how powerful the need to prove oneself could be, and how overwhelming and consuming revenge is. All in all, I would give this film 4 out of 5 stars. I found that intricate plot and the magical elements within the film to be enticing, furthermore the use of the foreshadowing and subtle music and the lighting in each background helped to bring an important element to each particular scene. However, I also found the storyline to be incredibly confusing. Not to mention that the social commentary of the film was difficult to understand and find within it. Nevertheless, the film was quite effective. It used the cinematography to bring certain emotions to the forefront within particular scenes. Presenting the storyline like a magic trick within itself. The plot of the film was also particularly interesting, as it continuously unraveled in surprising ways. The resolution on the other hand was not quite a resolution at all, which made it particularly interesting. The emphasis in the film on the layers and steps used in every magic trick was copied by the plot of the film. However, the importance of the prestige as a way to bring out a reaction in the audience and wrap up the magic trick perfectly was not shadowed in the resolution. It is evident that there is a clear lack of prestige in the resolution of the film, making it seem like an unsatisfying and unfinished magic trick. All in all, this film clearly indicated the power of secrecy and illusion, and the danger of revenge and the need to prove oneself.",

            "content": "Summary\n\"The Prestige\" is about two magicians, Angier and Borden, trying to compete against each other in every aspect of their lives. The tension started because Angier assumed that Borden killed his wife, and ever since then he tried to ruin his career and his life in every possible way, and Borden did the same for revenge. The biggest highlight in this movie is the secret behind Angier and Borden's \"Transported Man\" trick. During the trick both Angier and Borden were able to travel from one place to another in less than one second, and this secret was not revealed until the end of the movie. This is a very well-made movie due to its \u200bartistic metaphors, surprising yet logical plot twists, and thought-provoking life lessons\u200b.\n\nArtistic Metaphors\nThe simple magic trick in the beginning of the movie foreshadows the plot of the whole story. Angier's technician made a bird disappear with magic; this implies that both Angier and Borden were able to make themselves disappear in the \"transported man\" trick. After the bird disappeared, the old man made the bird reappear again, and this implies both Angier and Borden were able to make themselves reappear in the \"transported man\" trick. However, the bird that \"reappeared\" is actually not the original bird, it was its twin, the original bird was killed in the magic trick. When Angier did the transported man trick, he had to kill his duplicate to appear on the other side. When Borden did the same trick, he used his twin as a double to appear on the other side, and one of the twins got killed in the end. This is a very clever use of foreshadowing.\nThe battle between two magicians, Borden and Angier, also reflects the electricity battle between Tesla and Edison. Like Borden & Angier, Tesla and Edison were both extremely talented. However, Edison was better at marketing his technologies to society while Tesla was more focused on developing the technology itself. Consequently, Tesla's theories were more advanced than Edison's, yet Edison got more attention and credit because he commercialized his technology. This is exactly like Borden and Angier. Borden's techniques are more advanced since he put more effort into practicing his tricks, yet he didn't know how to present the magic tricks in a very appealing way, so he was always less popular than Angier. I think this triggers a very interesting debate. Who is more important, the person who created the product or the person who knows how to market the product to the general public so that everyone can enjoy its benefits? Also, who should deserve more credit? This is a critical decision for company executives since they will adjust their incentive programs based on their belief of which type of person is more important.\n\nSurprising Yet Logical Plot Twists\nMost plot twists are surprising; that's what they're for, yet not all of them make sense. Some directors try to create unexpected moments that simply come out of nowhere. Movies are supposed to be entertaining for the audience but if it requires some reasonable deduction as well, it can be appealing to both our physical senses and our brains.\nVarious scenes in the movie imply that there are actually two Bordens. For example, at the beginning of the movie when \"Borden\" accidentally killed Angier's wife, Borden didn't know which knot he tied that led to Angier's wife's death. That's not because he's lying. Even in his diary he didn't know which knot he tied. This indicates that there might be two \"Bordens,\" one that did tie the knot and one that didn't do so.\nAnother scene implies the same thing. Borden's wife constantly complained about Borden's alternating personalities. Sometimes when Borden told his wife \"I love you,\" his wife thought he meant it, and other\ntimes his wife thought he was lying. Sometimes Borden shows deep and genuine love to his wife, other times he shows deep and genuine love to his mistress.\nThere are many more surprising yet logical plot twists in this movie. After watching this movie, you'll feel like every little detail makes sense and all the dots connect perfectly.\n\nThought-provoking Life Lessons\nIn my opinion, one thing that distinguishes a good movie from a great movie is whether it conveys a meaningful message. Great movies should not only give people short-term excitement, but also make people ponder about their lives and the world as a whole. One thing I pondered about is whether the person who makes the product or the person who promotes the product creates more value to society. Another thing is whether we should make the ultimate sacrifice for the things we are truly passionate about. In other words, should we sacrifice \"small things\" for the greater good?\nWhen I was young, I was taught to admire many great scientists, great leaders who founded the country, and great CEOs. However, I'm definitely not fully aware of the type of sacrifices they made to accomplish great things. While some of these sacrifices will only impact the people who made them, others can extend their influence far beyond. For example, scientists and CEOs working day and night can't possibly have enough time for their families; their families could be in a constant state of loneliness. However, lonely people seem \"trivial\" when compared to the great contributions that are made to society like electricity, the internet, and so on. Value creation shouldn't be simply computed on a quantity basis. Many things like \"love\" that can't be measured quantitatively are actually one of the most valuable things in our lives.\nI think it's pretty unfair to let these families suffer, but again it's hard to determine which decision is the best. Steve Jobs once said on his deathbed that he most regretted not spending enough time with his family; but if he went back in time, would he choose to spend more time with his family or focus on his career? We will never know. In addition, many great military leaders have made significant contributions by bringing peace and unity to society. Yet to do so, they have to kill thousands or even millions of people. In this movie, Angier and Borden were both pretty successful magicians, yet both of them lost their wives and they were all indirectly responsible for it. Should this act be justified? Should we really sacrifice small things for the greater good?\nI recommend this movie 100% for those who enjoy murder mysteries, fantasy, and sci-fi.",

The movie was just a constant loop of \"magician makes revolutionary new trick, Magician tries it out and it works perfectly, other magician comes and sabotages it.\" From beginning to end, all of this happened quite a few times. So, that's the plot, but what about the characters? They're dull, although the acting is great, and emotion is portrayed well, it's very hard to tell them apart (Not based on looks, just the way they act). These are some relatively major complaints with the movie, but I would be stupid if I didn't talk about the brilliant twist at the end and some of the wonderful visuals. I have also always been interested in Nicola Tesla stuff for some reason, so I really liked this. But still, I just had too many problems. Maybe it's just my high expectation for Nolan, but this movie just didn't really click for me.",

The acting, the music, the visuals... well the visuals could be better but honestly, I'm not really complaining.

A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick.

This movie has an amazing cast a lot of A list stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, and Micheal Caine. I love the tiny details that Christopher Nolan puts in and if you don't notice you will miss and I appreciate the little things he puts in. I love the tension created in the final scenes of the third act and the climax is just the best and it just falls together beautifully at the end. There are two very different magicians and you can tell it from the beginning and they kinda switch roles. This film really has such a good atmosphere with the set design and the costumes and the lighting is all amazing it gives off an atmosphere that really helps the film. I love the ending and Christopher Nolan really loves crosscutting and I love that and the ending showcases crosscutting and I love that and this might have my favorite ending in film and it all falls together beautifully. I swear he impresses me each movie of his in each genre even before his mastermind blockbusters he made amazing movies like Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, and even The Following I have heard it is one of the movies with the lowest budget that is still pretty good for the budget.\n\nThe acting is amazing with the A list talent and the acting in all is amazing, I love the little things Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman change in each role of their roles of each person, you can notice it when you rewatch it and I just want to watch it again. The cinematography is amazing the lighting and the shot placement I love, and the editing is amazing with the crosscutting I just love in all of his movies. The score is one of my favorites of all time and it really helps each scene and it elevates the climax of the movie and the big moments I love when the score adds to it. The script and the dialogue is amazing I wish it got an oscar nomination because it is amazing. I love his non-linear storytelling it is just amazing with the ending somewhat lining up with the beginning it is my favorite way to tell a story. Overall I absolutely love this movie so much and would recommend it to anyone especially to Nolan fans like me.\n1000%\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf82\ud83d\ude4c",

            "content": "\"Are You watching closely?\". The film opens with this line and it is an amazing line to open the film with, when comparing to the plot of the film. This film is like riding a roller coaster. It is filled with turns and twists you wouldn't see coming. \n\tI thoroughly enjoyed watching The Prestige. I am very hard to impress and Christopher Nolan created a beautiful work of art. The tight screenplay written by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is almost on the same level as Back To The Future. It is so impressive and well-written. It is also based on a book by Christopher Priest. This review has no complaints about it and applauds the Nolan brothers on their extraordinary work. Their scene structure has a purpose and was different from anything I have seen before. Their character work is so thought out a deep that it is amazing to watch during the film. Each character has a reason for being in the film and is well written and amazingly acted by the cast.\n\tChristian Bale and Hugh Jackman did a brilliant job in the film. Their acting was superb and they played very well off of each other in the film. I personally was not a fan of Bale's accent for Alfred Borden. I found a strange mix of cockney and New Jersey, but he well made up for it with his stellar acting skills. Jackman's portrayal of Robert Angier's obsession and pride was amazing to watch on screen.Michael Caine was also amazing in the film. As Cutter, he was amazing throughout the film without even trying. His performance was effortless and showed his great acting skills.\n\tScarlett Johnasen is always a hit and miss actress. She is either a hit in the film or not good at all. In The Prestige, she was a hit. She portrayed everything Olivia Wenscombe needed to be brilliantly. Her sneakiness and motivations were very good in the film. Rebecca Hall also did amazing as Sarah. \n\tThe costumes and sets were also brilliant.  They blended in well with the themes and atmosphere of the film and tied in very well with the time period of the film. Not to mention the lighting used during the show really aided to the plot and also the special effects and makeup were very good as well. They were very well done and interesting to see on screen.\nThe film also did an amazing job of creating a thriller. The soundtrack helps bring out the nervousness in the heart  and anticipation of \"What is going to happen next?\". With the soundtrack, editing, and screenplay, the Nolans achieved Alfred Hitchcock worthy scenes. This film had me on the edge of my seat multiple times. It did not disappoint at any moment.\nThe Prestige definitely achieved its goal of creating a suspenseful thriller. I couldn't tell at first what it was trying to do, but it did give a nod to the harshness of Hollywood (magic) and competing for more fame and power, even with its setting of the late 1800's. The film was definitely worth doing not only in the notation that is very entertaining, but also that it is solidly structured and thought out. It used techniques from older movies, such as Psycho and Citizen Kane, and brought them back to the present. So, \"are you watching closely\" because you better when you go watch his film.\n\t**SPOILERS IN REVIEW AHEAD STOP NOW FOR NO SPOILERS**\n \t\nThere are a few things I need to give my feedback on that would be spoilers for an audience member so please, stop reading if you haven't seen the film.  You have been warned. First is the beginning line and how it ties in with the rest of the film.\nBorden literally states at the beginning \"Are you watching closely?\" to the audience. Directly to them, many, like me, might think it is just a notion to the magic tricks during the shows in the film, not the entire film for the plot twist at the end. It was so brilliant how it tied into the end with Borden being twins and that's how they did it. Everything was laid out for the audience during the film, we just had to be watching close enough to notice. \nThen the twins part was shocking. It was an amazing reveal. I personally was shocked and fell out of my seat with surprise. I truly didn't see it coming. Brilliant, Brilliant. Especially making Fallon always with Alfred at all times, leaving the clue right there for the audience.  Then the lines where Borden says to Sarah, \"No. Not today\" are so much clearer as it was the other twin, who was there, not the one who loved Sarah but the one who loved Olivia. It literally wasn't the twin who loved Sarah that day so he couldn't love Sarah because he didn't. \nNolan amazing job with Angier's death. His speech about not knowing if he would be the one who drowned or be the one on the balcony was brilliant and JAckman's acting was stellar during it, especially with his breaks of labored breath because he was dying. It was very realistic.\nThe parallel editing at the beginning and end was also amazing. Not to mention the whole diaries aspect of the film. Another hair raising, falling out of the chair \"Oh My God moment\". When they each read the end of the diaries and how, both Borden and Angier knew the other would read it, was amazing. A brilliant plot twist and point.\nThe film was so well put together and created, that until the duplicates were actually created and found by the machine, I thought it was based on a true story. It seemed so real and believable that it could have happened in real life. Another notation to the duplicates is how they directly showed them at the beginning in the forest, which was easily recognizable when Angier first appeared as the one from the beginning, but even I didn't realize they were the duplicates until Robert found the cats. Then at the end where you see all the duplicates in the boxes, it was so creepy and thrilling to see on the screen, because we don't know if the original Robert Angier still exists, and we will never know, which makes it an even greater thriller.\nThis film is so brilliant and had my attention the entire time. It grabbed at my mind to pay attention and pulled at my heart with its suspense. It literally had me falling out of my seat, mouth opened, gasping in shock. It truly is one of the best films I have ever seen.",

            "content": "Hands down Christopher Nolan's best film.\n\nWondrous illusions lead to Christopher Nolan's magnum opus of magic. Christopher Nolan's period magician thriller The Prestige (2006) is a masterpiece of filmmaking that demonstrates Nolan's creative cinematic vision and complex storytelling prowess. He takes everything he learned as a director from Following, Memento, and Insomnia to craft an intricate tale of revenge, jealousy, magic, love, lust, science, and sacrifice. Nolan's direction is captivating as he recreates an old era with Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh's striking dingy production design matched by Lee Smith's slick editing that only allows the eye to see what Nolan wants you to focus on at any given moment.\n\nChristian Bale delivers one of his very best and most intense performances as a skilled magician called The Professor really named Alfred Borden. His brilliant manipulation of his voice, accent, body language, and personality as a method actor match Borden's obsessive genius as a magician. Bale is scary, cunning, sympathetic, repulsive, and endearing all in one captivating lead role. How Bale plays his roles in The Prestige with such heart and conviction is just astounding. Bale is really an acting wizard.\n\nLikewise, Hugh Jackman is phenomenal as Borden's rival magician Robert Angier. His desperation to uncover Bale's secret to his Teleporting Man trick is entertaining and increasingly horrifying as Jackman ensures you notice his character's descent into madness without morals. Jackman certainly sells you as the driven magician and ethical nightmare that is Angier. He is sympathetic as his wife meets an untimely demise, but Jackman throws himself into the role of the fallen faithful to the magical code of morals and consequences. Similarly, Michael Caine is fantastic as the pushy magician manager Cutter, who drives Jackman to unspeakable horrors.\n\nScarlett Johansson is unfairly forgotten as the voluptuous Olivia Wenscombe. She is fascinating and an interesting empathetic character as you see exactly how she must feel torn between two warring wizards of illusory affections. Rebecca Hall is lovely and sweet as the tragically unloved and unappreciated Sarah Borden. She is as devastating as Piper Perabo as the pretty, tragic wife to Angier named Julia McCullough. I love all three leading ladies in their respective roles as the ill fated mistresses to magicians and their obsessions.\n\nDavid Bowie is unforgettable as genius scientist and revolutionary electrical inventor Nikola Tesla. Bowie nails a brilliant reclusive man with a particular accent and gentlemanly manner. David Bowie was perfect casting for the eclectic man and I love how he's the voice of reason among all the mad magicians. Andy Serkis is fun as Tesla's steadfast assistant Alley. His giddy excitement is similar to my feeling at seeing David Bowie in a Nolan picture.\n\nChristopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan's script is next level writing with layers of narrative scheming as he constantly sets up tricks to distract the audience from the real magic act payoff also known as the prestige. They adapt Christopher Priest's novel with riveting drama and shocking twists. The Nolan Brothers write with a keen sense of what needs to be said, shown, or hidden to truly startle the viewer with clever perspective changes and character turns. The Prestige has held up beautifully.\n\nWally Pfister's cinematography outdoes his haunting foggy cinematography for Insomnia with the Tesla Coil electricity enshrouded entrance of David Bowie's Tesla or the fog filled fields illuminated by isolated light bulbs. His use of space to evade each face or reveal until the exact necessary moment is just too clever. Pfister is a seriously underrated cinematographer and he delivers arguably his finest camerawork for Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Stephane Ceretti's visual effects are lovely with the phosphorus bulbs and pulsating electrical currents from the Tesla Coils. It all looks real as Ceretti makes science appear to be magic.\n\nDavid Julyan's score is engrossing with dark themes and heavy throbbing symphonies of electric noise. He makes The Prestige more mysterious and haunting that it already is and always will be. Joan Bergin and Kenn Smiley's costumes are full of cool period suits and lovely frilly dresses. Their clothing style choices are as striking as is the make-up team's work for the disguises in the movie. The Prestige is 130 minutes of pure mystery and intense loathing as rival magicians try to one up one another with lethal consequences.\n\nIn all, Nolan directed The Prestige with so much care and thought that this film will always be fun to revisit and analyze. The Prestige is a masterpiece and Nolan's finest feature to me.",

Adapted from Christopher Priest's novel of the same name, by the Nolan brothers, this remains about a magic in that very sense. That you are hooked and wowed at the end of the show, till it's big reveal. The film is about a two friends-turned-rival magicians who loses themselves and their loved ones in order to prove the superiority over each other.\n\nAnd the film walks for that unsaid scoreboard mentality for the most part of the film. Grabbing points by excelling or cheating, this mano-y-mano aspect of the storyline deteriorates very quickly when bigger themes like art, science, philosophy and ethics dive in. The clash between art and science is what fascinated me the most, especially after the film started accounting in, the infamous feud between Tesla and Edison.\n\nOften in a film that deals with parallel characters going awry and coming home, the film cheapens its content in latter stages by manipulating the audience emotionally. But the film dodges this bullet by wisely never revealing the hand that helps us in surviving this film. Empathy is never installed forcibly and even when for a brief period in its last act, you feel the film going soft on the characters, it actually turns the tables by revealing information that is always said to be hidden and not reversing the roles of any elements. This underrated genius often goes unmentioned, but it requires a closer and a second look. Nolan's film's malleability has been arctic over the ages. Not stiff, nor cold, but moody. To a degree that you will bow down to its celebratory behavior and PG-13 language. Something you don't see nowadays.",

I don't even have to say anything about Michael Caine due to the fact that he never disappoints. Scarlett Johansson is great. David Bowie as Tesla was an amazing casting choice. Overall, The Prestige is a smart movie. Some parts of the 3rd Act may seem a bit confusing the first time but it get cleared in a second-watch. Christopher Nolan delivers another great movie. The flaws in the movie are related to Tesla's invention. I thought it remained quite ambiguous whether his machine really worked or not because if it did, it would  become a movie from the science-fiction genre. Apart from that mentioned above, no other major flaws in my opinion.  A clever movie with great performances and of course, a good execution of the plot is what The Prestige is all about.

This is a fantastic film with a wonderfully twisty story, incredible acting, and excellent period detail. Yet it sits at a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. One of Christopher Nolan's worse as director. The bloated Dark Knight Rises sits at an 87%\n\nIt is a bit of a head-scratcher. It did come out during particularly good run of films in the theater ( Scorsese\u00e2(TM)s The Departed, Eastwood\u00e2(TM)s Flags of our Fathers)  and it wasn\u00e2(TM)t the only costume drama attacked that weekend (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette was savaged by critics) Some people didn\u00e2(TM)t like the end but I think it is more than a bit brilliant. One caveat is that I did like the film more on repeat viewings after a little time had passed. I can see how the initial reaction might be slightly harsher.\n\nStill, The Prestige has easily recovered and sits comfortably in the IMDB top 250 a couple of spaces from The Departed. (Time has not been as kind to Flags of our Fathers which is all but forgotten\u00e2\u00a6. However, Marie Antoinette has also picked up some fans over the years and is bordering on a cult classic.)\n\nI am not talking about The Prestige simply because I don\u00e2(TM)t want to spoil it. It is that good and should be seen with fresh eyes. Okay, one more hint it has the second best David Bowie casting ever.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is about two rival magicians who dedicate their lives to the craft of misdirection. Not only is the film about misdirection but the film itself is a misdirection to the audience. Throughout the entire movie there are sophisticated complications to this film that are often mistaken by the general viewers. Those complications help make this movie a \"magical\" yet intellectually invigorating cinematic display. \n\tThe two magicians, Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) begin as apprentices working together. They are good friends and have a common love and dedication to the art of misdirection. The friendship then becomes a hatred towards one another after a magic trick goes horribly wrong due to a knot Borden tied around Angier's wife causing her to die during one of their shows. The death of his wife causes Angier to make it his goal to end Borden's career and become the most successful magician of the time.\n\tMost movies today follow a linear plot developing the story and characters one step at a time. The Prestige is not very straight-forward. It makes the audience think and come up with their own conclusions. The way the characters are developed is through flash backs and flash forwards that can be confusing. Although confusing, Nolan's ability to add detail makes the movie better each time you watch it because you almost always pick up something new that you didn't notice before. There are subtle clues through the movie that an experienced audience will pick up better after each time they watch it. These clues are not very direct and usually only the most vigilant viewers recognize them. They help provide added relationships to the main plot of the movie which is important because the movie itself doesn't have a very clear plot. Usually you are introduced with the important parts of a movie in a very clear manner. But because this movie is about magicians, details are often hidden.\n\tOne of the very first clues is the very beginning of the movie where it shows dozens of top hats laying on the ground. This very small clue directly ties to the ending of the movie and how exactly Angier was able to pull off his \"Transported Man\" trick. \"The Prestige\" is the name of the final act of the three steps to a magician's magic trick as explained in the movie. This is also represented by the hats laying on the ground. The other two are \"The Pledge\" and \"The Turn\". Even though these parts of a magic trick are just trying to explain to the audience how a magic trick works, it is also telling you how these acts relate to the plot of the movie. Here is the direct quote from the movie about these parts of a magic trick, \"Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called \"The Pledge\". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called \"The Turn\". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call \"The Prestige\".\" In the movie \"The Pledge\" relates to the magicians and how they are just ordinary people with ordinary relationships. But then we see them do amazing things, that's the extraordinary, \"The Turn\". Then as we see these hats and how Angier was able to do something extraordinary with the teleportation machine, making the extraordinary the unexpected. At the core of this we want to understand how it works but above all, not wanting to know how it works. This is \"The prestige\" within the movie The Prestige.\n\tNolan portrays \"The Pledge\" as the two men who are famous entertainers, but are actually just ordinary guys. Like Olivia who is the girlfriend of Angier who then falls in love with Borden. Sarah, the wife of Borden who wants a normal family life. Cutter, the wise old man who is able to form most of Angier's famous tricks but still unable to figure out Borden's tricks These characters show us they are all just ordinary people or in this case to the films plot, they are the \"The Pledge\". Each of the individuals however do something extraordinary, Angier is able to pull off one of the greatest magic tricks of all time. Borden has a secret that gives him the upper-hand throughout the entire film that you don't figure out until the end. Sarah, who can no longer handle the lies and misdirection's leading to her suicide. Olivia, who leaves both men due to the overzealous addiction to magic.  These examples show the characters taking something ordinary and making it extraordinary, \"The Turn\".\n\tWith small clues throughout the movie they build a foundation for what lies in the end. Even if you can pick up these small clues though the movie they will only be helpful if you understand the famous saying, \"The more you look, the less you see.\" Nolan's twist at the end often leaves the audience in a numb-minded state trying to figure out exactly what just happened. Once you are able to process what exactly just took place you see the true beauty to the development of this movie. The fact you are just as entertained the second time you watch this movie, gives it a quality most films are unable to achieve.",

Nolan has crafted a movie about obsession and revenge under the guise of magic but the execution stalls in many areas. Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart, the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways, except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end, the film's climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that aren't all that surprising or hard to guess. The acting by the leads- Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is top notch but that should be a given. (Nolan's first misstep? Maybe).",

It makes sense this is why hes in love with both Olivia and Sarah and it only sounds genuiene on some days when Alfred tells Sarah he loves him. Its because  sometimes its the alfred who truley loves him and sometimes its not. Clues are left behind throught the movie and the reveal is not just pulled out of nolans ass. The reveal with robert was also great. Both revavels gave me chills. I just made a voice note for 10 minutes talking about this movie. The robert trick with the water tank is essentially the same as the double bird trick which is just SO CLEVER. The whole reveal is closley related to the old guys explenation of the three stages of a magic trick where he employs the use of the word prestige. The rivalry between the Alfred and Robert is so good. So much suspense when they mess up each others plays. When alfred tricks Root Roberts double to play along with him and Alfred sabatages Roberts preformance. Robert shooting Alfred in the hand. Alfred killing the dove and sabotagging Robertd play. The love tria gle between Alfred, Robert and Olivia. The sense of loos that Robert and Alfred have for their wifes deaths and THE AMAZING NON LINEAR STORY TELLING THAT KEEPS YOU PAYING ATTENTION FIRST MAKING YOU THINK THAT ALFRED KILLED ROBERT THEN YOU SEE AT THE END THAT ROBERT KILLED HIMSELF.

The performances are quite good for the most part, and the era is convincingly portrayed and offers a great atmosphere. And Christopher Nolan's signature time-bending storytelling is at full-throttle here. It does feel a bit melodramatic in some moments, but I didn't mind. And not to discredit the director's other films, because I am a big fan, but it felt refreshing to see something that focused less on spectacle. I feel like the movie might have benefited from some simplification, but it's very entertaining, and pays off quite well if you're able to follow everything that's happening.",

Bale and Jackman deliver both outstanding performances and really go for it. The second characters, Michael Caine ahead, are all really nicely written even though one can regret the little time Piper Perabo / Scarlett Johansson / Rebecca Hall have on screen, they all do a great job and manage to make the audience care for their characters. The atmosphere of the film is definitely my favorite aspect of the film, with incredible games of light & shadow, the film seems to play with his audience and definitely bring a sense of mystery that suits the tone and the mood of the action depicted on screen.

Here, he displays commanding signs of that power, but not the very best of it.\n\nEach of the magical stunts have no relative pizazz to make up for the already generic feel of the motion picture. Nolan does have his moments of spectacular imagery, including the creation of early 20th Century England and a line of lightbulbs enveloped by a misty field of snow, but there's nothing here as memorable as the Joker blowing up a hospital, or Paris folding over itself.",

            "content": "The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.\n\nAngier starts performing with the sobriquet \"The Great Danton\" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name \"The Professor\" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of \"The Transported Man\" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of \"The Transported Man\", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.\n\nThe success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.\n\nThe movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: \"Are you watching closely?\" \n\nA must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10",

            "content": "Having delivered such strong films as Memento, Inception and Interstellar (outwith the hugely successful Dark Knight trilogy), it's safe to say that director Christopher Nolan's output is of a very high standard. Many may even claim that he's yet to make a bad film and that his filmography is nothing but quality. For me, though, The Prestige is an exception to that and a major blip in an otherwise solid r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, celebrated stage magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is accused of the murder of Julia McCullough, the wife of his partner Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Her death happened during a magic trick but Angier puts the blame solely on Borden. As a result, the pair become rivals and a bitter feud takes place between them as they try to sabotage each others tricks with dangerous consequences.\n\nAs the film opens, we are informed that every magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called \"The Pledge\" where the magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called \"The Turn\" where the magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary (like disappear). But making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part that's called \"The Prestige\". And so the stage is set for Nolan's stylish and elaborate sleight of hand. He adheres to this magicians three act rule in the films structure but it's the hardest act (and the one that shares the film's title) that actually undoes the whole affair. \n\nIn saying this, it would suggest the film is let down solely by it's reveal. It's not. From the outset the film is very slow and tedium sets in very early. I don't have a problem with slow builds and I'm actually very fond of a good magic trick. Nolan's premise is very enticing and having two warring magicians play against each other should make for gripping entertainment. Only it doesn't. It's a laborious and excruciatingly dull endeavour which is very surprising considering it has Nolan in charge.\n\nWith films of this kind, you know there will be an attempt to pull the rug from under your feet. That's a given and given Nolan's track record of being more than able to deliver a good twist you expect that you're in safe hands. However, it reaches a point where it's just one preposterous plot twist after another with the ultimate misgiving being that Nolan doesn't capture a sense of wonder. It's difficult to accept the plot developments when you know that it's all just elaborately staged for the sake of it. It's like trying to convince the viewer that CGI is actually real. There's no way your going buy it and this film is as similarly unacceptable as that preposterous proposal. As for the final reveal, when it actually happens, it just stinks. It's a ludicrous revelation that's so tenuous that it's practically impossible to work it out and left me with feelings of frustration. Maybe this was Nolan's intentions all along but, to me, it felt like a con.\n\nGranted, Nolan has a good eye for the period and his regular cinematographer Wally Pfister does some beautiful work in capturing the Victorian era amidst Nathan Crowley's impressive production design. To the eye, it certainly looks the part but really the appearance is all smoke and mirrors. There's really no consistency underneath it all.\n\n\nEven having the charismatic leads in Bale and Jackman should work in it's favour but the film never really knows who to fully focus on at any given time leaving the development of their relationship - and their own identities - a bit of a muddle. It's hard to know which one to root for as their character arcs are continually blurred and messily delivered.\n\nFrom what I can gather, I'm in the minority with this one. Many critics and viewers have lavished nothing but praise on it but I fail to see what the attraction is. As I've said, the three act structure is undoubtedly on show; we are offered the \"pledge\" and it delivers the \"turn\" but Nolan's reveal simply doesn't work, leaving the final product lacking the \"prestige\". Which doesn't say very much for a film that can't even live up to its own title. \n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: As far as I'm concerned, Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' really is one of the most ambitious and profound films of the twenty-first century. I mean honestly let's just consider for a moment what this movie does - for a start it's in many ways a film literally about itself; a paradox of narratives that weave seamlessly and beautifully and allow Nolan to not only discuss his themes in front of the audience, but literally involve them in the deception and intrigue he's talking about. It's a magic trick of its own making, and the way it aims to fool and encourage the audience into the ideas brings an incredible sense leaving the theatre - the feeling that something integral has been proved about your very perception and interpretations of not only what you've just witnessed, but also perhaps your entire life.\nThis truly incredible magical trickery is only possible though (in the words of the film itself in fact) if there's a show to distract the audience from their own willing ignorance, and on that front Nolan amazingly delivers what is probably his most immersive character experience of all (in part thanks to his incredible lead actors) that not only brings another layer of brilliance to the whole experience, but also serves to prove that Nolan is completely bang-on about what he's saying - we don't really want to know the truth after all.\nAs a result of all this, The Prestige is one of the few films that literally lays out its stance on its ideas and actually succeeds, as not only does it do so completely in the shadow of your absorption; it also genuinely proves everything to you by the end. You've been completely fooled, and the fact it's so engaging and deceptive means that even after countless re-watches, Nolan is proved so right, and equally proved as the directorial king of this generation.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Nolan is right. Once you fully know the secret, even though you want to be fooled, the final Prestige can lose some of its first gut-punching impact.\nVERDICT: 'The Prestige' is a two-hour magic trick? with an awful lot to tell and an equal amount to engage. Christopher Nolan's best film is pure, brilliant genius, and it will always be one if my all-time favourites.",

            "content": "The Prestige has to one of the weakest films that Christopher Nolan ever put out, but still I love it's ambition. The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay adapted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. \n\nThe story of the film follows with Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, stage magicians performers in late 19th century London and America . Both obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, and Rebecca Hall.\n\nThe one thing that I like about the prestige is his ambition, of how competition works mainly with the two actors Christian Bale and Huge Jackman, both did a fantastic job with the characters. For saying that I love Christopher Nolan's films, it's very ambitious and ambiguous. It does show the weakness of the story. I have never read the book, for seeing this film back into 2007, it's really quite curious to read the book. \n\nThe moral of the story is really shows by what competition can drive through and vengeful revenge to one another. It shows it's human progression of competition. It's not really mainly on the performance of magic. What Christopher Nolan was trying to drive through is competition and revenge. \n\nI really do like the prestige, I just wish that the film had a stronger ending to it. In the middle of the film I quite know what's going on and how the magicians was doing there bitting onto one another. The cinematography is really good, the direction is really good, but this is one of the stories that I just cannot related to a Christopher Nolan Film. But the ambition of the film of humanity of competition and revenge is such a key to this movie. \n\nGrade: 8.5/ 10",

The Prestige is a great film because it is multi-layered, intricately written and demands the full attention of the viewer.  It often cross-cuts back and forth between two separate narratives, which means you need to be completely engaged in the film or you'll end up confused.  I've also never seen a film about magicians and showmanship before, so the Prestige opened up my eyes to a whole new film genre.  Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson were all great as the leads.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/4ZM11a",

Bale believes in devoting himself entirely no matter the cost mind, body, sole and even sacrificing everything he loves for the devotion to his idea of art. Jackman wants all the prestige as he is a wonderful showman who wants to be the man who comes out of the box not the man inside. Lives intertwined obsession of how Bale does his version of the transported man he goes on a journey to find his answer. His ambition is equal to the task, on his journey he finds something un natural and uses it to \"beat\" bale. Obsession, rage and envy drives Jackman to be everything he originally despised. In the end the simplicity of Bales prestige is the end of Jackman. Bale was the opposite he was a dreadful showman but a wonderful magician with his own demons and secrets that lead the woman he loved to madness. The back and forth rivalry, the script, dialogue and direction by Nolan is outstanding, mesmerizing and clever beyond imagination. That's what he does as a director. I watch this film at least twice a year and I always get something new out of it. He reaches heights of imagination that are confounding and amazing to watch. To me this film is perfect.",

The excelling rivalry between the two magicians is gripping throughout the film and the obsession with each other is almost palpable. However, it was the final act which I was left disappointed by. Michael Caine's character explains that there are three parts to a magic trick. The Pledge, where the situation is introduces. This is followed by the The Turn, where what we believe should happen is challenged. Finally, The Prestige, where all is set right again. The film failed in the final act by not referring back to the world of the pledge occurred but instead moves into the realm of sci-fi.

Great performances molded with a great story told through some mind bending magic tricks really has you guessing the entire movie and keeps it fresh and unpredictable as Nolan does all too well.

My favorite is probably Memento. I came out of that movie speechless, I didn't think someone could tell a story in such an ambitious way. I owe a lot to Nolan, he made me love movies and he introduced to some incredible directors.  But even though I'm a Nolan fanboy, I'm not going to let that get in the way of my criticism, I still have quite a few issues with this film I saw called \"The Prestige\"\nEvery time I watch The Prestige I am completely captivated watching these two lifelong enemies rattle each other cadges, but for some reason the third act of the movie just doesn't do it for me, it becomes predictable. The reveals don't really make a lot of sense and they feel shoehorned in at points. And that last scene in the movie with Angier and Alfred is nothing short of crap. It's the stereotypical death scene where the guy gets everything explained to him before he dies. It's lazy and a terrible ending to an otherwise good movie. The story of \"The Prestige \"is a great one but it could have been better. \"He's a wonderful magician, but a terrible showman.\" -Cutter. So although, the story of The Prestige is a great one, I think Nolan could have done much better with his directing, and Jonathan Nolan with his writing. \n\tThe actors in \"The Prestige\" were an interesting bunch. Wolverine, Batman, Black Widow, and Ulysses Klaue. Fun Fact: Andy Serkis, Tesla's assistant, is the dude who played Gollum in LoTR and Ceaser in the planet of the apes reboots. He's also going to be Supreme Leader Snoke in The Force Awakens, oh and he also helped Mark Ruffalo and James Spader with their motion capture work in Age of Ultron. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that they chose very well know actors to plays these rolls, and although these actors are amazing and they played their parts perfectly, it was seriously distracting. And it didn't help that everybody in the class was shaking in their seats when they recognized someone on screen. What I'm trying to say is that, with smaller films like this it's sometimes better to cast unknown actors so your audience can focus on the actual film instead of looking at Scarlet Johansson's chest.\nIf I remember correctly, we were supposed to pay attention to the lighting and sound. So here goes. Sound was good, electricity sounded awesome when tesla was walking through it. The score was alright, nothing special about it though. The lighting however was beautiful. I absolutely adore natural lighting. Not a lot of filmmakers can do it right but Nolan certainly had no problem making it look \"natural\". Some reviewers were complaining that it looked bland and tasteless but I disagree, the tone of the film required it to look that way and it totally worked. It's rare that the lighting is actually my favorite part of a film but in this case it totally is. Credit here goes to Wally Psifer, who has lit all of Nolan's films except for The Following and Interstellar. \n\n\tSo overall, pretty good flick. Yah sure, there are some huge issues with the story and casting decisions but these are things that can be ignored if you're not expecting another Memento or Inception. Solid 7/10.",

            "content": "The Prestige might be the ultimate test to see if a movie with a twist ending can live up to the hype when a viewer goes in (like me) already knowing the twist. It also might be the ultimate test to see if I can talk about a movie with a twist ending without giving away any spoilers. If you don't know, The Prestige is a film about 2 aspiring young magicians who develop a heated rivalry and work tirelessly to outdo one another, and also discover their rival's secrets. I found the non-linear story-telling to be quite difficult to wrap my mind around. For the first 30 minutes or more of the film I was at a complete loss to figure out what was happening when. As a result I imagine this is a film that might benefit from a re-watch. I will say that the Nolans crafted a script that was quite complex, and even with full knowledge of the secrets of their tricks going in, there was plenty to watch and try to figure out. In that way the movie succeeds at being a perfectly executed magic trick in itself, because hours after watching you're trying to figure out how the director did that, and if you didn't know the secret going in you might even be impressed by the way the movie tricked you despite all the foreshadowing that they loaded the film with. It's a brilliant exercise in misdirection. So, I have no complaints about the script, it is quite inventive and original.\n\nHugh Jackman did a decent job with his role. I felt that, at times, he was a bit one-note when all he seemed to be portraying was frustration and jealousy. However, towards the end of the film he's asked to do a lot more emotionally and he pulls it off. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is just remarkable from start to finish. He probably has the more difficult role to execute, but he does it brilliantly. I bet watching the film multiple times would help you to catch even more nuance in his performance. Scarlett Johansson was a bit wasted in her role as the magician's assistant. She plays a key part in the plot as a go-between for the two competitors, but she doesn't get to do much with that. Perhaps if she were allowed in on the secret with one of the men it might have given her more to do. Surprisingly, the female performance that most impressed me was Rebecca Hall who plays the wife of Christian Bale. She is essential in figuring out what is really happening, and plays her mix of confusion and heartbreak perfectly. There are a number of other great actors in the supporting roles including names like Michael Caine, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis (not in motion capture) and they all perform brilliantly. It's a great cast list, and each actor was well-suited to their role.\n\nThere were a few things that I didn't enjoy about the experience of watching The Prestige without the wonder of being surprised at the end. This is where I'll have to delve into some spoilers, so I apologize. First of all, I thought the makeup effects were not very good. I'd be really surprised if most people were fooled by Fallon because he looks like Christian Bale with a horrible fake beard and glasses on. However the real dilemma I struggled with was the illogical nature of so many of the plot points when you know the end. Why would the brother who didn't love their wife ever go home to her? I realize they took turns, but it seems the brother who loves her would always get the turn with her. Next, why did Hugh Jackman feel the need to murder his doubles, couldn't he have figured out a way of executing the trick in the exact same way that Bale did once he had a single duplicate of himself? Also, why didn't the brother who wasn't in jail take the police to Jackman or something in order to clear his brothers' name instead of letting him die? Clearly he had Michael Caine on his side at that point, so they could have vouched for it being the same man that Bale was supposed to have killed. It even bothered me a little that they have it timed out how long to wait before it's too late for someone to escape the water trap, but they didn't take into account that the ax they were using couldn't break the stinking glass. A lot of this stuff is nit-picky, but it did bother me a bit while watching so it's worth mentioning. In general I thought the smarts of the movie outweighed the plot holes, so The Prestige is a good film that I'd like to watch again sometime. It's not quite on par with my favorite Nolan movies, but it's close.",

It seems that in most Nolan's film, the ending scene always appears at the opening but his narrative style however manages to make audiences to forget that regardless on the complexity of the content he tries to confuse us, it is actually a straightforward plot with the key answers already revealed indirectly at the first scene. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity. Although with a bit of weaker scores (due to no Hans Zimmer), Nolan's smart piece of magical art is interesting to stress that the trick of victory comes only when a person overlook and think that he has already won the rival.",

Performances by Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden provide excellent counterpoint to one another; they display each character's personal agony in contrasting ways. Every personality in the film serves a definite purpose, and the thicker the story gets, the more tangled and excruciating the magician's missions become. The battles between Angier and Borden become increasingly more dramatic and teeter on the precipice of impossibility. Both men suffer loss on their quest to triumph over the other. The conclusion of the film is the prestige of the act, the part where it all comes together. And the movie's final shot of the room beneath Angier's stage-row upon row of evidence of Angier's obsession, ghastly illuminated by flame-provides a haunting reminder that when one loses sight of their true ambition, they will meet their certain downfall. This film is a superb addition to anyone's viewing resume. I highly recommend The Prestige.",

Rome had to fall at some point, right? Well, not here. Or yet for that matter. Nolan's middle-child film is a twisty tale of battling magicians in Victorian-age England, and the film where he really came into his own. An adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel, Bale stars opposite Jackman in the tale of two magicians driven to dangerous and deadly lengths in their personal and professional feud. With a plot hinging on a series of progressively more unpredictable twists and turns, The Prestige was bound to provoke a number of divergent responses. And it did, splitting consensus almost down the middle. Sure the cleverness of its ending is iffy, but the excellent Wally Pfister cinematography and that complex, cross-cutting story give it a wonderful transparent character. It couldn't be anything except a Chris Nolan film",

You never know who it is you're supposed to root for until you finish the 5th or 6th viewing, and even then, it still makes you question whether or not it even counts as a character we're meant to root for. I especially love Nolan's direction, and how it evokes the works of Terrence Malick as well as Film Noir. There's something about his voice overs that really helps give the film a certain atmosphere of being so close to the answers yet further away from them as well. The ending, I guess, can be disappointing for some, but unlike Nolan's other works, where the exposition get's in the way of the meaning, this film manages to suck you into it's message perfectly with the answer's given to you. It really catches you off guard. All in all, a fanatstic film that I will continue to claim as my second favorite film.",

Cutter, an experienced and well lived magician, trains a couple of young, talented artists to take over in his footsteps. Borden and Angier. After a magic trick goes horribly wrong at the cost of Angiers wives life, the men go their seperate way. Only to find themselves locked in a twisted rivalry that not only threatens their lives, but the lives of the loved ones around them. Conceptually it seems like a straight forward tale, however to call it that would be to disservice its true worth. The Prestige dazzles in a time where magic dazzled the public. The fight to pull of the greatest trick ever, something no one has ever seen before and forcing yourself to put everything you have on the line to embody it. The film is chalk full of layers, the psychological torture of 2 men trying  to outdo each other, double lives, science being warped for ones sadistic good, affairs and double crosses. It's all here in this period piece and its so satisfying to watch it all fold out, Nolan really should consider this his masterpiece. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both equally fantastic in their roles, cast perfectly to their strengths as human beings and actors. Bale, a more methodical actor takes on the role of Borden, a man who lives his magic, every waking second. Jackman, Angier, who's showmanship and talent shine through in popularity. Supporting is none other than Michael Cane one of his most heavily involved roles from Nolan, he is the important glue that holds this together, the pathway in for the audience, into this wild and warped world. Scarlett Johanson plays Olivia, a gorgeous and outgoing assistant who ends up becoming part of the duelling duo's mind games. David Bowie plays real life scientist Tesla, he adds an obscurity to the role which is subtle but needed, with his assistant played by Andy Serkis, who puts in a worth while performance but has nowhere near enough screen time. The film flits back and forth, in and out of situations and times, flinging us where we need to be, when we need to be. In fact only in our final moments do we truely realise the magnitude of what both these mens obsessions have caused. The editing is sharp and concise, very rarely did i see a flaw, never was i bored and the grade was gorgeous. The set design, costume and photography are all presented flawlessly. Whether its the dank streets of pre Victorian England or the Colorado Springs, each one is alive and breathing and contrast perfectly off one and another. I have watched this film, many times now, still have i to find any crippling flaws, there are barely any. It gives us the right portion, the performances are spot on, the visuals gripping, the concept outragiously good. Simply put, this is Nolan's finest hour, yes he bedazzles with continuation and outragiously ambitious and outstanding films but this here, is where the magic truly lies.",

Choosing a somewhat convoluted delivery method, the story does twist and turn interestingly enough, but fails to emotionally fully engage with the viewer, partly because of the twist or the Prestige if you wish. The acting in the film is consistently good, somewhat subdued and perhaps a little to tame, perhaps because of the material itself, because all the principals are usually much more expressive. What 'The Prestige' does well is the tempo, but for the astute viewer who can spot the subtle hints and winks, the film can feel like it's dragging towards the end. The production design is excellent and the work from DP Wally Pfister is especially noteworthy in the lighting given the films darker color palette. All in all, The Prestige is solid and unspectacular film-making at its most technically proficient and emotionally unavailable.

            "content": "\"Are you watching closely?\" A quote that could possibly epitomize most of Nolan's work, \"The Prestige\" follows the directors investment in narratives that are continually challenging and demand attention. After my second viewing, the magician seems the perfect metaphor for Nolan's intentions behind the camera: a man who creates misdirection through various illusions. And just like the interest invested in the mysterious nature of the magicians tricks, \"The Prestige\" is a film that will be continually revisited in an attempt to find the truth behind the directors apparitions.\r\n\r\nMoving from blockbuster territory to a period piece about two magicians rivalry that is warped into a tale of spite and revenge, \"The Prestige\" still reflects (as previously mentioned) Nolan's typical execution of a difficult narrative structure. Essentially, the narrative begins moments before the eventual conclusion of the film. From this position, one of the central protagonists Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) takes the audience back into the past through his rivals journal, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). However, when the narrative integrates back into the past, Nolan adds further difficulties to this narrative by switching the narrators from Borden to Angier. When Angier takes over the narration - and like most Nolan films - the story gains layers of complexity. As mentioned in my previous view of \"Memento,\" Nolan's continual investment in a difficult narrative structure is undeniably one of the fundamental reason why his film are so riveting - he forces you to pay attention. Moreover (similar to \"Memento\" and \"Inception\"), these complex narrative structures are not only a stylistic feature, but rather a further contribution to the substance of the film. And with a story that focuses of lies, deceit and illusion, the difficult narrative not only reflects the subject matter, but also the characters motives.\r\n\r\nIn various interviews, Nolan has stated that \"The Prestige\" represented a \"self-conscious\" reflection of his film-making. Considering his body of work (and as I previously mentioned), it is quite obvious to see how this period piece represents Nolan's style. Filled with constant turns and twists, Nolan seems to thrive on misdirecting the audience. And while much of the criticism for \"The Prestige\" is focused on these supposedly cheap twist and tricks, once again (and just like the narrative structure), these twist and turns are not merely thrown in for attempted shock value, but rather contribute to the fundamental concern of the films subject matter. After watching the film for the second time, there are continues clues that Nolan hints at (if you're watching carefully) that clearly indicate these eventual outcomes.\r\n\r\nSimilar to his previous body of work, \"The Prestige\" deals with an essential theme for the director: obsession. Like most of his characters, this obsession has great consequences as the narrative bends through a rivalry of various sacrifices that two human beings make for the purpose of revenge. Furthermore, what makes this interchange extremely compelling is that the distinction between 'hero' and 'villain' is continually being destabilized (a constant trait of Nolan, especially in \"Memento\" and \"Insomnia\"). At times we are on Angier's side, and at times we are on Borden's side. Essentially, Nolan is reflecting that morality is redundant when people are obsessed for a particular outcome as they are willing to do anything to achieve it.\r\n \r\nIf \"Memento\" was Nolan's visual adaption of the postmodern condition, then \"The Prestige\" is his visual - and rich - adaptation of the romantic novel. From sublime landscapes, the dichotomy between imagination and science and of course the central concern being obsession (a central thematic for the Romantics), it is quite evident to see the literary influence on Nolan period piece. And I know these particular themes are not an interest for certain casual viewers, however, these certain themes add a level of interests for people (like me) that love to dissect films.\r\n\r\nCurrently being in a stage of watching Nolan films consecutively (\"The Prestige\" being the third), it seems Nolan's is undeniably one of the great storytellers of modern cinema and \"The Prestige\" - while lacking the complexity of \"Memento\" - still delivers a more refreshing narrative and character dynamics than most.",

It's rushed but works. The entire film focuses on the attempts of these 2 men to outclass one another and how they end up bringing great pain to themselves. The Premise is quite basic but Nolan juggles the storyline and muddles it in a way that makes it not so easy to follow. This movie is more of a puzzle than a meaningful film. It keeps playing tricks on you but after a while the novelty wears off. It's too smart for its own good. The more tricks it plays on you, the more you raise your eyebrow and go, \"Hmm, did he need to do that?\" because most of these stunts don't contribute anything to the primary storyline. In a movie that's very cold hearted at its core, you can't be emotionally invested and these tricks turn frustrating, even annoying. But the 3rd Act is what really killed it for me. The Prestige builds up a lot of suspense in the first 2 Acts and the answer it provides at the end is-\"Magic\"- and that was so unsatisfying to me. Another major problem I had with it was that in this cold rivalry between these 2 despicable men, Nolan actually does reveal a winner, which was again very unnecessary. Through the film I thought it was trying to convey the moral that, \"if you fixate yourself on bringing pain to someone else you end up hurting yourself\". But the ending threw that right out of the window. \nThe Prestige is defined as the final act of a magic trick that instills fascination; ironically, it's the prestige of this film that let it down. Well the Prestige isn't art but it's still fun to watch; at least the first time.",

When it comes to filmmaking, time has both changed the craft of movie making with new techniques on how to make a movie yet the age old tradition of framing shots and telling stories for film has always stayed constant throughout history. Usually when you ask a person who their favorite directors are they will most likely say someone like Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, etc.; point being classic filmmakers have become legendary while current filmmakers obviously have not heralded the same kind of cultural admiration.  With that in mind, I can say with an utmost confidence that the best current filmmaker of the 21st century is the magnificent Christopher Nolan. What can I say; the man is an absolute genius when it comes to how to make a movie. The key to Nolan's success as an artist is his understanding that to make groundbreaking original films he has to first give into the studio and make a film for the masses, in return granting him the ability to make his own films. In 2005 Nolan made the critically acclaimed Batman Begins for Warner Brothers, his studio film. Begins was monumental success that instantly placed Nolan atop the mount Olympus of cinema. After having given the studio their blockbuster Nolan was given the freedom to make any movie he felt would fulfill his artistic vision; for in 2006 Christopher Nolan released The Prestige as his follow up to Batman Begins, reteaming with collaborators Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Having seen the entire Dark Knight trilogy, Memento and Inception I instantly wanted to find more films by Nolan and happened to stumble upon The Prestige while shopping for Blu-Ray's. I was aware of the premise at the time, two rival magicians competing with one another, but that was it. The whole magician idea just oozed with originality and when I finished watching this film an immediate satisfaction enveloped me, for The Prestige is a very good film, yet quite sadly not a masterpiece. Initially the way the film would skip between the past and present was somewhat frustrating because unlike, say True Detective, it was difficult to determine what was past and what was present; however, when I finished the film all became clear. The entire time I watched the film I was aware a twist may be incorporated somehow in the end, that would make everything clear, yet when the twist came I was sadly underwhelmed. With the bad out of the way I can now discussed what I liked about the film, first and foremost being the tight script. I was always interested in the both characters admiration to steal each other's tricks to achieve the best allusion of all; very compelling stuff. Nolan's visuals are of course eye candy and the performances delivered from the cast are of course top notch as well. Overall, the good far out way the bad for this film. There is a reason Christopher Nolan has received such acclaim for his work, simply because he Is a genius. He mixes together brilliantly original concepts with most importantly, a great script, to form a cinematic marvel. In my opinion, The Prestige, is one of Nolan's less impressive films simply because it is not quite as thought provoking as his other work, yet this film is still an achievement in its own right.",

All the characters are wooden, emotionless and almost heartless. The Prestige loses all it's charm within the first 15 minutes. The cinematography is decent and Bale and Jackman keep it interesting for a while but even their attempts turn monotonous after a few moments.

            "content": "Are you watching closely? Sorry, are you reading closely? I don't think that question made sense, but anyway it's a giveaway to the next Christopher Nolan film I'll be talking about: THE PRESTIGE (2006). The Prestige is based off the Christopher Priest novel of the same name, and also reunited Nolan with his Batman Begins actors: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. The film also stars Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, and Caesar himself Andy Serkis (!!!). The Prestige is a drama set during the late 19th century revolving around the rivalry between two stage magicians (Bale and Jackman) in London attempting to one-up the other by creating the best stage illusion; however their battle soon puts both of them on dark, twisted paths that ultimately ends with tragic results for them and their loved ones. In this film Nolan once again uses a non-linear storyline, yet still takes it a step further. The Prestige starts off with Albert Borden (Bale) getting accused of killing his rival Robert Angier (Jackman) and while in prison he gets a hold of Angier's secret journal which sets the audience into a flashback from Angier's perspective. BUT in the flashback some parts of it are of Angier reading Borden's secret journal to find his illusion secrets which sets us into another flashback of Borden's life. And the film switches in between these timelines throughout, essentially showing each magician's perspective of particular events that occur within the film.\n\nLike every Nolan film, all of the performances are great but in my opinion Hugh Jackman is the standout. His portrayal of Angier was absolutely captivating, and I've said it before and I'll say it again: I absolutely love it when he's acting as characters other than Wolverine (don't get me wrong though I LOVE Wolverine) because it shows so many other layers to his acting abilities. Unfortunately he and Nolan never work together again after The Prestige but hopefully sometime in the future they will. Bale was also fantastic as Borden and his chemistry with Rebecca Hall, who plays his wife in the movie, was awesome. In some scenes they have conversations about whether or not Borden loves her... And every single time I'm enthralled by those scenes because it continuously showcases that sometimes this guy is more obsessed with finding the best trick than caring about his family (of course there's ANOTHER reason why but that gets into spoiler territory). I especially loved Hall's performance, who I think is a little underrated and fairly not seen as much in Hollywood. Then she gets starring roles in crap movies like Transcendence (coincidentally directed by Wally Pfister, the DP of The Prestige). Scarlett Johansson was equally great but you actually see much less of her than you might think. Also, to put it simply, David Bowie as Nikola Tesla was badass.\n\nI completely have to applaud Nolan for re-creating the 1800s-London vibe so well. Not that I've lived during that time or anything but it every set piece looked so real and with Wally Pfister's amazing cinematography, the beauty of it all only increases. Though Hans Zimmer goes on to works with Nolan several times in his career, he DID NOT compose the score for The Prestige; it was actually Memento's David Julyan whose haunting melodies in The Prestige were extraordinary. Although I completely love The Prestige and the overall story that was adapted from the award winning novel, I must say it was a little annoying to see Nolan once again use a non-linear structure for his films. He did it with Following and again for part of Batman Begins. Of course I've never read the novel so it could be that it has a similar structure to the film, and if so then Nolan did a fantastic job of executing it.\n\nBy far the best part though was THE TWIST ENDING... ABRACADABRA! Only those who have seen it will get that. But damn that ending was spectacular and it's a great twist because it totally caught me by surprise and actually made sense. It's always fun to have a twist like that because it has your jaw dropping by the end of the movie and keeps thinking about the complexity and ingenuity of the twist. Of course that's SPOILER territory so I won't delve too much into it (unfortunately). This movie is great and it's so different from other magician related films, in that from beginning to end it's a full on drama-there is no quirky, childish humor instituted into the movie, all the characters and their actions can be taken seriously. Fans of both magic and Nolan can enjoy The Prestige, I assure everyone that. But for those who have seen it, go off in the comments on what you thought of that awesome ending - 8.5/10",

            "content": "The Prestige was directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2006.  He was the maker of Inception, The Dark Knight, and other iconic movies.  The original story that the film came from was Christopher Priest's novel of the same name.  It was published in 1995.  \n\tThe main plot of the movie revolves around a magician, Rupert Angier, (played by Hugh Jackman) trying to figure out another magician's trick, known as \"The Transported Man\".     The other magician, Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale), ends up trying to perfect his own act against his rival.\n\t\nAdditional characters include...\n\tA man named Cutter (Michael Caine) who helps Angier with his magic acts. \n\tSarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) is Gordon's wife.  She helps the audience figure out the truth of \"The Transported Man\".  \n\tOlivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) was Angier's assistant; she eventually grows close to Borden.  \n\tNikola Tesla (David Bowie) who helped create the transportation machine for Angier. \n\t\n\tThis movie, being directed by Nolan, did have in Inception-type feel to it.  It is a movie that that is constantly surprising you with what comes next and makes you actually think about what can/will happen.  It keeps you guessing until the end.  I really enjoyed the movie because it made what seemed impossible and magically into science.  Just when you think you understand what is going on, the movie takes an unexpected turn and makes it into something you would have never even thought of.  I also thought it was interesting how they incorporated real people into the movie (such as Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison).\n\tMy favorite quote of the movie is the opening line of Cutter's speech about magic.  He says that \"every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called \"The Pledge\". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called \"The Turn\". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call \"The Prestige\".\"  Usually magic seems like something phantasmagorical and surreal, but he turned it into something that sounds normal and routine.\n\tI believe the main theme of this movie was obsession, jealousy, and how it can drive people crazy.  The main problem in the movie was that Angier wanted to \"wow\" more of his audience than Borden did.  He became so obsessed with the illusion that it was the only thing he cared about all the way up to his death.",

Its story is about two rival stage magicians at the end of the 19th century who want to create the best illusion. A powerful plot performed by an even powerful cast makes this movie a must-see. I absolutely enjoyed it, though you must be focused to understand the big reveal in the end. Starring Hugh Jackman (X-men films, Australia), Christian Bale (The Dark Knight Trilogy, American Psycho), Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation, The Avengers), sir Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception), Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, King Kong), Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly, Looper) and David Bowie (Labyrinth, the Last Temptation of Christ). Are you watching closely?\n\nLondon, end of the 19th century - Robert Angier (Jackman), his wife Julia (Perabo) and best friend Alfred Borden (Bale) are working as assistants of a magician. The most spectacular act is the one with the water tank engineered by John Cutter (Caine), where Julia is tied with ropes, locked inside the water tank and makes her escape. One night the act turns into a tragedy as Julia drowns. Angier blames Borden, who cannot recall if he used an experimental knot.\n\nBorden gets married to the beautiful Sarah, who gives birth to Jess. But in order to earn money for his family, Borden begins to perform as 'the Professor' with the help of his engineer Bernard Fallon. In the meantime, Angier has started a career of his own. As 'the Great Dalton', he stands on stage with the help of Cutter and his new love Olivia (Johansson). But it doesn't take long before Borden and Angier want to damage each other's reputation by the use of sabotage.\n\nEventually Angier becomes obsessed with finding the best illusion. As Olivia and Cutter leave him, he travels the world in search of Nikola Tesla (Bowie) and his assistant Mr. Alley (Serkis), who show him their teleportation device...",

It left me thinking extensively on what just happened, and whether or not there was more to it than what Christopher Nolan has led me to believe. The Prestige has become one of the lesser known favorites from Nolan's filmography. Some have regarded this film as one of the director's best efforts but I never really felt that at all whenever I contemplate about this film. This is most definitely an improvement from Batman Begins and at par with his second film, Memento. It just can't make the climb to his spectacular films like Inception and The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe Prestige was written by both Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, this would be the latter's first adapted screenplay, and was based on the novel \"The Prestige\" written by Christopher Priest. Nolan has written a wonderful story about revenge, obsession, sacrifice and magic. Similar to Memento, the film's story is told in multiple layers, with one following something and the other following another thing but both will eventually come together and wrap things up. The revenge aspect of the story doesn't feel unique, as it goes where one expects it would go, but the subject being explored is. I wished we were given more about these characters as it would have given us more understanding of their intrinsic drives in beating the other man; they just don't feel comprehensive enough. The film essentially follows both magicians, and this is done in order for us to stay detached and see the rivalry in the eyes of a third person. Though I do wonder whether the film would be much better suited with a more personal approach; focusing on one person and spending more time exploring him. I felt that Angier's story was not as interesting as compared to Borden's due to the simplicity in the character's values and drives. Borden in the other hand demonstrated multiple layers to himself that gains more appreciation with repeated viewing. It's his story that had me wanting to go back and figure out how he managed his life. The film contains multiple twists and turns, and the rate of it increases as the film moves on. I wasn't one of those who were annoyed with the bombardment of twists the film offers because I felt they were plausible and appropriate given the subject matter. I wished that the film gave us a bit more from the characters impacted from the rivalry; for example Sarah and Olivia. Sacrifice is a big theme in this film, and these characters, along with Julia, are the symbol of that, and if the audience sees how much they have suffered because of this dispute then it would have been more heartbreaking to watch. The film's dialogue was pretty good; driving the plot along while still entertaining us with information about magic and it's importance. \n\nThe film was directed by Christopher Nolan and this film was made right after Batman Begins. I think the success from Batman Begins allowed him to make this film with more artistic license. Nolan seems to be in much more control with this film than his previous film, something that was also found in his second film \"Memento\". Nolan has made a pattern for himself in making blockbuster entertainments like The Dark Knight trilogy and in between he would release more personal and artistic films, which includes Inception, The Prestige and the upcoming Interstellar. Nolan loves to create films that would have us thinking and he places this on the surface of his films. Sometimes directors prefer to hide the film's complexities underneath the surface in order for the film to be more accessible, but Nolan makes sure it is in full display and at the same time ensuring accessibility. The Prestige is definitely his most complex storyline as he tackles a subject that many people are ignorant of. Watching this film doesn't make a person more informed about the craft because that isn't the film's intention. Nolan was also able to create this parallel connection with magic and filmmaking which isn't really groundbreaking but no other film has been more obvious or as literal as this. Certain scenes in this film seems to be almost directly aimed at the audience, particularly in the last few minutes of the film. Nolan is no stranger to fragmented storytelling, it's found in his earlier films like Memento and Batman Begins. The Prestige is a bit of a step back, as it does feature layered storytelling, but flows chronologically and more simple. Also it felt confusing in trying to follow the story in certain moments, with sudden cuts that takes a while in establishing the scene. The film's needs a bit of work in the editorial department.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister. What he has created for The Prestige is this dark atmosphere that explores the more pessimistic side of magic and not the glamorous climate that is generally attached with it. The photography captures the grimy urban setting that was found during the time period, though it wasn't a focus for the film as the photography places more of it's focus in it's characters and it's ability to sell the film's magic. The film also has some scenes set in the snowy mountain areas of Colorado, capturing that sense of isolation and exile that Tesla suffered. The film's photography takes a more hand held approach which gives the audience the opportunity to be close to these magicians during the act but at the same time it allows Nolan to use it as a form of misdirect. Pfister really captured the aura of success in magicians during the time period with many moments during their shows looking at these great men in the point of view of the audience member.\n\nThe film's score was composed by David Julyan. Julyan has worked with Nolan before in films including Memento and Insomnia. His work on The Prestige was quite disappointing, with very few moments actually creating a response from me. It never seems to create any elevated tension which was very disappointing. The orchestral score felt uninspired, with moments feeling very familiar to his work on Memento.\n\nThe film's acting is carried by it's main two leads, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The chemistry between the two actors was good but there was definitely a clear room for improvement. Bale was definitely a stand out in this film, surpassing his performance in Batman Begins. During subsequent viewings, I started seeing subtle things in his performance that shows how great he was. It was like seeing two sides of him, it just wasn't clear the first time because I was so heavily invested in trying to crack the story. Jackman on the other hand was a bit disappointing. It just couldn't match the complexity in Bale's performance. Jackman's character seems to be projecting only a handful of emotions and tends to repeat itself throughout the entire film. David Bowie as Tesla was surprisingly entertaining to watch. Though his character was really under-explored, he was still able to bring this aura of greatness, which in reality was a great man. Scarlett Johansson was decent as the magician's assistant, Olivia Wenscombe. Johansson didn't really bring anything extraordinary to the character, acting more as a pretty face to look at. Rebecca Hall on the other hand was amazing as this woman who doesn't completely understand her husband. She has wonderful chemistry with Bale and I completely bought their relationship. Michael Caine as Cutter was average, giving a performance that I felt wasn't really memorable. It's always nice to see Andy Serkis as he I always see him committed to his roles and though this is one of his lesser films, he still was able to give his character a personality, making him memorable.\n\nOverall, The Prestige is a great film thanks to a unique and interesting use of magic in it's storytelling and a great performance from Christian Bale and Rebecca Hall. Though the film has it's flaws, there is enough good things about it that makes this a strong effort from Christopher Nolan.",

Watching this film doesn't make a person more informed about the craft because that isn't the film's intention. Nolan was also able to create this parallel connection with magic and filmmaking which isn't really groundbreaking but no other film has been more obvious or as literal as this. Certain scenes in this film seems to be almost directly aimed at the audience, particularly in the last few minutes of the film. Nolan is no stranger to fragmented storytelling, it's found in his earlier films like Memento and Batman Begins. The Prestige is a bit of a step back, as it does feature layered storytelling, but flows chronologically and more simple. Also it felt confusing in trying to follow the story in certain moments, with sudden cuts that takes a while in establishing the scene. The film's needs a bit of work in the editorial department.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister. What he has created for The Prestige is this dark atmosphere that explores the more pessimistic side of magic and not the glamorous climate that is generally attached with it. The photography captures the grimy urban setting that was found during the time period, though it wasn't a focus for the film as the photography places more of it's focus in it's characters and it's ability to sell the film's magic. The film also has some scenes set in the snowy mountain areas of Colorado, capturing that sense of isolation and exile that Tesla suffered. The film's photography takes a more hand held approach which gives the audience the opportunity to be close to these magicians during the act but at the same time it allows Nolan to use it as a form of misdirect. Pfister really captured the aura of success in magicians during the time period with many moments during their shows looking at these great men in the point of view of the audience member.\n\nThe film's score was composed by David Julyan. Julyan has worked with Nolan before in films including Memento and Insomnia. His work on The Prestige was quite disappointing, with very few moments actually creating a response from me. It never seems to create any elevated tension which was very disappointing. The orchestral score felt uninspired, with moments feeling very familiar to his work on Memento.\n\nThe film's acting is carried by it's main two leads, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The chemistry between the two actors was good but there was definitely a clear room for improvement. Bale was definitely a stand out in this film, surpassing his performance in Batman Begins. During subsequent viewings, I started seeing subtle things in his performance that shows how great he was. It was like seeing two sides of him, it just wasn't clear the first time because I was so heavily invested in trying to crack the story. Jackman on the other hand was a bit disappointing. It just couldn't match the complexity in Bale's performance. Jackman's character seems to be projecting only a handful of emotions and tends to repeat itself throughout the entire film. David Bowie as Tesla was surprisingly entertaining to watch. Though his character was really under-explored, he was still able to bring this aura of greatness, which in reality was a great man. Scarlett Johansson was decent as the magician's assistant, Olivia Wenscombe. Johansson didn't really bring anything extraordinary to the character, acting more as a pretty face to look at. Rebecca Hall on the other hand was amazing as this woman who doesn't completely understand her husband. She has wonderful chemistry with Bale and I completely bought their relationship. Michael Caine as Cutter was average, giving a performance that I felt wasn't really memorable. It's always nice to see Andy Serkis as he I always see him committed to his roles and though this is one of his lesser films, he still was able to give his character a personality, making him memorable.\n\nOverall, The Prestige is a great film thanks to a unique and interesting use of magic in it's storytelling and a great performance from Christian Bale and Rebecca Hall. Though the film has it's flaws, there is enough good things about it that makes this a strong effort from Christopher Nolan.",

Christopher Nolan has truly established himself as a director and this movie proves it. He is able to have an intriguing, new premise for every movie he makes that keeps you interested, even if it's two and a half hours long.                         \n\nAll I can really say about this film's premise is that it is about a rivalry between two magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) that takes place in London during the early 20th Century. Watching these magic shows was really entertaining, as well as seeing then invent new tricks. \n\nThe acting in this film was incredible. There's nothing you can go wrong with when you have a cast like this. Hugh Jackman was great, Christian Bale was great, as well as all of the side characters, specifically Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis.\n\nThe Prestige has some violence in it. People are shown drowning, one person hangs herself, another man is shot dead, and one character is shot in the hand so that it takes off two of his fingers, although you cannot see the fingers fly off. There is a little bit of cursing, but nothing too bad. \n\nOver all, The Prestige was interesting, fun to watch, and really made you feel invested in all of the characters, even the villains.",

Nolan really is a true, and of course ambitious director/writer, that got the courage to do something different.\n\nThe structure in The Prestige is similar to Memento, but still a bit less confusing. But it's still a non-linear movie and I really admire that! There're a lot of things in The Prestige I would love to talk about, because it really is a stunning movie, and it have over the years become one of my all time favorites. It's so ambitious, mind-bending and overall awesome! This is a movie that's up for discussion, over what it's really about and what REALLY did happen in it. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a lot of mind-bending in this one, especially after the first time you watch it. I really recommend to check this movie out, because it got so much to tell, especially when it comes to obsession, basic life and of course; \"magic\".\n\nOne of the greatest aspect with the director/writer C. Nolan is that he makes movies that's ambitious and that's bigger in every scale. Just look at Memento; he successfully combined the main character and his dysfunction to make new memories, to the whole movie. It's the same with The Prestige; the whole movie is a magic trick! Thats how incredible Nolan is! Great aspects with this movie are of course flawless performance's by Michael Cane, Christian Bale and of course Hugh Jackman, but also a high amount of unique moments that we haven't seen before and of course the magical ending! I also love that the movie is so much more than a basic classic one, it feels like a real trick, a real show with a real artist performing on stage. It even feels like I'm sitting in the audience, watching closely on the tricks. That's definitely a wow-thing with The Prestige! I also feel greatly entertained every time I watch it, because there're hints throughout the whole movie about what REALLY happen near the end. One smaller negative aspect might be the soundtrack, it's not by Hans Zimmer (surprisingly), and it doesn't feel that epic as it could have been.\n\nThe Prestige was a great movie the first time, but it wasn't until my second or third that I really understood that this really is one of the greatest ever made. In my eyes is it even greater than Inception and Memento, and just perfect <3. Everything from the dialogs to the acting is stunning, even though the soundtrack could have been better and that the trailers did spoil one specific part, so don't watch them! Watch the movie instead, because it's freaking incredible! This is a classic work from our beloved director/writer Christopher Nolan, he gives us these ambitious mind-bending movies of art that impresses everybody. I wonder how he does it, but remember; \"the secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything.\"\n\n\"Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled.\"\n\n9/10.",

Before I get to that I wanted to give kudos where it is do. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan do a tremendous job writing a taunt, compelling and intricate script that balances plot lines in characters' personal and professional lives. The continual one-upsmanship gives viewers engaged from start to finish, as it appears that Hugh Jackman has the upper hand and then quickly Christian Bale reemerges on top and vice versa. Particularly strong performances from Bale and Michael Caine. \n\nWhat really struck me was how rewatchable this movie is. For instance, you can watch The Sixth Sense twice, but will get relatively little out of the second viewing, other than to see how M. Night Shyamalan pulled off the twists. Also consider Fight Club. Fight Club holds up after several watches, but the signs of the twists become more apparent each time, leading to diminishing returns. \n\nTo Nolan's credit, The Prestige holds up much like Memento. Every time you watch either movie, you get something new out of it. The tricks and illusions you're watching on screen are also being performed under your nose. While you wonder how Bale pulls off the transporting man, you don't realize that the answer is right in front of you. It's these layers that you can continuously peel from the audience perspective that makes The Prestige, not only a classic movie, but a testament to the thought and execution of Christopher Nolan.\n\nQuasi-related, here's my list of the best Nolan movies. For what it's worth, Insomnia (maybe) should be higher):\n\n1) Memento\n2) Inception\n3) Dark Knight\n4) The Prestige\n5) Dunkirk\n6) Interstellar\n7) Tenet\n8) Dark Knight Rises\n9) Batman Begins\n10) Insomnia\n11) Following",

This film is mainly told through constant flashbacks, which follows two competing magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). Bale and Jackman are perfect against each other, perfectly acting as terrific foils, while it is also impressive to see two comic book actors go against each other: Bale (Batman) and Jackman (Wolverine). The supporting cast is impressive, Michael Caine as Jackman's mentor, Scarlett Johansson as the assistant to both Bale and Jackman and Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife. The cinematography is bleak and as with Insomnia, the score here is also very spare. The film ends with an unexpected ending that you will never see coming, while so many questions are left unanswered. Upon finishing it, you will want to see it again just to further understand what was going on.",

Now, it's almost as if geeks had the fantasy that Wolverine would be pitted against Batman in this film, which finds Hugh Jackman (The Fountain) facing off against Christian Bale (Rescue Dawn).  But both actors are able to step away from their superhero alter-egos and make a convincing pair of dueling magicians.  They're surrounded by capable co-stars, including Scarlett Johansson (The Black Dahlia), Rebecca Hall (Frost/Nixon), Andy Serkis (King Kong), frequent Nolan collaborator Michael Caine (Children of Men), and a strange but fitting to the story David Bowie (Zoolander).  Additionally, the story - crafted from Christopher Priest's novel by Nolan and his brother Jonathan (Memento) - is real enough to believe, but fantastical enough to make it raise questions.  But that's pretty much the point of every Nolan feature is it not?  Have you watched a single movie with Nolan at the helm that doesn't make the viewer think?  I didn't think so.  It's not my favorite Nolan feature, but with such a clever story and a capable cast, it's quite an addition to his canon.",

Unfortunately this leads to some grave consequences. At one point Christian Bale becomes famous for a transportation act. Hue Jackman guesses how it is done but he is not completely happy because he wants the secret itself from Christian Bale.

            "content": "Completely gripping and mysterious.\n\nThe Prestige is set in Victorian London, a place where magic was insisted by many to be true. The film starts by showing Alfred Borden (Bale)  and Robert Angier (Jackman) acting as fake volunteers for a magic show, where Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo) was the lovely assistant for the Water Torture box trick; as done by the great Houdini. However, in this one show, Borden happened to tie the knots too tightly around Julia's wrist and she couldn't escape from the box. This event sparked an everlasting feud between Angier and Borden, with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige telling the story of such a hatred of one another, and how it became that Borden was standing accused for the murder of Angier.\n\nIn this movie, Christopher Nolan is doing what he does best, making an audience think. I see this as a great thing, Nolan is clearly a director that needs a beginning, middle and an end, but he very rarely uses them in that order. From the word go, The Prestige is bringing the audience in, making them ask questions of what they are viewing on the screen. Nolan himself is creating his own illusion, with the film never actually being all that it seems, waiting for as long as he possibly can until revealing the answers behind all the questions.\n\nHugh Jackman and Christian Bale's roles in this film complement each other extremely well. Even though they share a small amount of screen time, the interactions you get with one following the other or slyly looking from the wings give out such an array of emotion that the audience doesn't miss the too and fro of quick dialogue. The supporting cast is also on top form with Michael Caine playing Alfred the butler, sorry, no, Cutter, the mechanic behind the magical machines. Caine's performance gives off the same dignity that we know so well from Nolan's Batman Trilogy.\n\nThe Prestige is truly gripping and mysterious, but what else do you expect from a Christopher Nolan film?\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n8/10",

It just had everything I want from a movie. An awesome intro and outro monologue that can carry the movie by itself, great acting, and a story that's so twisted and interesting it blows your mind!\n\nI wasn't too crazy about the romances, they were a bit distracting and just a weak part of the story, but it hardly took away from the main story of the two main characters rivalry as magicians. It got intense and even shocking at times. And of course the narrative jumps around the timeline, as one thing is happening other things are being told through flashbacks, because it's Nolan's trademark that his stories not be told chronologically. Not to say it doesn't work for the movie, because it totally does.\n\nOverall, The Prestige is an amazing movie. It had great moments and quotable dialogue, everyone was on top of their game, the story had weak romances but was nonetheless kickass and it actually had a strong message, and it just happens to be in my top 10 favorites.\n\n9.5/10",

It is a possible to some viewers that the film, Prestige, will leave the viewers confused, and might not actually like it, but there will be others who will enjoy the film entirely and be adored by it. It is not for everyone. The film remains into this world of presumption the entire time until the end. It will keep the viewer guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. \n\nThe script, acting, surroundings, support, and everything were a superb.",

            "content": "This was a very interesting movie and the first non batman film I've seen from Christopher Nolan. The Prestige is the story of two magicians that go to far places to win over audiences with incredible tricks. Now what goes on behind the scenes is very enjoyable to watch. The magic tricks are all very cool and get somewhat messed up at the end and the acting is terrific, especially Christian Bale. Now the only issue I really had with this movie is that the story was told in a really crazy only out of order way which took me awhile to get used to but when I did, this movie was gold. I also have to say that the end had a great twist! Not saying but it's crazy. Otherwise, another great Nolan film.\n8.5/10",

            "content": "\"Are you watching closely?\"  From visionary director Christopher Nolan comes the fascinating psychological thriller The Prestige.  A competition between two magicians turns deadly as their obsession with perfecting their craft spirals out of control.  Featuring an all-star cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, the performances are quite impressive.  And the writing is very good; particularly in its character building, and the way that it incorporates its themes of obsession and illusion.  However, the plot is dark and cheats a bit.  Imaginative and well-crafted, The Prestige is a captivating thriller.",
