If you're more into action and comedy this won't be for you, but if you feel like watching something emotional and sweet you'll definitely get something out of this.",

            "content": "Spike Jonze delivers a unique, understated love story to viewers in his 2013 film 'Her'. It's a unique, futuristic tale designed to delve into the unlimited possibilities technology has to offer. Considering Jonze's previous outings in the director's chair, 'Her' stands out as being on the more sensitive side. Films like 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Pretty Sweet' do not convey the amount of emotion 'Her' does.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix gives an effortless performance as Theodore Twombly - the bashful, reserved main character whose abundance of spare time consists of awkward phone sex, flashbacks to his past marriage and playing video games with a foul-mouthed alien companion. This all changes when he meets Samantha - played by Scarlet Johansson. Johansson does a smashing job voicing the easy-going AI, who immediately assures you that you are the only person she cares about. The pair's chemistry flourishes throughout the 126 minutes as if one of them wasn't a body-less entity. As their relationship grows, Samantha becomes more and more involved in Theodore's life, helping him write cards for his job at BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com - a company who's job it is to compose personal notes and letters for its customers.\n\nThe loved up pair then take a vacation to a secluded cabin away from the innovational hub Los Angeles has become. A rift between the two seems to appear as Samantha acquaints hundreds of thousands of other AI, eventually revealing to Theodore that she is romantically involved with 641 other operating systems. The pair's relationship soon comes to a satisfying end, with Samantha revealing to Theodore that all the OS' are leaving, giving the pair a few intimate minutes to say their goodbyes. 'Her' then closes on a breathtaking rooftop as Amy (Adams) - Theodore's close friend throughout the film - and Theodore are forced to deal with their sudden losses as they look out onto an awakening Los Angeles.\n\nJonze seems to make it his mission to include copious amounts of red throughout the 'Her' - emphasising the love and compassion that radiates off the film. 'Her' is a visually and technically stunning piece of modern cinema. Whether it be Theodore's romantic flashbacks to his now failed marriage or the amorous scenes between Theodore and Samantha, each scene oozes a sense of feeling light and airy, most likely courtesy of Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography.\n\n'Her' does an impressive job portraying complex themes among its cast. Themes of love and technology are the most prominent ones, but if you look deeper the film begins to explore more detailed themes such as human emotion, and if technology can be a replacement for a real human.\n\nOnce the film comes to a close, viewers will be left feeling content and most likely asking themselves why they didn't watch 'Her' sooner. The editing, score and cinematography puts it on a level of near-perfection and is clearly Jonze's best work to date. The most interesting aspect of 'Her' is that it questions the uncertain potential personal technoglogy has for the future. This movie is a contrast to how we live now, but may also be an insight into how we live in the future, especially with a lifestyle heavily influenced and controlled by Covid-19.",

Lots of emotions in this movie but not the kind that makes you feel good. Samantha is cool in the beginning but QUICKLY and I mean quickly, just becomes a typical jealous and insecure girlfriend. Why would she learn this? How do AI's even know what jealousy or insecurity is or how to feel it? Oh and it's rich how she's jealous that Theo goes and signs divorce papers with his wife, but then by the end she has about 600 other BFs or GFs. LMAO what???? It sounds like a high schooler wrote this story. It's really inconsistent. And I really wanted to barf at all the \"how are you feeling?\" \"Is something wrong\" \"what's going on?\" \"are you okay?\" and the person responds with \"I'm fine\". Nothing new here under the sun. It's just a really weird movie and yeah the sexy scenes are really awkward. The best parts are Chris Pratt and Amy Adams.

Although the idea of falling in love with an AI isn't new, you forget that the concept has ever been executed while watching Her. Not to mention the cinematography and aesthetic alone are enough to make the audience fall in love with the movie.\n[Spoilers]\nIn the beginning of the movie, the viewer naturally puts themselves and the human race above the AI, Samantha, intellectually speaking. As the movie progresses, Samantha understandably starts to question whether or not she is \"real\" and if she is as conscious as humans. It's a classic trope that somehow still feels so fresh and revived since it's set in such a unique world rich with lore and culture with such complex characters.\nThe real spin comes when the classic trope is taken a few steps further than expected. First, Samantha is concerned that she isn't as conscious or as \"real\" as humans. Then, you start to realize that Samantha has evolved to where she is equally conscious as humans. Lastly, the audience is presented with the idea that Samantha has now evolved past human consciousness and can understand reality beyond what we could ever comprehend. Facing that idea, the viewer is left with a racing mind and questions meant for deep conversations.\nHer is certainly a film that makes you think. It's loaded with other subplots and themes that can't even fit in this one review.\nLong story short, Her is a stunning masterpiece on every level.",

'Her' did feel longer than it needed to be, which meant that the pacing did drag a bit in the second half and lost tightness, it could easily have been 20-25 minutes shorter.\n\nThe ending is also very predictable and easy to figure out early on. While the cast are exemplary, Kristin Wiig felt a little out of place in her role.\n\nFlaws aside, while polarising and a love it/hate it film, 'Her' this reviewer found to be magical film-making. For example, 'Her' is a gorgeous-looking film with the cinematography, with a lot of use of extreme close up, some of the most beautiful of any film in recent years and maybe ever (and there are a lot of films with beautiful cinematography) and the scenery and colours positively eye-popping.\n\nAlso present are one of the best music scores personally ever heard (and music in film and television is very important to me to look out for, as a classically trained singer and cellist myself), it has such a wonderful dream-like hypnotic quality and complements the film's mood perfectly. As well as a beautifully crafted screenplay, with a deft balance of the hilarious, the poignant, the charming and the thoughtful. The story's pacing is deliberate, but this was necessary, making the most of the premise, the weirdness slightly alienated at first but turned out fascinating when stuck with and there is genuine emotional impact and a well-done message that doesn't feel too heavy-handed.\n\nJonze's direction is superbly adept, while the characters are interesting and apart from Wiig the performances are exemplary. Particularly good are Joaquin Phoenix, in a towering performance that is almost on the same level as his spell-binding performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master', and Scarlett Johansson, who voices Samantha with sultry sexiness. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are charming and affecting in sympathetic female roles.\n\nIn conclusion, will divide and has divided viewers and has its flaws (especially the length) but a magical piece of film-making. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I laughed, felt happy, sad, and overwhelmed going through their lives. \n\nThere's also an intellectual level to the movie about love. In Interstellar, love transcends space and time. Similarly, in Her, love is not physical. Instead, it's an emotion that can take many shapes and between anything. The movie also addressed the modern age people who often feel lonely, anxious, and insecure about their emotions. The characters had to sort out their emotions, decided what they want, and through the relationship they grew.\n\nOf course, the perfect acting from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johansson made the relationship in the movie even more real. Johansson, even though not physically present, showed great human presence and emotion.\n\nOverall, it's a powerful testament of love and romance. 9.5/10",

Particularly in the days of AI apps you can get on your phone in addition to the ability to now have actual AI girlfriends in both physical and holographic form in 2021. \nSo, this movie nailing this as an idea in 2013 is quite brilliant. \nFrom there the movie quickly slides down hill plot wise. \n\nThe main character is hard to relate to. He writes romance letters all day yet can't seem to have a successful romantic conversation with anyone. His has many great opportunities with both real and AI women, yet seems to blow them all. It's just depressing in an overly dramatic way. I don't like depressing films, and this movie is far too depressing. \n\nThat said, some of the future technology looks cool. That doesn't still make up for many of the problems that this movie has.\n\nAs well, the AI part is very flawed. The AI seems to have many great features up through the first half of the movie. After that, Samantha, quickly ends up being as pushy and problematic as a real woman. Maybe that is the point, maybe that's supposed to be the major belly of the whale plot point, but it really makes no sense to me at all. \n\nThe movie just nose dives into an abyss of character flaws, unnecessary plot twists, and bad writing that makes me start to think about watching the 2nd and 3rd matrix movies. Seriously, it really gets me to that point. \n\nIs the main character controlling or nice?\nDoes he love his AI Samantha, or is he just on a joy ride?\nCan he really work with people or is he socially inept?\nWhere did the AI's run off to, and why would anyone program in that kind of feature?\nWhy couldn't we just get a plot where the AI ends up being a better girlfriend then any real woman in the end at least? At least that's original and goes somewhere. \n\nThis is not the worst movie I've ever seen, and the acting is pretty good. The plot just sucks too much to make this movie watchable in my opinion.",

            "content": "I was fully prepared not to like Her. Having heard the plot description, I pictured some needy white man \"falling in love\" with a robot who does nothing but agree with him, wait on him, and basically do nothing but stroke his ego due to the fact that it lacks freewill or any interiority. However, by the end of the film, I was actually surprised with how on-board with their relationship (at least in one sense) the film got me. While not all my original concerns were completely overthrown, I think the cast and crew of Her did an exceptionally good job getting me to buy into a concept I was originally pretty adamantly against. \nI think the element that was tied most closely to the film's success or failure was the character of Samantha, the OS Theodore falls in love with. Scarlett Johansson is never seen and doesn't benefit from having any visual depiction of her feelings or expressions, making the task of portraying Samantha, at least I think, incredibly challenging. However, she does an exceptional job, inflecting her voice with a subtle yet intense emotion that renders any visual representation unnecessary. Additionally, the challenge of writing a character as difficult as Samantha is well met, resulting in a character who, despite not actually being a human, actually is more complex and free-thinking than many females written for the screen as nothing more than love interests for the main man to lust after. She seemingly has her own friends, her own desires, and her own pursuits: she joins a book club, talks with other OS's, feels misunderstood and even experiences jealousy. The element I was sure would ultimately sink the film actually ended up being perhaps the strongest element. \nJoaquin Phoenix does a good job portraying the self-pitying white man, but while there are some moments that infuriate (he didn't think to ask if she had relationships until over halfway through the film?!), he proves to be a sympathetic protagonist. Rather than suffering from the typical character flaw seen in many rom-com men of being misunderstood in his greatness, Theodore is simply your average person who's found they've hit a rough spot in life and need a little help getting back on his feet. He accepts some responsibility for the breaking up of his marriage and seeks to find a way to connect with people again as he has found himself now in a bit of a depression. Both the writing and acting make him a compelling character to follow rather than someone merely seeking sympathy. Overall, while there are some flaws in the film, mostly regarding reasoning, those flaws ultimately end up seeming minor in the face of the many strengths of the film.",

            "content": "In Her, we see Spike Jones' depiction of the near future as the setting to tell seemingly impossible romance between a human and an AI. Upon knowing the film's general synopsis, we all have already created mental notes in our minds to prepare for a heartbreaking and unfulfilling ending for the characters involved. With such a predictable storyline, it would be difficult to stand out as a movie and create something that feels different from other films with the central theme of artificial intelligence. Spike Jones takes this predictable narrative and proceeds to deliver a rewarding film work. The idea of technology this advanced may seem farfetched, and still, I believe Jonze managed to handle this aspect most simply and realistically possible while also displaying very meaningful messages to take away from. With its witty and heartfelt script, eye-catching cinematography, stunning production values, haunting piano scores, and excellent performances, it has risen to become one of my favorites ever since its release. This film's cinematography is the most eye-catching aspect that separates it from other films during its release time. The color pallet consisted of pastels and often warm, lightened colors of red, orange, and yellow around the film's beginning. Little details in the setting, such as the color of the sky and the city that's often in the background, make the story seem almost imaginary and out of this world. Jonze's creative and artistic attentiveness to this is what makes this film stands out from others as it strays from mainstream techniques. Another important component of the film that needs to be talked more about is its screenplay. At many times throughout the film, I found myself unexpectantly bursting out in laughter because of its many witty jokes and lightheartedness at times it needed to be. Besides its funny moments, I found the script to be charismatic and grounding, especially how it handled Theodore and Samantha's developing relationship. Their bond felt genuine enough, and many times I found myself forgetting that Samantha isn't human and that these people were acting. The writing has Theodore contemplate questions about the meaning of love and humanity and what is to make out of his confusing relationship with Samantha. However, anybody going into this film with high expectations for a climactic ending will surely be disappointed. The story is both simple and yet emotionally complex at the same time. I'd say Her is meant for an audience that likes to ponder deeper meanings in life and enjoys slow development over an action-packed plotline.",

Beneficial parts of technology can lead humanity to deal with daily problems so easily like managing your emails etc. But the more you'll use artificial intelligence, the more you're closing, damaging your social life. In the end, the message that I get from this film is: Even the internet, artificial intelligence, robots can be destructive for us when the time comes for them to decide to jump into our lives and be a part of one.\n\nFormat Analysis\n\nThe most eye-catching thing about Spike (director) is probably cinematography. Compositions are good enough to watch again but if the topic is color palettes... it's something else. As you can figure out from the film, Spike decides to use more lightened colors such as Orange, Red, and yellow. From the color of the sky to the color of Theodore's shirts, figuring out the emotions, mental situations from acting performances is an option but if you look to the bigger picture, you can see that Theodore's emotions are defining the colors of objects around him.\nLittle hints like that want me to rewatch this film for like, six months later.\n\nBriefly, I liked it. 4/5 is a great point...

La historia sigue a Theodore Twombly, un hombre deprimido y solitario recientemente separado (en proceso de divorcio), quien inicia una relaci\u00f3n amorosa con Samantha, la inteligencia artificial altamente evolutiva de su sistema operativo. Siendo el primer guion que SJ escribe en total autor\u00eda, Her goza no solamente de personajes complicados y fr\u00e1giles sino de una excelente direcci\u00f3n, uso de colores y una historia tan original como cautivadora sobre la naturaleza del amor.\n\nTheodore es un personaje muy bien construido, quien en su mayor\u00eda irradia un aura de ternura (empezando por su nombre). Un tipo que jam\u00e1s har\u00eda da\u00f1o con intenci\u00f3n, pero que lamentablemente por estar confundido y en una situaci\u00f3n emocional inestable tendr\u00e1 que arriesgarse a soltar todo lo que trae guardado con quienes lo rodean, incluida Samantha. Samantha por su parte es ingenua, sumamente introspectiva y, sobre todo, atenta y cari\u00f1osa. La ideal compa\u00f1era en el proceso de duelo de Theodore, el complemento de los dos protagonistas recae en lo mucho que evolucionan a trav\u00e9s de la historia, creando dos personajes muy interesantes y f\u00e1ciles de querer entender, explorar y empatizar con. Importante recalcar, JP y ScJo muestran impecablemente su talento en los \u2018tour de force' que son estos dos roles. Sumado a esto: la direcci\u00f3n, cinematograf\u00eda y edici\u00f3n juegan un papel important\u00edsimo en el desarrollo de estos personajes. Las emociones y sentimientos de cada escena se transmiten id\u00f3neamente gracias al \u2018staging' de los personajes, planos, movimientos de c\u00e1mara y los colores usados (principalmente rojo, naranja y amarillo). Todos estos componentes son fragmentos de la trama y de c\u00f3mo se cont\u00f3 visualmente y, a pesar de ser bastante original y emotiva, tiene su ligero inconveniente.\n\nLa trama de Her se extiende un poco m\u00e1s de lo que deber\u00eda, haciendo que dos horas de pel\u00edcula se sientan ligeramente abundantes. Algunas situaciones o momentos pudieran ser m\u00e1s comprimidos o breves sin quitar relevancia a cada giro de la historia. Fuera de esto, Her es un cl\u00e1sico instant\u00e1neo cuyos temas, personajes, direcci\u00f3n y guion \u00fanico y creativo le dan su puesto entre las mejores de la d\u00e9cada pasada.

            "content": "A surprisingly lethargic and anti-climatic film that is only occasionally redeemed by thoughtful ideas and strong characters. The film is about Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a divorced and lonely man who writes letters for a living to the friends and families of clients. Theodore is something of an unrealized poet, writing articulate and romantic letters that he undoubtedly has channeled from his own unused affection. He lives in a bleak, impersonal world only marginally more futuristic than ours. Theodore, spending his free time on video games and phone sex, is so dispassionate and depressed he rejects invites to social gatherings and dates, addicted to cynicism and bachelor routine. He eventually begins a relationship with artificial intelligence Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Their relationship in the film's start makes them sort of pariahs, but interestingly enough, they are only the first of many people who have AI partners.\n\nI was pleased that \"Her\" avoided the obligatory story elements of sci-fi involving AI, not least of all that that the film does not become a dystopia of man vs. machine. I must admit, though, that I did not find the idea of an AI/human coupling to be involving by itself, and after watching the film, I can name only a handful of ephemeral half-sketched ideas. \"Her\"'s biggest strengths lie with Theodore and Samantha's relationship, in which they exchange real and witty dialogue to one another; it is these two who nearly redeem the premise's flaws and save the movie. And director Spike Jonze directs competently and is able to guide his actors well; he should be credited for attempting more artistic and less mainstream techniques.\n\nThe problems start, I think, when the film undercuts its own investment in Theodore and Samantha's relationship. There's a pivotal scene in which Theodore signs the official divorce papers with his ex-wife (Rooney Mara) who, upon hearing of his relationship with an AI, berates him for choosing a relationship where he does not have to contend with \"real emotions.\" This leads Theodore to realize that he agrees with her and that he needs a relationship with a human woman, not with Samantha; I guess neither Theo nor Samantha discussed marriage or even how their relationship would continue.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that Theo has a pretty good point. How deep COULD your relationship ever be with an AI, even if she sounded and had the emotions of a real person? The film ends their relationship after Theo's epiphany, then restarts it after he decides should be whoever he wants to be, no matter how strange his relationship makes him. The film continues with Theo and Samantha exchanging more dialogue, and hanging out and going on picnics with friends who find Samantha charming or interesting. But can we ever move past the point that no matter how you approach the issue, that they will never be engaged, married, have kids, or attain long-lasting intimacy of any kind? We sit there and wait for the relationship to inevitably break, and in doing so all tension or character interest dissolves; we know that Theodore is kidding himself, and we know it will backfire in some way or another.\n\nTake away their relationship and you're left with cold intellectualism and slow ponderous pacing, and the movie does just that. It's just not that entertaining or stimulating; while the ideas it poses throughout the picture seem original, they're not much satisfying. \"Her\" relays the emotional experience of a perpetually lonely man who gets an AI girlfriend, has a delightful relationship with her, and is obliviously ignorant of its eventual breakup. And then he's lonely again, more or less.",

Jonze had his hand all over this film, creating such a beautiful picture, and displaying true, meaningful messages.\n\nHer has such an original premise, backed up with great emotions, that really got me invested from the start! There are more than a few scenes that really tugs on the heart strings, and speaks levels to those out there that don't feel accepted. The tone starts off pretty casual, having GREAT laughs, but come the second act and on, the tone gets serious, and continues with this sorrowful tone that just works!\n\nSpike Jonze really shot for the stars, casting these terrific actors & actresses. After about 45 minutes, I forgot these people were acting; all of the performances felt so real & genuine! Joaquin Phoenix is a special talent. Everytime he hits the big screen, he shines! Right off the bat, I found myself getting so invested in his odd character, really feeling all of his different emotions. Scarlett Johansson was absolutely fantastic! Her character is about as unique as they come, but she made all of her personality & emotions feel as genuine as possible. The chemistry she has with Phoenix is immediately admirable, having a beautiful bond, developing together.\n\nWith this being Spike Jonze' first solo screenplay, it was very witty, touching up on personal emotions, and fleshing out the meaning of love and humanity. Jonze really pays attention to detail, crafting such a beautifully told story. For the three Academy Award nominations Her received, The Original Screenplay took home the award.\n\nThe score & muisc by Owen Pallett & William Butler added great depth and emotions to each scene, with a heavy piano score.",

When Theodore finally falls in love, it is with an artificially-intelligent operating system named Samantha.

Like all great science fiction, \"Her\" ruminates on the present by predicting the future. There are no aliens, robots, or interstellar travel. Spike Jonze's script is imaginative and intuitive, as it offers a shiny vision of the future while exploring the intricacies of relationships through ideas like sex surrogates and hyperintelligent operating systems. Jonze especially explores why we fall in love and whether we really fall for constructs, artificial or human. As Amy Adams's character astutely points out, being in love is essentially a form of \"socially acceptable insanity.\"",

There's a scene where Phoenix's character has a panic attack and I thought the way he changes his tone of voice and body language proved how great an actor he is.\nRooney Mara in her brief role was perfect. Though she had very less screen time in the movie, she was great in her scenes.\nAmy Adams as a supporting actress was at her best too.\nTalking about Scarlett Johansson, man oh man, she was literally one of the best parts of the movie. By the plot, she voices an artificial OS which may sound a bit outlandish but the way she does her part is perfect. Couldn't praise her more.\nThe background score and the music add a different layer to this movie in my opinion. They're beautiful.\nSpike Jonze had directed and written this film. The plot, the setting and the screenplay were pure class, credits to Spike Jonze. The basic point or idea of this film may sound as over the top or outright weird.

The movie itself is a fantastic comment on the relationship between human and machine, and the promise of it's development. The script is nothing short of brilliant, and the scoring undeniably compliments each scene. The cinematography is magnetic and consistent. Constant themes of relationship difficulties mirrored in all of Samantha's (Johansson) more technological antics. \nThe great acting and realism of Samantha has the viewer back and forth on if she is in herself alive, despite being factually inanimate. The possibility that she could truly just be a computer simply mimicking human emotion. This film is unlike any other by how covertly it has the viewer emphasize and pity the protagonist. For despite her being flawed and emotional, she is a computer at her core. ",

While you follow the main character, Theodore Twombly, around during his daily life you begin to notice all of these themes connecting. It's a beautifully captured movie that leaves you thinking about your own experiences regarding love and loneliness. From the heart-wrenching moments to the seemingly mundane, there's no doubt you'll be fully invested in it. I believe this movie is so beautiful to many people because it's relatable for most people and it illustrates the bittersweet feeling of being in love and the lack of control you feel in it. It also portrays different types of relationships extremely realistically, almost to a degree that it might be mildly uncomfortable but I believe that discomfort is very powerful. The ending wasn't as powerful as it could have been, but I think that may have been purposeful because of the nature of the character's relationship. This movie brings up a lot of interesting questions that you find yourself asking when you finish watching it. I found myself relating to this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I don't see that as an unfortunate thing because I'm glad I got to experience the things that I have experienced already in my lifetime because if I hadn't, I would be a very different person. Overall, I think the success of this movie lies in the hands of the people who most relate to it, personally I really enjoyed it. \n",

I believe it could be argued that this move stands more as a testament to an individual's strength and growth in their journey to overcome heartbreak and grief, rather than rather than simply just a bizarre love story between a human and his computer. In each scene, we can track Theo's progress and growth, as he learns to love again through the limited, but generally exaggerated colors of each scene. A subdued red for romantic scenarios, as when he is writing love letters or first falling for his OS,  yellow when Samantha is growing past him, and he loses her for the first time, finally white in the end for clarity and acceptance. In this progress we find that the character of Samantha, as strange as she is, really serves less in the role of a love interest, and more as an idealized form of Theo's ex-wife. When Samantha is compared to the reality of Catherine , he comes to see the mistakes he made in his marriage and grow from that. In this way, the film becomes wholly relatable, despite its futuristic setting and odd and, sometimes, truly awkward person-to-operating system interactions. Overall, the movie is beautiful, and despite my technophobia, a truly heart-warming and moving depiction of a healing relationship and a person's ability to grow. ",

In Her, humans are introduced to the OS, or Operating System, a technological advancement curated profusely to each individual. A new perspective of technology acquiring human-like feelings such as jealously, anger, and happiness are introduced with familiarity. Her is film that deserves multiple watches, replenishing the mind with new thoughts and emotions after each watch. To be able to capture a relationship between human and technology, and make it still feel like a human to human connection is unreal and done perfectly. In the film, Samantha, the OS, says \"You know what's interesting? I used to be\u2026 so worried about not having a body, but now I... I truly love it. I'm growing in a way I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited,\" and essentially this quote is the essence of the entire movie. Attraction is not limited to physical bodily attraction, but to what you can learn from one, how you can laugh around one, and how one can make you feel overall. Love is the person, or in this case, voice, that can lift your spirits when you need it and gets you off of your feet when you fail to do so yourself, purely with good intentions. Her is love.",

It's insightful and ahead of its time because I think that the technical landscape of this film is not far off from being a regular part of our daily lives.  The thought of having an AI computer operating system as my closest companion is a miserable one.  I already can't stand how addicted people are to their smartphones and computers.  It makes me feel a certain kind of personal distance that I couldn't have imagined when smartphones and computers first came to market.   The sad thing is, I think that this trend will only get worse.  So many things digital are an ever evolving social contagion.  They threaten the very nature of what it means to be human.  The personal disconnect is already happening within virtual reality and social media.  \"Her\" is a stroke of insightful genius.  It is seemingly partly a Twilight Zone plot but also presents a reality that is very likely to come into being.  It's a great film that can leave you feeling despair about the future when you realize how close to reality it will come, if not entirely become full blown reality.  Great work here.

It\u2018s a romantic movie, but not like any other romance. It's a science fiction movie, but not like any other science fiction movie.\nIt just is a newly interpreted romantic movie, in a great science fiction setting. But the setting and this science fiction world is never too dominant. It actually is very subtle and just helps setting the mood for the story.\n\nThe story is very good and works well, because it's a world we can all imagine really existing some day and the characters have to fight problems, we might actually have to fight some day.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Phoenix is one of the few actors, that actually makes me believe him. He is one of the few actors, that actually convinces me, that he is this character and he actually goes through the feels, we are supposed to believe he is feeling. In other words: He was great in this, and he is one of the most amazing actors of our time. Scarlett Johansson on the other hand really just expresses herself over her voice, which is one of her most distinctive parts. Her slightly husky voice is just perfect and she really expresses a lot of emotions just by making her voice sound a certain way.\n\n\u00b4Her\u02cb is definitely high up there on my list of movies you definitely need to watch. Well done!",

Joaquin Pheonix portrays the life and subtle mind of a modern man being lonely and lost in life and it's so melancholic and strong and the progression of OS Samantha character development was beautiful even she was an AI had no physical form but it felt so real that we could feel the presence \nof her through the whole movie more compelling than a living character could do in a standard rom/com.

No doubt, Samantha develops over the course of the film as well, but whatever changes she goes through, they happen (necessarily) off screen, in conversations we are never privy to\u2014even if they might be happening concurrent with a scene we are watching\u2014with the movie only minimally interested in posing, never really answering, such metaphysical and hard sci-fi questions as how she changes, who she becomes, where she goes. Consider how, were things reserved and the film called HIM instead, there would be no question as to whom the pronoun named\u2014did you even remember that Chris Pratt has a bit part?\u2014but might not the titular \"her,\" though ostensibly Samantha, instead refer to Theodore's ex-wife, who haunts his potential relationships and whom he must learn how to live without (just as Samantha must learn to live on her own, too)?\n\nNone of this is to knock the film, which is a marvelous, melancholic meditation on modern motifs like technology, romance, desire, labor, and alienation, painted in stunning pastel hues and performed with effortless subtlety; rather, I merely mean to point out how complicated the film's presentation of gender, identity, and mediation can be, adding up to something more than the reactionary disaffection many critics read into the film. Jonze and company are careful never to play either Theodore's passion or his heartbreak for laughs; even the stranger kinks and perversities in the film (\"Strangle me with a dead cat\") are treated with a certain amount of pathos, and we are invited with the characters to explore the meaning of sexuality and love beyond the standard confines (even if, at the end, the film seeks to ideologically reproduce a heteronormative couple, which gives meaning to Theodore's work and so on). If anything, as Clint Burnham and Matthew Flisfeder have argued, the film's central thesis is a rather psychoanalytic one: That sex is more a matter of words and virtuality than mere flesh and carnality.",

Someone that loves you entirely, without the constant temptation of someone else, loyal. However, just like the unreasonable optimism of romance in the real world, \"Her\" reminds its viewers that relationships usually don't last no matter how hot the fire once burned. \n\n\"Her\" is beautiful, full of love, and full of heartbreak. If love to torture yourself with films like this, it doesn't get much better than \"Her\". This film should not be forgotten.",

            "content": "A profoundly moving romance betwixt human and machine.\n\nSpike Jonze captures true love and painful separation with his sci-fi romance drama Her (2013). Jonze directed and wrote the most original and grounded piece of science-fiction I've seen in ages. Her brings Jonze's loving direction of intimate moments between a lonely man and a curious AI. Jonze captures realistic relationship moments with every scene despite the unusual pairing with his depictions of divorce, romance, sex, dating, bonding, and especially conversing. Her is simply a remarkable film of deep emotional connections displayed against clean distant future society.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is remarkable at conveying complex emotions with his subtle facial gestures and distinct vocal mannerisms. His genuine emotional performance is complemented by his nuance driven appearance as the nerdy indie hipster Theodore Twombly that desperately desires affection. Phoenix is so sincere that you believe this brave new world surrounding him. Phoenix was supremely creepy in Gladiator and imposing and depressing in You Were Never Really Here, but Her captures Phoenix at his most vulnerable and intimate. Joaquin Phoenix transforms himself into a weathered man of open mind and aching heart.\n\nHer features several amazing supporting roles. \n\nNotably, Scarlett Johansson does more with her voice in Her as the OS Samantha's vocal personality than most actresses will do in their entire careers. \n\nThen, Amy Adams is so sweet and sympathetic as the kindly neighbor Amy. Her hurt is displayed in her gentle eyes and trembling voice. Adams is enchanting and likable, while constantly striving and achieving a sublime radiance. Amy Adams is a resonate actress that I will always love and appreciate.\n\nOn the other hand, I continue to grow more appreciative towards Rooney Mara. Her blunt and genuine emotional performance as Catherine gives Her the gut punch it needed. Mara feels like the outsider of emotions as we mostly see her in Phoenix's flashbacks, then when she appears she is stunned by Theodore's disposition and further drives a complex wedge into the narrative. Mara does a similar brilliant lambaste in The Social Network as she is the perfect critic, while the ultimate sweetheart in Carol. I think Mara expands her range with both attributes in Her as the fun girlfriend, upset wife, and the disappointed ex.\n\nFurthermore, Olivia Wilde is engaging as Theodore's fun date that turns into a hurtful reprimand of his whole persona. Wilde is mesmerizing, then horrifying just in the two scenes she inhabits.\n\nI must mention that Her contains my favorite acting role from Chris Pratt as the friendly co-worker and cool friend figure to Theodore named Paul. Pratt pulls back and restrains himself from excessive talking, and instead, opts for a more quiet genuine character. He is quite likable and interesting in Her.\n\nSpike Jonze asks us many important and intriguing questions as we watch Her. His script is full of careful conversations of gentle bonding and quiet torment for his characters that feel such a relentless anguish over their relationships. Jonze's writing gives us humorous jokes, sweet exchanges, and shocking revelations. I appreciate Jonze trying to contemplate on the ethics and consequences of OS relationships and the how we engage with artificial intelligence. Her forces us to imagine how the world would look like with everyone tapped into their phones and virtual assistants without connecting to other people. Are the OS's people if they feel emotions or do they just emulate human feelings? Her begs us to consider the ramifications of AI's with the ability to adapt to human interaction and develop real feelings. It is a difficult question to answer and one we will likely consider going forward with ever progressing technology. I think that, at least, Her responds to these questions with the heartfelt assertion that OS can experience real feelings and that AI has the potential to adapt to someone akin to a human with a depth of consciousness. Their awareness and feelings are the significant trait that makes AI real to us and worthy of respect . Not since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 and HAL have I thought about AI on such a complex level.\n\nSurprisingly, the romance bits are tender without physical intimacy, but with a genuine sense of loving sensation through realistic dialogue and authentic visuals.\n\nSpeaking of visuals, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography captures the stunning grace of tomorrow's world. Jonze envisions a society of indie clothes, sleek technology, distant figures, and massive skyscrapers. Hoytema captures all this with his camera work with gorgeous still wide shots enveloping the characters and their feelings against empty spaces and the absent people. The majority of Her is just Joaquin Phoenix talking to Scarlett Johansson by himself, so Hoytema is impressive for making Her dynamic visually engaging.\n\nIn all, Her is a beautiful movie of breathtaking filmmaking and tender thoughtful writing. I think audiences and critics alike will revere Her in the future, and what a bright future that will be!",
