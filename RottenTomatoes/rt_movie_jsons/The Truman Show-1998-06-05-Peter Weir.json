The movie is quite short, but It still leaves you speechless, questioning your exsistence. Also, the finishing sentence: \"In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!\", portrays a moment of clarity and a chance of long-awaited freedom.  As always, Jim Carrey carried the role so effortlessly and powerfully and I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",

The experience of watching Jim Carrey's normal portrayal as a happy go lucky character grow into an emotionally captivating character with real human feelings of sadness, anxiety, sacredness and confusion, is so powerful. The casting of Truman could not have been better. All in all this movie is an absolute masterpiece of creativity and world building, and will be a worthwhile watch to anyone considering viewing this movie.",

This movie is very impactful to the point where it can allow you to evoke many feelings of sympathy, disturbance, happiness, and laughter.

I believe this is one of Jim Carrey's best performances in the film industry solely because he portrayed Truman very well. Although this film is hopeful, it saddens me that Truman's life was stolen from him for clout. Even the soundtrack does its job to support the movie and conveys Truman's life in a meaningful way.",

            "content": "Truman was presented with the blue pill and the red pill. \nThe blue is to preserve a decent middle-class life in the 90s, rotating around the office, friends, and family within an unpretentious peaceful town. The right pill is a ruthless rebellion, an impulsive subversion to the existing tranquility. It's to doubt the specious smoothness and legitimacy of his life and to investigate every obstruction he encountered when trying to pull away from the monotone and sail off for new places. It's to raise the disrupting question \"is my life set up for something\" and \"if everyone is in on it\", where \"it\" was later revealed to be a live TV show. \nIt took some convolution for Truman to figure out the reality, which is ironically a fiction where all his friends, fams, neighbors, and colleagues are the cast and all relationships are performed according to the script. The society around Truman is constructed and governed by the principle that his personality shall be kept safe as his body so that he stayed that humorous, outspoken, and relatable figure who's been favored by the audience. I wouldn't dispute the creator's assertion that \"there's no more truth out there than the world I created\" since in whatever world there are lies and conceits. But Truman should be free to confront them, to pierce through the disguise instead of hiding from it, and indeed he insisted on his right to discover and embrace the reality, even if it might be less graceful.\nOne peculiar point that's worth more discussions and even speculations (since we are not provided with many clues directly from the movie) is what's on Truman's mind. When he realized himself in a modern utopian world with an ordinary sweet and sour life where he couldn't tell the line between the real and the fake. How much tacit understanding does he share with Maron(his best friend since childhood)? How much does Meryl love him? How many people listened and replied and how many just read out the script? These questions could devastate one's faith since it put emotions and human connections at stake. I guess Truman had episodes of fear and despair, even hesitation to stay in the bubble. But in the end, he put on his common positivity, \na determination rather than simplemindedness, to defeat the storm and\nhead out to the exit, a channel to a wider and wilder world.",

It's as simple as that.\"  Totally original in nature, the film succeeds on the strength of its story, countless thought-provoking insights, and what is probably Carrey's strongest and most memorable performance.

But in fact, everyone is living in a set world, we live in this society, but also subject to all kinds of invisible constraints and restrictions. But can we deny that this world is not real?

Other people have even caught common TV practices being used maliciously, such as the fact that the year on the magazines Truman receives from the stand are always a few years late to the newspapers and magazines the viewers have, a common practice in TV today due to the fact that it is difficult to produce episodes in response to an event on the spot, which means if something serious happened outside the dome, he wouldn't know anything about it for years, just so they could get that \"perfect reaction.\"\n\nAll of this was rolled up into a comedy film. If you're here for the laughs, this will probably not be for you, to be honest.

After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I kept not having time and putting it off that it became the number one movie at the top of my watch list and I finally broke the two month streak of not watching it and watched it last night.  Oh my was The Truman Show a delight.  This is definitely my favorite Jim Carrey film as of now (have yet to watch Eternal Sunshine so that might change) and I am happy to say that out of the three films I watched yesterday, (Jaws, True Lies, and The Truman Show) this was my favorite.  While it isn't marginally better than Jaws since I have them both in my top 100 and I rated them both 5/5 stars on here, I still prefer it over the shark adventure.  This film also broke a record for me of not legitimately laughing in a movie in a long while.  During my watch of True Lies I chuckled a little bit, but during The Truman Show (even though it is more of a drama than a comedy) I full on belly laughed a couple of times which added to the overall experience.  A truly amazing movie that people are not over hyping, check it out.",

After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I think Carrey is at his best when he doesn't try to fool you into thinking he's not a funny dude. He does some real, pure dramatic roles after this one that are just nowhere near as good; it's like he wanted to prove that he can still act with his hands tied behind his back, and he's right, but it's still not as entertaining as watching him in peak form like this.

Saw on Netflix so thought I'd give it a rewatch.\n\nI was really blown away by how relevant this film continues to be over the years. The explosion of reality TV took hold in the early 2000s with shows such as Big Brother enrapturing people across the globe. The voyeurism of watching real people live their lives and interact with others provides so much more authenticity than what actors can achieve through playing characters. In a way it gives us a sense of escapism. Indeed, throughout the film we see multiple cutaways to various characters who seem to spend their whole lives watching Truman live his rather than face their own.\n\nThe film also provides commentary on the way media has the ability to influence and change the way we view and interact with the world. This is especially pertinent in a world now dominated with 'fake news' and conspiracy theories becoming accepted within a more mainstream setting thanks to the proliferation of disinformation online. I think Ed Harris' character Christof summed it up best with this quote: \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented\".\n\nFinally, with the advent and development of social media and how it has come to dominate our lives (Letterboxd being one of them), we all belong and star in our own Truman shows. We share ourselves, often in intimate detail with the whole world free to scrutinise our lives.\n\nTo summarise, I remembered this as just another solid Jim Carrey film from the 90s, but on rewatch discovered an absolute gem of a film.",

The withholding of information, first informs the viewers, and then gives our root able protagonist something to fight for, as well as a shock he hasn't felt before. Jim Carrey's acting in this film is some of his best work, and the end is befitting of his depiction of one man against the world. The satirical projection of hollywood consumerism and production is better than most, with advertising being both comical and realistic.

            "content": "It was boring when I saw it during release, it's boring now. The movie was basically a big satire of reality TV, hence why the premise is more unrealistic. It requires human behavior and logistics that are akin to something like Running Man and Deathrace 2000. The movie at the time was marketed that way, no one implied any deep meanings or themes, it was sold as \"Look how stupid reality TV is and if we lived that way to an extreme.\" Ok, possibility for amusement.\n\nThen a 99 minute movie felt like 35 minutes to me. People discuss figuring out the premise, but there's nothing to figure out. You get an exposition dump in the beginning of the movie to explain everything neat and tidy. You know where Truman stands, and if you know anything about the film previous to walking into the theater you know the theme to the movie is his inevitable realization of his surroundings. It takes no times at all for average intelligence viewers to conclude where the movie is heading: His escape. Love or hate this film, you likely guessed the ending by no later than the 15 minute mark.\n\nNow I'm not trying to brag but I was a nerd about film even as a teen and had seen enough movies to understand basic writing framework. Not some prodigy, just basic understanding.\n\nSo I watch the character have a call to adventure (his realization of his surroundings), The activist helps him (help), He ends up going through his threshold (Concludes it's time to challenge the status quo), and then makes the journey to escape (Challenges and trials). Finally, he escapes the dome (The Rebirth).\n\nWhere the F*** is the other half of the arc? The movie is HALF a hero's journey. So while there's some hijinks and interactions, ultimately we're watching the first 2 or 3 acts of a 5 act structure. Now some might debate that his wife leaving and his fake dad showing up are the death and rebirth, but I felt as though the new wife, his old wife and the dad were not played to a significant enough extent to portray that. They feel like trials in and of themselves.\n\nThis is a major reason I didn't enjoy the movie. It's half a story. I could come up with so many ideas to the how's and what if's of this world, and after my imagination went wild, I was left with \"He got out. The end.\" The only other movie that felt so pointless to me was Perfect Storm.\n\nI also can't give this movie credit the same way others do for it's \"accurate satire\" and \"deeper meanings\" Look kiddies, these movies pre internet had advertising too. We had interviews back then too. All the same promotional material, you just watched it on E! instead of Youtube. And no, this movie was outright sold as satire of a specific thing. Comparing it to Twitch streamers seems like apples and oranges to me. The concept of \"you're being watched\" had been done to death by 1985.\n\nI get that often in society, liking things seems to be based more on what's trendy, but still, I relate to other viewers in the mind boggle you experience trying to figure out WTF everyone else saw in this POS.",

The plot touches on the state of the world we live in and where it might lead us: a world where a human life is valued only by how much it can benefit those in power. Truman (True-Man) provides a reflection of ourselves within the world; he is on a quest for truth in a microcosm of reality, in which he finds he may possess less control over his life than he believes.\n\nThe cast, directing and writing are each amazing and never feel forced or lacking.\n\nThe camera angles throughout the film, often from hidden street cameras, make it painfully obvious that we are supposed to adjust our perspective on our own lives to view our surroundings with a little more distance. The film seems to directly allude to the timeless Shakespeare quote, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.\" In addition to providing meta-analysis on the entertainment industry, Truman's arc from a mindless drone in societal autopilot to a vulnerable, rebellious independent highlights two contrasting aspects of human nature: the uncontainable human spirit and the \"[acceptance of] the reality of the world we are presented.\"",

            "content": "The Truman Show is one of the most unique films ever made. It's something that has never been done again and in all honesty I don't think it could be with how technology is today. How would a man unwittingly be in his own reality TV show all his life without realising. Nobody would believe it in todays cinema. That's what makes this film so brilliant. I genuinely as a kid remember watching it and losing my mind trying to work out if my life was a reality TV show. Every mirror and strange occurrence made me wonder for a good while after the film. Not many films can affect you like that but that's what this film did. It really made me wonder as a kid. That's really something that you want from a movie. To make you think about it after  you watch it. Even now it is still a clever movie. \n\nI always think imagine if this was a real thing. Could you actually picture a whole town in a massive dome that is made specifically for one clueless person who doesn't realise anything is real around him. Just imagine watching that show on TV. You would have none of that fake shit you get on every reality show. Yeah the cast would be actors but one man just not having a clue he's the star of a show and he's being watched. We would have a real reality show which would actually be worth watching. Thing is that's majorly unethical and seriously fucked up, so we will never see something like that. Instead we see it in this film and it's quite the experience. \n\nTruman Burbank is a really likeable character. Jim Carrey makes him that way. This for me is his greatest ever role. He really blends bits of comedy with seriousness and we get to see the perfect all around character. Carrey will never star in a role this good again. As an audience we are majorly caught up in his story. We want him to have his happy ending and for him to find out his world isn't as he seems. We're invested. The film is brilliance and Carrey's performance is the draw in that brilliance. One of my favourite parts of the film is how he just starts noticing all the little details in his life and starts to come to this realisation something isn't right. How would you react if all those things started happening in your life?! I would literally have no clue what to do. \n\nYou add a unique and still to this day not replicated premise with a actor at his absolute best in Carrey and a really good cast around him. As an audience we want a film to leave us thinking afterwards and the Truman Show is one of those movies even now 22 years later that leaves us fascinated. It truly is one of the most clever films I've ever seen. Even now after all these years it is a brilliant rewatch and easily a must see film!  \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

(Source: IMDB)\n\nThe Truman show is a movie that you will enjoy from beginning to an end, the movie will break the boredom in a clever way that will seem to be simple and that's a thing that I have seen in very few movies. \n\nJim Carrey as Truman Burbank was perfect, amazing performance and he was able to present that character exactly the way it should be presented, would not call this his best performance tho, in my opinion, Jim Carrey's best performance is \"Joel Barish\" in \"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind\", that's why I don't agree with those who say \"The Truman Show\" is his best movie. \nEd Harris' performance was Oscar-worthy, and of course, the entire support cast was amazing, very well done. \n\nThe Truman Show's amazing production design, music, and cinematography that looks exactly like a reality TV show, it's like you are thrown in there with Truman Burbank. \n\nThe custom designs that were incredible and a thing that really grabbed my attention, for example, the cool black custom of Christof (played by Ed Harris) with the hat, or Lauren Garland's (played by Natascha McElhone) cool red custom with a shirt that has red flowers on it that she was wearing when her and Truman Burbank talked at the library, or Truman Burbank's suit, they were all so simple but looked amazing. \n\nThe Truman show is a movie that everyone will enjoy and one of the most original movies ever made, it has drama, comedy, great score, character development, great story, superb production design, and many more things, highly recommend this to everyone.",

Jim Carrey as usual plays a very strange character and at points it feels like he went far too over the top. There's also a big problem with the story since it seems very unlikely that Truman wouldn't realise the reality of the situation earlier, especially when the studio did such a poor job of hiding things. It's not really funny and some of the dialogue could have been better. The acting is decent but certain characters seemed completely fake throughout like Truman's wife and it makes no sense how he never noticed. Overall, the plot is reasonable, and gradually revealing more and more about who Truman really was as well as the switch to the sort of producer/director perspective at the end worked well. However, things are too weird and silly throughout and that negatively affects the believability.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a clear reference to the common film archetype of death and rebirth. Truman Burbank's death is presented through his world shattering realization that he lived in a legitimate bubble his entire life. Not only had he been completely isolated from the outside world to a manufactured society that manipulated his behaviors and upbringing, but the outside world had complete surveillance of ever moment of his life for 30 years. It seems obvious that prescription medication and years of psychological therapy would be essential for Truman to cope with this depressing recognition, however, director Peter Weir spares us of this tragedy by ending the film and fulfilling the archetype with a heroic rebirth of Truman Burbank as he triumphed over the director and antagonist by stepping out of the fabricated reality into the real world he had yet to know. \n\nThe conflict of the film presented itself from the start as a stage life came plummeting from the sky onto the streets of the unsuspecting truman. The plot was thick with backstory on Truman's birth, childhood and loss of his father, however, the only plot point to truly drive the story and capture the viewers attention was a flashback encounter with an old flame who leaked the truth that Truman was on a show and his whole life was a lie manipulated by actors and directors. Truman begins to gain awareness of his captivity through a lull of persistent obstacles, diversions undertaken by actors and a series of special effects created the director to keep him from leaving. While the audience is directed to route for Truman to escape in this story of captivity and injustice, the core of our desire for Truman to make it out of his manipulated bubble is due to an inner desire we have as people to seek the truth. \n\nWe wanted Truman to beat the odds and have an opportunity to live a real life like ours. But moreover we wanted Truman to gain clarity of the misconceptions surrounding the world he had been presented. The overall social commentary of the film is that media outlets and large corporations presents us with misleading information and biased opinions then present these as facts to the world. We are living in our own bubble like Truman, and these influential corporations and media outlets control our own truths we believe in our lives.",

            "content": "Finding the True-Man In Each of Us\n\nTruman Burbank quite literally was raised in a bubble. Since his birth, Truman's life in the idealistic town of Seahaven was broadcasted for years 24/7 on televisions across the entire globe. \n\nIn this 1998 film from Paramount Pictures directed by Peter Weir, Jim Carrey plays the happy-go-lucky protagonist, Truman Burbank. The film begins with Truman working as an insurance salesman and facing the trials of everyday life while otherwise living in a seemingly perfect town. As the film progresses, Truman begins to question the authenticity of his own reality and relationships. This film uses foreshadowing effectively to hint at the false nature of Truman's world. Truman's adventuristic spirit and desire to see parts of the world beyond Seahaven forces the show's creator and mastermind, Christof, to take extreme measures in an attempt to keep Truman in Seahaven. \n\nPeter Weir's portrayal of Christof as an omniscient creator who is able to alter and fabricate the entire reality of a human being points toward the film's social commentary on free will. This film creates a dialogue regarding to what degree humans have in controlling their own destiny. In an age plagued by commercialization and media, it seems as if intervention by higher powers are constantly in play. This film effectively uses placed product advertising as a thread to comment on how commercialized our world is today. \n\nChristof's belief that Seahaven is a paradise free from the toxins of normal human life raises an interesting argument about morality. Is lacking free will a price worth paying for a life free from normal human struggles and pain? The wide viewing audience of The Truman Show in the film also provides a social commentary about the role of media and television in modern life. It seems that reality television has only become more popular since this film's release and the comparison to lives portrayed as perfect on cameras has become more dangerous. \n\nThis film also provides a social commentary about what a \"perfect life\" constitutes. Despite having a beautiful wife, stable job, and financial stability, Truman still is left with a sense of longing. In Seahaven, a perfect life is portrayed as a middle-class nuclear family. Truman's unhappiness with his life in Seahaven questions societal norms.  \n\nUltimately, the resolution of the film occurs when Truman is forced to overcome his own internal conflicts to leave the comfort of his entire world known to him in Seahaven, and choose to step into the unknown outside world. Truman's character arch as the protagonist shows immense growth as he learns to overcome his fears and leaves his constructed reality behind. Truman embodies the Death and Rebirth film archetype as he leaves his entire life in Seahaven behind and steps through the door to the unknown.\n\nIn contrast to many other films in the drama/fantasy genre, The Truman Show utilizes an interesting plot, foreshadowing, and character development to effectively convey a greater social commentary. This film gets my endorsement of five stars!",

            "content": "The Truman show causes hearts to stir for Truman, a man who is being taken advantage of by a corporation.  However, it pushes the audience to think of what \"corporation\" is controlling their life.  This film serves as a \"call out\" to modern audiences in order to expose their willingness to be controlled by social media.\nTruman is the main character of a reality show that he doesn't even know exists.  Being controlled by a corporation, Truman is faced with planned tragedies and planted with fears in order to make the perfect, relatable character.  Truman falls in love with an extra who warns him about the reality show and is then removed by the corporation.  Truman starts picking up on signs that his surroundings are planned.  \nThe cinematography consists of continuous usage of a \"fish eye lens\" to allow the audience to foreshadow that Truman is being watched.  Until the storyline reveals Cristoff, the director and head of the Truman show, the audience is left to predict who exactly is watching Truman.  \nThe dialogue between people of the town and Truman serves as a thread to exhibit the awkwardness of the actors and portray a false society.  Not only does Truman's signature \"Good Morning\" phrase persist, but he continues to have scripted conversations that seem rather forced.  \nA biblical influence shadows over the film through the use of imagery and symbolism.  Cristoff serves as a \"God\" as he controls Truman's life in order to follow a greater plan.  Being adopted by the corporation, it only makes sense for Truman to be considered his son; therefore, Truman is the son of \"God\", or a Christ figure.  With the usage of heaven-like cinematography, such as the staircase to the set or \"heaven\", and Truman \"sacrificing\" himself for the happiness of others, such as his viewers, Truman is portrayed as a Jesus who has risen.  Thus, the archetypal \"Death and Rebirth\" story is developed as Truman's oblivious nature to the TV set is eradicated and he is reborn as a man who is taking control over his own life. \nI give this film 5/5 stars for the effectiveness of its social commentary. This film provides a social commentary that exposes the obliviousness of the audience to social corruption, which differs from other films that follow the \"Death and Rebirth\" archetype which aims to inspire the common man.  This film leaves the audience feeling skeptical about their own lives and the influences which control their actions.",

            "content": "The Truman Show.\n\nThis is a classic tale of death and rebirth. The rebirth is the sudden self-actualization that comes with Truman's change of perception. Moreover, death can be construed as walking out of the life that he always knew, and adventuring into the world that is unknown to Truman.\nBeyond the character archetype of death and rebirth, we find that the film hints at another piece of social commentary, the blurring of the public and private sphere. Truman is publicly displayed for the voyeuristic pleasure of an audience while the audience maintains its own autonomy. A strange dynamic that we can all relate to in this age of technological change.\nWe see how Truman is part of a mass surveillance scheme that fetishizes his life and portrays him to the world as an object. To the audience, Truman is not a human, he is an object of consumption. The audience lives through Truman and has a strange affection for him, but disregards his current situation. You can find similarities between Truman and zoo animals. A fake environment, scripted interactions, lighting, sound, and worst of all is the inability to live out life as nature intended. \nAnother archetype that can be drawn from The Truman Show is the True Love Story. In several instances, we see how Truman is determined to find the girl that he was in love with in High School. You could argue that the entire movie is based around the plot of Truman trying to escape this fake world in order to find the girl that he is in love with, but is unable to leave because of his situation. \nOverall, The Truman Show was not a great example of Jim Carrey's acting range. The plot was interesting and kept me focused on the screen, but the ending left a little more to be desired.",

One of the biggest criticisms that I have for this film is that even though the audience knows what is happening around Truman and the set up of the show, many of the background characters make it painfully obvious that they are setting up a \"show\" within the movie and it kinda made me wonder how Truman never questioned anything in the timeframe before the movie; however, it is tolerable because at the end of the day the film is still a comedic drama.

            "content": "Conceptually this film is not unique as there are many other films that follow the same storyline including EDtv (1999) which was released just a year later but this is a film that uses that base outline to comment on religion, the negative influence of media and the toll that television takes on it's stars. The steady hands of Peter Weir carry the film along as he brings a touch of humanity to the film that is necessary while never losing sight of the larger points that the film wants to make. I found myself enjoying the film even as I was made uncomfortable by how perceptively the film is able to attack our modern media culture.\n\nAs a baby Truman Burbank, Jim Carrey, was legally adopted by a corporation and has become the star of a reality television show that has documented him from childhood and follows him 24 hours a day without his being aware. He does not love his wife Meryl, Laura Linney, and yearns to run away and reunite with Lauren Garland, Natascha McElhone, who he genuinely fell in love with. He does not know that the actress playing Garland had wanted to reveal the reality television show to Burbank but had been banished by tyrannical producer Christof, Ed Harris, before she could inform him. He eventually discovers his reality and tries to test those around him in an attempt to break free but faces great adversity with resources being thrown at him by the producers. Viewers who have tuned in to watch him their entire lives are shocked as the show begins to break down with Burbank noticing his wife's product placement and moving out of his usual routine. He is able to escape one night but Christof forces him to question whether he really wants to leave the home he has inhabited for so long but he asserts his desire to be an individual.\n\nIt was a surprise to some audiences in 1998 to discover the twist in this film as they probably expected a broad Jim Carrey comedy reliant on slapstick instead of a funny but introspective film about an optimistic but lonely man. Watching the film now, already knowing the twist, you can see how the breadcrumbs are laid out so that you get the sense that something is off. The big reveal to the audience is not cheap as twists often are but occurs relatively early in the film and provides an opportunity to explore how gross and manipulative the normalcy of Burbank's situation is. When we see the people who Burbank cares the most about as actors exploiting him or their own selfish gain who casually describe the ways in which they manipulate him and use him for their own gain. The scariest character in the film is Christof who is reminiscent of one of the characters from Network (1976) and seems to have no life outside of keeping Burbank under control. We fear for him even as we see the comedy in the constructed life he lives and the eerie parallels to the entertainment we consume as it grows more and more depraved.\n\nCarrey's performance was widely acclaimed although it failed to garner him an Academy Award nomination and it is fascinating to see him put his comedic abilities to use while managing to handle the serious elements of the film as well. He is relentlessly cheerful and has clearly studied the work of a Dick van Dyke or an Andy Griffith to get the style of a sitcom from this era. His more toned down, emotionally volatile moments are affecting as they are vanity free with Burbank seeming like an upset child rather than the angered but powerful figure a different actor may have played him as. Linney gives a typically fantastic supporting performance as his slimy wife shifting expertly between the Donna Reed role her character plays on the reality show and the calculating actress she plays off screen. Harris and his intense blue eyes are put to good use as the godlike Christof and he does have a manic intensity that convinces you of the psychopathic nature of the character. \n\nYou buy in completely to the film's concept and are uplifted when we see the man who has been taken advantage of his whole life break away.",

Truman's fear of leaving this invented world, once he realizes it is a fraud, is similarly like our own reluctance to break our symbiotic relationship with media. His growing suspicion that what he is seeing is staged for his benefit is our own suspicions as the media-fabricated illusions around us begin to break down. And the producer-director of this stage-set world, who blocks Truman's effort to escape, is the giant media companies, news organizations, and media-politicians that have a stake in keeping us surrounded by falsehood, and are prepared to lure us with rewards as they block efforts at reforming the system.This movie is so unique and there's a lot of lesson that I learned from this movie.",

The movie made me feel incredibly compelled. Throughout the whole film, I found myself paying more and more attention to the details - watching the ways in which they created this world, as well as to how Truman was reacting to the environment he was in. I thought that it was an incredibly well done film that was so well thought out. It was one of those films where you could tell that every single piece and detail was intentional. The acting, especially that of Jim Carrey's was phenomenal. I enjoyed the scene in the beginning of the film where he was about to get on the ferry, but was unable to do so. His physicalization of not being able to get on the boat and showing how that affected him gave us so much insight into his character and where he was coming from. The story and the writing did such a great job setting up moments of conflict and heightening the tension. I particularly enjoyed when Truman is setting out to sea and Christof deliberately keeps making the weather worse, in an effort to deter Truman. In terms of directing, I thought that the film was very well executed. The shots chosen were so interesting and added to the intrigue of the story, and how this made-up world operates. I particularly enjoyed shots such as the one that is set in Truman's dashboard that follows him while he drives. I also enjoy the shot that looks like it is set up within a billboard outside of Truman's work. It is these aspects that make us feel that we are a part of Truman's world and allow us to be more invested in the film. As far as the genre is concerned, I feel that this film would classify as a drama. Commercially, I feel that this movie would likely appeal more to people within the 20-30's age range. This film came out at a time when reality television was new and up and coming, so I feel that at the time it was something that a lot of individuals would feel intrigued by. It displays a new world and environment that is unbeknownst to us.",

As noted many times by many reviewers, this is basically a what-if scenario, extremely well played out, of a man's discovery that his entire life in a storybook coastal village has been the focus of a 24 hour \"womb to tomb\" television channel. The film is interestingly well balanced in terms of humour, bizarreness, drama & seriousness. It also consists of many themes, among them, the all-pervasiveness of the celebrity culture and its concomitant absence of privacy for the affected celebrity - and especially, arguably the over-arching theme of individual responsibility and freedom and its attendant risks  versus the tried and true and their attendant security and lack of freedom and risk. Not only excellent acting, but also a well crafted script. Not merely entertainment, but also thought provoking and fodder for interesting conversations about significant topics.",

Seahaven is the way the world should be\". Combining cinematic masterminds behind films such as Dead Poets Society and GATTACA, Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol have managed to create one of the most thought provoking yet entertaining films to date. The Truman Show follows the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a normal man living in the seemingly normal New England town of Seahaven.  But unbeknownst to Truman, Seahaven is the world's largest reality TV set, filming 24 hours a day to an audience of billions. Being the first human legally adopted by a corporation, Truman has never known anything but the grotesquely perfect world of Seahaven, and is prevented from ever leaving it. The show director, Christof (Ed Harris) captivates the \"mad-creative type\" perfectly, controlling everything about Truman, from the people that appear (or disappear) in his life, to the sun that rises in the sky each morning. \nTruman's desire to escape his reality is driven by his wish to find his long-lost love, Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) that he met in college. After an exciting school dance, the two ran away together to a beach for some privacy. It was then that Sylvia tried to tell Truman that the world he is living in is in fact not real and that she was an actor. Everything, from the sand on the beach to the ever-expanding ocean is all artificial. But before she can reveal too much, Christof sends her \"dad\", to drive down the beach and grab Sylvia, telling Truman that they are going to Fiji and never coming back. \nSince his night with Sylvia, Truman becomes more cognizant of the world he lives in. The once pristine and happy Seahaven is now a cheerful prison, and Jim Carrey plays a very great prisoner. His quirkiness lightens the tone of what's really happening; a man is stuck in the world's largest TV set and everyone is in on it except him. \nWhile Jim Carrey does an outstanding job playing Truman, his wife in the movie, Meryl (Laura Linney), plays the part of the \"50's housewife\" just right, wanting a quiet life in the suburbs with children. Another character, Noah Emmerich, who plays Truman's best friend, successfully creates this closeness dynamic with Truman that looks almost surreal. But after Truman asks if Emmerich is lying to him about the world, Emmerich manages to capture this look in his eyes that says, \"I want to tell you the truth but Christof will kill me\". \nAfter his decision to escape by sea, Christof is forced to play is final card to keep Truman in Seahaven. He unleashes a chaotic storm knocking Truman off his boat, into the water. But Truman's persistence keeps Christof from going further and killing him on live TV. The dramatic music suddenly falls silent and as Truman reaches the horizon, he crashes through the TV set (literally breaking through the fourth wall). The build up to Truman's escape and his final parting of his world makes this movie always enjoyable to watch and watch again. \nAside from the plot, Weir's clever use of camera angles makes the film even more entertaining. Because of the nature of the movie, the viewer sees the world through the \"5000\" secret cameras hidden in places like trees or in car mirrors. It creates that quality of intimacy that comes along with prying into someone's life that ordinary camera angles just could not achieve. Another aspect to the show is its use of music during Truman's life. The music ranges from cheerful to gloomy, and is played live in the show, depending on the atmosphere Christof is trying to create. If it were not for the music and the camera angles, the Truman show would not be the most watched show in history. \nIt may be considered a feel-good family movie, there is a deeper meaning behind the film. The Truman show was created at a time when reality TV and social media began to consume people's lives. The idea that every feeling, thought and reaction of Truman's was real, all the while living in an artificial world only adds to the irony of it being considered a \"reality TV show\". The progression of Truman's journey to reality is a guide for the viewers to do the same, yet after Truman's escape, the transmission ends leaving the dedicated viewers saying, \"what else is on TV?\" only adding to the absurdity of the movie.\nAlthough Jim Carrey is generally known for his goofy and sometimes child-like humor, the balance between comedy and seriousness in this movie is impeccable. Due to its uniqueness and depth, this movie deserves 4 stars, always leaving the viewer wanting another episode of the Truman show.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is one of the best psychological thrillers because of its concept, choice of actors, filming and script. As I watched this movie I was blown away by how interesting it actually was. I find psychology incredibly interesting so this movie was great to me. The entire concept of this movie is about a man, Truman, who has spent his whole life growing up on a \"movie set\". His parents aren't his real parents, his lovers aren't his real lovers and his house isn't his own house. Yet, he has no idea that these people around him are all actresses and he's living in a fake world. The real outside world is watching through hidden cameras placed everywhere on this movie set that he calls his life. His entire life, Truman is being watched 24/7 and the outside world watches him as a reality TV show. Every move he makes, every emotion he feels and everything he sees and experiences is purely for the outside world's entertainment. The reason he was placed in this fake world, purely for entertainment, was because he was chosen from an unwanted pregnancy. There were six unwanted pregnancies and he was the first born, so he was the first chosen by the corporation producing the Truman Show.\n I really enjoyed watching Jim Carrey play Truman because as Truman began to experience signs that he was living in this fake world, it kind of turned into comedy. I love watching Jim Carrey because he never fails to make people laugh. He's done a ton of comedies including Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and many others. Carrey accepted this role even though he was getting paid 8 million less than what he usually gets paid for films. I'm glad he did though because I can't imagine the movie with anyone other than him playing the face of Truman. Jim Carrey tends to do a lot of improvising on set, which is exactly what he did during this movie. He didn't agree with some of the parts of the scripts and he would change things he did and said last minute as they were filming.\nObviously as I was watching this movie I couldn't help but notice how it was filmed. I really enjoyed how this film other than the fact that it takes a while to understand what is going on in the movie. Many people may get half way through the movie and finally come to the realization that his whole life is being filmed as a reality tv show. However, it's also really intriguing how it is filmed. It's filmed in the perspective of hidden cameras. The angles are different than \"normal\" movies and a corporation logo appears in the corner of the screen in most scenes of the movie. This really showed how he was being filmed without him knowing. It gave the movie more of a reality tv show feeling than a formal movie which makes situations that happen more shocking.\nThe script is very well written in my opinion because it makes you feel every core emotion. You laugh, you feel sad for him, you get angry at how they treat him and you feel excited for him. As the movie starts out he has no idea he's being filmed, however as the movie goes on he begins to realize and pick up on peculiar things that are happening to him. Characters in the movie start to feel sorry for him and try and warn him that he's being played. He starts to pick up on all these clues and try to figure out how he can overcome his fear of the water to potentially escape. The only way out of this TV set is to escape past the water, but unfortunately for him he has developed a strong fear for water. When he was younger, his \"father\" died in the water so he's never tried to travel past it. This was their way of putting fear in his head so he would never want to escape this tv set if he ever found out about what was going on. He eventually has the courage to get through the water on a boat which leads him to the door to exit the TV set. \nThis movie provided such a thrill factor that I haven't seen in many other movies before. Watching him experience his situations and get past them is exactly why I believe it is one of the best psychological thrillers that exists.",

While Truman might be the star subject of his world, in the final analysis it is the show's viewers who are subjugated even more, learning the lessons of that reality-good Protestant work ethic, happy monogamous heterosexuality, and so on-without the hope of escape that Truman enjoys (an escape which in fact only confirms the closure and significance of his narrative).",

Peter Weir's The Truman Show is an excellent example of this as on the surface, it is about the main character, Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, whose entire life is a fa\u00e7ade that is broadcast on live television. However, analyzing it further, it becomes apparent that it is much more than that. The film explores the politics of reality as well as how mass media influences our perception of it and architectures of containment, may it be archaeological, ideological or psychological. Weir achieves this through both the content via the interactions and power relations between the people as well as the form in the way that the film is constructed in terms of camera shots and the presence of visual metaphors. \n\tThe Truman Show is a film that revolves around the life of Truman, which is completely scripted, he is surrounded by professional actors in a fake setting for a tv show that is broadcast around the world. This entire concept is portrayed in a negative light, using the creator of the tv show as the antagonist. In doing so, the film attempts to push forth a certain ideology, one with a clear Socratic binary opposition between artificiality and reality. It also sets in a place a hierarchy where artificiality is below reality and portrays reality as something we should fight for and strive towards. This is explicit when Christof, the creator of the show, says \"While the world he (Truman) inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there is nothing fake about Truman himself\" (0:0:30, Weir). Here, he admits to Truman's world being fake and contrasts it to Truman himself as completely real and describes this as the reason to why the show is so successful. He proposes that society desires something more realistic through television rather than artificial \"reality\" shows. As this dialogue takes place at the start of the film, it creates the space 'ex nihilo' (out of nowhere) for the film going forward and foreshadows the exploration of the meaning of reality. The film also implies this idea of the contrast between Truman and his world in terms of reality and artificiality by his apt name - \"True-Man\". This has the unconscious effect of enforcing the idea that Truman represents reality whereas Seahaven represents artificiality. This shows how although everything he is surrounded by is artificial, the life that he leads is very much real. However, the audience is still filled with a feeling of dissatisfaction as it is implied that real life is in contrast to the one that Truman leads. This arises from our unconscious realization and subsequent denial that the life that Truman leads is eerily similar to the lives that we have become accustomed to. This results in an innate feeling of discomfort watching the fa\u00e7ade of a life that Truman leads. The audience in the film also have this feeling however, mass media exploits their unconscious desire to watch Truman's life unravel to employ cynical reason and overcome this feeling of dissatisfaction. This goes to show the extent to which mass media shapes society and the influence that it has over us.  \n\tThe architectures of containment present in the film also explores the concept of society's repression and emphasizes mass media's control over society. This is achieved by illustrating how Truman is controlled and trapped in Seahaven. The archaeological architecture used here is that of Seahaven being a desolate island, that is separate from the rest of society. However, this is successful in trapping Truman due to its psychological impact via his fear of water that was instilled in him through the staged traumatic incident of his father drowning in front of him during his childhood. This created an unconscious architecture of containment that manifests itself in his conscious fear of water. This idea is also emphasized through the form in which he is portrayed when his fear of water takes over as he is shown through multiple fish-eye lenses in this scene, which forms a visual metaphor of him as a fish stuck in a bowl (0:8:22, Weir). The fish eye-lens is also used in other scenes to emphasize his entrapment in this society. The film also shows that although Truman is trapped, he could escape if he wished to, which is illustrated through him finally escaping at the end. However, what prevents him from escaping for the majority of the film is his fear of the 'Big Other' - a repressive force that establishes control over people by exploiting their unconscious to set in place a symbolic order (iek). The irony in this situation is that there is no such thing. The 'Big Other' is a figment of his own unconscious created to establish order in fear of the alternative - chaos. This directly applies to us as well as we tend to create and give power to the 'Big Other' by fearing it and this, in turn represses us into the constraints of society. In this sense, Truman acts as an effective allegory for our current society as it is he himself who takes away his freedom and in doing so, gives power to the 'Big Other'. Through the film, he also escapes his entrapment by overcoming his fear of the 'Big Other' and in doing so, takes away its power. This provides a feeling of contentment for the audience watching the film as they feel like they too have escaped this entrapment.

            "content": "The Truman Show is a comedy direted by Peter Weir released in 1998. The movie speaks about Truman Burbank. Since his birth, his world is only a gigantic set of shooting and all those around him are actors. He alone is ignorant of reality. The film explores his first doubts and his quest to discover the purpose of his life. \n\nTruman, interpreted by Jim Carrey seems happy in a routine that it is itself built. He nevertheless has a water phobia of the sea, due to a terrible accident when he was young.\nGradually as the movie have started, we discover Truman and his habits of the day and we see that Truman is endearing and comical because sometimes he acts like a kid so it's funny. \n\nThe movie team uses many special effects and realizes a huge work for the settings which earned the prize for the best movie scenery. The movie is filmed from different points of view, sometimes we see Truman thanks to the camera that films him in the daily (included in the film) while sometimes it is a camera in the real life.\nThere are many close-ups centered on Truman.\n\nI think the message of this film is that, anyone cannot take control of the life of someone and exploited him without him knowing to obtain from him any money or entertainment. Also by this film, the director criticizes the reality TV that began to develop in 1989. \n\nGoods points of the movie\u00a0: it is full of very amazing and surprising ideas, the beginning is funny but later we discover that Truman is manipulated so we put ourselves on his places, which allows to really be captivated into the screenplay.\nFor me, the ending is the most beautiful thing in all the movie, because the dialogue with the project manager who tried to hold back Truman is deep and sincere and is a beautiful life lesson. \n\nSo worth watching\u00a0? I advise film to all those who have not seen it because it is not only my favorite movie but because there is an incredible actor games that allowed Jim Carrey to take back the Golden Globe 1999 and Ed Harris The Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.",

            "content": "By McKenna Curran, January 31, 2017\nWhat if you figure out that your entire life is fake; the biggest lie ever told, and everyone was in on it? The Truman Show -- The Truman Show (1998), is about a man that lives in a dome; a fake world, where his family and friends aren't really his family and friends, but just actors who grew up with him. This life of his is just a fake, with fake weather, lies about other places, recurring radio channels; all on TV. This movie got me thinking about technology, and how humans have manipulated each other. Every storm that changes the weather were all done by dials and switches. \nTruman, a simple guy with a beautiful wife, a nice a house, a garden, and friendly neighbors. Each day is the same: talks to his neighbors before he leaves for work, his favorite songs are on the radio all the time; the people he interacts with are organized (i.e. he doesn't run into to anyone on his way). Before he gets into his building, he gets food from across the street. He looks at magazines and calls the travel company every day, even though he's taught that Fiji isn't a real place, but he tries anyway. Sometimes, he goes on the daily boat ride, expecting to leave town forever, but it never happens. \nOnce, he started to bond with a woman on the beach, but a few days later, men come and take her. After dinner, he hands out with his childhood friend, Marlon, always on the shore of the beach. Truman begins to become suspicious of this life, but Marlon reassures him that nothing's wrong. He should just calm down and go about his business. Outside Truman's believed home, the TV crew and director does a Q&A. The woman from the beach is on the phone, yelling about Truman to get into the real world. \nTruman finds some of the cameras around the town; his house; figures out that the radio isn't real. So, he tries to get out of town first, but is blocked by fake guards and police. So, he hides. But, all the actors in town have to find him after a day, with directions from the director of the show, Christof. Cristof has watched Truman grow up for over 30 years, gaining fans from all over the world. Truman leaves, but it's not easy. He gets to the edge of the dome on a thunderous trip on a boat. He's talked to Christof through the loud speakers, who tries to get him to stay. \nMy opinion on this is that it's the kind of fiction that could totally be real; possibly even in the future. The dome would be more advanced, of course. I like this movie because of the way things work; his daily routine. He visits his mother, and sees his father. They make sure he's secure in town. I like movies because I'm a movie nerd, and this review has to be formal, but I'll try to do it like usual. It's cool because it's like a vacation. The movie is trying to perform a simple life. But, Truman is a test subject! It's weird to think about, honestly.",

Perhaps this will go down as one of Carrey's most powerful performance, at the very least one of his most unforgettable.

I liken this film to feature length episode of the Twilight Zone, as it's got the same sort of vibe and subject matter I'd expect from them. This story is just so creative and so interesting and it's executed near perfect. My only problem is that Jim Carrey does ham it up a bit too much with his performance which makes it a bit harder for me to empathize with what he's going through. I would have preferred something more along the lines of Eternal Sunshine Jim Carrey (minus the overwhelming sad). In the end, it doesn't bring it down too much for me.",

            "content": "The Truman show is a cross between a biting criticism of the truth to be found in television as well as the validity of religion and a simple, feel-good movie. This makes for an entertaining film that leaves you both satisfied and introspective once it's over.\n\nThe Truman show has a large number of biblical allusions if the viewer looks closely enough. First off, the \"creator\" of the show is named Christof, which is extremely similar to the phrase \"of Christ\" used in religious texts. This allusion exists to set the framework of the movie being a satire of religion. Christof's purpose as a character is to criticize a God that is \"always watching\" but allows us to operate in a world in which no one really knows the purpose of living. In this sense, Truman [the only true man in a world of fakes], once he realizes that he is living in a false reality, becomes a sort of anti-jesus who wishes to escape the enslavement of his god in order to venture into the unknown. While I see some reviewers likened Truman to Adam and Sylvia to Eve of the biblical story of Adam and Eve, I feel my explanation fits better with the script of the movie and the overall themes in general.\n\nOn the other hand, one can view this pleasing film as a joking criticism of the growing American obsession with reality television and the utter stupidity of it all. Despite Christof claiming that \"nothing is fake\" in the show, it is inherently fake in its depiction of the events of Truman's life as it's all orchestrated by the Christof himself. This movie aired in a pre-Kardashian age, but is just as applicable to the world's television tastes now. In an age where celebrity is almost synonymous with falsehood, this movie provides a refreshing satire on reality TV obsession.\n\nI believe the Truman show is a mostly good movie; while there were plot holes (why in the presence of 5,000 cameras was the entire cast of the show linking arms and shouting out Truman's name to find him] and instances where too much of Jim Carrey's patented eccentric nature leaked out, it contained a good message and a valid criticism of the world in which we live.",

            "content": "One of the more funny aspects to always look at when watching a movie like this is to imagine how unaware audiences back then would see just how much these films would create such a big impact, or large foreshadowing, to our modern society (much like how other forms of literature like Seventh Seal and TV shows like Star Trek gave us concepts, themes and props about moral choices and thinking the larger pictures in very smart and realistic ways). And The Truman Show is one of those films that director Peter Weir and influential writer Andrew Niccol (who would go on to make Gattaca and Lord of War, which if you haven't seen yet I HIGHLY recommend doing so), would pave way into not only reality TV and runaway celebrity culture, but also a message on society built on learning private details on the lives of ordinary people who don't have all that to share. And if you couldn't tell by now, all that means that I HIGHLY enjoyed this film not just from the awe-inspiring message it provided but also in the film's other qualities. A lot ranging from: A tender and very hilarious tone and script that brings the right amount of levity and emotional punch the movie provides on it's message and main character, some great camerawork and shot composition from director Peter Weir, an obviously well made message on modern society from writer Andrew Niccol, a fantastic pace that takes it's time to set the mystery and intrigue for the film, lots of very memorable moments both from it's hilarity and it's serious scenes, great performances from all of it's secondary main cast and of course a very fitting and charismatic performance from Jim Carry that is memorable all together while keeping his over-the-top personality in check compared to films like Dumb & Dumber and Ace Ventura. And honestly despite my rating, I can't think of much that is at fault with the film because of my enjoyment of it overall (which is sometimes rare of me to do), So overall this is a film I'm glad exists that not only balances it's theme with a overall funny tone with Jim Carry but was, for the time it was released, a film for the ages that who would of thought been the center ground on a lot people's, especially me, cynical view on society being obsessed with celebrities like Kim Kardashian, The Real Housewives and Honey Boo Boo, all while watching \"Reality TV shows\" that are fabricated to make the audience care and watch something not all that real.\n\nScore: 8.5 / 10",

This is one of THE movies that guarantees a mixed love-it-or-hate it response; I can't really say whether or not you're going to like the concept of this film unless you sit through it. This is also a very atypical Jim Carrey film because it's not a comedy. It's a drama.\n\nSo the whole idea is the title character, Truman Burbank, lives in a town that he does not realize is actually a reality show set. The entire show is his life story without his knowledge. There are things that can tip it off such as odd effects like rain, coincidences, and slipping plug-ins happening all the time.\n\nOne of the things that is meant to serve as conflict is the \"girlfriend\" trying to tell Truman he's in a show. Standard. What really starts the dominoes falling is the radio on Truman's car shorting out and transmitting directions from the stage's control room.\n\nOne of my problems is Truman starts to realize that he's in a show too early. That should be a revelation at the halfway point.\n\nThere is a bit of awkwardness in some of the scenes such as the first trip to the boat dock. Carrey looks like he's having a seizure. But he is solid in this movie. And it does have a rather epic climax.\n\nThere are parts of the film I liked, but the move to make this a low-key \"reality show\" may have worked too well. I like the idea behind this film. I just don't think this is the best execution of it. I can see why people love this movie, but I don't think I'm one of them.",

I love the fact that he is slowly discovering the false nature of the world around him, and piecing together the puzzle, trying to deduce why his life feels so artificial. His mission to find the truth by behaving erratically is intriguing. In fact it might have worked better if they never clued us into the fact that it was a show until the very end, and let us try to figure out what was going on along with him. My difficulty with this film has always been the behind-the-scenes section where we see the creators of the show, and watch them talking about the process. The sudden switch to things like a talk show interview and watching the crew manipulating Truman is out of place and stops the momentum of the movie completely. I love Ed Harris, but he plays Christof a little too dramatically and it spoils the simple magic of the movie we watched up until that point. It's fun to watch Truman walk into a travel agency and seeing a poster of a plane disaster which says \"It could happen to you!\" which allows us to chuckle at the obvious lengths the producers are going through to keep him on the island. It's much less fun to watch a group of tech guys with headsets on discussing how they need to create a traffic jam or something. I think the story of The Truman Show is engaging, and takes a good look at our reality TV culture (years before it even got started.) I just wish they had figured out a better method of keeping the story entirely focused on Truman, and allowing us to experience the events from his perspective.",

The plot surrounds Truman and his monotonous routine with a wife, a nice house and good job until he meets a girl he fancies named Lauren who convinces him that he is living in a set. This immensely scares Truman as he comes to grips with the reality that his mother, father, wife and friends are all paid actors to continue the illusion that Truman is living in the real world and the fictitious Seahaven island. The story seems to allude to the control that corporations have on everyday life. The world in which Truman lives has a Utopian feel to it and the people he encounters have genuine scripts without cue cards which makes it feel as if it is real-life. Truman lives the American Dream of sorts in the suburbs outside of LA in the tremendously large set and everything that transpires is synchronized and orderly. The audience is supposed to see Truman as the hero and protagonist figure as everything that has happened to him was decided by others from birth to the current moment, even the routines he completes are suggested by people within the set. A Foreshadow to this occurs when he sees water and he is frightened and then we are told that his father died in a boating accident that was brought about because of Truman's fascination with leaving the island. The film seems to offer a social commentary on American life and the advertising phenomenon as things from sodas, to lawn mowers are marketed in the middle of the show. The patterns and loops that occur on the show helps him to realize that he is being manipulated by a set and the show. A moral commentary is offered when Christof the show's director claims that what they are doing is Christian because he has created a life for Truman and that he know's what's best for him. From the music that is played, to the weather and sets Truman is controlled by a machine and I can see the man v. machine dynamic at play. Upon the movies resolution, Truman leaves the set and breaks free from the chains of the television company. I thought this was a well made film and I enjoyed it a lot. The messages being portrayed were complex and thought-provoking.",

When technical qualities match the ingenious vision, quality art ensues and remains as one-of-a-kind.\n\nOh, and there's also Jim Carrey, the titular character. What a performance.

O Show de Truman fala sobre a vida de Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey, lindo maravilhoso e humilde), filmada diariamente por 5mil c\u00e2meras de TV, como em um reality show, menos pelo fato de que ele n\u00e3o sabe que sua vida pessoal nunca foi t\u00e3o pessoal assim.

Viver uma mentira, um conto de fadas, pode ser maravilhoso por um dia, uma semana, quem sabe at\u00e9 um ano... Na verdade, viver um conto de fadas seria maravilhoso, mas parando pra pensar, precisamos de desafios para nos manter \"ao vivo\". - ........ - \u00c9 isso que torna a vida excitante.

The Truman Show was a revolutionary movie that deeply criticized the media in a creative way that could be enjoyed by almost anybody.\n\nAnd this movie worked so much, this movie kept its focus where it should of been and stayed with its lesson throughout the movie, but did so casually without dedicating special time in the movie just to teach the lesson, the movie was the lesson and it worked so well.\n\nMy only complaint with this movie was the pacing. This movie tried to fit so much content into such little time that the actual plot felt rushed and failed to feel natural. The plot moves so fast that the changes in the characters are passed by so quickly that the audience cannot sit back and think about how these characters changed. But overall this is more nit picking and the way the characters actually change are enjoyable and does help the story.\n\nOverall The Truman Show is a absolute classic movie with a great meaning and plot but could be flushed out just a bit more.",

After you bought your TV, your car, your house, you may think it's done there; you do not realize you buy your human connection, your adventures, your thrills and romances as well in the perfect order of 0s and 1s. With an empathic actor as a surrogate, your life lives in your screen. At a bar, at a diner, in the house with your family, and alone in your bathroom, as vividly displayed in the film, we are always looking for somebody else to empathize and sympathize with, somebody to make us feel wanted, and normal, and ironically, special.\n\nEvery character there represents a social niche we need in our lives and the dual reality needed to make them work. From the director's acid-like value of privacy, to the career Truman had 'chosen', we see the irony disgustingly raw in our faces. The beauty of such science fiction films is the truth they portray about our modern lives; the Truman Show makes the 'lies' of a mythical society remark the 'truths' of ours. Picasso would have loved it.\n\nThough this film is catalogue often under comedy, an exchange of actor coupled with a slightly different soundtrack and editing style, you get a very possible horror film. Unfortunately, people see Jim Carrey in the cast and want to come out of the movie theater with aching stomachs, and drying drool on the side of their lips, when Carrey has done great work on more serious roles like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Number23. \n\nOverall, the Truman Show is a hallmark in the history of film, and a relevant and important classic to our civil-ization.",

And Truman's triumph in being his own person at the end of the movie, making his own desicion, his choice to stay in reality tv land or be his own person in the real world. And the actor's around him, act the part but that's their job and if they don't then they are out of the tv show. To be , you would think that a corporation would adopt Truman or any child and make him be in a reality show to make the person who adopts the orphan makes all the money and don't giving a lick to the orphan over their entire life. But don't forget about that cliff hanger, I hate when they do cliff hanger s in phenomenal movies, like this one, I hope that this movie gets a sequel because I want to know what happened to Truman and how he survives in the real world.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is a fantastic film. Jim Carrey really plays his character, Truman Burbank, to perfection in this question inducing take on the constant need for reality TV. One of Carrey's best.\nTruman Burbank has been the star of a nationwide television series aired 24 hours a day, chronicling his everyday life, but he's the only one who doesn't know about any of it. Truman suspects foul play when things don't fall into place, realizing that everyone he has loved and known are simply acting. This leads Truman to find the real world in Fiji, hoping to find a college crush and conquering his fear of the sea.\nI entered with this film on Netflix, noticing I had already watched a half hour's worth of it some other time earlier this year. It was odd, because I continously got hooked in every aspect the movie showed. The film's anti-hero, the show creator known only as Christof, seems to play God along with Truman's once desired and brings up either a lot of questions or a heated debate in the end. Great film, though, Carrey nails his character. \"Just in case you don't see me, have a good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\"",

The Truman Show is an original movie that was masterfully done well. It's directed very well by Peter Weir with a great script by Andrew Niccol. The premise may seem like a one joke movie, but Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol took advantage of it and create a story for it that's really interesting and really good. Of course with Jim Carrey, it's going to be a comedy film, but there's actually some drama scenes, that were really done well and Jim Carrey, while being really funny in this, is a great drama actor in this that shows that he's not just a comedian. The subtle humor in it is really obvious, but it was intentional that way and it works in that type of premise. The acting is really good, and are really funny too in this. It is really thought-provoking and does leave you wondering about what you would do in this situation. The music, while some intentionally sappy for some comedic stuff, are really catchy and just gets you excited. The characters are memorable, and the ending is wonderfully well done. The Truman Show is an excellent movie that is not like anything you see from an average movie.",

And no, this is not an exaggeration. The Truman Show will keep you at the edge of your seat.. even after the movie has ended.\n\nTruman is the star of the most popular show in the planet: The Truman Show. The only thing is, he is not aware of it. Born into a huge television set and watched by thousands of cameras, people across the globe have seen his every move, live, from the moment he was born. However, lately he has been wondering about the rest of the world and about the whereabouts of his true love. With his whole world against him, this naive celebrity is now searching for the truth and a way to leave everything he knows.\n\nThe Truman Show would never have worked without Jim Carrey. He shows us a side of him never seen before this movie. We knew about his playful, sarcastic, and hilarious personality from films such as The Mask and Ace Ventura. But until this film we can see that he can act without the help of jokes and props. The film is so personal that it is impossible to cheat it. Director Peter Weir creates a perfect world for our protagonist and brings an incredible cast that adds charm and meaning to the film.\n\nThe story is deep, unique, and thought-provoking. There is some truthfulness to this reality show. The protagonist is sincere, but everything around him is fake. The events at every point in his life, his thoughts, his fears, everything has been modified and carefully managed at some point. Carefully taken care of. We may not be inside a big stage controlled by a TV producer, but who's to say today's society is not being controlled by media in the same exact way?\n\nAs the film reaches a conclusion, Truman leaves us and the audience with his famous catchphrase. The viewers, after a tiny spark of excitement, seem to wake up from a trance and change the channel to something other than a blank screen. That is it, off to another program. The similitude to reality is scary, but it also makes this movie quite extraordinary.",

But as he picks up on more and more clues, combined with the efforts of his on-screen father and former girlfriend to try and expose his existence to him, Truman eventually finds the truth.\n\nThe film is very well acted, with the lead role perfected by Jim Carrey in one of his most understated and poignant roles (no reliance on rubber face or slapstick gags in this one), and the supporting cast including Laura Linney, Ed Harris and Noah Emmerich performing perfectly. The film also includes a highly entertaining motif that allowed the audience to follow the thoughts and opinions of Truman's viewing audience.\n\nIt's incredibly thought-provoking, and scarily realistic, and it is a cornerstone of Hollywood film-making - and one of many highly successful films in Peter Weir's filmography.\n\n9/10",

            "content": "One Of Jim Carrey's most critically acclaimed performances, The Truman Show had a very interesting concept which could be excellent if executed just right,\n\nThe Truman Show can be looked at and interpreted in many ways because there are so many themes subtly within the film underneath the primary focus of its media satire and how the corporations manage to control the world with lies. If you examine the film closely, you can pick up on the fact that it has religious terminology as well in terms of the way that its character Christof plays god with the life of Truman Burbank, and it even has themes of psychology in it because the behaviour that the titular Truman Burbank exerts can be commonly associated with Schizophrenia. Frankly, The Truman Show could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people and proves to be a lot deeper than one might have expected it to be on the surface. Thanks to the fact that writer Andrew Niccol contributes both a very original concept and a screenplay full of complex themes and intelligent dialogue, The Truman Show is a great film from the start which only gets better as it goes on.\nWhile the pace may feel a little bit fast and the film may feel a little bit short for such a complicated science fiction concept, The Truman Show is still a film which will stand out to viewers like no other because of the kind of character that Truman Burbank is and the strange world that he lives in. The world is designed with spot on production design and scenery as well as being captured with excellent cinematography which gives the film a good technical platform. Its cinematography is especially terrific because of the fact that it is filmed and edited in a style that makes it feel like the viewers is genuinely watching a hidden camera reality TV show. The atmosphere of the film has a real sense of artificiality, and it is cleverly satirised as a way of the film poking fun at the idea of a utopia. So the general feel and energy of The Truman Show are just perfectly powerful, and thanks to dedicated direction from Peter Weir it is able to take advantage of its high concept plot. While maybe not as deeply and as largely scaled as a lot of viewers may like, its focus on the character Truman Burbank is still thought provoking and funny. So The Truman Show has a fine atmosphere and a story worth telling which Peter Weir does without challenge.\nFrankly, one of the best things about The Truman Show is the fact that it is one of those films which has viewers questioning reality. It makes them wonder just what a world it would be like if they were stuck in a reality TV show controlled by someone else without knowing it. It has the same kind of complex thinking behind it that The Matrix did, though it sacrifices the action concept in lieu of some simply light hearted dramatics and laughs. And quite frankly, it can be a mesmerising film which leaves audiences in a shocked state of mind. If like me, The Truman Show had you questioning the potential delusions and mysteries of reality, that means that The Truman Show really had you feeling something strange. And what a feeling it is. The Truman Show is one of those films which subtly uses complex dystopian themes to encourage audiences to be more independent and think for themselves, as well as how you can't sit around waiting for life to happen or wasting it all on some television screen. And lastly, it reminds us just how strange it is that humanity is so fascinated with reality TV when a lot of it is just artificial depictions of random people whose contributions to society are overemphasised. Frankly, it is difficult to walk away from The Truman Show without thinking deeply about it, and it is even harder to walk away from it without experiencing some form of serious entertainment.\nAnd quite frankly\nJim Carrey's leading performance in The Truman Show is just excellent. He ties the entire film together in one of the clearly best performances of his career, and it shows his true versatility as an actor. A lot of Jim Carrey's natural anecdotes which made him an iconic actor of comedy manage to transition well into drama in The Truman Show, and that is precisely what makes his performance memorable. As the world of Truman Burbank begins to slowly collapse around him, Jim Carrey performs as if he is suffering from true schizophrenia with a slight comedic edge so that he is still funny at times. And without even needing to study his performance closely you can tell that he is giving it his true all. Jim Carrey is just excellent in The Truman Show, and the film will go down in history as being one of his most iconic roles which it most deservedly is because of the way that he has viewers easily sympathising and caring about him for a large number of reasons. Plus, he benefits from Jim Carrey's naturally likable persona as well. So there is a hundred things to like about his performance in The Truman Show, and it is one of his deepest performances to date.\nEd Harris' depiction of Christof of a man who considers himself a god is spot on. He portrays him as a man of both wisdom and immense power and combines both positive and negative elements into his persona so that liking or hating him is based on the audience's opinion of his behaviour instead of his motives. Ed Harris delivers his lines with the passion of a man who has sunk into true power, and he makes the greedy media theme of the film just jump to life with immense strength within only a few scenes on screen. His line delivery is terrific as well.\nLaura Linney also gives a dramatically rich supporting performance, as does Noah Emmerich.\n\nSo while The Truman Show stays on a small scale and moves along so quickly that it can be a bit of a rush, it is a deep and complicated science fiction satire which is both funny and dramatic thanks to an absolutely perfect central performance from Jim Carrey.",

            "content": "I really felt like I needed a palate cleanser after being so disappointed with Pleasantville. I knew The Truman Show was a similar movie, but I also had heard a lot of good things about it. And don't get me wrong, before I go any further I must stress that I did enjoy The Truman Show a whole lot more than Pleasantville. But it wasn't the excellent movie I was hoping for. It offers up its own big problem.\r\n\r\nTruman was born and raised in a reality TV show. Everyone and everything around him is fake. The world he lives in is a giant set. The people around him are actors. The situations he finds himself in are contrived. But the whole time, Truman thinks he is living a real life. Because of this, his reaction to the fake world around him is genuine - and the show becomes a hit! A massive one at that. \"The Truman Show\" makes billions of dollars. And it all hinges on the fact that Truman must never know the truth. But when a few slip-ups cause Truman to question his world, the show runners struggle to keep their program running.\r\n\r\nI really do want to spend most of this review talking positively about the movie, so lets get the negative talk out of the way first. The main, overarching thing that brings the movie down for me is its simplistic and rather offensive view of God. The character of Christof represents God in the story (no surprise, his name is Christ-of after all). This character is shown as a controlling, obsessive, and downright insane individual who things his fake world is just as valid as the real one. It also shows him as the omnipresent string puller that he is - suggesting that God is some crazy control freak who sits in Heaven, completely dictating the lives of us, the people. I'm a Christian, and this view is not what God is! He gives us a free will, unlike Christof who plays Truman like a puppet. God allows us to choose our paths, even if he does ultimately know what paths we are going to choose. He doesn't make the choice for us. Free will. But this movie paints Him as a freak who is afraid of the \"real world,\" someone who will stop at nothing to keep us naive. And this aspect of the movie is so entirely wrong, that a lot of enjoyment was sucked out of the story for me. \r\n\r\nBut enough about that - there is a whole lot of good in this movie! The entire premise is so creative and intriguing. There are little things, like how the movie portrays product placement, that kept me smiling throughout! The movie really does provide for some biting commentary on our complete acceptance and faith in what we see on TV. Our society is essentially right where this movie predicted. A whole lot of Americans lap up \"reality\" shows. We never stop to consider how persuasive these influences are on our lives. This movie points this out, ultimately winding up being a few years ahead of its time. It's nifty.\r\n\r\nThe movie is so much more enjoyable than Pleasantville! Even if I didn't like some of its ideology, at least the movie remains challenging throughout. I never felt like I was being smashed over the head with an agenda. It's a subtly thought-provoking movie, for sure. And I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nAnd what surprised me the most was just how dramatic and effective this movie was. There are some truly tense scenes. Like when Truman begins to understand the lie, he makes a break for the outside world. His \"wife\" gets thoroughly freaked out by this episode. When he is finally stopped and sent back home, his wife unconvincingly tries to advertise some coffee. Truman is disgusted, and he lashes out. It's a really effective scene. As is the whole subplot with a past female cast member who tries to tell Truman the truth.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey doesn't often get to be so simultaneously comedic and dramatic, but he absolutely nails it as Truman! At times, he is laugh-out-loud funny. And at times, he is downright touching. Seeing him give his million dollar smile while going through his daily routine is priceless! \r\n\r\nThe supporting cast has one major highlight. The criminally underrated Noah Emmerich plays Truman's \"best friend\" Marion. There's a really well acted scene between Truman and Marion - and even though Marion is having his entire speech dictated to him by Christof, it's still extremely well acted!\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, I feel like I have to briefly talk about Ed Harris, who plays Christof. As Harris was nominated for an Oscar for the performance, I feel like I have to mention it. And he's alright. It's not bad acting, that's for sure. But as I mentioned above, I could not get behind anything the character represents.\r\n\r\nPeter Weir does a heck of a job making almost everything in this movie work. It truly is an imaginative movie. And it really is executed almost to perfection - with equally excellent drama and comedy. But sadly, the movie treats God like a maniac. And to that I say \"no thanks.\" But to everything else in this movie, I say \"thank you!\" Chew the meat and spit out the bones, that's how I treat The Truman Show.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" 6.5/10",

With the right mix of comedy and drama to go down with it\ntoo, The Truman Show shows us what a show is all about and in a true\nsense shows us how obsessed the ordinary person is with certain peoples\nlives. I felt the film was safely a great movie, and here below is why\nI felt that about it all.\n\nThe story is superbly smartly done and whoever even thought if this\nidea is just awesome, it brings us all the elements we want to see from\na film like this too and certain moments when Truman is finally seeing\nwhat the world is all about are just fantastic. The film isn't scared\nto be fun either as the story although is serious, the things we see in\nit sometimes aren't and we can get a few laughs out of this but as I\nsaid before, it incorporates the right amount of drama into it's plot\ntoo. One minor thing is that the for it's running time of 103 minutes\nit manages to fit such a complex plot into such a short amount of time,\njust brilliant in my opinion.\n\nJim Carrey portrays Truman in the way we always expect from Carrey,\nloud and very crazy, although this isn't like all his roles as Carrey\nhas to deal with the drama too and manages not to always be trying to\nbe funny, a good job from him. Ed Harris as the TV network head is kind\nof a strange mix of evil and goodness, where as he wants the show to\ncontinue, you can also tell it slightly eats him up that Truman is\nshown to people like this. The entire cast do an excellent job and even\nthe odd policeman or shoe owner seems to do there performance with a\nhop and a smile, just good fun had by all.\n\nPeter Weir does a fun job and really makes this his prime artistic\nvision that is brought to life perfectly, this is probably his best\npiece of work in my opinion. Andrew Niccol the writer also chips in\nwith his artistic vision in writing to create dialogue that just keeps\nare eyes on the screen to see what this insane thing is all about. I\nloved the sets used and not to ruin some cool things which you will see\nfor yourself but some things are positioned in some pretty neat places\ntoo.\n\nAlthough the film is great, it isn't without maybe minor things which\nstop it from being superb, Like for example I didn't find this that\nfunny and although it fun and bouncy when trying to be funny, you won't\nbe crying with laughter at this. I also felt the ending was poor and\nalthough it makes for an interesting end and one you definitely\nwouldn't expect, we don't get to explore much of it and just ends right\nthere right then. It isn't perfect but it is has very little problems\nso if you ignore them things, this could be one of the best films you\nwill ever see.\n\nFor those who love Jim Carrey well this is probably one of if not his\nbest work in film and although as I said he holds back on humour\nslightly, he still manages a fantastic performance as Truman which\nmixes a lot of elements together. I think if you ever wanted a thought\nprovoking film then this is it, I don't think it make you think\nphilosophically, but it makes you think about human nature and lying\netc, what the world really thinks of other people and how we talk about\neach other.\n\nOverall will give it a higher 8/10, Safely a Great movie, I couldn't recommend\nthis much more to you and especially to those who consider themselves\nas film connoisseurs as I feel this could be essential viewing. Have\nfun with this movie and it will reward you, come in thinking of it as\nsuper serious and you will be disappointed, I can assure you that\nwatching this can give you a little smile and although sometimes you\nmight feel like shouting \"GET OUT OF THERE TRUMAN\", you still just feel\nhappy for him the entire way through.",

Not that this may happen, but it shows the lengths humans will go through just to get entertainment.  Featuring a spectacular performance from a much more tame Jim Carrey, though he does go looney in a couple of scenes, it's a great satire on American's television habits, and just T.V. shows themselves.  It's funny, sweet, and emotionally investing, giving us a likable character in Truman.  My one complaint is that the ending is a little too abrupt, but that's all.  If you can accept the outlandish, yet unique, premise at hand, you'll find yourself immersed in this film.",

            "content": "The Truman Show is one of Jim Carey's best and most honest performances. It's also one of the most unusual, intriguing and original films I've seen. The Truman Show is about 30-year-old Truman Burbank whose whole entire life is a lie. Truman is unaware that is being filmed and is part of a reality TV show documenting his whole entire life from birth. Nothing is real; his family, friends and wife are all paid actors. Truman's home town, \"Seahaven\" is a film set, build in an archaeological dome. Truman begins to become aware that something in his life isn't right and he begins suspicious. He is trapped and barred from seeing the outside world; his attempts to travel outside of Seahaven are rebuffed. \r\n\r\nJim Carey has proven that not only is he a comedian, but that he is a serious and versatile actor who can take a step away from comic roles. He still injects some comedy into his role as Truman, but he is capable of being serious and portraying a lot of emotion. The film is very well acted; Laura Linney gives a really strong performance as Truman's wife, Meryl who you just want to punch in the face the whole entire time because she's a total bitch. Meryl is like a robotic 1950's housewife and has no true or genuine feelings for Truman. Ed Harris gives a good performance as the manipulative and calculating master behind the Truman Show, Christof. Natascha McElhone also gives a strong and emotive performance as Sylvia, the extra who Truman fell in love with and she is part of a campaign to free Truman.\r\n\r\nThe Truman Show brings up so many different themes, debates and issues such as our obsession with reality television and how manipulative and powerful the media can be in that it feeds us a false reality of the world. The Truman Show also depicts the American Dream with the whole white picket fence and shows how hollow and empty it can be. A lot of philosophical arguments and analogies can also be attached to the Truman Show such as Plato's analogy of the cage. The Truman Show shows everything that is wrong with our world. The thing that surprised me most about the film was that a majority of the people didn't see that the Truman Show was immoral or wrong. This is a truly eye-opening film which will stay with you. I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it. The Truman Show should be studied in all film classes.\r\n\r\nGrade: A+/A*",

He finally begins to gain awareness that there may be a man behind the curtain.  In a very foreshadowing manor, this came out right before the big reality television boom; sure, there was already MTV's The Real World, but reality TV didn't really take off until Survivor hit the scene in 2000.  The Truman Show really captures exactly what people crave from television today, and it is great at never letting you forget that all of this is being filmed, and everybody's watching.  Carrey can be superb when he is utilized correctly, and he does a great job playing this incredibly earnest character.  If I were to register a small complaint about this, though, it would be that he has a few of his trademark Carrey-isms that anybody can easily identify, and it did take me out of the movie at a couple of points.  The performance that Laura Linney turns in is grossly underrated; it is so difficult to portray an actor playing an actor, and she knocks it out of the park.  This manages to be both sweet and charming, and also serious when need be; when it gets real, it gets real.  This has a lot to say about the TV that we watch, and is ultimately a very human story.",

It tells the story of a man who has spent his entire life starring in a tv show without knowing it.  After a television network adopts him as a baby, he grows up in a world that is composed of actors on an elaborate set.  This is the only world that he has ever known and the film is essentially a sociological study of how a person accepts the circumstances in which he lives.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film is its accurate prediction of America's obsession with reality tv.  At the time of \"The Truman Show's\" release in 1998, Americans had not been introduced to shows like \"Big Brother\" and \"Survivor.\"  And yet, the connection that the home audience forms with Truman is precisely what draws crowds to reality television today.  The script is fantastic, taking the perspective of the show producers and showing how they have introduced certain events into Truman's life to keep him from exploring beyond the climate controlled world that they have created.  It accounts for the funding of the show through product placement, the crazy fans who have tried to sneak onto the set, and even the girl that loves Truman and wants to reveal the truth to him.  Most importantly, it paints Truman to be a lovable character that everybody can relate to and root for.  I'm glad to see that the script was acknowledged with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The acting is also great, with Jim Carrey playing this dramatic role to perfection as he adds a few goofy quirks to make him more relatable.  Laura Linney isn't always my favorite actress but I love to watch her play this role within a role.  Add in Ed Harris whose two incredible emotional moments earned him an Oscar nomination and Paul Giamatti is so great that his very presence makes any movie better, even in a small role.  There really isn't anything bad to be said about \"The Truman Show.\"  From the interesting minimalist score by Philip Glass to the many clever ideas throughout the show's \"production,\" this film will leave you wondering if you were actually watching real life unfold within a television show that existed in real life and was rebroadcasted as a movie.",

This makes him more curious as he is desperate to leave the place and find out what is actually outside Seahaven since his friends and family keep on disappearing and appearing out of nowhere. This comedy/drama/science-fiction gave us a clean, strong message on not just the social media commentary but also about how reality views TV life and how they view us.

The film explores-sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly-such topics as libertarianism, religion, existentialism, and the search for truth in a world of uncertainty.

            "content": "This biting dark comedy tells the story of a man coming to the realisation that his whole life has been followed by cameras for a reality TV show. It's a satirical comment on pop culture but also the gripping tale of the desperation of a man who feels his world coming down on him as he realises that his real world was never real to begin with. But what is striking is the way in which director Peter Weir lets his film be naturally infused with a sense of tenderness that avoids the coldness of most of the films that deal with the theme of the power of media on the people. Jim Carrey turns in another great performance as Truman, and the film is entertaining as well as thought provoking.",

Biggest strength: Stirring execution of the premise of a \"random\" person's life, from Day 1, being entirely televised for the whole world, with everything in this person's life being scripted (to the in-film director's best ability). Biggest weakness: At some points, we are to consider whether or not the isolated, crime-free world in which Truman has lived is truly better than the real, crime-ridden world that watches Truman's life. Andrew Niccol does not follow with that fully, instead wishing to indulge us, the viewers of his movie, with these vague notions of needing to be free, and rooting for the romance(?) between Carrey and some woman who first told him that his entire life is a lie. Leave it be, Niccol! You came dangerously close to self-parody, in certain scenes. Thankfully, Peter Weir had the chops to bring most of the scenes into comedic light; better yet, the casting choice of Jim Carrey helped even more. There were some delightful moments of simply watching Truman do his routine thing. Weir and Carrey are unitedly responsible for letting us, the audience, care about Truman, even if not as much as the audience of the in-film Truman Show.",

Por lo mismo me sorprend\u00eda que una empresa tan grande como lo es Paramount Pictures aceptara producir esta cinta; pero al final es posible darse cuenta del por qu\u00e9. Esta pel\u00edcula pod\u00eda tomar dos rutas: La primera era provocar una verdadera reflexi\u00f3n en el espectador, continuando mediante tem\u00e1ticas complejas y originales, como lo es la idea general de el filme y sin la necesidad de mostrar un final feliz, o, la segunda opci\u00f3n, ir encaminando la historia poco a poco hacia la cl\u00e1sica pel\u00edcula hollywoodense en la que el chico bueno derrota al villano, despu\u00e9s de haberse ganado el aprecio de todo el p\u00fablico, provocando entretenimiento sin que se le de gran enfoque a la concientizaci\u00f3n del espectador, y dejando un buen sabor de boca en la mayor cantidad de audiencia posible, llev\u00e1ndola al mismo tiempo a un mayor \u00e9xito comercial. Peter Weir y Andrew Niccol eligieron la segunda.\nA pesar de ello, la pel\u00edcula es definitivamente inteligente y bien pensada, con ideas frescas e ingeniosas, adem\u00e1s de una historia envolvente y entretenida.\nLa actuaci\u00f3n de Jim Carrey le a\u00f1ade dinamismo y diversi\u00f3n en la mayor\u00eda de los momentos, sobre todo en las casi inexistentes ocasiones en las que el ritmo de la pel\u00edcula llega a tornarse m\u00e1s lento.\nLa fotograf\u00eda es bastante agradable y presenta tomas poco comunes para un filme comercial, cosa que lo vuelve m\u00e1s deleitable. Otra aspecto que no hay que olvidar, es la banda sonora compuesta por el talentoso m\u00fasico minimalista Phillip Glass.\nEn general, The Truman Show es una pel\u00edcula realmente disfrutable, que de una manera bastante imaginativa y divertida, har\u00e1 pasar un buen rato a quien sea que la mire, y dependiendo de quien la mir\u00e9, podr\u00e1 llevarlo tambi\u00e9n a la reflexi\u00f3n.\nUn importante logro cinematogr\u00e1fico que vale la pena mirar.",

Jim Carrey gives a powerful performance as the titular character, whose wide-eyed optimism and sense of humor make it nearly impossible not to root for him.

Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out.  One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality tv and its effect on our culture.  It also explores themes such as the nature of reality.  It's just an incredible film all around, and should be seen by everyone.",

And those are the Jim Carrey films that I love to see, because when you take away his comedic appeal, you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor.\nCarrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show. He has been on the show ever since he was an infant. Despite having kept this a secret for 30 years, Truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life, despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him.\nWhere does Truman want to go? Well, in a very interesting subplot, we learn that Truman wants to visit Fiji. Why? Because the girl of his dreams, (previously an extra on the show, now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free Truman with the help of political activism) was taken away by her supposed father, who hastily replied that they were going to Fiji. Now Truman wants to go to Fiji to reunite with the love of his life, and escape his blond and boring wife.\nIf there's one thing that holds this film together, it's the acting. Not just from Carrey, but from the supporting cast, which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor, and they pull it off flawlessly.\nOne of \"The Truman Show's\" themes is feeding into ones anxieties. It carries this off by having Truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive. There's a really funny and well done scene where Truman goes mad, and attempts to drive to anywhere in America, and the show tried to retail irate by presenting Truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic, forest fires and chemical leaks. It makes me happy that I didn't see it when I was younger, because it surely would upset me. But even still, Truman still attempts to escape, giving the character a sense of courage. \nAnd that's what makes \"The Truman Show\" work. The character is great. The character is relatable. He represents a great film character. And what great film character would be complete without a great film. \"The Truman Show.\" Check it out.",

            "content": "In the days of \"Jersey Shore\" and \"Jon & Kate Plus 8,\" \"The Truman Show\" is refreshing (possibly even more now than it was in 1998) because it takes the media's annoying habit of indulging themselves in others personal lives for cash, and spins it into a juicy satire. \u00a0Jim Carrey seems like an odd fit for a genre made for deadpan leading men, considering his physical comedy roots, but he's perfectly cast here, making the stereotypical nice guy not so ordinary.\n\tYou can't help but feel sorry for Carrey's character, a poor fellow named Truman Burbank, who was chosen at birth to star in his own reality TV show.  You might already be thinking of a trashy one you'd see on Bravo or E!, but that's not the case.  Instead, the producers of his \"show\" follow his life 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which ends up being quite inspirational and rewarding to most viewers.  The problem is, is after 30 years, Truman is growing suspicious of his too prim-and-proper life.\n\tHe's married to a woman (Laura Linney) that's so bright and cheery that it can't be right.  His entire town is friendly to him, and every time he tries to leave \"his\" city, something goes apparently awry, so he can't.  But after years of frustration, Truman realizes that it all might not be just a coincidence.\n\tThere's a sort of bizarro parallel between Truman and Kim Kardashian. \u00a0While they're not similar in personality (or gender), they both are huge figures in how the public hungers to see somebody else live their lives. \u00a0Kardashian seeks out the attention, with her high profile romances and bad decisions; Truman represents the golden \"real world,\" which is most likely why his audience finds him so entertaining-- they can relate to him. \u00a0In opposition, people today look to Kardashian as a person who is glamorous, ridiculous (to the point of almost seeming fictional) and fascinating, for all the wrong reasons. \u00a0The point is, no matter who the focal point is, the public can't help to escape their lives and get a head-on view of someone else's.\n\tThe performances are durably excellent. \u00a0Carrey has terrific comedic power, but sometimes it can be a bit tiring; here, it's put to good use, as he plays a quirky man that still manages to be realistic, and often times is somber enough to move us. \u00a0The rest of the cast, who are all playing actors in Truman's life, manage to keep the light air of sleaziness (as they're all complete fakes) and robotic-ness. \u00a0The actors create a great sense of the real and fake of Truman's life, and that's a difficult thing to do.\n           Andrew Niccol's screenplay is compelling, because, while it definitely has a bit of a comedic, sci-fi edge, it works as a unique drama. \u00a0It's always upsetting to see Truman's life get controlled by television just for entertainment, since you can't help but wonder how different his life could be if it was like anyone else's. \u00a0The quieter moments of the film are the best, as there is a bittersweetness about them that you know are too good to necessarily be true. \u00a0The fakery set around Truman's world, with every single place truly looking like a movie set, is thought-provoking; the movies, TV shows, and advertisements making \"home\" enticing to Truman is near insane, as the producers of his show are so desperate to lock him into his own little world.\n       \"The Truman Show\" has aged well over the years, since reality show heaven has truly set in. \u00a0It's unnatural style surely makes it a candidate to work as a companion piece to \"Being John Malkovich\" of the next year -- but \"The Truman Show\" is great enough to stand alone.",

The movie's premise is already unusually clever, but under director Peter Weir, the execution is funny, dramatic, poignant, dark, and altogether exceptional. Jim Carrey gives on of the best performances of his career as Truman Burbank, a man unaware that he is being watched by the entire world. Carrey gives Truman a comedic touch, but it is not his usual over the top routine, instead he feels warm, relatable and human. Other good performances in the movie include Laura Linney as Truman's ideal wife  Meryl, Noah Emmerich as Truman's best friend Marlon, however the real scene-stealer is Ed Harris as the show's director Christof, who effectively portrays a man fiercely commited to keeping Truman in his artificial world. Almost every aspect of the movie works from Phillip Glass' solid musical score, to the thoughtful religious allusions that can be seen especially towards the end. Overall The Truman Show may work well with a unique premise and as social satire, but it is so much more than that. A genuine human story is what makes this movie so memorable. It remains my favorite Jim Carrey movie, and one that should be seen by everyone of his fans.",

The story for this film is just so original and unique but it is extremely well written, a film like this could have been a disaster had it not been written well. This film had me invested right from the beginning and did not let me go until the credits began, everything in the story was just so interesting because I had never seen anything like it before. I honestly don't know what genre this movie fits into, there are some dramatic moments but there are also a few comedic moments and they both work very well. Peter Weir does an incredible job at directing this film and helps bring Niccol's vision to life. Weir does an amazing job at directing his actors and he also does a good job at keeping a steady tone. Sometimes the tone could be a little off when there's both drama and humor but Weir does it perfectly in this movie. Weir also does a great job at setting up some of these incredible shots, there are some scenes in this movie were the camera is just facing Jim Carrey from a mirror or from a car radio and they just look amazing. Speaking of Carrey, the performances in this movie are great. Jim Carrey is just phenomenal in this movie and gives one of his best performances, this is not the comedian Jim Carrey in this movie and I thought it was fascinating that he got himself out of that and gave a great performance in this serious role. Ed Harris is in this film as well and he's great as always. In the supporting cast you have Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, and Natasha McElhone and they all give very good performances. In the end The Truman Show is a fantastic film that shouldn't be missed, definitely check this movie out if you haven't already!",

I'm just not a fan of Jim Carrey's extremely comic and over-the-top performances, so it's hard for me to get past that in this film. But the concept and story is strong.

The film is so prophetic in its deliverance of the message, it is honestly one of the most original scripts in cinema history,  but it really makes you understand the lengths we will go through to get our entertainment and the idiocy of that entertainment.  Andrew Niccol wrote the screenplay, whose first film, Gattaca, is one of the most well written and original science-fiction films of all time, really makes this a hilarious, but intelligent study of our modes of entertainment. Jim Carrey gives his greatest performance as the naive and somewhat neurotic Truman, he makes the role seem natural and fluid, as if he is just rolling with everything and discovering it with us. But as for Peter Weir, this film is so much different from the rest of his work, he creates a very different tone and atmosphere to this film. It works very well though, and it may be his best work, its right up there with Witness, but the only film of his I could compare this to would be Fearless. His work with fantastic elements in Fearless are somewhat apparent in The Truman Show, but for the most part he makes radical change in directorial style. Overall, this film is a masterpiece,  and essential viewing.",

Andrew Niccol's screenplay is great for the fact that it is not complex what so ever but at the same time it is a film that will keep your attention. This dramedy has some very funny moments based on various \"mishaps\" where our protagonist begins to come closer to realizing that his life is in fact a worldwide broadcast television show, where everyone around him are actors. Jim Carrey in his Golden Globe winning performance is fun, serious and at the same time his same old self...which is a good thing and fits for this film. I liked that Carrey was not nearly as over the top as usual. He actually gave an in depth performance showing confusion, fear and determination to discover the truth to his life. Leading to a solid climax and ending.\n\nThe film was very well paced, at first showing us Truman's life, giving us insight and informing us as to why his life is so interesting. Which it is, its broadcast 24 hours a day for the world to watch. The film even flips at times to the outside world where literally everyone stops what they are doing to watch Truman's life. The direction the film goes shows' the mystery of his life, and even begins going into a thrilling aspect as he gets closer and closer to discovering the truth. From disappearing and getting on to a boat in an attempt to flee. \n\nEd Harris as Christof the corporate mogul who \"adopted\" Truman and determines what happens in his life is, villainous. The man is playing with a person's life and towards the films end nearly drowns him via artificial weather to keep the secret in. Christof is cold, calculating and manipulative but even he could not stop Truman from uncovering the mystery of his life.\n\nDespite being a good drama with story and thrills it is also has very funny moments, such as every time Truman has attempted to leave or tried to leave, there was always some reason as to why he could not. Most of the humour itself though is from our star, Jim Carrey with his own zanny antics and personality. No doubt his best performance.",

He discovers his seemingly perfect life begins to get weird, when his father, to whom he thought was deceased after falling off a boat when he was young, turns up alive one day. It also gets odd when he, along with his supposed wife (Laura Linney), try to flee for trip of his coastal village and his attempts fail when he is stopped every single time. Frustrating and entertaining comedy works, even if Carrey can get annoying after a while. Definitely a freaky movie in that shows like this do exist today, although my assumption is that 1) they don't take place in a dome; and 2) the person being filmed is aware of the camera.

Unaware.\"\n\nThe Truman Show may have one of the most genius premises ever for a film. There's, especially today, always this fear of being watched. With all the paranoia about our phone calls and texts being sold to the government and with cameras everywhere and anywhere, it's a common part of our everyday. So with The Truman Show, we view a protagonist whose whole existence is a tv show. He's been on the air for thirty years, since his birth and he doesn't even know it.\u00a0\n\nTruman is a married, insurance agent. That's his \"character\" in the tv show, The Truman Show, that he stars as. The show was created by Christof, and everyone in the town he lives in is in on it. They are all actors. Truman is beginning to suspect all this and just wants to find the girl who he really wants to be with. But the show controls his life without his even knowing it.\u00a0\n\nThis film is pretty much flawless. It's well thought out and just keeps getting better as it goes on, while many movies with great premises like this run out of steam near the end. The Truman Show is a perfect example, that great writing is what makes a movie great. Sure Peter Weir is legendary director and his work here is among his best, but what makes this movie so good, is definitely the screenplay. Also you gotta love Jim Carey in movies like this. This is where he thrives.\n\nSo if you haven't seen The Truman Show, it is a must watch. It's nonstop fun, intelligent entertainment. The story has good ideas present at every turning point, and just when you think the movie has reached as good of quality as it can, it introduces something else that makes it even better. This is a masterpiece and it would be a shame to miss a film like this one.",

            "content": "The Truman Show has one of the best original stories put to screen. There's everything that a film lover could dream of in this movie. The story follows Truman Burbank, a man who starts noticing weird things happening around him in his everyday life such as lights falling from the sky, weird product advertising, and strange visions. What he doesn't know is that the whole world is watching him on tv through a 24 hour tv program called The Truman Show. What ensues is an extremely fun and thought provoking ride for freedom. Jim Carrey can be a chameleon, he can do comedy perfectly in films like The Mask and Dumb and Dumber, but he nails drama too. He gave an incredible performance that was charismatic, charming, goofy, and inspiring too. Truman is a relatable character even though he is kept in a fake world. He loves and functions the way a normal person would and honestly I'd act the way he did if I was put in his shoes. It was really neat to see how the society around him influenced his overall attitude through many \"magic of tv\" moments. Ed Harris was great as well! He was sort of Truman's puppet master who created the show and controls what will happen each day. He's also kind of a self proclaimed father figure, given that he's grown up with Truman and watched him age along with him. His performance was menacing but also really engaging. The originality of this story is unbeatable. It's movies like this that are hard to come by, I can't think of another movie that's like the Truman Show and that's impressive. The creation of this world where everything is perfect has been done before but never through a tv screen and through manipulative dialogue from just plain actors in said show. The way the set is built was really impressive. It looked like a really happy town with really quirky colors and visuals that just pop. This also goes in hand with some great camerawork too. Those combined make for some quirky fun visuals and convincing TV set. The movie is also a bit of a satire on corny tv shows in a way. It's able to make fun of obvious product placement and really screwy catchphrases and show how ridiculous they are in an audience perspective. I can go in a lot of depth as to how far this movie goes to achieve its greatness and honestly that's one of the best compliments you can give a movie. I can analyze the heck out of this movie with all that goes on. The Truman Show is a really fun, original film that has memorable performances, a really thought provoking message about humanity, laugh out loud moments, and great camerawork. It's nearly impossible to hate. A-",

Following the story of Truman - a many who is \"on the air; unaware\" 24/7 - keeps us gripped to our seats and eager to find out more. A film that just betters with age, and becomes a more & more relevant satire as our society moves towards reality TV reliance and obsessed with celebrity culture. Definitely Carrey's best role, The Truman Show provides us with what we never realised we wanted: a cold hard look in a mirror, and the unsettling paranoia that there may be a camera behind it.",

            "content": "To state the obvious: Humanity is continually moving into the future with rapid progression in technology. From the use of the spear to the sensation of global communication provided from the internet; technology is proving to be a valued commodity within society. A notable achievement within the technology realm is the Television; a device that has ultimately become popular within mass-culture with it's condescending and catechizing power. In the age of 'Big Brother' and 'Survivor', it's quite evident that 'Reality Television' has become an immensely popular aspect. 'The Truman Show' focuses as a satirization of such popularity, and while the idea of 'the media hiding the truth' seems tiresome and obvious, it's quite shocking to see that the film resembles an actual present representation of the power of contemporary television.\n\nThe film revolves around the man of the hour, Truman (Carrey). Truman occupies an idealistic world; he has the friendly neighbors, the great job, the beautiful wife and the best friend, the American Dream right? However, despite such virtues there are a few things that are missing within Truman's life. His father supposedly drowned when he was a kid, he wants to travel to Fiji but is constantly disallowed and he has lost his true love, which Truman poignantly attempts to recreate through magazine clippings. Truman's world is artificial. His life is idealistic because the world he inhabits is a reality TV show, dubbed 'The Truman show'. Truman focuses as a puppet for the creator of the show, Christof (Harris).\n\nJust from a quick summary of the plot details, it's quite evident with such a concept that the film could of easily fell into the pits of a melodramatic affair with such an extremity example; thank god for Carrey. Gaining recognition from films such as 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Liar Liar', it's unfortunate to see that Carrey has fallen under his own personal stereotype of that 'Comic actor that plays dumb people well', and while his performance of such characters are memorable, it's so much more rewarding to watch Carrey play a character that creates a balance between the comedic and emotional aspects rather than a focus on his comedic ease. Similar to his performance in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Carrey creates a character that is easy to sympathize with; Truman is a normal man who wants normal ideals rather than being the star of Televisions most popular show, and in the end, we are cheering for his freedom just as much as the audience.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, Carrey questions this 'Reality'. Initially, Truman is treated to number of clues that lend to his suspicion, however, the creators continual use their props to cease Truman's questioning. Eventually, Truman pushes the limits of his jurisdiction through a number of hilarious comedic sequence with Carrey and his 'Wife' (Linning). Truman is trapped within his own prison, his actions consist of no purpose when everything reacts to his personal response. Through these sequences, Weir is obviously providing the social commentary of modern technology restricting individuals liberation and privacy: To what point must an individuals life become a form of emotional exploitation for the audience benefits? 'The Truman show' explores these themes that contain evident resonance to modern media and it's obsession of obtaining every detail of individuals life's.\n\nDespite these virtues, the film at times does become tedious, as the drama seems to arise from repetitive motivations; Truman gets a clue, challenges them and then finds himself back to normal due to the creators innovation. Thankfully, Truman goes the whole nine yards through the conclusion. Truman devises a plan that diverts the attention away from his actions and uses a boat to travel to the real world. One of the most brilliant aspects of the film's ending and Truman's triumphs is that we realize how much emotional investment we have within the protagonist; his final sequences are truly poignant. Through the ending Truman comes into contact with Christof, his maker. Christof offers him the choice of choosing between the idealistic or realistic world. In brilliant fashion, Truman simply replies \"If i don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\" After this triumphant moment, Weir shows two of the audience who neglect this monumental moment and simply wonder what the next TV show is. Weir's final commentary focuses on the TV's brainwashing power; even after watching such a moment of a man displaying the problems with having a TV show that violates the ethics of an individuals right, there may be some who attempt to solve the problem, but most of the mass culture will continue to act as passive receivers to the TV's catechizing power. Weir is ultimately suggesting that we must question the power that the TV withholds on the world. \n\n\nAs a great artist once said \"Television rules the nation.\"",

            "content": "I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.\n\nThe Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called \"Special Service\".\n\nAfter the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.\n\nMade with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.\n\nThe movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.\n\nUnaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.\n\nThe thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.\n\nThe movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.\n\nThe script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.\n\nBefore making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).\n\nThe movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show. Andrew Niccol went ahead to do more great movies from S1m0ne with Al pacino in 2002 to The Terminal with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in 2004.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

It doesn't bother Truman and life goes on, but a few days later things start happening that bothers him and thinks there is a new world out there. The director, Cristof doesn't want Truman to leave and so don't the rest of the people in his world. With everyone watching, including people at a bar, a man in a tub, two security guards, a woman and two old ladies, will he be able to get out? Carrey, in his world of comedy picks out a dramatic role. He is outstanding and so is Ed Harris. 3 Dimensional characters are everywhere in the our two worlds, the earth and the dome. A fitting original score and thought out scenes help the movie get off the ground into higher territory. A fantastical adventure.\n\n98/100 A",

Happy-go-lucky Truman Burbank (Carrey) is a real man in a simulated world broadcast around the globe as 'The Truman Show'. After 30 years unaware of being on the air, Truman soon realizes everything he knows about the world isn't what it seems. Show-creator Christof (played by Ed Helms in an Oscar-nominated role) is suddenly forced to thwart Truman's escape from his zoo-like surroundings. Now it's rare nowadays to find originality in anything on the screen (large and small), and this rare gem is truly the very definition of 'original'. The acting, directing, script, and musical score are grade-A work, and the film itself will hopefully be recalled as a modern classic in the near future.",
