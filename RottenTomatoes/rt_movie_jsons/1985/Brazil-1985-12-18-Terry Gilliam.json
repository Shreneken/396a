I didn't like it as much as him but I can easily acknowledge that this is an extremely well made movie that was totally unique for when it came out in 1985, which was a great year for film. While it did lose me a couple of times and while I wish Robert DeNiro had more screen time, I really loved the acting, the action, the human-kind philosophy behind every scene, the well-executed humor, and the beautiful way in which certain scenes looked like a painting out of a museum! I will likely watch it again one day just to make sure that I can understand more of it since it's a movie that requires multiple viewings. Not my favorite film like Doug's but I can definitely see why this would be a favorite! I also feel like it's definitely not as widely talked about as it deserves to be like other films of its kind (like the Fifth Element, Minority Report, or Total Recall). I give it credit for its creativity!",

As much as I am fond of Time Bandits and The Adventures of Baron Manchausen, two childhood favourites, and also Twelve Monkeys, I consider Brazil Gilliam's masterpiece.\n\nOn a visual and technical level, Brazil is outstanding. The cinematography and effects are well and truly exemplary, as is the make up, but I loved the authentic sound and the genuine atmosphere Brazil exuded.\n\nMichael Kamen is a composer that I have a lot of respect for, and Brazil is no exception. His score is both of beautiful and haunting quality and really helps to enhance the atmosphere. The story does have a simplicity and complexity, it has a wonderful idea, has something to say and explores it well.\n\nThe script also impresses. It is thoughtful and deep, but it also has its funny moments of the subtle kind. Gilliam's direction is superb too. The acting is really tremendous. I loved Robert DeNiro, Ian Richardson and Jim Broadbent here and Kim Griest gives a performance of considerable depth avoiding any signs of blandness, but the picture acting-wise belongs to Jonathan Pryce. Pryce is just superb in this film, and while he has done a lot of solid work such as Regeneration, The Ploughman's Lunch and The Adventures of Baron Manchausen I think the role of Sam Lowry from Brazil is his best performance.\n\nI can understand why some mayn't like Brazil. It is a lengthy movie, people might find they like the idea but find there isn't enough to say or they even mayn't like Gilliam and his style. I will admit I did find myself frustrated on first viewing three years ago, loving the idea but found myself confused, but now I both love and appreciate Brazil and not only consider it Gilliam's masterpiece but also one of the better movies of the 80s.\n\nOverall, outstanding but perhaps not a movie you should see just once. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This is like a weird dystopian nightmare - less V for Vendetta and more 1984-ish, with a heavy emphasis on 'Big Brother' and government ministries. I knew it'd likely be a bit weird but it really is rather bonkers and there's not much context or information provided to the viewer as it goes on - we have to guess things as and when.\n\nI recognised a number of well known comedian/actors, including Bob Hoskins, Gorden Kaye, Michael Palin and of course Robert DeNiro. There is some witty dialogue present but its not what I'd call a particularly accessible film - its very quirky and surreal with a weighty feel to it, so you have to be in the right sort of mood for it I suppose. It's very much a film about corporate and indeed government based bureaucracy. It's quite dark in terms of the themes covered and the visual look of the film - most settings are in barely lit dark rooms. I suppose it does well at putting an oppresive feel across. I did laugh a bit at the scenes depicting a worker or manager being hounded by a gang of other workers asking him questions, as he rushed down a long, long hall, reminiscent of MPs being hounded by the press I suppose (not that I feel sorry for them most of the time), due to the upbeat music played during these sequences.\n\nThere's an element of riddle present in some of whats said and given this film dates from the mid 1980s, its visually somewhat dated, a little like Blade Runner, only without the flying cars obviously. \n\nThis is quite a niche sort of a film - not one that will likely appeal to too many people, certainly on first watch. I wouldn't really recommend this as such, as I don't think its the kind of film that will appeal to many unless your really in the mood for something off-centre.",

            "content": "In a dystopian, polluted, hyper-consumerist, overbearing bureaucratic totalitarian future somewhere in the 20th century, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a low-level government employee who frequently dreams of himself as a winged warrior saving a damsel in distress. One day, shortly before Christmas, a fly becomes jammed in a teleprinter, which misprints a copy of an arrest warrant it was receiving. This leads to the arrest and death during interrogation of cobbler Archibald Buttle instead of renegade heating engineer and suspected terrorist Archibald Tuttle (Robert De Niro). Sam discovers the mistake when he discovers the wrong bank account had been debited for the arrest. He visits Buttle's widow to give her the refund where he catches a glimpse of her upstairs neighbour Jill Layton (Kim Greist), a truck driver, and is astonished to discover that Jill resembles the woman from his dreams. Sam frantically tries to approach Jill, but she disappears before he can find her. Jill has been trying to help Mrs Buttle establish what happened to her husband, but her efforts have been obstructed by bureaucracy. Unbeknownst to her, she is now considered a terrorist accomplice of Tuttle for attempting to report the wrongful arrest of Buttle...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads \"Brazil, Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian fantasy, is an audacious dark comedy, filled with strange, imaginative visuals.\" Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan described the film as \"the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since Dr. Strangelove\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times was very positive towards the film upon its release, stating \"Terry Gilliam's Brazil, a jaunty, wittily observed vision of an extremely bleak future, is a superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones.\" Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic in the Chicago Sun-Times, giving the film two out of four stars and claiming that it was \"hard to follow\". He felt the film lacked a confident grasp on its characters' roles in a story \"awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and a general lack of discipline\". Ebert wrote positively of certain scenes, especially one in which \"Sam moves into half an office and finds himself engaged in a tug-of-war over his desk with the man through the wall. I was reminded of a Chaplin film, Modern Times, and reminded, too, that in Chaplin economy and simplicity were virtues, not the enemy.\" Colin Greenland reviewed Brazil for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"a daring, exorbitant Vision, sombrely funny and darkly true.\"\n\nTerry Gilliam\u00b4s Kafka/Orwellian \"Brazil\" is a mish mash of comedy, fantasy, drama and a dystopian nightmare. I saw it when it came out in 1985 and as far as I remember it never was a movie of my liking and that opinion hasn\u00b4t changed. It\u00b4s a classic Terry Gilliam film with all sorts of social och political comments towards for example pollution, consumerism and bureaucracy, but it\u00b4s also a classic Terry Gilliam film in terms of everything is over the top and there\u00b4s never a moment of tranquility to grasp what\u00b4s actually going on. I don\u00b4t think Terry Gilliam himself grasped everything in the film. It just becomes too much in the end and your brain becomes tired and want to switch off. \n\nTrivia: Though a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North American release. It has since become a cult film. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted Brazil the 54th greatest British film of all time. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever.",

The camera work excels as a wild mash between a fever dream and mundane reality, even if some others might dislike the Dutch angles. Brazil occupies both the realm of concrete commentary and otherworldly piece of art due to its surrealism, biting humour, and created world in the mould of 1984. Pryce does brilliant work in the main role, but every single cast member deserves credit. Palin could hardly be more different from his role in A Fish Called Wanda, but he performed superbly. De Niro fills a similar role to Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys, with both men being the biggest star on the planet but relegated to just a few scenes. They still steal every scene that they are involved in. Helmond and Holm also lift proceedings themselves. Brazil demands attention and forces out interaction with every engagement level imaginable with those provoking thought and those enjoying the film at a superficial level. What an accomplishment.",

            "content": "I cannot stress enough how important this movie is. Basically 1984 on steroids. I fbought it on DVD some months ago and when I watched it, I couldn't believe what I witnessed. Visionary director Terry Gilliam uses a cliche premise to create a story about bureaucracy, totalitarian regimes and oppresion of creativity that startles, baffles and gets more relevant as time goes by. Though it is certainly a movie that you will either love or hate. The plot, which is thick as hardwood, is about a lower class worker in a dystopian goverment, characterized by bureaucracy. After a mistake (when a fly gets jammed in a typewriter and a letter changes in an arrest order of a terrorist, causing the death of an innocent man), our protagonist has to go and give the innocent man's family a compensation when he realizes strange things are happening after the event. He sees a woman who resembles the one in his bizarre dreams, is constantly harrased by various people, is promoted to disturbing work spaces, and even comes in contact with the terrorist mentioned above. All these events mess with his already brooding, grimm reality and psychology and ultimately lead to his slow demise. Though the screenplay might seem tiring and complex, if you pay attention to small details of the story itsself, you will realize its greatness. Each scene is a visual treat (the gorgeous and iconic dream sequences), with some of the best, albeit over exaggerated, art direction for the steampunk, dystopian city, buildings and rooms. The acting is perfectly acceptable, and Jonathan Price and John Cleese stealing the show. The music is very intriguing and the main theme gives the movie its title. In contrast to some other critics who panned the pacing and slow direction of the movie, I will praise it because, as I mentioned above, it gives us enough time to comprehend the situation, glance at the visuals of the movie and relax whenever needed (I actually never realised how fast this movie ended). Of course, the themes of the movie are quite palpable, so I won't elaborate on those, they are relevant and disturbing, to say the least. The real winner of the show was, for me, the ending, no question. Never have I ever seen a movie whose ending has caused me so many feelings and has caught me so off guard as well. It was the best part of the movie, and I would watch it again just for this scene. Overall, I recommend this disturbing art piece on a dystopian, authoritarian world for everyone.",

It's weird, unpredictable, difficult to digest for those on a different frequency, but very clever and subversive under the surface. Very much a modern version of 1984, though the director has admitted to never having read the book, it's a tale of totalitarianisms, consumerism and rampant, crippling bureaucracy, taking place in a world where you can barely pick your nose without having to fill out a form. The films colour palate helps to highlight the divide between the elite and the working class, with the former dwelling in sumptuous surroundings while the latter slave away in grey, monochromatic office blocks. It's deliberately over the top and exaggerated, as you'd expect from Terry Gilliam, and it can be easy to lose track of the story and where its going. I think this was probably intentional, since we're supposed to lament the system and its machinations just as our lead does. The jokes are surreal and come right out of nowhere, and the cinematography is constantly striking and memorable, with odd angles and strange perspectives contributing to its fantasy-like aesthetic. It was definitely about 20 minutes too long and some scenes have a habit of dragging on unnecessarily. The film is at its best in the first half, as it gets overloaded towards the end and you actively wish for it to stop. I loved the bleak ending, and wish that more filmmakers were brave enough to end their movies on a bum note if it fits the tone of the story. Here a happy ending would have been completely out of place. I can't see myself ever watching it again, but all the tiny background details do add a certain degree of rewatchability.

Gilliam brings his Python satirical flair to a comprehensive worldbuilding effort, mocking the hints of a dystopian future that he saw in everyday life, and amplifying them into distressingly familiar parodies of the real world. Its combination of whimsically depressing futurism and flat out absurist tendencies make it the most oddly charming film that you won't be able to entirely follow with respect to the actual plot. The narrative is strikingly complex and carries a frantic energy, which renders the film constantly engaging despite the consierable length. Gilliam's true talent is the ability to craft actual social commentary on a wide range of issues through a highly creative and often infectiously humorous design, while Pryce aptly frames the confused frustration that the audiences shares in, making his way through a vast ensemble of wonderfully strange characters portrayed by some A-list talent. Wacky, inventive, and influential, Brazil is essentially the closest that an has come to an original film equivalent of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, though with added substance. (4.5/5)",

While the film certainly has its funny points, I found interest in the deeper relevance to problems in the modern workplace. Now, that sounds like a lot for a little film like this, so I'll explain. I love Monty Python, to the point that I'm sure I have come close to memorizing the entirety of The Holy Grail. While Brazil is a completely different film, certain elements are similar, namely, the comedy. The humour in this is a perfect mix of visual and dialogue-based humour, which is something I feel is missing in cinemas currently. The setup of Brazil is bizarre, where a fly ends up in a typewriter causing a typo leading to the wrong person being charged of an extreme crime, one thing leads to another, and I'm still not quite sure what happened. However, it is clear that this film, intentionally or not, wanted to focus on the truth of the problems in the modern workplace. That's why the environment is so cluttered and stressed, the main character often day dreams, and the setting seems so familiar. However, all of this is covered by the dull and bland use of the camera. Almost every shot is the same, and that bothered me a little bit. None of the performances in this movie are particularly memorable either, with an exception being Michael Palin, because he's Michael Palin. Overall, if you find that watching movies to be confusing at times, definitely skip this one, it's my second watch of this, and I have a decent grasp, but too much of this movie goes right over your head the first time to truly be appreciated.",

The bleak stylised retro-future and surrealist nightmare world slowly meld throughout the film concluding with a violent collision of the two realities.\n\nA rich and interesting world which begs to be explored is populated with scores of eccentric characters interwoven into a noir inspired story which compels from start to finish. In concept this dystopic future draws heavily from the literary classic 1984 but, with such creative flare the picture stands as its own unique work. Using film's strength as a visual medium to full effect; the camera work is expressive, the costuming bold, the sets fantastically cartoonish and the colour palette stylised. \n\nThere may not be great depth in the exploration of our protagonist's fears or in the critique of exaggerated bureaucracy and superficiality but, the film remains an impressive exhibition of creativity and a great example of the variety of artistic expression possible through cinema.",

This movie could both be seen as an informational depiction of what our future might become, but it could also just be seen as a quirky, sci-fi comedy. If I would have to recommend this film to someone, it would be an individual whose opinion on the aesthetic of the film outweighs the length of their attention span. What I mean is that the film has a tendency to run a little slow in the middle, but overall has one heck of a plot twist near the end.

It takes for granted that bureaucracy is the ultimate solution to organizing society, and considers what that implies about human nature. To say that bureaucracy is THE necessity for organizing a society we must take for granted that we are incapable of organizing ourselves and that we are so suggestible that we would allow such a bureaucracy to guide our every decision to the point where if it were no longer functional we would have to be told by an authority that we should move if we wanted to avoid being burned alive by a fire caused by the incompetence of the government. Because if people were so suggestible and so unintelligent that we could not self organize then that would also imply that the people who decide the rules of the bureaucracy are as well, perhaps as a side effect of having never had to actually consider anything since the bureaucracy has always chosen for them. In this farce of a society people are so poorly inwardly directed that extrinsic motivation is the only motivation. If someone so much as decides to help someone fix their air conditioning without first getting permission from the proper authorities they better be armed and fully prepared to respond to the police. In Brazil safety, purpose, morality, health, functionality are not things that affect us but prescribed to us by authority. While intelligence is how well you understand the bureaucratic channels and authority is given to those who conform to a convoluted process which is ultimately arbitrary. Any system where those in power can abuse the rules to retain that power will sustain itself and ultimately pervert itself to the point of dysfunctionality. Brazil makes one question why we organize our society the way we do, what are we saying about the nature of a population from how we organize them, does that organization perpetuate the idiocy that necessitated the external organization in the first place, and what are the dangers of abstracting the nature of reality into formalities. If a people do not possess intrinsic understanding then they are bound to abuse the rules to suit their misunderstanding, if people do possess intrinsic understanding then there are no need for rules. At any rate you can't enforce a culture no more than you can punish a child into loving a parent, culture is an expression of the intuitions of its people and the purpose of government should be to foster culture not curate it. Organization isn't intently evil, but even the most benevolent organization's purpose would be in part to take the burden of responsibility from its citizens and when citizens give it without consideration they give with it critical thought which is where a stable culture really emerges. A culture without critical thought is the true dystopia, submitting blindly to authority is one way to arrive there but so is anarchy without direction. How can we form a direction out of anarchy? Is organizing a government necessary to do so? If so how can we avoid the trappings of foregoing critical thought in favor of easy living? Or is it an inevitability of our selfish nature if we are bound not to overcome it?",

I may even say that this film could easily be one of my favorite comedies. \nThis is from the writer and director of the Monty Python films, Terry Gilliam, so you can expect some clever witty British Comedy. There are so many small jokes in the background that it takes a couple watches to see them all. Every joke always got a laugh or a chuckle out of me, but the film made sure the comedy didn't overshadow the surreal drama in the last act. The only problem I had in the entire film has to be the romance. I'm fine with a love interest, but they rushed it out before they can have proper chemistry. \nMost of dystopian worlds in 80's films were just Blade Runner copy cats, but Brazil stood out because of its futuristic 50's style designs. I'm kinda surprised that the film only had a $15 million budget since a lot if details went into the production.\nBrazil is an amazing film that is surprising overlooked.\n9.5/10",

Though its world might seem dated in terms of today's society, Brazil combines the technology, social issues, and materialism of the 1980s with the styles, mannerisms, music, Noire, and Art-Deco designs of the 1940s- creating a distinct setting of dark urbanity, rampant consumerism, and rigid bureaucracy.\n\nThe plotline is thoroughly enjoyable, revolving around a lowly, overclocked government bureaucrat and his quest to acquire the damsel he frequently elopes with in his dreams- whom, in reality, turns out to be a hardened truck driver accused of having ties to an underground terrorist organization. There wasn't a character that I didn't like in this movie, and the dark comedy combined with Monty-Python-esque influences help make for an interesting story that perceives a world of apathy and clueless,  all-consuming bureaucratic control.\n\nOverall- good setting, good characters, good plot, good production, good soundtrack, excellent movie.",

Sam, played by the marvellous Jonathan Pryce, has a recurring fantasy dream that he is a winged superhero battling monsters and trying to save a beautiful woman. This marvellous and twisted movie made in 1985 is one of Gilliam's best features and he manages to weave his usual darkly comedic threads and fantastical elements together in order to create a chaotically startling world of ludicrous excess. There are just so many brilliant moments in the film. I love Katherine Helmond as Sam's rich, plastic surgery obsessed mother and Robert De Niro as Archibald Tuttle, the terrorist-cum-heating engineer who swoops into Sam's life and causes chaos. However, it is Pryce who really steals the show as the increasingly unhinged and desperate hero who through trying to be nice and do a good turn finds himself caught up in a situation that he is wholly unsuited to dealing with. Gilliam truly shows his genius and love of the underdog in this brilliant film that is still as stark, dark and funny as it was when I saw it in the cinema over 30 years ago.",

The dystopian genre is very interesting, and it's one that is always exciting to see what they'll come up with it. With Brazil you have something totally different, you have hints of humor thrown into the film's storyline, and it adds something to the enjoyment of the film. Dystopian society films are often dark, nightmarish portraits of a society, but with this film we get something very different. The formula here has been reworked to give the storyline a bit more range than your standard dystopian film, and in turn it makes for a truly engaging experience. In the hands of Terry Gilliam, you have a well crafted picture with some truly stellar performances from its cast, especially from lead actor Jonathan Pryce who lights up every scene that he's in. Brazil is a great film, one that succeeds at delivering a different take on your standard dystopian society film, and in the hands of Terry Gilliam, he crafts a standout picture that is sure to please genre fans looking for something a bit different. Brazil is eccentric in the way that it's told, and it makes for a truly entertaining two and a half hours. If you enjoy Gilliam's work, you're sure to enjoy this. What makes Brazil great is the fact that it has your standard dark, atmospheric elements than are synonymous with the genre, but there are also lighter touches comic relief to really make it stand out among other films. Brazil is great filmmaking and one of the finest dystopian society films I've seen. With a great mix of comedy and serious content, Brazil is a standout genre film that elevates the bar and makes for a truly worthwhile viewing experience.\n\nI have thought of my own reason why this movie is called Brazil/ the ending, reason 1, obviously is that the song 'Brazil' is played numerous times throughout the film.\n\nReason 2: So, I've never been to Brazil and when I look up Google images and I see these beautiful pictures of Rio de Janeiro etc. and the amazing weather, it just looks like the dream place to live, a paradise....but apparently it's a pretty dangerous place to live, with the slums it has a pretty high death rate, you have to be smart and know what streets are safe to walk down ect. It's safe to pressume Brazil is a False paradise.\nJust like the end of the film is a false paradise for Sam. He's living the perfect life in his mind with his dream girl away from all the faulty machinery that's been ruining his whole life...but in reality, he's not in paradise, he's strapped in a chair without a state of mind. And to top things off he hums the song Brazil before the credits role indicating that he's in a false paradise.?",

A disturbing and surreal existence is portrayed, and Sam Lowry, the protagonist, is living under the assumption that it is a life worth living. The scary part is that it seems to resemble reality, and what could be an inevitable future.\n\tSam is a straight-edged government worker. He blends in with all the other gray suits at the office he works at, which seems to be an infinite office space with a herd of bustling workers. Even though Sam resembles all the others in appearance, he is quite different. Sam has daydreams and aspirations. He wishes to conquer his love, his daydream lover that is, his damsel in distress. Sam seems to believe that in order to be truly happy he must save his love by conquering his fears.\n\tSam is fighting against the odds of living an ordinary life, fighting himself and everyone in the reality that is Brazil. He seems to only care about his daydreams. His life is a drag in which he has no choice but to endure willingly because he knows of nothing else. That is, until he see's his lover, and then follows the white rabbit down the hole, and into Brazil we go!\n\t It all begins with a family, the Buttle's. The father in the Buttle family is wrongfully interrogated for suspected terrorism, which ultimately ends in his death. An error, in which the typo \"Tuttle\" which now read \"Buttle\" lead to the death of a low-income father/husband who seemingly lived by all the rules of society, but still faced punishment for another man's crime. Demonstrating that even when leading an \"honest life\" you can still suffer greatly and face injustice at the hands of your own government.  \n\tTuttle, who is later introduced into the story, is breaking all the rules and not obliging to the bureaucracy everyone else seems to live by. Tuttle, now a rogue freelance AC repairman, has decided that paperwork takes up to much of his precious time and it is not relevant to the important repairs he must make. He decides to play by his own rules and is therefore considered to be a \"terrorist\".  \n\tSam's AC breaks, he then calls the AC company to alert them of the issue. Tuttle intercepts the distress call and breaks into Sam's house to fix the AC. Tuttle fixes the AC in no time, while, his counterparts, the repairmen that work for the corporate AC company arrive to fix Sam's AC but instead seem to have no knowledge of how to do so, which results in Sam's house being destroyed.\n\tWe encounter time and time again how the system has failed, whether it be random dumb luck or pure ignorance, it is a system with flaw and without amnesty. We see it working for the rich, and the schemers, but Sam is neither. Sam is the character we can sympathize with the most, we see the story unfold through his perspective, and we become attached to Sam. Breaking his neck for others while also trying to keep his own head above water, he is searching for happiness and meaning, and it is unattainable. \n\tI realized a small truth to all this madness. It came in the form of a sign from a scene where Sam is walking through a store. The sign read \"Consumers for Christ\". I found this to be indicator of sorts. Along with other Christmas references, Christmas is a Christian holiday, and Christianity is a religion based solely on a system of belief and faith. Since religion is based on faith how could you possibly question it? All you can do is choose to believe in it or not believe in it. I noticed that all the characters seem to have bought into some idea or another while Sam is struggling to find anything to believe in. This is what I presume leads him to the quest to find answers and ultimately through the eye-opening saga to conquer his own fears of life and death. Spoiler alert, he does not come out the same man.

So what exactly makes \"Brazil\" this beloved cult classic? The answer is simple: Blend totalitarianism with Monty Python. \nIn a futuristic society that's obsessed with perfection, Sam Lowry is a man who works in a mediocre government department that's has no future. But after a mistake is made by its government, Sam starts a journey that will change his perception of the world. \nWhen it comes to directors, there are some that are remembered/praised for their filmmaking technique, others for their storytelling, for pushing boundaries, for their use and execution of themes, for a unique visual style, for their creativity, or simply because they are way out there. And the best way to describe Terry Gilliam is as a hilarious man that manages to create precise messes with an insanely creative visual style, and that's exactly what \"Brazil\" is. \"Brazil\" is this mess of a film that managed to degenerate into a masterpiece thanks to its hilarious comedic timing, performances that perfectly fit within the world established with the greatest of them all being Robert De Niro who steals the film every time he is on screen, inventive and unforgettable visuals, a well used fast pacing, a masterful mixture of that classic Monty Python comedy with \"1984\" ideas, themes that are masterfully executed, a direction that knows how to play with expectations, a gorgeous retro future visual style,  a well made social satire that is wisely masked by the visuals and comedy, a cold cinematography that flawlessly creates the atmosphere, a story that's is dumb but it is well written, imagery that go from fun to disturbing, a extremely shocking, perverse and bittersweet ending that you won't be forgetting any time soon, and Gilliam\u00b4s confidence behind the camera is evident as he delivers this organized chaotic take of a predictable genre. My only issues with the film are only two: The main character is extremely unlikeable and some scenes are a little redundant, but compare to all the greatness Gilliam achieved, these problems are minor. \n\"Brazil\" is undeniably Gilliam\u00b4s masterpiece as it is clever, hilarious, memorable and shocking. Just be warned that this is not a film for everybody to to its peculiar (to say the least) style, watch the first 10 minutes of it and if you laughed or were captivated by the world, then stick to it, otherwise you should turn it off. One of the most inventive and fun sci-fi films I\u00b4ve ever seen.",

            "content": "If you haven't already seen Brazil, you're in for a world of \"what the?\" once you delve into the inner workings of Terry Gilliam's mind, represented onscreen by this cinematic gem. The timeless story of Sam Lowry, a little cog in a big machine who dreams of growing wings, is incredible cinema and one of the best things to sprout from the twisted garden of Terry Gilliam's subconscious ever.\u00a0\n\nWhen a typo causes a man to be killed by mistake, the system set up around the lives of the general public begins to crumble slightly. And when Sam Lowry glimpses the girl of his dreams (literally) he decides to stop at nothing to get to her. All this and more set in a dystopian future where restaurants serve green mash and heating repairmen are forced to turn vigilante in order to preserve the wellfare of the suffering public.\u00a0\n\nJonathan Pryce plays our lead, Sam, and he is brilliant. Before he was Elizabeth Swann's befuddled father, he was battling the baffling circumstances he was presented with in Brazil. He goes through a thousand and one things, from battling huge samurai warriors to his heating system acting up and is brilliant throughout. He manages to make us feel the strain, the confusion, the highs and the lows of all the situations he finds himself in with fantastic restraint, akin to Michael Stuhlbarg in A Serious Man. Often roles like this can be mistaken for caricatures and become send-ups of themselves, but Jonathan Pryce brings the perfect amount of quirkiness, innocence and desperation to Lowry which makes the role so believeable, despite the unbelieveable circumstances surrounding him. It's because of him that the entire film stays grounded, at least slightly. Well let's say it keeps us in the atmosphere at least, rather than taking us into orbit. The rest of the cast don't have nearly as much time spent on them, though they deliver great performances, including a fantastically absurd turn from Robert De Niro as Harry Tuttle the repairman and Ian Holm is great as Lowry's boss. Michael Palin is fantastic as Jack Lint. He is typical Palin at first, but he shows a very sinister side which makes it impossible to guage his actual motives at any point.\u00a0\n\nThe script is great; filled with symbolism and quotable lines. It's appropriately absurd, considering the surroundings and it sustains the feeling of uncertainty, as if the entire world is slightly off centre. It's as if there is an entirely different language at play here which we should know, and we are plunged into the middle of it without any warning.\u00a0\n\nBut it is the message of the film which makes it such an enduring classic. As sort of an exciting 1984 with a whole lot more gadgets, Brazil discusses the same topics as the George Orwell novel but in a much more personal way and a much more absorbing format. There is even a parallel that can be drawn between the leads of each story and their journey into the forbidden fruit of love. Gilliam shows the obvious problems with letting the system take over everyday life and the possibility of our personal lives being monitored and controlled by an impersonal system which classifies human beings into numbers on a list. He creates some incredible, indelible images which epitomise the message behind his film and a storyline which boggles the mind. The opening scenes themselves are amazing, especially the introduction to Sam's workplace to some fantastic music. And it only gets better from there, plunging the audience into samurai dreams, car chases and everything else short of actually entering Oz. And sure, the film goes on for about 20 minutes beyond any possible human comprehension, but Gilliam has created what all filmmakers aspire to create: a critically acclaimed, deeply personal statement which will live on timelessly in the minds of audiences all around the world.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nSam is joined by a crew of heating repairmen when in dire straits, and the madness continues.",

As anyone knows who has had their ducts cleaned, the required form is HZ/7B. But I forgive this creative license, because after all, Mister Gilliam's movie is a fantasy; why, he depicts Harry Tuttle, freelance repairman, as an actual person, when everyone knows that rogues like him are just fairy stories invented to scare children. More serious is the erroneous depiction of the elevator shafts in Information Retrieval. I have never been, of course, but I have it on good authority from a friend who has his very own number on his very own door in that very building that the shaft to the right of the reception desk does not stop at the fourth basement level. The elevator bank to the right, however, does. It is details like that that really take me out of a story, and I expect better of Mister Gilliam. After all, he recreates perfectly the look of things around here, from the one-seater cars to the art deco skyscrapers to the film noir fedoras and shadowing. We wouldn't get much done in Information Adjustments without our fedoras, our classic movies on closed-circuit TV, and our pop art on the walls. Without those, the office would just be row after row of absurdly magnified computer screens and perforated, continuous-feed printers, and that's no world I want to live in! At any rate, I also appreciated the festive cheer and very English humor that Mister Gilliam brought to the proceedings. It always puts a smile on my face to see our Nazi stormtrooper security team singing Christmas carols, and to overhear the friendly small talk that they make while hauling a truckload of blindfolded, strung-up terrorists in for interrogations that will be duly and meticulously transcribed, screams and all. That sort of jocularity is classically Gilliam, as are the movie's thrilling dream sequences. I particularly enjoyed the giant, robotic Japanese warrior: is there any country that better symbolizes endless, neon urbanity, bureaucratic perfection, and always-on consumer electronics that manage our every move than Japan? Except, of course, for our own beautiful city as depicted in \"Brazil.\" Speaking of which, I don't quite know what Brazil is supposed to symbolize in Mister Gilliams's movie. Something about trees and utopia, I think; to tell the truth, I rather tuned out toward the end of the film, which is a bit too long and contains a lot of shouting and shooting in the run-up to the credits. The romantic element didn't make a lot of sense to me, either: aren't we supposed to fill out form 78-9/C before beginning an intimate relationship? Only in a movie could lovers be so quick to jump into bed together!\n\nFor tomorrow's movie in Information Adjustments, I think I'll suggest \"Modern Times\" (1936), \"Blade Runner\" (1982), or \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" (1994): they all share some of \"Brazil\"'s themes and visuals, but keep things much more down-to-earth.",

            "content": "Finally sitting down to Gilliam's Brazil, it felt good to sink my teeth into a dystopian tale took itself only as seriously as it absolutely had to. Painting on themes from Orwelle's 1984 (okay, it practically IS 1984), Terry Gilliam gives you a vision of the future that, despite all its black comedy, is something truly to be avoided. I mean, the current wealth of post-apocalyptic themes is not without their merit (everything from Hunger Games to The Walking Dead) but it almost seems like the filmmakers are trying to show you a world that would somehow be cool to live in. And you can see this mind control tactic is working when you find yourself sitting down at a table with full grown adults who, in order to participate in an serious discussion, require you to accept the rational probability of a zombie apocalypse. And what is with L'Oreal's \"Capitol Collection\"? I mean, Hello! Did you guys see the movies? Did you read the books? Better yet, do you know the shit storm that's rolling its way to the capitol in the shape of Mocking Jays part 1 and 2? Should call it the \"Target Collection\". And that's being lenient.\n\nAnyway...\n\nNo, Terry Gilliam probably saw the Fulci and Romero rags popping up and thought, \"Well the zombie thing is neat, but not for me.\" The closest we get to the reanimated dead is the hauntingly effective Katherine Helmond as lead Sam Lowry's plastic surgery-obsessed mum, Ida. Oh boy when you see what her and her friends get up to at the hands (read \"scalpels\") of docs Jaffe and Chapman and friends, you'll be begging for some good ol' flesh-eating zombies. Ah... the simpler times.\n\nThe whole story hinges on the growing distraction experienced by one low-level government stiff, Sam Lowry (played by Jonathan Pryce), while investigating a catastrophic clerical error involving a fly and a typewriter (I know, I have already lost half of you) that resulted in an innocent man being arrested as a suspected terrorist and dying during interrogation (Oh hey! You're back!). Gilliam's distaste for consumerism rings loud and clear in Brazil as Sam Lowry chases madly after the damsel in his dreams (Jill Layton played by Kim Greist - made flesh in the form of the stricken family's well-meaning apartment neighbour) amidst the devotion to cheap consumer goods that saps the world around him. The government, totalitarian and overreaching as it may seem, seems totally incapable of getting it together enough to see what Sam is up to. Of course, as in 1984, just as Sam and his damsel settle down for \"a little necrophilia\" (calm down, he falsifies her records to indicate she is deceased), the Gendarmerie crashes through the windows and doors to apprehend them both.\n\nThe storyline is simple enough to follow along with and I think that's the kind of canvas that works best for Gilliam's warped but charming mind. The truth is, my one paragraph synopsis is way too simplified. And it is AFTER Lowry's apprehension that we see the shit really go down.\n\nBrazil is not for everyone. As a matter of fact, those who spend most of their time on gadgets themselves - concerned more that the gadget work rather than what functions it can perform - may find the subject matter involving a gross over-developed obsession for consumer goods offensive. The flavour is decidedly British - that is to say, very Monty Python-esque. The inciting incident involving the arrest and interrogation death (at the hands of a delightfully macabre Michael Palin) of the wrong Archibald Tuttle is a stunt only a \"Something completely different\" alumni could get away with. If you have a taste for the delightfully absurd, Brazil should go down smooth. If you require your fare a little more clean cut, rife with right angles, pop culture references, and generally catering to the list of acceptable responses... Well, you best look elsewhere.",

The story, at times, can get a little confusing, but it comes together in an interesting and entertaining manner, which in a way, makes up for the film's slightly overstretched length. The characters are quite strange, but the acting helps in so many ways, and the characters are fleshed out pretty well. Perhaps my favourite parts of the movie, which I'll admit is also the weirdest, are these surreal daydreaming scenes in which the main character is depicted as a winged hero whose goal is to save the woman of his dreams. These scenes are the most bizarre parts of the movie, but they also showcase the richest imagery in the film, along with representing a form of blissful insanity. Overall, this film may be strange and hard to follow, but with its unique twists, it's entertaining enough that it's worth at least one good look.",

This is the story of a dystopian past where a man is seeking a girl he keeps dreaming about saving, but she is being sought by the organization he works for, which is kind of like the government but specializes in information and form-signing...Why am I even trying to explain this? Brazil, more than any movie I've seen in a long time, is one where I just didn't \"get it.\" Have you ever had that feeling 30 minutes into a movie that you still have no idea what's going on? Well, I had that feeling one hour into Brazil. I understood some of the basic concepts, but I just could not get acclimated to the world it all took place in, so everything was hard to follow. Were there really terrorists or were things just breaking down because everyone is so incompetent? Where did all the ducts go? Why was a repairman brought to tears from the mere mention of a form? It all was so removed from reality that I wasn't intrigued I was just puzzled.\n\nPerhaps the hardest thing for me to deal with was the fact that most of the humor didn't hit for me. Much of it was too dark and too close to our present reality for me to laugh. I think I could see what it was that others might enjoy, but it just sailed right over my head. Then there was the ending. You'll have to forgive me here, because I'm going to kind of spoil the closing moments of the film. At the end the protagonist is found to be essentially dreaming in a torture chair. So that begs the question...when did the real world scenes end and the dream start? It seems like a clear cut answer because we see him being escorted into the chair, but since the entire world is insane enough to be a dream, I have a hard time differentiating the later sequences (where a man is destroyed be flying paper) from the earlier sequences (where a woman's face is essentially made of silly putty.) Perhaps you would say logic dictates when the dreaming commences, but in a film that revels in defying logic how am I supposed to suddenly apply it. I think Brazil might be one of those films that would benefit from repeat viewings because you could suss out all the little details and understand more of the references they are making. I just don't think I'm the type of person who likes devoting that kind of time to analyzing a film that I found only OK.",

The movie looks amazing, endowed with a budget that would let Gilliam's imagination run wild but the story is a disaster. Many people are able to find genius in it; I only wanted out.\n\nThe great visual style only carries the picture so far when I had little to no idea what was happening at any given moment. Realizing the film's limited commercial appeal, the studio heads refused to release it for months resulting in a notorious showdown between Gilliam and Universal Pictures, and frankly that story sounds infinitely more interesting that the one told in the film. I consider myself an intelligent movie lover always looking for something outside the norm, but this is an extremely trying and uninvolving picture that went right over my head; impressive to look at but little else. \n\n\"Brazil\" is a film that I really wanted to like, if only so I could say that I belonged to that select group of people who can honestly say that they get it.
