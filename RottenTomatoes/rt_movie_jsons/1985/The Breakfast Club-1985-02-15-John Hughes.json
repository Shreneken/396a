    "summary": "Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal (Paul Gleason). The disparate group includes rebel John (Judd Nelson), princess Claire (Molly Ringwald), outcast Allison (Ally Sheedy), brainy Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) and Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the jock. Each has a chance to tell his or her story, making the others see them a little differently -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will ever be the same.",

This movie is absolutely funny, and shows the lives of these teenagers.  I keep asking myself questions in this movie, like, \"How are these people not caught?\", or \"Why does the dean verbally abuse these students?\".  Well, I guess it was the 1980s.  There also is an anti-gay joke in this movie, which was common in the 1980s.  If you do not like that kind of stuff, steer clear.  If you don't mind, this could be the movie for you.  Everyone acts well, like Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez, prominent young actors in the 1980s.  If you need a good comedy, \"The Breakfast Club\" is the movie for you!",

As time passes by, their egos fade and they become close buddies.\n\nThe breakfast is one of those classic comedies that i had never seen before, until now. Personally i think this movie at his core, isn't even a comedy, more of a character study. The movie follows a bunch of great characters, portrayed perfectly by the actors playing them. The first part of the movie introduces these characters all so great and then by the end of the movie, you just fall in love with them. The themes of rich and poor, smart and dumb, loved and not loved, are all so well done. The Breakfast Club would probably be the movie I would identify the 80s/90s the most with and I think that there couldn't be a better movie, to portray that image, fantastic movie and some of the most iconic moments and lines in cinema history!",

It's one of those movies that; though it's uneven and imperfect; the parts that work, just work so well; they cut like a knife infact; they're so moving; so generation defining.  Moments like when Molly Ringwald admits that though they've all bonded in deep and profound ways; come Monday, all bets are off; since they belong to different cliques; and society has already said never the twain shall meet.  And the way that line just seers right into when you hear it; because it's so true.  Or the heartbreaking moment when Ally Sheedy says, \"I have no friends...\" Or when she says, \"it's inevitable.  When you grow up, your heart dies.\". Or when Emilio tells Judd Nelson, \"You know what Bender?  You don't even count.  If you didn't show up tomorrow no one would even notice, because you don't matter\".  And seeing the pain on Bender/ Judd's face when he says that.  Or when Emilio says to Ally, \"What do they (your parents) do to you?\" Using a shorthand teenagers use since they all feel hurt by their parents.  And she looks back at him and says, in that scratchy, soulcrushing voice, \"they ignore me.\"  Or in the title sequence, which quotes David Bowie's Changes: \"And these children, that you spit on.  As they try to make their worlds... They're immune to your consultations.  They're well aware of what they're going through ..\".  So many powerful moments.  Powerful enough to forgive the phony upbeat ending; when Molly kisses the guy who's been harassing her for two hours; or when Ally gets a makeover and then everyone has a happy ending; (like a makeover ever solved anything!  How shallow John Hughes).  In spite of those failings when the movie works it just works so well.  It breaks your heart; and also gives you such fleeting hope that someone, our guardian Angel John Hughes, was listening; someone who understood us; someone who cared.  Someone who spoke to that scared little 14 year old we all once were; and the scared little 14 year old that's still in us.  And this film still speaks to teenagers and connects to them that way; moving them; connecting them; making them grow in a small way.  That's why this movie is so special.  Not because it's perfect; but because when it worked it spoke directly to the hearts of Generation X; it moved us; it changed us; just like it continues to speak to generations since then.  It's become a right of passage and a cultural landmark.  It's one of those special miracle movies that could do all that.",

This is a film that I have watched multiple times and enjoyed it more every time. Being sucked into their world and their detention is truly a mind entrenching experience. This movie approaches the topic of conformity, peer pressure and high school cliques. The plot development is insanely thick. It's also hilarious (to me anyway) - No I didn't go to High School in the 80's - but I can relate to this movie - and I understand what this movie is all about, and its fantastic. 5 stars all the way. Take a dip back into high school life - without actually having to go back. Also, the makeover was the only bad idea in this movie - and it has not aged well.

            "content": "While it is funny throughout, The Breakfast Club is known for being a sentimental drama and one of the 80's great coming-of-age stories. The film focuses on high-school age adolescence and has each of the main niches outlined in it's cast of characters. We have the Jock Andrew, the Princess Claire, the Brain Brian, the Criminal John and the Basket Case Allison. While each is a unique individual with their own feelings and beliefs, they also conform to these niches both by peer pressure and by the natural order of things in high-school. I think most people can find at least one or more characters that they see themselves like or at least can understand and relate to when they were in high-school. While I wasn't a \"basket case\" I guess I could identify with Allison in the fact that I was mostly a loner (friends would come and go and would only be one or two) and I liked what I liked simply because I am who I am. The entire course of the film unfolds over a Saturday detention which all the students, for one reason or another, are stuck in for the entire day. The strict and seemingly miserable Principal Vernon is there to make the students feel as miserable as he is. Over the course of the day though each one learns to overcome their classification and befriend and even start romantic relationships with one another, when at the start of the day that had not even noticed them. They each grow as people and mature, not fully, but they learn something new about life and open up their futures in doing so.",

Of course, the error in this film, the one that never makes sense to me, is when Allison gives up her quirky individuality to put on makeup and become like everyone else. Even when I was young it felt hollow and it seems even more empty today.\n\nP.J. O'Rourke, who worked with Hughes at the National Lampoon, summed up the film in a way that makes me question so much of it. He said that the movie lives up to Hughes's politics, in that the students do not organize a protest together but, \"like good conservatives do, as individuals and place the highest value, like this conservative does, on goofing off. Otherwise known as individual liberty.\"\n\nEveryone wants to have a moment of rebellion but when faced with the opportunity, so many of us put on makeup and try to fit right in.",

The great writing by John Hughes makes this one of the most memorable films from the 80s. The characters can be classified into standard stereotypical high school kid clich√©s, but there is depth added to them through their conversations. The actors all do great jobs of portraying all their character's nuances. The story is so simple, and yet it is entertaining and satisfying. Hughes is able to dissect the teenage psyche tactfully enough to make a deeper and more meaningful movie about high school. Any viewer of this movie will be able to relate to one aspect of at least one character to their high school selves. This film has some good laughs, and some great drama. The balancing act between the two is done so well that it makes it feel very natural and free flowing. Even 33 years later, this movie remains relevant and relatable to teenage audiences. The moral that people of all different backgrounds can be friends and coincide with one another is a never-dying moral, and \"The Breakfast Club\" teaches it well. This is a great movie and is definitely worth seeing more than once. Overall, I give this film a 9/10.",

I just love it so much, mostly because it's so relatable to me. We all remember being a teenager. A crazy, intense time when your highs were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant. This movie really captured what high school is like no matter what year you attend.\nThe movie starts with five teenagers getting dropped off at school for detention on a Saturday. None are well known to each other, and even start off with not liking each other's different personalities. As the day goes on it seems like one kid, Bender (Judd Nelson) starts to push the others out of their comfort zones and seeing who they really are. See if they're all more than just a \"criminal\", a \"jock\", a \"princess\", a \"nerd\", and a \"basket case\".\nThis is definitely an 80's film in all aspects, including the acting. I try hard to not judge acting when it comes from the 80's and prior because we just live in a different world now. I will say though, that the acting from this ensemble is equal all throughout, nobody was a true standout good or bad, and that's refreshing to see. I think everybody did a killer job for the decade it was released.\nWhat I like the most about this movie, other than the entire concept of the movie itself, must be how relatable it is. I was in detention a lot as kid and when I was with a group we always messed around and made it more difficult for the teachers because we all thought life was hardest for us. Its how kids are, and this movie expressed that in a way that my generation and even generations to come will still relate to. After re-watching this movie over and over I thought I would notice some things that stand out in a not so good way, but the whole movie has a solid story and was executed smartly. I will say however that the acting is subpar, even for an 80's film. It's not bad by any means, but there are times throughout where it seems like they knew they weren't going to get the right take, so they just kept one they weren't' happy with.\nOverall, I strongly believe that everybody will find something to love with this movie and I strongly recommend it if you haven't seen it. If you haven't seen in it a long time, give it a watch again to remind yourself of how amazing it is.\n4.5/5",

            "content": "This is the definitive high school movie for good reason, it's undeniably great. The writing, direction and acting is fantastic and the clever use of some memorable songs helps to cement the film's iconic status. For some people Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) is their favorite John Hughes movie but to me this is his magnum opus as he manages to understand the fears and concerns of teenagers with alarming accuracy and writes a film that feels like an entertaining character study instead of an anthropological dissection. As a teenager I feel a special connection to this film that an adult may not feel but in my experience this is a film that can be appreciated by all.\n\nFive teenagers, each from different socials group, attend detention on a Saturday at Shermer High School in Illinois. Claire Standish, Molly Ringwald, is the pretty, popular girl, Allison Reynolds, Ally Sheedy, is the outcast, Andrew Clark, Emilio Estevez, is the jock under immense pressure from his father, Brian Johnson, Anthony Michael Hall, is the depressed nerd and John Bender, Judd Nelson, is the philosophical bad boy who pushes the others to open up to one another. Principal Vernon, Paul Gleeson, is the main antagonist that the teenagers are able to unite against and the friendly janitor Carl Reed, John Kapelos, encourages them to bond.\n\nEach character is immediately introduced as exactly what most people see them as. In just a couple of seconds Hughes shows that Claire is a spoilt brat who usually spends her Saturday elsewhere and Bender is a delinquent with a wild streak. We make these assumptions, which Hughes plays on later, because these introductions are so specific and so identifiable in everyday life that we look at people in our own high schools or workplaces in the same way. I immediately felt myself leaning towards being an Allison but as Claire revealed her backstory I also began to relate to her, much like The Wages of Fear (1953) this film proves that nobody is just anything. Everything about them, from their dialogue to the way they dress feels so right to how we imagine a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal.\n\nThe idea of teenagers projecting different images to who they really are seems obvious now but films about teenagers before this film don't seem able to articulate this idea in the same way. Yes, we hear about Brian's suicide attempt and the physical abuse that Bender faces in the same scene and one by one they all make their confessions but it is written to feel natural and the teenagers speak with character so you ignore the exposition. Everyone can relate to one of these characters to some degree, I relate to Allison, which makes the film universally engaging and the treatment of them as more than just stereotypes prevents the film from feeling as though it is pandering to a certain audience.\n\nThe final scene of Bender and Claire kissing is one that gives me all of the feels as the combination of \"Don't You Forget About Me\" by Simple Minds playing and the imagery of Claire's earring in Bender's glove is meaningful in a strange way. The idea of two opposites attracting is naturally romantic but Bender taking something from Claire that goes against his tough guy persona so completely shows just how crazy about her he is. The reading of the letter and fist pump after this are also deservedly iconic but almost every section of this film is near perfect in execution. Even the shots of the five of them smoking marijuana in the library feel as though they have been very specifically staged by Hughes to represent the shifting allegiances of the characters. His attention to detail creates these beautiful moments and suggestions of development in these kids who are simply looking for themselves in a world that doesn't support them.\n\nI really love this film and I think I will feel the same way in twenty or thirty years just for different reasons. Despite being 34 years old the film is still more in touch with youths than any of the high school films being released today and it is a wonderful testament to Hughes' ability that he was able to direct a timeless classic.",

The film made me feel nostalgic for the simpler times of high school when the only thing to worry about was others√¢(TM) perceptions. It made me think that we should maybe instill better ideals in our youth to not have their focus be on what √¢group√¢? they fit into. This narrative, like a lot of John Hughes√¢(TM) films really paved the way for the teen coming of age dramedy. I don√¢(TM)t wish that they did anything differently, as the film is such a professional classic. In terms of the writing, my favorite scene was when all five of the kids start whistling with each other. It√¢(TM)s really the first time that the characters start to come together and work together. Directing-wise, I loved everyone√¢(TM)s entrances into the library. The way that the each carry themselves when they√¢(TM)re walking in is so telling of who their characters are but also their relationships with each other and very appropriately sets up the story and dynamic. In regard to editing, I loved when Bender reenacts his idea of what everyone√¢(TM)s home lives are. There are more reaction shots when he describes Brian√¢(TM)s home life, but the editor makes the decision to solely stay on him when he is describing his home life. This choice by the editor makes the story that Bender tells and the impact of it more effective. My absolute favorite actor in the film was Ally Sheedy√¢(TM)s as Allison. She has so many great facial expressions that I just love and that makes her character so enjoyable to watch. I like when her and Andrew are walking down the hallway to get some water and she stares him down, her hair covering her face. I also enjoyed how she slurps her coke from the table as it spills. Overall, the cinematography was wonderful. To me, the best shots that will always be my favorite are when the gang is running through the hallways trying to avoid the teacher. They√¢(TM)re all always well-framed in the shot and the color palette is very vibrant and energetic. The sound design is also another incredible aspect of the film. I especially love the opening credits when the iconic √¢Don√¢(TM)t You Forget About Me√¢? plays and then the glass shatters to reveal the high school. The production value is impeccable, creating the iconic film that we know and still love today.",

Judd Nelson (John Bender) is mostly good, though he's a bit over the top. Anthony Michael Hall (Brian Johnson) might be the standout, while Emilio Estevez (Andy Clark), Molly Ringwald (Claire Standish), and Ally Sheedy (Allison Reynolds) all deliver. There are plenty of great scenes. The scene where they all sit around and reveal major things about their lives is outstanding. Each character delivers some kind of truth and all are handled with care. It's emotion that works. Hall is amazing here, discussing bringing a gun to school and how hurt he was at the idea that nobody would act like his friend after this day. Following it with the famous dance scene was perfect, as these characters had now gone through something that bonded them. The script allows for these characters to tell stories that help them grow by the end, while the dialogue all feels natural. Lastly, the film's soundtrack is legendary. Not only are the songs great, but they're fitting of the tone and era. \n\nWeaknesses: It's clear that many of these characters are incredibly stereotypical. I would've liked if some people played against type. A female jock or nerd. Something like that. It's a small issue, though. The real problem is the relationships. While Claire and John feel like they have a bond throughout the movie, the Andy/Allison stuff feels so forced. They only share one real scene with any kind of bond. If that wasn't enough, when they do get together, it only comes after Allison changes her appearance. She shouldn't have needed to do that, as her being weird and different is what worked for her. \n\nOverall: One of the greatest teen movies of all time. With a great cast, insightful script, killer soundtrack, and lots of emotion, it hits nearly every beat it needs to.",

            "content": "While John Hughes has other films that I think are better, The Breakfast Club might be the most purely distilled essence of his style in the 1980s. He takes all the high school stereotypes and locks them in a room together in order to force interaction, revelation, and an exploration of teen behavior. Of course, by extension, he‚Äôs also trying to say something about all of us no matter the age through these teenagers. I always find it uncomfortable to watch at the start, because I knew a number of John Bender‚Äôs in my life and seeing him act so abusive and intimidating to the other kids reminds me of bullying I received. (Just for the record, I was a Brian Johnson with a little Allison Reynolds thrown in, so my high school life is not something I look back on with fond memories.) I find it remarkable how this movie sums up exactly why that time in my life was so miserable because it shows that we have this tendency at that age to divide ourselves, fight or just shun those who don‚Äôt fit in with us, and feel endless pressure in our home lives to always be better. When the walls start to break down between the characters in The Breakfast Club is when the film transcends a typical high school drama. For one thing, these kids act realistic as I would imagine actual teenagers would in a similar situation. They let their guards down slowly, and seem leery about appearing vulnerable. It takes time for them to reach the point of breakthrough, but it‚Äôs at that moment we finally see these characters for who they really are instead of who they pretend to be. The amount of breakthrough that comes from a single day spent in a room together is probably a little exaggerated, because this feels like enough drama that it could have taken months to reach this point, but for the sake of making a good movie I‚Äôm willing to accept the sped up timeline. The movie delivers a nice balance of heartfelt drama that can bring you to tears and comedy that can make you laugh out loud, and it can make the turn from one to the other on a dime. The acting performances are all wonderful, and I am impressed with the perfect casting of each role. The part I always struggle with when I watch The Breakfast Club is that it doesn‚Äôt feel like we can rely on any resolution or change. While the characters appear to have made some type of cathartic journey over the course of the film, there‚Äôs no evidence that they will change for the long term. Nothing is done to refute the chilling truth that Claire delivered when she talked about the return to normal life on Monday morning. The pseudo-relationships that are formed don‚Äôt seem strong enough, or grounded in anything that will last. Perhaps there will be a fling between Claire and John, but it doesn‚Äôt seem viable for the long-term. That being said, I still have to commend The Breakfast Club for how it presents a perfect microcosm of high school life. Even though the events seem far-fetched at times, the emotions and themes are authentic. I love the film for how it makes me feel and the hope it gives me, because in general all people can form these bonds if they let down their guard and accept that deep inside we are all the same no matter how we look or act.",

            "content": "Can be considered a very natural to have a nostalgic feeling when a movie you enjoyed in high school is released on the DVD/Blu-ray is a 20th-anniversary edition. However, when the film is one that your soul with your wife after getting her parents to babysit your one-year-old child is marketed as '30th-anniversary collector's edition', that goes beyond nostalgia and firmly into the realm of making your old. The film that incited these feelings was a milestone opus filmmaker, John Hughes, his 1985 masterpiece, 'The Breakfast Club.' This was a movie that was targeted to a very specific program, the 'X Generation.' Generational demarcations are germane to understanding the impact of this film, the X Generation, individuals born after my generation, 'The Baby Boomers,' before the Generation We Would Give Birth to, Really Known As the 'Y Generation.' Under normal circumstances, precise attention to the birth year audience members would be closed insignificant but in this particular case is a significant part of why this film has become such a lasting example of cinematic history. John Hughes was one of the most influential directors of his time. Fans almost universally accept it, critics and film historians, that Hughes played a major part in defining both the decade and the generation growing up within it.\n\nThe style embraced by John Hughes as a director dominated the filmmakers of his day. As a screenwriter's subject matter, predominantly exploring themes growing up in the 80s, but one of his most lasting contributions is introducing the group of young actors would become the A-list stars in the coming years. Our parents, the ones that fought in World War II garnering the name 'The Greatest Generation,' where entertained by a group of singers, comedians, and actors collectively known as 'The Rat Pack.' Envied by many men for their freewheeling, excessive lifestyle in such places as Las Vegas, the group included such legendary performance as; Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin. John Hughes introduced younger, contemporary personalities that would widely become known as 'The Brat Pack.' Instead of converging on Las Vegas these twentysomething stars would frequent the latest venue for excessive libations; the nightclubs of New York City and Los Angeles. A roster of the Rat Pack, for the most part, comprise the principal list actors in this movie; Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy. Not only would they be frequently found several other high school/teen angst films by John Hughes, but they would go on to drive ticket sales are just appearing in the film.\n\nJohn Hughes was able to touch his audience by making a substantial emotional connection with readily identifiable characters. He also set his stories against the background of familiar events common to most teenagers such as a sweet 16 party, or in the case of this film preschool detention. Okay, I have to confess that in high school I was very much a by the books kind of student never received detention, I understood the concept and its purpose. Intended by the faculty to punish and perhaps shame one sentence to the attention, to those most likely to receive it on a regular basis it was little more than a place to raise the now or to time. The core of this film is that it offers an opportunity for the filmmaker to bring together an exceptionally divergent group of students together in one place sharing the same experience. This was considered a major departure from the high school movies that proceeded, and a large number of those that would follow. Teenagers in high school are inevitably depicted as being defined by the clique that they belong as they share a Saturday sentence confined to the library and the punishment known as' The Breakfast Club.' The progression of the story is how the boundaries of the individual cliques began to dissolve, and reform is something new.\n\nJohn Hughes managed to the major cliques familiar to any high school movie. Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez) is the high school jock, a state champion wrestler. Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the 'A' student with Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) is the pampered princess of the class. Rounding off the roster of detainees on the darker side of the group; John Bender (Judd Nelson) as a delinquent and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) providing the emotionally and psychologically damaged girl. Normally in charge of them as the designated adult supervision is the assistant principal Dick Vernon (Paul Gleason), who has the diluted perception that his authority bears the kids, \"you mess with the bull, you get the horns.\" The only other adult that wanders in and out of the story is the school janitor, Carl Reed (John Kapelos). As Mr. Vernon explains to them, their punishment includes the following provisions. They are to remain in your seats without speaking or sleeping until 4 PM, almost 9 hours already. During that time they are to write a 1000 word essay on 'what do you think you are.' All the students in the group Vernon have had the most contact with Bender as a frequent offender in common fixture in detention. There is a great amount of animosity pre-existing between the two and Bender has absolutely no respect Vernon either as an authority figure or human being.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that ordering a group of teenagers sit quietly in the seats almost 9 hours while composing an essay is not something that is likely to be obeyed. Predictably it is Bender instigates the rule breaking that will persist with the entire course of this sentence and the film. The rebellious young man begins to pick fights with his fellow 'inmates.' Considering the diversity among the group members and Bender's predilection for stirring up trouble, it doesn't take long before the 'sitting rule quietly' is not even a memory. In a strange but very believable way, the confinement quickly erodes the boundaries between each of the students and their innermost secrets begin to bubble to the surface. A clue as to why the acts out in such a way could be limited to the fact he comes from a very abusive home life. Allison is a compulsive liar, and Claire is a virgin was taunted and pressured by her friends. They also discover that there is a major bond between that is far stronger than the superficial definitions of their cliques; they all have exceptionally strained relationships with their parents.\n\nThere are so many ways that the success of a movie can be gauged. The most important thing for the studio has always been the Box office revenue. The executives focused on how great the return on the budgeted investment.Considering the film had an estimated budget of $1 million in a gross over $45 million studio executives are ecstatic the film received critical acclaim although it was largely overlooked during the award season not receiving the industry accolades mostly controlled by the previous generation. The genius of this storm is held well spoke to generation X, but it did so with such intrinsic truth that even now over 30 years later it is easily relatable to those watching. I school will always be a time cliques, pairing us for life as adults are the only thing that changes the parameters of the cliques and the repercussions for inclusion and exclusion. John Hughes was able to tap into the complex emotional state of teenagers in such a fashion that many felt his movie spoke directly to them. The themes of alienation and constantly being misunderstood by other teenagers and the adults proves that teen angst is not something that belongs to one specific generation but that it is a persistence quality of the human condition. Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from this film is one that also transcends the age of the viewer; cliques are based on the most superficial criteria. Once you make an effort to get to know a person on a deeper level discover there are far aspects of common than differences. There's been another great release of this film but the special edition those include some extras that go to great lengths to elucidate what serves the foundation for this movie. The matter which generation you happen to call your own, this is a fitting film add to your collection and periodically revisit.\n\nFinally, this film has achieved another means to recognize the substantial contribution to the zeitgeist of a generation lasting effects on filmmaker techniques going forward. The 'Breakfast Club' is the latest in a continuing effort undertaken by the Criterion Collection to preserve significant examples of cinema as a means of artistic expression. The mandate of Criterion has always been the preservation of the filmmaker's artistic vision by presenting their work as closely as possible to the theatrical premiere. When they further select a title to be remaster the movie to high definition the details of the video take on such a new life that the nuances previously missed can be ascertained to the betterment your understanding and appreciation of their work.\nbullet\tAudio commentary from 2015 featuring actors Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson\nbullet\tNew interviews with actors Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy\nbullet\tNew video essay featuring director John Hughes s production notes, read by Nelson\nbullet\tDocumentary from 2015 featuring interviews with cast and crew\nbullet\t50 minutes of never-before-seen deleted and extended scenes\nbullet\tRare promotional and archival interviews and footage\nbullet\tExcerpts from a 1985 American Film Institute seminar with Hughes\nbullet\t1999 radio interview with Hughes\nbullet\tSegment from a 1995 episode of NBC's Today show featuring the film's cast\nbullet\tAudio interview with Molly Ringwald from a 2014 episode of This American Life\nbullet\tPLUS: An essay by critic David Kamp",

To modern day high school students the culture and the things that were popular in the movie may be very different than what they might be interested in. The characters were very unique in their own way.Although they had very basic descriptions of the characters at the beginning of the movie throughout the development of the story and the progression of the movie you start to see that the characters are all much more than their basic descriptions given by the administrator in charge of the detention they are all attending. At the beginning of the movie it starts off with the parents talking to the kids and it gives another perspective and it also gives the characters backgrounds. The problems with their parents shows up later in the story when they are all talking. They figure out that although they may be labelled differently they are all still the same on the inside and are in some of the same problems. Also the problems they are having they can help each other through them. The acting throughout the movie was well done and even though they are teenagers all of the actors were very talented. I love the way in this movie the soundtrack told a story and it also added to the plot, the fades in and out of the music covering up John Bender screaming at Mr.Vernon was a beautiful touch. Everyone in this movie and on the movies crew did an amazing job, i would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",

His directorial work is appreciative but deserved a better supervision compared to its script. The performance wasn't up to the mark which is the only thing that itches one down the throat in this old classic. The Breakfast Club is a typical teenage movie retold in the most intriguing way that it is almost impossible not to invest in it and be moved by it (no matter how much familiar their tales may sound but the impact doesn't grow shallow at all).",

These five strangers begin the day with nothing in common, each bound to his/her place in the high school caste system. Yet the students bond together when faced with the villainous principal (Paul Gleason), and they realize that they have more in common than they may think, including a contempt for adult society.\n\n\"The Breakfast Club\" is one of the most iconic films ever? Why haven't you watched it yet, Chris? Why not? My friends always ask me this. I'll answer with the fact that you don't need to see every \"renowned classic\" in order to be smart about films. In fact, since this film, it has been done a thousand times over. It's nothing special, but if you look back to what this film originally was, it's still executed great, and is surely one of the better films of its decade.\n\nYou got nothing different here. You have the jock, the queen, the nerd, the emo, and the outcast. You have every essential stereotype packed into one room and that's not different. The different is the small things in this film and the writing. The characters themselves are pretty self-explanatory and while they're not special, they're still written well. The characters have great dialogue and they certainly give solid performances. \n\nThe best thing about this film is the screenplay. It's a very well written screenplay with so much small jokes and great lines of dialogue. It's well crafted and I think it's really the core of this film. It'd be nothing without the small and minute details that makes it what it is. The film is simple but deep down, it's more complex. I think the screenplay was in the hands of the right person and it certainly was well structured. \n\nIn the end, \"The Breakfast Club\" still holds up well today. As someone who wasn't born in the 80s, I can't speak for this film and its impact back then. All I can do is compare to media today and it holds up pretty decently.",

It follows the exploits of an unlikely group of high school students who have been put into a detention one Saturday morning. The 5 pupils are stereotypes (the geek, the prom queen, the rebel, the jock and the emo) and wouldn't normally have anything to do with each other. Here, however, they are forced to spend time together, work out their differences and forge friendships. Masterfully directed by John Hughes this is the \"Go To\" film of the the era. I was surprised on a recent rewatching just how little music there was. My memory had the movie jam-packed with hits from the time. Still, the Simple Minds theme tune is a classic and just helps the memories, of those of us of a certain age, come flooding back. Definitely something of a time capsule, if you've never seen it, it's a movie worth seeking out. The only aspect that is today a little cringe making is the last few scenes where the group couples-up and Ally Sheedy's \"alternative\" character gets the all American makeover courtesy of Molly Ringwold's bobby socks character, Claire. This was a movie that defined and reflected a generation and is still good today.",

The Breakfast Club is an up-close, introspective look at five essentially disparate souls who share one cramped Saturday together in detention and, along the way, discover there's much more to their peers than what they wear and who they hang with. Reminiscent of theater, much like the closed-room classic 12 Angry Men, this isn't a flashy picture but it really doesn't need to be. This film rides entirely on the strength of its authentic, revealing dialog and the astonishingly mature, resounding performances of its cast, who contribute many of the sharpest, most memorable lines via ad-lib. It's about trust (or lack thereof), pushing others' buttons, being honest with oneself, testing new boundaries and revealing a shared, deep-seated uneasiness about the perilous approach of adulthood and its inherent responsibilities. Emotions run high at this age, and they respect no class distinctions. The cast may be extremely small, but it delivers across the board; Judd Nelson's damaged loner, Ally Sheedy's bashful antisocial, Anthony Michael Hall's over-stressed bookworm, Emilio Estevez's high-strung jock, Molly Ringwald's pretentious priss. Each role a potential career-maker, and not a missed note in the bunch. It's an existential essential, a notice to uncertain adolescents that somebody understands, and a reminder to their grown-up counterparts that they, too, were once just as troubled.",

But what mostly keeps this movie together is not the fantastic script, but the engaging, interesting, hilarious asshole of a character, beautifully portrayed by Judd Nelson called ''John Bender'', every scene he is in (quite alot), he steals the show. He is just so engaging, your eyes are glued to him whenever he says or does something, it is Judd Nelson who is unforgettable as Bender that acts as the catalyst of everyone's emotions.\nOn top of that the last half hour of The Breakfast Club, is truly incredible, emotional and heartbreaking. Every actor in this film shows their true potential there, and oh boy do they all shine.\n\nWith ''The Breakfast Club'', John Hughes shows us once again why he is the king of 80's comedies.",

Talvez um dos filmes mais bem sucedidos em tentar trazer toda a ess√™ncia dram√°tica da adolesc√™ncia, porque convenhamos que √© como dan√ßar ziguiriguidum em cima de uma corda a 3 metros do ch√£o. Por√©m, o que fez desse filme um dos mais aclamados da tem√°tica adolescente?\n\nS√°bado, 24 de mar√ßo, 1984. Col√©gio Shermer, Shermer, Illinois, 60062. Cinco adolescentes s√£o obrigados a ficar confinados dentro da escola, cada um tendo que escrever uma longa reda√ß√£o sobre o que eles pensam de si mesmo.  O c√©rebro Brian Johnson(Anthony Michael Hall), o esportista Andrew Clark(Emilio Estevez), a princesa Claire Standish(Molly Ringwald), o marginal John Bender(Judd Nelson) e a neur√≥tica Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheedy) formam o Clube dos Cinco. Todos bastante distintos uns dos outros, mas que v√™m nos problemas pessoais uma coisa em comum.\n\nVivemos uma √©poca em que filmes considerados adolescentes envolvem grandes revolu√ß√µes, a sociedade separada em castas e cen√°rios p√≥s-apocal√≠pticos e, se voc√™ pensar bem, o filme em quest√£o traz muito dessa vibe revolucion√°ria, com jovens sendo for√ßados a deixar sua inoc√™ncia para tr√°s e come√ßar a batalhar pela sobreviv√™ncia. O diretor John Hughes usa o marginal John Bender(Judd Nelson) de estopim para isso. √â atrav√©s dele que vemos o desenrolar dos outros personagens e como eles reagem ao mundo em sua volta. Isso acabou fazendo com que, mesmo que n√£o propositalmente, Bender carregasse a imagem de mocinho da hist√≥ria, e isso √© uma vis√£o meio deturpada das coisas, porque um dos pontos positivos do filme √© n√£o focar em apenas um personagem e aponta-lo como o mocinho/mocinha/mocinhx da hist√≥ria e sim dar espa√ßo para que seus dramas pessoais entrem em cena e deixe claro que ningu√©m √©, de fato, um mocinho.\n\nJohn Hughes utiliza a escola como um instrumento crucial na constru√ß√£o de seu filme. Que lugar poderia reunir jovens de diferentes tribos em prol de um bem maior? - E n√£o, o escad√£o n√£o √© uma op√ß√£o.  - Desde os anos em que guaran√° tinha rolha, o adolescente e a escola passam por uma rela√ß√£o de amodeio dif√≠cil de ser explicada. Fica claro o desconforto dos personagens em ter que acordar cedo e ir √† escola em um s√°bado de manh√£.  Acordar cedo j√° √© um sacril√©gio e acordar cedo e ir √† escola e escrever uma reda√ß√£o autodescritiva seria como cometer todos os pecados capitais e ainda desenhar a Xuxa segurando um pentagrama na porta da igreja. Hughes se aproveita do ambiente escolar para introduzir outros personagens indispens√°veis para a trama: o diretor do col√©gio Richard Vernon(Paul Gleason) e o zelador Carl Reed(John Kapelos).\n\nOutro ponto positivo do filme s√£o os di√°logos totalmente cr√≠veis que ele apresenta, parecendo fluir sem a necessidade de um roteiro, e foi exatamente o que aconteceu na cena em que todos est√£o confessando suas desgra√ßas em conjunto no ch√£o da biblioteca. Nenhum ponto negativo no que diz respeito √† atua√ß√£o dos atores,  dando destaque para Ally Sheedy e Emilio Estevez. E fato curioso: Nicolas Cage estava sendo escalado para fazer o papel de John Bender, que bom que n√£o rolou n√© pessoal?\n\nMas talvez o que tenha deixado o Clube dos Cinco marcado na mente de tantos jovens da d√©cada de 80, 90 e do pov√£o de 2000 foi mostrar que todos precisam conviver com seus pr√≥prios dem√¥nios, e que n√£o d√° para fugir disso.

It dives into how being an angsty teenager really is, hits home on the issues kids can have with their parents, and properly displays what it feels like to be the black sheep. The soundtrack only makes it that much better. You need to see this movie.",

It was also over-dramatic and had one too many climatic moments. But again, that was expected. It was also very touching and made me wonder what would happen if people who never ordinarily talk to each other or even notice each other crossed those boundaries and discovered that at the end of the day we are all people and we all have or our demons to battle. This movie illustrated that we all share the commonality of that struggle no matter who we are. Well worth seeing.",

This film is poignant, and thought provoking look at what we as a society put our children through when we teach them to look down on each other, over  pressure them to achieve,ignore them, or abuse them...If you didn't relate to this film as a teen you must not have a heart. The themes of isolation, loneliness, and peer pressure are timeless. John Hughes was a GENIUS and directs a great cast in this classic.",

The Breakfast Club is heartfelt and insightful film that looks into the inner feelings and thoughts of a teenager. The great thing is that you see the inner self in each type of teenager. The rebel, the brainiac, the athletic, the pretty girl and the artistic basket case, and it's all very powerful. Aside from the great script, the performances are great and The Breakfast Club is just a wonderful coming-of-age classic.",

The last section of the movie is overly serious, somewhat disjointed in it's construction and really suffers from Paul Gleason fading into the background.  Some of the dialogue in this section is painful (\"When you grow up your heart dies\"?) and the characters tend to launch into awkward monologues that are way too on the nose.  In a way, it's a perfect film for teenagers, and that's probably why it still works for me.  I was 16 when I first saw it, and it was perfectly designed for me at the time.  I give it a lot of credit despite its flaws.",

Lots of memorable characters and a great set up fro conflict and interesting character study. Only the characters being studied were so boring and dislikeable! John Bender was an annoying prick, who reminded all too much of the douchebags you have to tolerate in high school. The quiet girl was boring, the even quieter girl was fluctuate in her ambitions and traits way too much, and the Emilio Estevez jock I couldn't give two shits about. The only person who gave any justice to the band of bad characters was Bryan, and he was just getting told to \"fuck off\" every minute. In fact, the one person I sympathised most with was the principal! The Breakfast Club does have it's funny moments, but that's about it. Even the final scene where they're discussing personal issues would just turn into something predictably dark and the whole send off where four of them end up as couples was just predictable and unsatisfactory. Fun, slightly charming film, but barely tolerable beyond that.",
