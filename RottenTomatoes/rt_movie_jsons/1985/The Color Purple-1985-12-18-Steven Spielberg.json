Over the course of the film we see Celie grow from a scared and timid girl to a strong and independent woman and one who is filled with passion and perseverance! The film is a little over 2 and a half hours but is filled with such great performances from Glover, Goldberg and Winfrey as well as the supporting cast that there is no wasted screen time and while it falters in a few moments, makes up for it with such loving care in the way it is filmed and enacted that you simply forgive it's faults.",

When Celie stands up to deliver a thundering monologue on her husband's abuses and his twisted nature, you feel it, you are brimming with empathy in that moment and want to join Oprah's Sofia in getting second helpings to savor every detail. \n\nYes, it picks at low-hanging fruit and was angling for the award show circuit from the first draft, but you still get swept up in it even if the runtime is pretty substantial. Spielberg might not have been the optimal director to give the content the most impact or brutal honesty, but it's difficult to deny the exceptional performances that Whoopi Goldberg gives in the lead role of Celie, and that Oprah delivers as Sofia (though I'd say she was well compensated as the experience helped elevate a career that would culminate in her becoming one of the world's wealthiest people). Glover would demonstrate a range even as a hated character that would set him down the path to decades of A-list recognition.\n\nWhile the ending is too sickly-sweet and neatly wrapped up to give the film the status of a truly impactful classic, it's certainly difficult to avoid getting pulled up in the emotional epic that famously flopped in eleven categories at the Oscars.

Too many secondary characters whose arcs are not given proper time. Since so little time is spend with every character I can't help but not being able to connect with their stories. \n\nThe other big problem that I have is that sadly, as with most Spielberg dramas, the tones of sugar are all over the place, with melodrama peeking at the door over and over again. The movie is a very lite drama, it backs away of showing the \"hard moments\".\nIt feels like it's target audience are 50-60 years old white ladies that gather in book groups to discuss the newest Best Selling Drama Novel.\nIt lacks punch, continuing  with the sugar distribution problems of Speilberg sensibilities, there are scenes where awful things are happening and in the back there is joyful music playing, destroying completely any sense of drama. \n\nI am not the biggest fan of Spike Jones or Barry Jenkins, but after seeing what they had to topple in terms of \" Hollywood African American Dramas\" they didn't had such a hard job.\n\n\nCloser to 2.5 than 3.5",

I justly asked myself if this would've occurred to me if I didn't know who the director was and the answer was still yes. There are still several sequences throughout that cut like a knife.

It was one of the toughest experiences to watch. \nDirected by renowned filmmaker Steven Speilberg and based on the best selling book by Alice Walker.\nDanny Glover, Oprah Winfrey and the amazing Whoopi Goldberg. She stars as Celie, an African American woman raised in a very tough lifestyle in the early 1900s.\nShe got pregnant at a very young age and her baby was given away against her wishes by her father. She also has to deal with early bigotry and abuse.\nHer less than caring father marries her off to \"Mister\" Albert Johnson and it only escalates from there. Even her sister is driven away disconnecting any semblance of love.\nCelie's struggle to endure lasts for 40 years, it's tough to find companionship and solace among all the mistreatment. Later she meets Sofia the wife of Mister's son. She's actually one of the brave souls in Celie's life who refuses mistreatment from her husband. A singer named Shug Avery becomes Mister's mistress. She's less than welcoming as you'd imagine. But Celie is able to open herself up to her with such tenderness she's never experienced. It's one of the few rare moments in the film where there's levity. Even Mister's father disapproves of his life choices. As you can tell it's a passing down of cycling abusive behavior that goes unchanged therefore projected onto others. Celie points out people like Mister's father talk smack about others that are too rich or too free.\nGoldberg as Celie finds her humanity among all the hardships she endures. She is defined by her trauma while simultaneously contending with the indignities a black Woman faces in the south early 20th century. Celie has that kind of reserve as a defense mechanism protecting herself from the violent, drunken mood swings of the men she comes across.\nGoldberg here creates a vivid portrait of intergenerational trauma, systemic abuse, and perseverance. \nCelie thankfully manages to find friendships and camaraderie with several of the women she meets.\nIt takes suffering to gather strength, heartbreak to feel joy, trauma to gain courage, triumph goes with tragedy, it's the quest strategic strength that helps to survive, and despite sadness there is always a ray of hope\nThe film's use of music — from jazz to blues to gospel — is another powerful way of steering the narrative.\nIt's about life, it's about love, it's about all of us \nSpeilberg succeeds with a movie that's hard-hitting, sympathetic, beautifully crafted, and it tells a great story. \nServes as a powerful love story of family, sisters, mothers and children.\nIt still holds a deep bone resonance with not just black audiences but diverse audiences everywhere. The cultural impact it's left since its release is still going strong. A universal statement that no matter how many things come at you you can still pick yourself up. 'Color Purple' wins by inspiring others whom have felt invisible, powerless, or marginalized.",

We all like a happy ending and this is provided even if it is a little sugary (it's fortunate that someone in Celie's family had property to leave her) but it tells an important tale nonetheless.  A wonderful performance too from Margaret Avery who played Shug Avery as the man-hungry but never man-dependent diva and Tata Vega as her voice!  Overall another triumph from Spielberg. The quote I remember, which is the heart of the film, spoken by Danny Glover's character (or some other of Celie's brutal controlling men)  as she makes her final escape from soul-destroying household drudgery: 'Don't forget you're black, you're poor, you're ugly and you're a woman.

It’s like sitting next to someone who keeps poking you with their elbow saying ‘ohhh get it? get it? deep huh?’ How does anyone take ridiculous ‘look at me!’ direction like this seriously? Happy black children romping in fields in pretty pastel dresses. Horrible and one dimensional black men and white women. It cops out on the more controversial, deeper elements of the book because Spielberg was not a brave film maker, and needed to pander to the widest (narrow view point) audience. If Hallmark and BET made a film, this would be it. Some great acting and Whoopi is a force of nature that raises this to a higher level. Still enjoyable if you drop your ability to think, and will be manipulated by pandering tear jerking Justifiably ignored by Oscar.",

            "content": "Films that concern important social issues such as racism and the abuse of women are often exempted from proper criticism because of how ‘important' and ‘culturally significant' they are. This is one of those films as other than a minor backlash over the film being directed by the white Steven Spielberg and the fairy tale presentation of life for African-Americans the movie received positive notices with a conspicuous lack of criticism for the performances and hammy direction. I really wanted to like the film but I was thrown off by the awkwardness with which a melodramatic story that verges on torture porn is told and turned off by the over the top theatrics of Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nIn the early 1900s a young African-American woman, Celie, Whoopi Goldberg, is married off the older, abusive Mister, Danny Glover, after having the two children that resulted from an incestuous relationship with her father taken away from her. She suffers as he beats and rapes her but finds some outlet for her creative spirit through her relationship with her sister Nettie, Akosua Busia, however her sister is torn away from her by Mister and she becomes silent and submissive. Her life changes with the arrival of daughter in law Sophia, Oprah Winfrey, whose loud, brash personality clashes with Mister and Shug Avery, Margaret Avery, who is her husband's mistress but becomes a close friend and eventual lover. She becomes empowered through these relationships even as Sophia is silenced and the threat of her husband's abuse increases.\n\nWhat is most shocking about the film is that you never come to know or understand Celie despite spending two and a half hours with her and seeing her face great trials. This is in large part due to Goldberg's portrayal as she is not restrained but expressionless when she is meant to be portraying the downtrodden, resigned Celie and completely overplays the moments when she attains freedom. We never understand how she transitions from abused wife to powerful woman unafraid of criticizing her husband despite several scenes that should provide Goldberg with the opportunity to display a great outpouring of emotion through a subtle expression or a quiet resolve. This is never seen as she is either blank as in her early scenes or chewing up the scenery in a fashion so ridiculous that you forget what serious reasons she has to be aggrieved. In order for the emotionally manipulative scenes in which our protagonist is reunited with her long lost children to work we need to care about this woman as more than a victim and we never really do. Winfrey is painful to watch in a supporting turn as she really can't act and her characterization is so broad it is hard to believe that she is appearing in a serious drama rather than a second rate sketch comedy television show. The cast as a whole fail to make us believe that their characters are real and are caricatures who exist to suffer and have the camera delight in their high camp theatrics.\n\nThe film itself has many issues as it is tonally erratic with the horribly depressing abuse of women being intercut with wacky slapstick humor, a touch which dulls the impact of the scenes of horror and presents a muddled depiction of the supposed villains. One of the aspects of the film that was most criticized was the presentation of African-American men with all that appear on screen being abusive or cruel to women in some way. It would have been good to see the positives in at least one of the male characters as not all men from this time period were absolute monsters but because the film commits to having the men being purely evil it is odd that they are softened by falling through the roof and forgetting their ties. We are expected to chuckle at them in these moments but we do not because the comedy is not pulled off successfully and because it is jarring to jump from seeing these men as abusers to being expected to find them funny and even slightly charming. Spielberg also lays it on so thick as no audience member is allowed to draw their own conclusions about what emotional response the film wants to extract from them as the Quincy Jones score and pedantic editing hit you over the head. \n\nAt least the film looks pretty as Allen Daviau's cinematography captures the area nicely and makes interiors look warm and brightly lit but this is drowned out amongst the gaudiness of the content of the film.",

And I don't just mean it because he makes these long films. But because he can blend into any genre instantly. And it is not that he just qualifies for that project. He excels it. His durability is a dangerous skill that he carries so effortlessly. And usually the director Steven Spielberg is famous for working with props. And I was looking forward to this drama. And see how he binds this thick script with various personified objects. But there isn't any. This disappointment is the best thing that happened to me. And to even the film.\n\nThis is not your Spielberg film anymore. I think this is more Sergio Leone-isc. The faces are captured. Well, to be precise the emotions are captured. Call it a tensed phase of the film where you see a sweating face or call it an engaging phase where the eyes turn red and insults empower the rage or my personal favourite, a face whispering a peace sign when it was supposed to scream war. These close up shots is what's decided by the director and is then, these decisions that sweetens the bitter pill.\n\nFor no one is more present then Spielberg, himself on the set. He makes sure that you are there for that action. No matter how mundane an activity is. No matter if it is just shaving. The Color Purple isn't painted bright by that intense background score or the sheer hatred that ignites the friction between two characters, it is those kids mimicking the actual activity, the shaving, with a leaf as their replica. Something so innocent, scientific and magical can only be present in Spielberg's house. You better warm up, you have to stay for decades here.",

            "content": "The Color Purple is hands down director Steven Spielberg's single most underrated film of all time. It is a harrowing account of four black women in the early 1900's that suffer rape, incest, racism, separation, and domestic abuse all while enduring poverty.\n\nSpielberg does not get enough credit for tackling these intensely disturbing topics. He handles them well by directing sincere moments with close ups, intimate moments with silhouettes, long panning shots for establishing his setting, parallel edits to show juxtaposition, and deep still shots of intense emotion that linger in your heart. The Color Purple is filmed immaculately and with a tender care to be respectful to his subject matter. Spielberg uses tasteful metaphors and pans away from the most disturbing scenes, but you always know what is happening. It's very clever and always classy. I am still emotional from having just watched this brilliant movie again after having first seen it over a decade ago. The Color Purple leaves such a strong impression.\n\nA quick mention to Quincy Jones' excellent score for The Color Purple. He creates a variety of gospel, soul, blues, and more for each scene. His compositions flavor each moment with deep emotion that perfectly adds to the tone. Jones layers the atmosphere and time period with delicate and gripping music in the air.\n\nThe main highlight I think that most audiences will note is the remarkable performances by the cast of The Color Purple. Whoopi Goldberg lays down her greatest performance as an actress ever. She's quiet and subtle, but ever so expressive. She captures the fear and loss that Celie experiences with such grace and sorrow. You can see her suffering and anguish with every shot of her sad eyes. I am still moved by her emotional acting.\n\nThe supporting cast is just as exhilarating and devastating. Oprah is incredible as the boisterous and independent Sofia who endures a truly harrowing separation. Her range as an actress really shines here. Oprah eats up the scenery in perhaps her most memorable performance. Margaret Avery is also very engaging as Shug Avery the singer. She starts out so shallow and Avery plays her exponentially sympathetic over the course of The Color Purple. You are rooting for her by the end. She displays such warmth and kindness as Avery.\n\nFinally, Danny Glover plays the meanest, cruelest, sickest, craziest, and most unsympathetic monster of a husband with such wicked confidence. Glover's acting is truly inspired as he is never one note as the evil Albert Johnson. A lesser actor would have played Johnson as only awful all the time, whereas Glover builds up why and how Johnson's character is so heinous. He even gets a saving grace at the end that Glover plays with a quiet empathy. It's the performance of a lifetime that gets overlooked as the leading ladies of The Color Purple are all magnificent. You have to see Glover in The Color Purple as he really makes you hate his despicable Johnson character. Glover embodies his role with a vicious glee and complex feeling. He really stands out and makes you uneasy with each appearance in his scenes.\n\nIn short, The Color Purple is breathtaking. Easily one of Spielberg's absolute best films. It's an underappreciated classic that I highly suggest you revisit or experience for the first time.",

Danny Glover made me hate him, which is something I never thought would be possible, so his performance was outstanding. Whoopi Goldberg is simply spectacular as well, because she is able to convincingly portray the range of emotional events that Celie goes through. Because of the time it came out, and an apparent attempt to make a movie for the masses, The Color Purple is a bit sanitized. They gloss over some of the darker moments, and only loosely imply a lesbian relationship. I, personally, don't think that weakens the message all that much but I could see some people feeling like it makes the film inauthentic. The movie is a hard watch even with the toned-down abuse. I was emotional more than once, and the ending wrecked me completely. That strong connection I had with the story is why I think it still holds up to this day. The film is also a visual masterpiece, with dozens of images that are iconic, and the music from Quincy Jones matched the tone well.

I remember upon studying the novel at A level, being shocked at the level of violence that women like Celie had to endure.  I was very glad that the film didn't water this down.  To have done so would be a grave insult to the women worldwide who had to suffer this treatment.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg made her film debut in the Color Purple and she was great in her role as the grown-up Celie.  I've always liked how she can bring a naturalness and realism to her acting.  The Color Purple is no exception.  \n\nRead my full review for more: http://goo.gl/ykObxL",

Throughout the movie you would feel yourself in the place of those inside of the movie and you would feel fortunate about what you have. It is a movie that enriches your perspective and teaches you about humanity and how we have changed out values since those times depicted in the movie. The story flowed well from beginning to end with no gaps in the plot. There were also no spots left untouched or any scene not explained. By the end of the movie you didn't have any questions left to ask. I would have enjoyed more of a surprise ending, but that's just a personal preference and did not go with the tone of the film. I however do not recommend this film to watch with your parents because it gets a little awkward at times.",

            "content": "Characters in Spielberg movies can operate in the middle of the moral spectrum, can exhibit nuance, and can hold true to their immutable natures while still going on a journey of change-see, for example, Chief Brody in \"Jaws\"-but it is more common for them to be characterized in extremes, as most of them are in \"The Color Purple.\" Shining heroes and devilish villains are not out of place in, say, Indiana Jones movies which trade in concepts of good and evil in a world where magic is real and the stakes include the destruction of the world, but in Spielberg's historical films his black and white view of life can feel stifling, arbitrary, and preachy. In \"The Color Purple\" and in \"Schindler's List\" no less than in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" the story unfolds through a series of good and evil actions committed by characters who are either right or wrong, respectively. To be fair, Oskar Schindler is a flawed hero in the latter movie, and in this film Celie Harris Johnson (Whoopie Goldberg) has one line that suggests complication. This moment occurs early in the movie, when she suggests, perhaps for lack of any other example of male behavior, that a man beat his wife in order to make her more docile. But for the most part, Celie and the other characters in \"The Color Purple\" have at most two settings, and when they alternate between them it is with a rapidity that is more in service of plot and message than of truth. Spielberg is not obliged to make truthful movies, of course, but in his historical movies he seems to want to have it both ways: he seems to want to say something honest and meaningful, but through characters who are too idealized and abstractified to connect with.\n\nHere, the film opens with an idyllic pastoral scene: young girls playing in a field of flowers. When they step out of the head-high stalks, we see that one of the girls, Celie, is pregnant. Clearly, something is amiss. The next two scenes reveal Celie's painful childbirth, the cruel theft of the infant by her father, and the statement that her father is also the father of her child. The moral lines are very stark, the villain and victim very clear. If only real life had the perfect clarity that it has in Spielberg's versions of it.\n\nAt times, of course, it does. There have been, and still are, women like Celie (Whoopie Goldberg), abused and despised and trapped by their deranged fathers or husbands. There have been, and still are, women like Sofia (Oprah Winfrey), unjustly imprisoned or mistreated by their employers because of the color of their skin. But do people bear their circumstances with the saintly, childlike, often bemused patience of Celie, or alternate between Sofia's polar extremes of unbridled confidence and utterly defeated resignation? Some perhaps do, but for most people, life is lived in the middle. There are monsters in the world, like Danny Glover's tyrannical Albert, but do monsters like that ever change in time for a Spielberg-sanctioned happy ending? These characters are simple when they should be rich, and mercurial when they should be static.\n\nThat said, if Spielberg's prime objective is to convey a strong, positive message through raw, uplifting emotion, he succeeds. Many have focused on the film's famous march to a church, a big musical number that feels good and creates a neat resolution for a juke joint singer named Shug (Margaret Avery). Yet this is actually a side plot, and not strictly necessary to the core ideas about strong female relationships. In fact, it works against those ideas: Shug is the film's most complicated and interesting on-screen character (an equally intriguing storyline set in Africa exists only on the margins), but in the church she is railroaded into what audiences in 1985 found a crowd-pleasing conformity that, to me, just feels like conformity. The idea that really drives \"The Color Purple,\" and that remains as daring and intense and uncompromising and subversive now as it was then, is that bonds between women have the ability to weather the destructive power that certain men employ to maintain their position of privilege in society. Celie's different but equally strong connections with Sofia, Shug, and a sister who remade herself in Africa are mutually empowering and healing, and the worthiness of this message makes the film worth seeing and talking about in spite of its many missteps.",

It'd gotten darker when Danny Glover's nasty character entered the picture and took Celie, since she's older than Nettie, as his wife/mistreated slave. It gets worst when he forbid the two sisters to see each other since the lazy bum (I'm talking about Glover's character - a representation of slave owners) couldn't get Nettie's affections.\n\nIt was just sad to watch with sympathy on what Celie had to go through, while not standing up to him. But when Whoopi Goldberg entered the picture as Celie, her performance lighten the atmosphere at the same time Celie's life lighten up when Margaret Avery entered as the positivity and self-confidence fairy after Oprah Winfrey entered as a good friend who don't want to be messed with (her character married the lazy bum's son, then left him when he was sort-of following his father's ways for a short time until he'd learned his lesson).\n\nAfter that sad, powerful downer that'd affected the rating to a 3.5-star, the film was progressing to a solid 4-star after strong performances from the main actresses and how things resolved towards the heartwarming ending that was built up since the exposition throughout the hard times.

Celie pours out her innermost thoughts in letter form to her sister Nettie (Akousa Busia), but Albert has been hiding the letters Nettie writes back, allowing Celie to assume that Nettie is dead.

Alas, Sofia is \"humbled\" when she is beaten into submission by angry whites. Later, Celie is able to forge a strong friendship with Albert's mistress Shug (Margaret Avery). Emboldened by this, Celie begins rifling through her husband's belongings and finds Nettie's letters. Able at last to stand up to her husband, Celie leaves him to search for a new life on her own.

            "content": "The 58th Academy Award Ceremony must was quite the night of disappointment for the cast and crew of ¿The Color Purple.¿ The film was nominated in 10 different categories including Adapted screenplay, art direction, make-up and music. Whoopi Goldberg was nominated for best actress in a leading role and both Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery received nomination for best actress in a supporting role making for a total of 11 chances to win an on Oscar for this movie. That night, they took home¿none. I thought perhaps it was one of those years where one movie sweeps up like ¿Titanic¿ (1997) at the 70th Awards or ¿Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King¿ (2003) at the 76th awards, but this was not the case. They lost to a variety of movies like ¿Mask¿ 1985, ¿Ran¿ (1985) and a couple to ¿Out of Africa¿ (1985). Clearly, with all these accolades, this must be a good movie. I also tend to like Whoopi Goldberg movies from her more serious movies like ¿Clara¿s Heart¿ (1988) to her comedic films like ¿Sister Act¿ 1992. I, personally, did not like this movie. I found it dull and boring. The movie is about African American woman Celie Harris and her difficult life. Set in the deep south, this shows the hardships she endures, and yet not so much from the whites, but from her own family and people. It was a good story, but again, I just did not enjoy it. I¿m beginning to notice a pattern, as there are other highly acclaimed films that have something in common that I did not enjoy such as ¿To Kill a Mockingbird¿ (1962) and ¿Fried Green Tomatoes¿ (1991). I¿ve always said that I enjoy movies from absolutely every genre. I think I¿ve pinpointed a specific genre I don¿t care for. I guess I¿m not a fan of film adaptations of novels set in the early 20th century deep south.",

            "content": "The film is alternately fascinating and frustrating. Let's be methodical. \nThe acting is fantastic, at least among the older women - I had never seen Whoopi Goldberg in such a meaty dramatic role, and her eventual flourishing as a character compensated for her earlier inability to defend herself (a quality I always find intensely annoying in characters, unless in the right circumstances). \nAnd Oprah Winfrey is marvellous as Sofia, bringing hilarity and gravitas to the film at the drop of a fist. \nBut the men in this film are supremely dodgy in acting terms - Danny Huston acts the part as though he was in vaudeville in the 20s, while most of the other men are equally dumb (the only exception being the almost silent Lawrence Fishburne in a bit part). \nThe music is all over the shop - it is as if Spielberg said to Quincey Jones, \"Listen, I need some music here, but I don't know what it should say, so just go and do something pastoral sounding, ok?\" Though there is some very good singing. \nMost of my problems with the film are to be found in the first half hour; Spielberg seems immature here, with horrendous incident after horrendous incident strangely put together, as though Spielberg struggles to distance himself from jollity. I cannot say I liked either of the children playing Celie or Nettie, and their blubbering was so overdone, again, it felt more like slapstick than drama. \nBy the last act, after Goldberg has claimed her independence, I began to appreciate there was some beauty in the film, but the Johnson homestead with the picture postcard surroundings and the funny little mailbox looked like something from a cartoon or from The Wizard of Oz. \nThere are some excellent scenes and shots, but by and large, the film entirely failed to live up to its considerable reputation. \nShame, really.",

All the actors deserve credit, helping bring the story to life but special mention to Whoopi Goldberg who probably delivered the greatest performance of her career. I personally felt Mister (Danny Glover) could have been portrayed darker so as to offer more of a contrast with the kinder characters; nonetheless, the film does enough to show Celie as a troubled soul and make the audience feel uncomfortable at every piece of abuse she suffers.",

Yet Steven Spielberg's \"The Color Purple\" is a heartbreaking, powerful, and emotionally resonant motion picture that holds up as a masterpiece even today. Mostly staying true to the novel, Spielberg's film is made with love, passion and respect for Alice Walker's novel of the same name. Its a tale that reaches beyond what one usually expects from a book-to-film adaptation, capturing some of the greatest moments in the history of Cinema. Although it plays out at a long running time, \"The Color Purple\" allows director Steven Spielberg to plunge the audience deep into the inner psychology of each of the characters, especially Celie. What we're witnessing isn't a film anymore, but real people interacting and contemplating.  Spielberg manages to get the very best out of his actors; the cast isn't playing the characters, they live each of their roles deep down. Its one thing to make a powerful story, but you're in a completely different league if you get each of the characters right in a book-to-film adaptation. That rarely ever happens, and is one of the main reasons why \"The Color Purple\" is the defining classic of its time. Each scene flourishes with beautiful cinematography and a fantastic soundtrack. Its only about time that you realize that you're not watching a movie, but something greater that understands even the most despised subjects such as racism.",
