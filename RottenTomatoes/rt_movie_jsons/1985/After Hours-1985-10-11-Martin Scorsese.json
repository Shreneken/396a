Later that night, Paul takes a cab to Marcy's downtown apartment. His $20 bill flying out the window during the ride portends the unexpected night he has. He cannot pay for the ride and finds himself in a series of awkward, surreal and life-threatening situations with a colorful cast of characters. He spends the rest of the night trying to return uptown.",

            "content": "While After Hours can be predictable, it's also erratic at the same time. This paradox is how real life is, and that's where the dark humor arises. That's also where the intelligence and creativity behind the movie lie, as it's not easy to make such a movie, and the proof is that it's indeed very unique and rare in its thriller-like vibes while still maintaining its comedic and realistic identities. The soundtrack is also remarkable. It definitely is the weirdest movie I've ever seen, and that's not a bad thing.",

Scorsese's only ‘pure' comedy, After Hours shows the director's range by managing the rare feat of consistently eliciting laughter while simultaneously making you feel bad about chuckling at its characters' misfortunes. It is also probably the acclaimed auteur's most overlooked masterpiece.",

            "content": "Scorsese's funniest film by far!\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's indie black comedy After Hours (1985) is an absurdist's delight! I love how fast paced After Hours is as Scorsese has the hero constantly meeting all these intriguing and alluring women all in one night that devolves into chaos. After Hours is a sweet 97 minutes and feels like 25 to me. It's like the entire joke is that the main character could have avoided all of this grief, tragedy, mystery, and insanity if he had just picked one girl and spent the night with her or even not ventured out into the foreboding darkness of Soho, New York at midnight. Scorsese's direction is super creative as he leans into the ridiculous series of events becoming increasingly strange and hectic with these long takes and moody scenes until they reach sheer chaos. After Hours is Scorsese at his most silly and surreal.\n\nWriter Joseph Minion comes up with all these brilliant and hilarious ways to weave together seemingly random meetings of chance into one giant comedy of errors. His funny premise of a bored program coder wanting a girlfriend going out on an endless spring of impromptu dates that go horribly awry yields constant laughs. I love how Griffin Dunne's bewildered hero Paul Hackett is basically the villain as every choice he makes is selfish, mean, and foolish as he undoes himself. Dunne's shocked and confused face makes for the perfect moron thrown around speeding taxi cabs and gawking at strange ladies telling him their traumatic life stories. If there is a moral to this cautionary tale, perhaps it is to be wary of strangers, be kind to women instead of solely lustful, and be forewarned of late night misadventures.\n\nRosanna Arquette is drop dead gorgeous and delightfully charming as the mysterious Marcy Franklin. She effortlessly conveys Marcy's trauma and insecurity with a moving performance that goes from enigmatic femme fatale to outright emotionally disturbed. I love how she was just reaching out for help and someone to listen to her woes, when Griffin Dunne's Paul just wanted sex and a relationship without really ever empathizing with her. Rosanna Arquette proves why she's one of cinema's greatest dramatic actresses, while also depicting genuine romance and simultaneously pulling off a funny comedic role here in Scorsese's After Hours.\n\nLinda Fiorentino is amazingly seductive and naturally pretty as the punk rock sculptor and BDSM enthusiast Kiki Bridges. Teri Garr is lovely and hysterical as the frustrated and horny waitress Julie. She's so funny in that perfect way that Teri Garr is charismatic and charming as she goes into this comedic frenzy of babbling out these adorable lines. Teri Garr was a treasure to film. Verna Bloom is a riot as the lonely last lady at the punk bar named June with a really artistic personality. She's believably flirty and artful in a wild performance with a lot of subtle grace and gentle beauty to her character June. Catherine O'Hara's young and playful Gail is really funny with her insatiable flirting and frantic persistence in After Hours. All the ladies in After Hours fit perfectly alongside Griffin Dunne's clueless protagonist.\n\nJohn Heard's patient and forlorn bartender Tom is really funny with his ideal deadpan delivery and perfect comedic timing. Will Patton is crazy as the dominatrix Horst. Bronson Pinchot has a humorous cameo in the beginning as Lloyd right after his breakout role in Risky Business. Rocco Sisto's dancing coffee cashier, Larry Block's raging taxi driver, and Victor Argo's disgruntled diner cashier are all hilarious. I loved the outrageous hilarity of Murray Moston's stubborn subway attendant. Dick Miller makes a cameo as the friendly diner waiter too. Tommy Chong's idiot thief Pepe and Cheech Marin's art appraising burglar Neil are hilarious cameos in After Hours. Martin Scorsese really got an incredible ensemble cast including himself as Club Berlin's searchlight operator.\n\nEditor Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp cuts to numerous comedic moments really makes After Hours fly by quickly. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus finds all these crafty ways to shoot in tight spaces in wide shots, while always capturing beautiful close-ups of Rosanna Arquette's emotional face or Griffin Dunne's incredulous looks of disbelief and dismay.\n\nComposer Howard Shore comes up with all these nifty 80's synth melodies and eccentric instrumentation that keeps you laughing with how absurd the music gets in After Hours. Rita Ryack's costumes are a microcosm of 80's excess and playful wonder. Valli O'Reilly's make-up ensures everyone looks as good as they ever did on the silver screen.\n\nIn all honesty, After Hours remains one of Martin Scorsese's finest pictures and certainly his funniest movie for those curious few seeking it out. They will surely be greeted by the paranoid and neurotic joys of those lurking in the perilous darkness of After Hours.",

Paul Hackett (Griffith Dunne) is a conservative, Manahattan suit and tie kind of guy who runs into the intriguing Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) in a café.  After getting her number, he goes against his instincts and meets up with her later that night.  What follows is nothing short of bizarre, his night filled with a wide range of oddities as he struggles to survive until dawn.  The film features some stellar dialogue, a slew of fantastic characters, great performances from a huge cast, and Scorsese's trademark probing camerawork.  While not for all tastes, it's a must-see for anyone interested in Scorsese's massive body of work.",

I simply can’t take that journey because, once I empathize with a character, it’s a painful experience to watch them suffer. After Hours combatted that in a couple of ways, and surprisingly bucked the trend to become a movie I quite enjoyed. The first thing this movie does is establish Griffin Dunne’s character as a somewhat unpleasant person. It’s not that he’s a total jerk and deserving of a miserable night, but he’s not totally innocent either. The other thing that worked for me in After Hours is the gradual build to the night. It starts out just odd instead of awful, and then as the night progresses things get out of control. By the time it’s all so bad it feels like a nightmare, I’m laughing and wondering how it got to this point. Explaining jokes and why I found them funny is a surefire way to take all the humor out of them, so I won’t go into any more minutiae about what made me laugh in After Hours. But I will talk about the style of comedy. It’s interesting because a lot of this “guy who can’t catch a break” comedy feels like something I’d see in a goofier movie, like Police Academy or even Naked Gun. However, in the hands of Scorsese, it takes on a more serious tone. The world around Griffin Dunne feels so real that the insane things that happen to him almost seem logical. It makes some of the more farcical moments feel a little out of place, but I was willing to accept it since this is a comedy. After Hours reminded me a lot of a slightly more adult and gritty version of Adventures in Babysitting (a favorite of mine.) It might not be one of the greatest comedies of all time, but I enjoyed it more than I expected, and would gladly go on that ride again.",

            "content": "What a strange film for a director like Scorsese, usually so focused on gritty realism, with it's Tim Burton-y characters, he was initially slated to direct, and screwball comedy elements it all feels a bit off under a director who doesn't entirely seem to get it. The film isn't without it's pleasures however with a charming and sympathetic leading man in Griffin Dunne and entertaining performances from Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr as two difficult young women along with an off-the-wall visual set-up that does achieve the high fantasy genre that the film seems to be going for. Overall the film doesn't completely work as an absurdist comedy but it's individual pieces are charming enough to create a pleasant little film.\n\nAn ordinary schlub, Griffin Dunne, who is bored with his everyday life is enchanted when the lovely Marcy, Rosanna Arquette, gives him her telephone number. When he travels downtown to meet her in the hopes of a hookup he encounters several kooky characters and seemingly insurmountable obstacles in his quest to return home. As he inadvertently offends Julie, Teri Garr, and discovers that the subway fare has increased overnight he struggles to make sense of the world around him as he has arrived in a seemingly inescapable hell-scape.  Cheech and Chong play robbers who appear intermittently and their star presumably attracted several stoners to this admittedly trippy film. \n\nThe screenplay, written by Scorsese and Joseph Minion, would appear to be a competent comedic script, it is reminiscent of early David O. Russell films like Spanking the Monkey (1994) and Flirting with Disaster (1996) who was most likely inspired by this type of oddball satire, but something about the direction of it saps it of some of it's richness. For example, we hear Dunne talk about his horrible night but we never actually get a sense of the torture he is going through, sure Fiorentino and Arquette appear to be unpleasant but the camera never gives us a sense of any real frustration or suffering from Dunne's perspective. Dunne's performance is convincing but it is only when he has thick \"I'm tired\" makeup plastered to his eyes that we understand how physically demanding this night has been for him.\n\nThe technical elements of the film are mostly interesting with some extra Scorsese flairs added to what could have otherwise been a pedestrian romp. The camera movements have a fluidity to them not seen in your average 80s comedy, see the utterly boring Revenge of the Nerds (1984), with crisp close up shots of our protagonist and effective panning which shows the many oddities of Marcy's neighborhood. The set design also pops as we see very 80s apartments littered with neon colored knick knacks and odd sculptures that serve as an immediate shorthand for the weirdness of these characters and the environment they exist in. One criticism I would have of how the film is technically crafted, other than the previously mentioned lack of stress buildup, is the terrible score in which two songs are used over and over, initially I found myself liking their Bernard Herrmann-esque sound, but as they kept getting played the film moved into almost self-parody and the lack of variety hurt some otherwise fun scenes in the film.\nThe best part of the film is the performances and Dunne is a fantastic leading man, almost a precursor to Ben Stiller but with less morbid wit and more sweetness, he is one of the few parts of this film that seems to perfectly fit the genre he is working in. His interactions with Arquette are twee but believable and his annoyance at the various women who bombard him with their requests are both assured, fully integrated components of the character. Teri Garr is funny but tragic, she struck a similar note in Tootsie (1982), as she sexually harasses the harasses the main character, through a modern lens these interactions are more scary than hilarious but Garr's performance remains well-suited to the film. The various other performers in the film, particularly Fiorentino, work as an eclectic bunch of fruitcakes and the comedic beats often work despite Scorsese's direction and due to the abilities of these actors.\n\nI would recommend this film because it is relatively short at 97 minutes and is light and funny enough to watch with family and friends. It is not thought provoking or shocking as most of Scorsese's work is but it is a delightful mid-80s comedy with a more interesting construction than most films during that period and it deserves a larger audience considering the popularity of the genre it exists within. That is good enough for fifteenth on list. This is certainly an outlier within Scorsese's career but it is not an unpleasant one and it is nice to see him experiment with lighter material.",

            "content": "Suspense, as Alfred Hitchcock put it, is an audience knowing that a bomb is under the table while the characters don't. This has been the rule of thumb ever since, and most films who have tried to divert from this formula fall flat on their face. To my knowledge, there has only been one exception: After Hours, a 1985 film by Martin Scorsese that nobody ever talks about. Here's a movie that tightens the figurative knot of tension to an almost unbearable level. It's advertised as a comedy, and while funny in retrospect, it is one hell of a thriller, and I mean that literally. While not quite dreamlike enough to qualify as Kafkaesque, the infinite sense of urgency crafted by director Scorsese is some of the best since Rear Window. However, After Hours is not a vehicle for general excitement, mostly the consequence of our lead character's innumerable misfortunes, which mostly causes the average audience member to become more intrigued and frustrated. In most films that would spell certain death, however in this case it's instrumental in the movie's success. Scorsese does this simply: by teasing you. He'll build something up, and then cut it off. What's most remarkable about it is how it's achieved through editing, for which Hitchcock advised as a filmmaker's greatest tool. I can't exactly call him a pioneer in this area, yet even then he draws on such classic suspensers as High and Low without ripping anybody off. He does with this shots too, keeping them very frenetic and tight, somehow trapping us in the terrifying mare's nest that we can all sympathize with, without honestly ever enduring it at this severity. It really is an incredible film, unless you're one of those types who find the sight of characters falling into enigmatic, entirely coincidental plights dreadful. In that case, you're sure to walk out of this film feeling very bad. Even then, I would still would administer it to most, because by avoiding it you are robbing yourself of an extremely entertaining 90 minutes of nervewracking hilarity straight out of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Essential example of nonconformist filmmaking.",

            "content": "I was 13-years old when this film came out and for whatever reason, it absolutely clicked with me and I became kind of obsessed with it. It was around this time that I started to notice film directors and the visual flair Martin Scorsese brought to this picture dazzled me, as did the offbeat story. Taking place within the space of one evening in Soho, Griffin Dunne calls up a woman, Rosanna Arquette, for a date who he just met at a diner. From there his evening becomes a series of strange interactions with the color, offbeat, and downright strange denizens of NYC at night. Dunne is the identifiable \"normal\" everyman character who just wants to go on a date but instead finds his money flying out a cab window, buying weirdo pop art from Linda Fiorentino, befriending a 1950s refugee, Teri Garr, awkwardly finding himself helping Arquette's ex-boyfriend, John Heard, and that's just the beginning. From there it just gets weirder as he runs into other colorful characters played by Cheech & Chong, Catherine O'Hara, Verna Bloom, Will Patton, Victor Argo, and the great Dick Miller. Scorcese's \"comedy\" nearly becomes a horror film in the mold of \"Repulsion\" or the \"Tenant\" with Griffin Dunne's evening turning into something of a surreal comic nightmare. \"After Hours\" was part of the cycle of \"Yuppie Nightmare\" films, which included the likes of \"Into the Night,\" \"Something Wild,\" or even \"Blue Velvet,\" a somewhat forgotten sub-genre. Kudos also go to Howard Shore for his fine score and to Michael Ballhaus to his dizzying photography. Overall, this is Scorsese's most \"1980s\" of films and I think one of his most underrated, very much worthy of it's cult status.",

However, he has no money for cab or train fare and things are about to get very weird, leading to a situation where his life is in danger.\n\nOne of Martin Scorsese's least-known movies, and there's a reason for that.  It is not that good.  It had potential, as a quirky comedy or an intense drama, but it's these very possibilities that doom it to failure.  Instead of picking one of the two courses and sticking with it, Scorsese tries to have a bet each way, making it a quirky comedy with deadly serious thriller aspects to it too, and the two sides don't gel (how could they, possibly?).  \n\nDifficult to view it seriously as a thriller, when you have these comedic moments.  Difficult to laugh when the danger may be real.  This conflict makes for an uneven experience.\n\nNot funny enough to be a good comedy (though there are some good moments), not intense enough to be a good drama.  The comedy itself mostly revolves around trying to throw as many wacky characters and situations into the mix as possible, and this gets rather tiresome, rather quickly.\n\nThe adventure that befalls Paul Hackett is quite a roller-coaster ride though, and it is this ceaseless momentum that prevents the movie from being total waste of time.

The screenplay itself, so replete with dated  mysoginisms, with our hero's wish to get laid as a central character motivation, make for hollow entertainment  at best.  The discomfort the protagonist has with learning about a woman's potential burn scars by  discovering her tube of medical cream (and this was 10 years before \"Seinfeld\", too) is not amusing but  sad and frustrating, the plot device of her past history of torture a far too bleak one for it work in a comedy.  Perhaps  Scorsese considered such elements of the writing  to add dark flavour and edginess to the material, but it all amounts to the lead guy being unlikeable and the women in the film being unfunnily portrayed as hysterical neurotics.  The deftness of Scorsese's directorial hand is seen no less here than in his other films, placing  this superbly lit and shot film at discomfiting odds with its immature, ugly writing.",

It definitely has a very David Lynch feel to it, unintentionally, of course, but the surrealness and the overall strangeness of it make it stand out in Scorsese's body of work, despite being a mostly forgotten film. Film fans are the ones that enjoy it the most, and I'm one of them. It's a strange experience, but a rewarding one, nonetheless.",

It has directing and cinematography very similar to Wes Anderson movies, which might be the reason why Scorsese called him \"The next Martin Scorsese\" and coming to think about it, Wes Anderson used the same type of music in \"Bottle Rocket\" and had James Caan's introduce himself the same way as a character in this movie (the sculptor girl that lives with the main character's date).\n\nThe movie is a segment of strange occurrences, similar to what happens to all the characters in Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Magnolia\". I also found the dinner scenes with the main character's date to be similar to the dinner scene in Pulp Fiction, but maybe thats just me.\n\nApart from comparing it to other movies, the performances are great, the story is unexpected, I loved that Cheech and Chong are in it and I also enjoyed Martin Scorsese's Alfred Hitchcock-like cameo in it.\n\nI believe this is a classic because a movie like this could not be made today, because of the technology that exists. If they were to remake this it would all end within 10 minutes thanks to a phone call.\n\nI'd recommend it to people who liked \"Midnight in Paris\", \"The Hangover\", \"Being John Malkovich\", \"The Tenant\", \"Roger Dodger\" or \"The Big Lebowski\".",

What follows is a series of bizarre events and oddball run-in's that conspire to lead Paul through possibly the worst night of his life. What's clear is that director Martin Scorsese is having a tremendous amount of fun, almost as if the shackles are off and he's allowing himself to enjoy the process of creating something experimental. The rain swept, neon lit, grimy streets of night time New York are lovingly captured as our protagonist unwittingly stumbles from disaster to disaster in a way that could only happen in your worst nightmares. Like being in a dream state, the film offers the possibility of any occurrence taking place at any given moment and thanks to an increasingly frantic display from Griffin Dunne, a sense of justifiable paranoia grows with every new unfolding. Paul's initial aim of casual sex gradually becomes a desperate bid to escape the weird and not so wonderful people who inadvertently conspire to make him a prisoner for the night. Towards the end, things do tire a little but overall, After Hours plays like a crazy Scorsese trip to the Twilight Zone fully intent on having a great time. 3.5/5",

I don't think I laughed once. I didn't get that it was meant to be a comedy because for me the humour was too subtle, or just not funny. Perhaps in 80s NYC a lot of it was seen as good quality black humour, but for me it was weak and it neither pushed the blackness of it far enough, or the simple, straight-forward humour either. I can easily see afterwards that it was intended, at least to some degree, to be a black comedy but compared to so much else of what's out there, no, sorry, it didn't work for me. If it wasn't intended that way, I felt it could have done more to follow the lead character's descent into turmoil.\nPerhaps that's the age of the movie showing through - some movies age, others don't. Is it the quality of the acting that at the time would have seemed fine but now seems a bit wooden?\nDefinitely worth watching during an 80s marathon session, but otherwise don't bother, it's too dated.",

There are many great pictures we get to see here.\n\nWhen it comes to the plot I must say I found it original and interesting.

            "content": "[b][u]Review My Collection #7[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nOne strange Christmas, approximately five years ago, my brother scraped together some cash from his part time supermarket job and bought me a present that would keep on giving.  The gift contained a DVD box set entitled \"The Martin Scorsese Collection\" and like many discount collections of this ilk, packaged two well known films with three obscurities.  While I was thrilled that I now owned a better transfer of Goodfellas and was euphoric it threw in the slightly better Mean Streets, the other three films were complete mysteries to me at the time.  Even though one of those movies, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, was surprisingly good, the other two remained encased in shrink wrap, forgotten and forlorn in favor of the more popular movies therein.  Unwatched and collecting dust, the final two films in the collection became footnotes in my movie-going mind, usurped by more modern Scorsese classics.  The first of these films is Who's That Knocking On My Door and the second, unearthed exclusively for this Review My Collection series, is the dark comedy After Hours, a barely satisfying footnote in the storied career of the master filmmaker.\r\n\r\nGriffin Dune stars as Paul Hackett, an Upper East Side computer consultant who leads a staid existence: he consults Bronson Pinchot on how to use a mid 80's computer terminal, reads Henry Miller and lives in an orderly New York apartment.  However, after meeting a quirky but fascinating girl in a New York diner and calling her that evening, Hackett kicks off a series of events that takes him through a very strange night in the City That Never Sleeps.  From the first frame, one thing is readily apparent: After Hours is clearly a Martin Scorsese joint.  The film is peppered with Scorsese's signature cinematography, full of quick pans, jolting zooms and meticulous pacing, all hallmarks of a director at the height of his craft.  Nobody can deny Scorsese's aptitude behind the camera and After Hours highlights that ability in spades.  Yet another love letter to the city that Scorsese called home, After Hours serves as a time capsule to a New York that simply doesn't exist anymore, highlighting all the madcap grittiness, weirdness and danger of that place and time.  As a current resident of Manhattan, I often wonder how it would have been living here two decades ago and the best Scorsese movies give me a little taste of the New York gone by.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the film, nostalgia and film techniques can only go so far without a competent story to keep it afloat and this is where After Hours takes a turn for the bad.  Labeled a \"dark comedy\", the movie heaps on the satire without ever winking, creating an experience that's more unsettling than humorous.  Just like the guy you knew in college that thought Holocaust jokes were funny, After Hours wants to be darkly comic without having an inkling of what the term actually means.  People get robbed, talk blandly about rape experiences and attempt suicide, all played for a chuckle that just isn't there.  It's not that the performances are bad: Dune plays the hapless fella just trying to get home with sincerity, Rosanna Arquette is at her weirdly comic best as the diner girl and bit parts from Catherine O'Hara, Teri Garr and even Cheech and Chong serve their comedic purpose.  Problem is, the comedy just isn't there.  Although Scorsese was able to find that comedic balance in his previous film, The King Of Comedy, that movie had the strength of a more interesting story, likable characters and, oh yeah, some guy named Robert DeNiro.  After Hours, on the other hand, features a cast of misfits and degenerates, all trying way too hard for your cautious laughter.  Sure the movie has its moments, but just as you think Hackett is about to come across a person somewhat normal, the shtick ramps back up, hurling you headlong into the next out of place encounter. The tale is scattershot and for the most part humorless.\r\n\r\nAfter Hours, in a word, just isn't funny.  Perhaps this was considered a biting farce in 1985, which would explain the mind boggling 92% Fresh rating it currently holds on Rotten Tomatoes, but to me it just fell flat on nearly every level.  Well constructed and decently directed, After Hours fails at its primary goal of providing some cringe inducing laughs in the midst of a wild New York night.  Although I'll always love viewing NYC through the eyes of a master, good technique only goes so far.  Even though the movie doesn't provide much in the way of laughter, it's still worth a watch for the hardcore Scorsese fan, featuring some top notch camerawork and direction.  Now all I have to do is give my brother a ring and let him know I finally watched his gift from all those years ago.  And, oh yeah, I'm saving that final box set installment for Review My Collection #197. \r\n\r\n[url=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/808326/blogs/?id=701434\"]**Check out my RT blog entitled \"Review My Collection\" for the rest of the series!!**[/url]",

There is so much happening that we are being branched out ourselves to be completely focused with the strike of unluckiness. The plot is ridiculously hilarious and original. It's originality is a big dive into a pool of fun. Scorsese's direction is a bit rushed at the beginning but it goes perfectly smooth as the movie progresses on in a fast pace that brings the laugh to it. Griffin Dunne, an artist I've never heard of, puts a very lifeless performance in the beginning matching with his character perfectly and gives us an absolutely wonderful performance as the plot grows stronger. With side performances from many others, the film is complete and the characters they portray wonderfully fit in to this big jigsaw puzzle of a movie. The screenplay is nothing too big but it's actually great when you analyze its themes. It makes the movie more watchable. It's a fun movie that may be a little off for some people but easy to understand for a lot. It's a great film that I will totally watch over and over.\"\r\n\r\nFull Review: http://reverieinwords.blogspot.com/2011/06/after-hours-1985.html",

THE STRANGEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE\"\n\n\n\n\"After Hours\" is a surrealistic experience. It's also one of Scorsese's lesser-known gems and as far as I'm concerned, everything the man has so much as ever sneezed on is a gem. I know that sounds very sad and slavishly faithful, (but keep in mind that the man has a great reputation for spinning cinematic gold with about everything he does). I know I sound like some kind of medication and therapy, but to that, I simply ask you all: Has the man ever made a bad movie?\n\n\nMany have complained that pretty much all of his movies are kinda the same. \"Mean Streets,\" \"Raging Bull,\" \"Casino\" and \"Taxi Driver.\" \n\n\nGriffin Dunne is Paul Hacket, a computer programmer who is just going through the motions and has an empty social life. He strikes up a conversation with a nice lady named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) at a local restaurant over a novel they've both read. Words are exchanged. So are looks. She seems interested. He's hooked. \n\n\nAnd from the split-second he gets into that cab, the nightmare begins. The cab blows like mad through the busy streets of downtown SoHo. And after his transportation money literally goes out the window, so do Paul's chance of getting home. He has no idea how deep he's in. At first, it just seems like he's the victim of some bad luck. \n\n\nHe encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.\n\n\nHe encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.\n\n\nNow many of you may be asking, \"Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is a thriller? Is it a horror show?\" Yes. \n\n\n\nIt's... it's like a dream about something that really happened to you. It all plays out like a dream about \"the strangest night of my life....\" And everyone's had that one long, weird night where they were stranded somewhere.... just stuck. No money, no ride. And all the weirdoes and sickos all come out from their hiding-places. \n\n\n\"They only come out at night,\" as they say.\n\n\nI don't want to give too much away because this is a movie where surprise after surprise. There's a whole domino effect here as everything leads to a big final act where we fear for Paul and his safety, and our own. Because it feels like we have become Paul.\n\n\nThe movie features a first-rate all-star cast. Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom, Tommy Chong, Linda Fiorentino Teri Garr, John Heard, Cheech Marin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Miller, Will Patton, Robert Plunket and Bronson Pinchot. \n\n\nThis is the most surprising thing to come from Martin Scorsese. Scorsese has been somewhat pigeon-holed as a director, making usually historical bio-pics about true-life Jewish/Itallian Immigrants growing up in the Bronx and embarking on a life of crime. Always operatic, always rich with detail. \"A Night In SoHo\" is the arrival of a new Scorsese. One who shows a frightening \"what if?\" story in the Big Apple involving anyone with a big-city nightlife.\n\n\nIf it wasn't for Scorsese's name in the credits, you'd never guess he was at the helm. You'd never imagine in a million years he ever had anything to do with the project. He uses a quiet, subtle feeling the movie has when it's... \"too quiet\" and the pumped-up feeling during the more intense dramatic scenes. \n\n\nScorsese is a master of suspense, mood and timing. The fact that the Academy continues to pass him for an Oscar time and time and time again is not only annoying. It's downright offensive. We all know too damn well that the Academy bases Oscars all on politics. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Scorsese has played by all the rules. His films are very well-made and intellectual. They have a graceful operatic feel to them. They are often all-too historically accurate bio-pics. \n\n\nAnd it uses it. Every actor is perfectly cast. Everyone is allowed to stand out in a big way without being too contrived or too cartoonish to be real. \n\n\nAnd Scorsese, who's name stands for quality above all others, makes the most of it.\n\n\nJoseph Minion's screenplay (which he collaborated with Scorsese on) is used for all it's worth. All the characters are quirky, colorful, yet realistic. The dialouge is smart and honest without being too unnaturally \"screenwriter-ishly clever.\" \n\n\nAnd 9 out of 10 New Yorkers who see this movie will smile and nod, \"Yep. That's NYC at night to a T.\" Everyone else will be sure to avoid New York like a severe audit. Most people who live outside New York fear the city and plan never to go there. \n\n\nI imagine this movie will do a lot to complete the trend. \n\n\nMy only real complaint is that Minion should have gotten more credit for his original and winning screenplay. He should have gotten maybe a few more nods from other academies, I'd never seen anything so intriguing and elaborate before. It's not just new. It's smart, fresh, well-crafted and all-too believable. \n\n\nI know the American Academy would give an Oscar nomination to a film like this, but that's almost a sign of it's greatness. Scorsese gives it a realistic, yet outrageous feel and knows how to let the suspense draw out and build skillfully and Joseph Minion has written himself a little bitty treasure. I just wish he'd write so much more. \n\n\nStill, this is a home run on every account. I say this and mean it: YOU ALL MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Ask for it by name: \"After Hours.\"\n\n\nThanks for reading.... \n\n\n--In The Name of Scorsese, Dane Youssef",

            "content": "Let me just start this off by saying that After Hours is one of my favorite films. Ever. It's one of those films that you just watch over and over and over and over again. It never gets old. It's a Martin Scorsese picture about a guy named Paul (brilliantly played by Griffin Dunne). Paul has the worst night of his entire life, and we're along for the ride. This is a fairly dark comedy, in the sense that if the stuff that is happening to Paul in this film were to happen to you or me, we would have a nervous breakdown. Bad luck doesn't even begin to describe it. But since we're watching this stuff happen to Paul, it's absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nAfter Hours is one of those films that is so consistently entertaining, that it's almost distracting. There's not one dull moment here. Paul is always getting into some sort of trouble. Some of the coincidences presented are extremely outlandish, but that's what's fun about it. At every possible instance, the worst thing that could possibly happen to Paul, does. And it's almost always hilarious. You may feel bad about some of the things you're laughing about here. Suicide and murder both play into some of the film biggest laughs. This isn't an unlikable film though. It's surprisingly light-hearted, when you think about some of the subject matter. And that likability comes from Paul.\r\n\r\nPaul is a great character. One of my favorites in film. He's pretty much an everyman, but he's a character. Most \"everyman\" characters in films come off as a sort of blank slate. Someone that lets the events of the film completely shape who they become by the end. That isn't the case here. Paul is a person. He meets a girl at a coffeehouse, and later on he calls and she wants him to come over. And just like that, he has initiated the launch sequence for the worst night of his entire life (and probably yours, if you were him). It's a pleasure to watch Paul deal with the constant situations that come up. He reacts like a normal person would to them. That's what makes it so fun.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese's direction is, as usual, flawless. He's doing a pseudo-Hitchcock thing with this film, that really works. The camera swooping around and such. He gives the film such a brilliant sense of place. As Paul is running, around SoHo like a madman, going from place to place, you begin to feel like you could navigate your way around there. You know which way he came from and where he's going before the scene even changes. Not many directors can achieve that in a film.\r\n\r\nA wonderful script, a wonderful cast of characters, and a wonderful energy that you just don't see in films anymore. It's hilarious, dark, and pure genius. I highly, HIGHLY recommend you seek out this gem.",

            "content": "by Dane Youssef\n\n\n\"What a weird dream... experience? What.... What The Hell Happened...?\"\n\n\n\"AFTER HOURS\" is a surrealistic experience. It's also one of Scorsese's lesser-known gems and as far as I'm concerned, everything the man has so much as ever sneezed on is a gem. I know that sounds very sad and slavishly faithful, (but keep in mind that the man has a great reputation for spinning cinematic gold with about everything he does). I know I sound like some kind of medication and therapy, but to that, I simply ask you all: Has the man ever made a bad movie?\n\n\nMany have complained that pretty much all of his movies are kinda the same. \"Mean Streets,\" \"Raging Bull,\" \"Casino\" and \"Taxi Driver.\" \n\n\nGriffin Dunne is Paul Hacket, a computer programmer who is just going through the motions and has an empty social life. He strikes up a conversation with a nice lady named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) at a local restaurant over a novel they've both read. Words are exchanged. So are looks. She seems interested. He's hooked. \n\n\nAnd from the split-second he gets into that cab, the nightmare begins. The cab blows like mad through the busy streets of downtown SoHo. And after his transportation money literally goes out the window, so do Paul's chance of getting home. He has no idea how deep he's in. At first, it just seems like he's the victim of some bad luck. \n\nHe encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.\n\n\nHe encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.\n\n\nNow many of you may be asking, \"Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is a thriller? Is it a horror show?\" Yes. \n\n\nIt's... it's like a dream about something that really happened to you. It all plays out like a dream about \"the strangest night of my life....\" And everyone's had that one long, weird night where they were stranded somewhere.... just stuck. No money, no ride. And all the weirdos and sickos all come out from their hiding-places. \n\n\n\"They only come out at night,\" as they say.\n\n\nI don't want to give too much away because this is a movie where surprise after surprise. There's a whole domino effect here as everything leads to a big final act where we fear for Paul and his safety, and our own. Because it feels like we have become Paul.\n\n\nThe movie features a first-rate all-star cast. Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom, Tommy Chong, Linda Fiorentino Teri Garr, John Heard, Cheech Marin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Miller, Will Patton, Robert Plunket and Bronson Pinchot. \n\n\nThis is the most surprising thing to come from Martin Scorsese. Scorsese has been somewhat pigeon-holed as a director, making usually historical bio-pics about true-life Jewish/Itallian Immigrants growing up in the Bronx and embarking on a life of crime. Always operatic, always rich with detail. \"After Hours\" is the arrival of a new Scorsese. One who shows a frightening \"what if?\" story in the Big Apple involving anyone with a big-city nightlife.\n\n\nIf it wasn't for Scorsese's name in the credits, you'd never guess he was at the helm. You'd never imagine in a million years he ever had anything to do with the project. He uses a quiet, subtle feeling the movie has when it's... \"too quiet\" and the pumped-up feeling during the more intense dramatic scenes. \n\n\nScorsese is a master of suspense, mood and timing. The fact that the Academy continues to pass him for an Oscar time and time and time again is not only annoying. It's downright offensive. We all know too damn well that the Academy bases Oscars all on politics. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Scorsese has played by all the rules. His films are very well-made and intellectual. They have a graceful operatic feel to them. They are often all-too historically accurate bio-pics. \n\n\nAnd it uses it. Every actor is perfectly cast. Everyone is allowed to stand out in a big way without being too contrived or too cartoonish to be real. \n\n\nAnd Scorsese, who's name stands for quality above all others, makes the most of it.\n\n\nJoseph Minion's screenplay (which he collaborated with Scorsese on) is used for all it's worth. All the characters are quirky, colorful, yet realistic. The dialog is smart and honest without being too unnaturally \"screenwriter-ishly clever.\" \n\n\nAnd 9 out of 10 New Yorkers who see this movie will smile and nod, \"Yep. That's NYC at night to a T.\" Everyone else will be sure to avoid New York like a severe audit. Most people who live outside New York fear the city and plan never to go there. \n\n\nI imagine this movie will do a lot to complete the trend. \n\n\nMy only real complaint is that Minion should have gotten more credit for his original and winning screenplay. He should have gotten maybe a few more nods from other academies, I'd never seen anything so intriguing and elaborate before. It's not just new. It's smart, fresh, well-crafted and all-too believable. \n\n\nI know the American Academy would give an Oscar nomination to a film like this, but that's almost a sign of it's greatness. Scorsese gives it a realistic, yet outrageous feel and knows how to let the suspense draw out and build skillfully and Joseph Minion has written himself a little bitty treasure. I just wish he'd write so much more. \n\n\nStill, this is a home run on every account. I say this and mean it: YOU ALL MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Ask for it by name: \"After Hours.\" What can happen after dark... after-hours? Anything can...\n\n\nThanks for reading....\n\n\n--Marty Forever, Dane Youssef\n\n\n\nanessf@yahoo.com \n\nhttp://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=58175682\n\nhttp://www.google.com/profiles/youssef.daneyoussefcom.dane\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASKUZHOKQ1W3E/ref=cm_pdp_rev_title_1?ie=UTF8&sort_by=MostRecentReview#R2MFYILVVRXX73\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/user/ur2718160/comments-expanded?start=0&order=alpha\n\nhttp://wiki.answers.com/Q/User:DANE_YOUSSEF\n\nhttp://www.epinions.com/user-surfur\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DANE_YOUSSEF\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SURFUR\n\nhttp://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/User:DANEYOUSSEF\n\nhttp://www.movieweb.com/u/dane_youssef/reviews\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/SURFUR\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/DaneYoussef?feature=mhum\n\nhttp://hairmetal.ning.com/profile/DaneYoussef?xg_source=activity\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/people/46939743@N07/\n\nhttp://twitter.com/Dane_Youssef\n\nhttp://www.neoseeker.com/members/daneyoussef/",

As a simple word processor, Paul Hackett ticks his life away with every dull moment he spends at the office, doing a job we all know he truly dislikes.

Paul Hackett is a young word processor who thinks that he might get lucky one night, and when he goes to meet the girl at her house, she turns out to be a little crazy. There's always something off about her that he nor the audience can fully understand. Something about fire, or burns, or something. The story just keeps getting more and more strange as it progresses. Paul starts out with just one problem: how do I get away from this girl without breaking her heart? Then it turns into: how can I escape this mob alive? Everything moves along smoothly as we get deeper into the night. I felt like I took the journey with Paul. He's asking \"what next?\" and I found myself doing the same thing. You think you know what will happen, but the writer keeps changing things up. It starts out with guessing that the film will be a strange journey of him making his way to Marcy's house. Nope. Then it gets to Marcy will freak out when she finds her roommate on the couch with Paul. Nope. Then we think he will get blamed for the death of somebody (not mentioned here for spoilers). Nope. With a lot of films, after all of this wrong guessing with these scenarios it might start to feel fake; like the filmmakers knew what was going through the thought process so they force something else. But nothing ever feels forced. It's all unpredictable, but it all makes sense. We laugh because it's all so strange. I'm sure if Scorsese wanted to, he could have made this a dark and horrific film. But instead he wants us to have fun with this strange ride. The entire film is filled with terrific characters. Even though things goes poorly, I still felt Julie was the nicest character. I felt awful when he was mean to her right off the bat. She hates her job, probably hates her life, and just wants someone to come by and treat her well, but he can't do that. I guess this makes us not hate the movie after a while when he can't get home. We have a reason to understand it all. He's just a human, and he has flaws, and this is a heavily flawed night.

I just can not rate this movie on the same level as the majority of his other work.

They converse about their common interest in Henry Miller.

So I feel obliged to say that this is one of the best films Martin Scorsese has made. Yes, this is the man who made such masterpieces as \"Goodfellas\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\", and \"Mean Streets.\" I feel \"After Hours\" is more than welcome among those very fine films. It just goes to show that how a film is made matters.

The theme concerns one night in New York City, and although what transpires could happen in any major metropolitan area, the trappings are distinctly New York. It's funny how Scorsese is able to satirize the city while still celebrating its cosmopolitan atmosphere. The genius is the method in which the action slowly unfolds getting progressively more ridiculous as time goes on. We sense something is amiss right from the very start. Notice how Marcy's roommate Kiki answers the phone when he rings her up. Kiki's disembodied voice dripping with annoyance. That's merely the beginning. His odyssey becomes nightmarish in its development. The brilliance is that he takes the saga to places we don't anticipate. Creatively building layer upon layer of insanity to form a perfectly realized vision of hell on earth. It's hilarious, weird and uncomfortable at once. Throughout it all, Dunne grounds the picture in an air of normalcy that radiates safety for the viewer. And just when you fear that this cruel paean to the Big Apple cannot end in any meaningful way, it does. The story comes full circle intelligently referencing events we've seen before. It's an intricately constructed tale that simply gets better with age.",

A series of unfortunate events follow slowly, but become more and more rapid as the night goes on, especially as Hackett encounters one strange character after another that make up the eccentric SoHo, which includes a who's who list of all kinds of great names in this, like the aforementioned Arquette (sorry, doesn't get naked), Linda Fiorentino (does get naked! yay), Cheech & Chong (as late night thieves whose deeds are getting blamed on Hackett), the beautiful Verna Bloom (whom I'll always remember as Dean Wormer's wife in Animal House), Catherine O'Hara (man, she looked hot when she was young), Teri Garr (still looked pretty hot but not Young Frankenstein hot), John Heard, Will Patton, and even the great Dick Miller. Overall, this movie was fun. You really feel for Dunne and his character's plight throughout the night. The rest of the cast adds a lot of fun and flare to the film, so that Dunne isn't carrying the film all by himself. Keep in mind, this isn't a conventional comedy. It's done differently by the awesome Martin Scorsese, who tries to dance between light-hearted and dark comedy, but packed with plenty of storyline on top of a seemingly simplistic plot.

As Paul sits with a glazed look in his eyes, the viewer understands that Paul needs a kick start. And boy does he get one.\r\n\r\nPaul meets up with a seemingly normal and pleasant girl at a coffee shop and upon returning home, calls her. She promptly invites him over to her place for a couple of hours. From there, everything that can go wrong for Paul, does. From possibly being at fault to a death of a girl to being accused of robbing homes, Paul runs a muck around the New York neighborhood just trying to find a way home.\r\n\r\nThe New York scenery is priceless and it seems each character was casted with precision as they all seemed to flow with the Scorsese's otherwise surreal story.

One of Martin Scorsese's most underrated films. It was made in 1985, and I can already see the techniques Scorsese used in Goodfellas and the quick editing. It is directed and edited really well. So if you were a fan of Scorsese's frantic camera work in Goodfellas and Casino, this film is for you. It really does put you on edge as a viewer, you really want Dunne's character to get back home but everything possible that could happen to him happens. This is not just a evocation of soHo in the early 80's, it is a deeply black comedy. All the rules go out the window for Dunne's character, because after all it is after hours. Overall, however, \"After Hours\" is an enjoyable film. It is an especially good choice to gain a sense of perspective. Not many ongoing experiences can be worse than the rough night that Paul has in Soho. Watch at own risk!\n\n\nConjure up an urban world where apparently friendly young ladies all turn out to be somewhere between odd and crazy. Then imagine you're up here to see one such girl and your last bill has flown out of the cab window on the way. Then pretend your date has committed suicide, you've somehow got branded as a serial robber, and another girl is after you with her ice cream van.
