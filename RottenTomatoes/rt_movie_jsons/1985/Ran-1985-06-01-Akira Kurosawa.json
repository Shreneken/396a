I would not wish upon my worst enemy to sit through all 2 hours and 40 minutes of Ran. \n\nThough oftentimes I find the beginning scenes of movie to be poor at setting the tone for the overall film, Ran's opening perfectly establishes the movies pacing: slow, awkward, and difficult to sit through. Even compared to other movies of the time, the effects are poor, and the acting leaves much to be desired. \n\nI do not understand why this movie is rated so well, and disagree to the utmost. I would rather do classwork or physical labor than watch Ran again.",

A multi-layered, gritty, thought-provoking, depressing, and complex drama that creates a storyline built upon one of the quintessential  Shakespearean classics in order to formulate one of the most complex movie experiences I have ever had (damn that was a horrendously long sentence).  Although a long and arduous ride ,  Ran constantly demands your full attention through plot twists, moral dilemmas, and philosophical references.  Additionally, this is likely the most visually stunning 3 hours you will ever have whilst watching a movie.  The cinematography is incomparable to any other film and color mixing is impeccable.  An absolute must watch for anyone who considers themselves a cinephile (or anyone who wants an epic three hour experience for that matter).",

The plot is thick with betrayal and self-interest, all shot in beautiful, beautiful color \u2014 whether it be the rolling green hills or the orange-fires consuming a black and gray castle. Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) abdicates from his position of power, relinquishing complete control to his eldest son, Taro (Akira Tarao), to the pleasure of the middle son, Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and to the chagrin on his youngest, Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). This decision casts into motion the entire slimy plot of scheming actors \u2014 I must imagine that Ran served as one of George R.R. Martin's many inspirations for GoT. Hidetora's health and visage begin deteriorating once he realizes the effects of what he's done \u2014 he eventually doesn't look much better than an afflicted King Th\u00e9oden. There is a lot of Hidetora wandering the countryside, oftentimes with his jester, Kyoami (Peter), which gives me one of my few criticisms of the film. At 162 minutes, some of this could've been cut. The film is filled with visually stunning scenes, most notably Saburo's cavalry crossing the river, Ayabe's (Jun Tazaki) contingent high on the hill, and the castle engulfed in flames. Kurosawa gives us some solid battle scenes \u2014 it is astounding how these actors really fell from their horses and bounced off the ground \u2014 but I have to admit I was disappointed we never got the armies really engaging each other in hand-to-hand, katana-clashing combat. Ran is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a blood-covered epic. I'm comfortable giving it one point less than Seven Samurai.",

As with the source material, the film deals with themes of loyalty and the chaos that results from the struggle for power.

            "content": "I watch quite a lot of Southeast Asian films, and the great majority have very fine, naturalistic acting. The other Kurosawa films I've seen have your usual cinematic rather than theater-style acting. The acting in Ran takes me out of the movie a lot. Tatsuya Nakadai seems to spend most of the movie bug-eyed and slack-jawed while 'Peter' just seems like some cliched effete homosexual twit. It's the visuals of the impossibly glorious colors, the army marching on horseback, the fantastic clothing design along with the basic story line that make it so remarkable for me.\nThe army crossing the countryside, crashing through the waters, is fantastic. The image brings with it a sense of the regal, the honorable, but also one of impending wrath; it's almost frightening in a way. costumes, which won an Academy Award, carry most of the film's color. I read that the 1,400 costumes were handmade in Kyoto, traditional seat of Japanese tapestries: \"It took three to four months to make each beautifully colored robe (the work was done simultaneously), and it was nearly three years before all were finished.\" Kurosawa frequently chooses drab backgrounds--barren soil, gray slab courtyards, rock steps--to show off their dazzling beauty.\nThe film is set in medieval times, but it is a 20th century film, in which an old man can arrive at the end of his life having won all his battles, and foolishly think he still has the power to settle things for a new generation. But life hurries ahead without any respect for historical continuity; his children have their own lusts and furies. His will is irrelevant, and they will divide his spoils like dogs tearing at a carcass.\nThe story line, partly inspired by Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", but also commenting on on the intricacies of family dynamic, ego, selfish obsessions, and war in general, is compelling for sure. However, I felt too many scenes were unnecessarily wrong, leaving me wanting to skip ahead much of the time. The greatness of the film outweighs the slights, so I'll go with 3.8 stars for now.",

The action sequences still look superb, and the cinematography is unreal, but I did find it less engaging than some of Kurosawa's previous work, most notably Seven Samurai (1954). A loose adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear, it also takes themes from Macbeth and Hamlet, and is nothing short of epic in scope and scale, but certainly seek it out in 4k blu ray and see it on the biggest TV you possibly can.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's Ran (\u4e71, translit. Mandarin: \"lu\u00e0n\", lit. \"chaos\") is one of his most highly regarded films. It adapts the plot and narrative structure of Shakespeare's King Lear to the Sengoku Jidai: in place of Lear and his daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia, we have the daimy\u014d Ichimonji Hidetora and his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. This transposition somewhat intensifies certain aspects of King Lear's moral conceit. Hidetora's sons neglect their formal duties under filial piety, just as he abdicates his own responsibilities as lord and father. While the actions of their Shakespearean counterparts is intuitively reprehensible, in Ran, they violate codified central tenets of Confucian ethics.\n\nNihilistic interpretations of King Lear came into vogue in the 20th century, but while neither the stage production nor its film adaptation affirms a strong moral conclusion, to me it is at least clear that an ambiguous morality is not equivalent to a lack thereof. Ran is a cautionary tale about seeking privilege without responsibility, substanceless claims to moral superiority, and the banal yet fragile nature of what is truly good. Kurosawa's direction relies more heavily upon nonverbal techniques than Shakespeare's dialogue, and it is largely for his mastery of visual storytelling that the film is so highly regarded by critics.\n\nThe film feels more of an exercise in visual storytelling, than necessarily a source of mass entertainment. It certainly is instructive in expressive cinematographic technique, with much to be learned and emulated. For the critical viewer, this is indeed a great masterpiece.",

The director had been planning to make this film for decades and this was the realitization of a decade of painting the storyboards for this film. It would be his last epic and the most expensive film that he would ever make.\n\n\n\nBeyond the autobiographical nature of this story, Kurosawa also saw the battle scenes as metaphor for nuclear warfare and the high anxiety after Hiroshima. There's also the influence of Japanese Noh theater for two of the protagonists, Hidetora and Lady Kaede, whose single-mindedness stand in contrast to the rest of the cast of characters.\n\nHidetora is a powerful warlord at the close of his life who has decided to divide up his kingdom amongst his sons, with Taro gaining the First Castle and the leadership of their family, while his brothers Jiro and Saburo are to support him and live in the lesser castles.\n\n\n\nThe wise old man explains unity using three arrows. It is easy to snap one arrow but three together are more durable. Saburo snaps all three arrows and calls his father a fool, which leads to him and a servant named Tango being exiled. Fujimaki, a visiting leader who watches all of this, agrees with the brash young man and offers him his daughter in marriage.\n\nTaro's wife Lady Kaede also demands that her husband go to war, still angry that her entire family was killed by Hidetora. The constant battles \u2014 gunfire has replaced swords and arrows \u2014 drives the old man mad as he wanders the wilderness, haunted by visions of those he has destroyed in his journey to power.\n\nAs the entire family follows him into some level of insanity, with war, intrigue and double crosses throughout, it seems as if every castle will crumble into nothingness.\n\nHow important was Ran to Kurosawa? His wife of 39 years Y\u00f4ko Yaguchi, died during the production and he only mourned for one day. His eyesight had also completely deteriorated by the time principal photography began, so his assistants used his paintings as guides to frame each scene.",

            "content": "The term 'sweeping' seems to get overused quite a bit when describing epic films, but the term absolutely applies here; Ran is the most sweeping film of Kurosawa's career, in scope and cinematography alike (though perhaps not in theme). While the setting and several details are altered, the nature of Shakespeare's tragedy is evident in full force, as a family initially presented in regal certainty find themselves pulled apart by greed, mistrust, na\u00efvet\u00e9, madness, and, perhaps most painfully, chance. Vices such as anger and jealousy fan the flames of conflict until they reach the boiling point with devastating consequences; you'll gaze around the smoke-filled battlefields and, thinking back to the opening scenes, wonder how the characters could have arrived at such an unpleasant fate. At its core (as confirmed by the title), Ran is about the thin line between civilized behavior and total chaos, and the hostility associated with periods of evolution as groups vie against one another for supremacy and survival; the relatively innocuous and somewhat well-intentioned series of events that lead to a complete shattering of both peace and Hidetora's mental state amplify one another in unexpected ways, playing off of human weakness. Deeply philosophical and totally morose. Visual composition is spot-on here, as Kurosawa employs distinctive wide angles in accordance with a massive set and costume budget (that was clearly put to good use); the final shot of the lone, blind Tsurumaru left isolated in the shell of his former castle not knowing that his slain sister will not be able to return to him is a heartbreaker, even if he is not necessarily an important character to the actual plot.

His own lust for power begets their lust of power, and ultimately, the film ends with destruction. This story is compelling and, probably because it's Shakespeare, makes it feel classic, timeless, almost like a storybook.\n\nI noticed that Kurosawa's cinematic composition is a little different here.

In the tradition of Throne Of Blood, Kurosawa finds himself once again adapting William Shakespeare work to feudal Japan with exceedingly effective results. RAN is choked full of all the sweeping battles, family betrayals, and political intrigue that one would suggest when bringing the tale of King Lear to the screen. As usual, Kurosawa's direction is perfection throughout. This is different from his films of the 1950s and 1960s. Here we see him take advantage of the benefits that come with shooting a film in color, like color symbolism throughout. The rivers of blood are also much more striking in there more accurate reddish tones than in his previous works. The film was on the whole more generous when it comes to the carnage on screen, a clear sigh of censorship changes over time. Tatsuya Nakadai would have made Sir Anthony Hopkins proud with portrayal of the mad king. He is able to play both Hidetora's proud stubbornness at the beginning and his descent into hysteria at the end with equal fervor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Overall: While I personally prefer Kurasawa's smaller scale skirmishes like Rashomon or Seven Samurai, RAN is still an impressive spectacle and spellbinding exploration of the profound themes of The Bard's work. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Highlight: In the scene of Hidetora's castle being sieged, what would be a thunderously deafening scene is instead only left with the sparse musical score, making the gruesome slaughter on screen all the more vivid.",

It's a bold and tragic piece, rich and unforgettable.",

            "content": "A great take on King Lear!\n\nAkira Kurosawa's epic war drama Ran (1985) is a fantastic adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy play King Lear. Kurosawa writes sympathetic and complex characters and modernizes Shakespeare's language into finely tuned dramatic prose for the big screen. Ran is riveting as a tale of fatherhood, brotherhood, loyalty, family, honesty, and betrayal. I can make the argument that Ran is the greatest version of King Lear ever put to film. It's exciting in its large scale combat and engrossing in its nuanced drama. \n\nKurosawa's direction is particularly fascinating as his ambition for realism is unparalleled in these epics. Using scores upon scores of extras in full armor, he gallops entire platoons of men full speed on horseback towards one another. The blur of motion in the camera during the action looks startlingly modern. Ran could have come out now with its genuine performances and contemporary look. Kurosawa continues his obsessions with vibrant color and dream sequences. Ran fashions itself out of lovely kimonos, realistic samurai armor, endless muskets, cool katanas, and frightening spears. It's impressive how Kurosawa brings feudal era Japan to life again and again with his films. Ran is just as astounding as his earlier classics.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai is powerful as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji. He plays the clan head well as an elderly man, who falls prey to his sons' dishonesty, while scorning his honest son. Nakadai uses his big expressive eyes effectively as you feel bad for him by the end. He's a very fun actor to watch in Ran.\n\nI really liked Akira Terao as Taro Takatora Ichimonji. His meek responses are funny and his cruel underhanded is interesting. Jinpachi Nezu is perfect as the traitorous son Jiro Masatora Ichimonji. Daisuke Ryu is excellent as the banished son Saburo Naotora Ichimonji. His candid rapport with Nakadai is nice to see. I must mention Mieko Harada steals the show every time she is on screen as the conniving and resourceful Lady Kaede. Toru Takemitsu's score is really refreshing and different for a Kurosawa film. It sounds quite contemporary to my ears.\n\nOverall, Ran is brilliant filmmaking matched by compelling acting. Kurosawa did it again!",

            "content": "Ran is Akira Kurosawa's last epic. The man was a genius when it came to directing these long Japanese war epics and Ran is no different. This is Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that unfortunately I did not study. The plot consists of Lord Hidetora abdicating his empire and splitting the kingdom between his three sons, who each want to have total control. And so many castles are raided and many horseback battles are conceived. Whatever the scene, everything was filmed to perfection. I just adore Kurosawa's style, he doesn't rush a single scene. Leave a castle burning for 30 seconds, watch a man run through a field for 30 seconds or even look at the sky for 30 seconds. In theory, I should be bored...but his artistic integrity and majestic style is a sight to behold. What resonated with me the most was the screenplay, also by Kurosawa. Several lines of dialogue felt like Shakespeare and it's admirable to see an influential film maker be...well...influenced by another famous writer. Scenes where Hidetora descends into madness are great examples of this. Tatsuya Nakadai, who portrayed Hidetora, was once again outstanding. This equals his role from Kagemusha, it was an emotive and poignant portrayal of a father who has been betrayed by his children. The battle scenes were masterful work, hundreds of extras in clan attire definitely filled up the screen with contrasting colours. The costume and production design were yet again wonderful to look at. I do love me the traditional Japanese environment that Kurosawa captures with ease. Lady Kaeda though, was the manifestation of evil...her manipulative skills were fascinating to watch. This leads me to my only problem, which is that none of the major characters are likeable, even Hidetora had issues. So I struggled to become emotionally invested in these characters. However, the purpose of this iteration was to explore themes of betrayal and insanity, Kurosawa conveyed them to technical perfection. Not a complete masterpiece, but extremely close to being one.",

It's crazy to see how conniving and corrupt the Great Lord's son becomes. Wow, amazing sequence when the warriors trap Hidetora and his men and then proceed to kill them. Really dark bet yet so elegant especially with the music in the background. \n\nI love how Hidetora looks like a goddamn ghost when he walk out. It's almost like is in fact a ghost. Amazing shot with the castle burning in the background and all the warriors. \n\nThat scene where Hidetora gets carried into a small house is amazing. When the man plays the flute, you can feel all the emotions and feelings he has towards the whole ordeal with Hidetora himself. It's played out brilliantly. The man in the house serves as a reminder to Hidetora of his not so friendly past. \n\nSeeing all those warriors on horseback cross that body of water full throttle is quite a sight to see. That Lady Kaede is probably the most viscous out of all of them. She don't fucking play no games. It's incredible to see the amount of extras Kurosawa used in this movie, he paid no expenses. I'm glad Lady Kaede's life ended that way. But what was more intersting was her reason behind why she did everything she did. It kind of makes you understand why she did what she did, and makes sense. That ending, wow, so much symbolism and metaphor. \n\nOverall, this movie is an amazing epic. It could easily be arranged into a play, and still be good. The acting and the story line are so gripping. The cinematography is beautiful. A lot of attention to detail was given. Especially with all the costumes, castle, set pieces, and locations. Seeing the good relationship they all had, the father and the sons, and then watching it all go to shit once the father relinquishes his power, is something I've never seen in a movie before. This movie is about revenge, avenging lost ones, family bonds, war, corruption, history, and even religion. And it all comes together elegantly and majestically.",

There is no question that Kurosawa is a phenomenon, and his films are all worthy of serious attention. 'Seven Samurai' is an absolute classic. 'Ran' is a good but not great film, though. Its strengths lie in its robust characterisation, philosophical insights into the human condition and in its superb retelling of the King Lear story. The actors are all top notch in spontaneity and vigour. The cinematography and colours are beautiful in the recently restored 4K version. But the direction and editing, in my opinion, are undisciplined. Most of the battle scenes are haphazard, repetitive and overlong (and the fake blood looks ridiculous), though the sense of peril in pre-CGI days is palpable at times. There are waaaay too many scenes of the increasingly mental Hidetora (a consistently intense Nakadai) wandering around woefully in wastelands with his loyal fool Kyoami (a girlish and watchable Pita).\nThere are some outstanding scenes of really gripping drama, especially when the psychotic seducer Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) is on-screen, and I enjoyed the stalwart, unflinching loyalty and integrity of men like Tango, Fujimaki and Kurogane. The film's themes are superb: irresponsibility, ambition, fidelity, authority, power, futility, sexuality, forgiveness, religion and many others besides. But it's hard to fully root for any of the characters and there is no real hero, as Hidetora himself is revealed progressively to have been a bit of a monster in his younger years. If the film was trimmed by at least 40 minutes to get it near the two hour mark, it would be touching greatness. Instead, it's incisiveness is lost in the flab of excess footage.",

Brilliantly shot, acted and directed, the film, not only boasts effective performances, but has stunning imagery, which adds so much to the film.  Fans of his work will definitely relish in the power that the film possesses. I much preferred Kurosawa's earlier work, but Ran is nonetheless a strong film that features all the trademarks that has made Kurosawa's work so good. With strong performances, and a simple, yet effective story, Ran is brilliant, poetic filmmaking that should be seen by any film buff. I really enjoy films that have simple ideas for storylines, and I find that the filmmaker is able to get much more depth out of an idea without overdoing anything, and the result is an impressive effort that ranks among the finest foreign films. Nonetheless, I still think that Seven Samurai was Akira Kurosawa's masterstroke of filmmaking. He has never topped it, but he always delivered thought provoking, epics that managed to be some of the finest films ever made. If you want a good action drama, then give this a viewing, it is a film going experience like no other, and it's one of the few foreign films that have stood the test of time. This is a film worth seeing, and it is enthralling experience from start to finish that will surely appeal to viewers looking for a film that has a simple idea, yet grand execution in style.

Just like \"Throne of Blood\", \"Ran\" easily engulfs me in a magical world of great enchantment, but this is a chaotic and cruel world. A world made of suffering where gods will not save Men from himself and where the thirst for power is the mirror of the natural struggle for survival, ethics and morality are subdued by the samurai conduct and interests of the powerful. Film of great symbolic significance, to watch \"Ran\" is like watching an epic and blazing Noh (form of Japanese classical theater) performance that reveals the true gist of human nature and existence. Tecnically superb work with countless memorable scenes, hauntingly beautiful soundtrack by Toru Takemitsu (whose work I highly appreciate), top-notch cinematography, camera work and acting, all in perfect harmony to create a deeply melancholic, beautiful and exciting universe. \"Ran\" is not without its shortcomings though. I may speak for a minority, but this would be a virtually perfect film in my eyes, if not for Kurosawa's maniac obsession with redundant battle scenes, especially in the last half hour or so (yet again, for what?!), some dragging moments ought to be chopped out with more insightful editing work to keep up with the standards of the rest of the film, enough is enough. And hard for me to believe that no life was lost during those crazy shoots. Fortunately, these distractions are relatively minor here, not as bad as in \"Kagemusha\", so it doesn't prevent \"Ran\" from becoming one of my favorite movies ever. The heartbreaking final scene also enters into my favorite list, perfect expression of how helpless we are in the world. Masterpiece from Kurosawa, highly recommended!",

From the royalty to the soldiers and even the peasants, each is just stunning to look at and I can only wonder what they would be like to wear.\nWhere this film loses me is in the large scale fight sequences. Kurosawa has demonstrated in previous films that he has a good eye for action and framing of action but it seems as though much of that is lost in Ran. Whether the camera is too close not giving much information or far away and stationary, when combined with the editing in the film, you can only help but wonder... were these the only shots available for the film? Where are the matching tracking shots, etc.? While removing these large fight sequences would have eliminated these problems, it might have made the film stale and truly would have taken away from the epic scope of everything. Such are the decisions of the artist.\nI do have to wonder, is this the film Kurosawa wanted to make, or the one he ended up making despite it not being exactly how he envisioned it. Still despite the minor grievances, Ran still brings forth a powerful film and viewers who don't nitpic as much as I, will likely find no fault in this epic of tales.",

It's a tour-de-force, the likes of which are never found on screens today, except in revival screenings. Kurosawa chose to re-envision Shakespeare's King Lear, but set it within feudal Japan. The story concerns Lord Hidetora, who being quite old decides to foolishly (but with the best intentions) divide up his lands amongst his three sons. He is betrayed by them as they turn their backs on him and go to war with each other over the territories and castles as Lord Hidetora slowly loses his mind. Beautifully photographed, well acted and entrenched with deep emotion, it's a major highlight in Kurosawa's illustrious film career. But then again, all of his films are major highlights.",

            "content": "Ran, director Akira Kurosawa's epic adaptation of William Shakespeare's King Lear, has the distinction of being one of the greatest and most powerful cinematic tragedies to ever grace the silver screen. Kurosawa had already demonstrated his ability to handle Shakespeare 30 years beforehand in his masterful version of Macbeth, Throne of Blood, but he had to wait until he was 75 to film Ran, a project he had long cherished. Criticized and neglected in his home country of Japan, old, lonely, near blind and suicidal, Kurosawa must have felt some sort of kingship with Lear and set out to bring Shakespeare's tale of greed, power and betrayal to ravishing cinematic life. He ended up making one of the supreme masterpieces of Japanese cinema; a bloody and nihilistic interpretation of Shakespeare's play that, although set in 16th century Japan, highlights the sorrowful state of the human condition in the Cold War era. Although Ran is without question the most devastating film ever about anything, with powerful performances and gorgeous photography, composition and art direction, it is endlessly watchable.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.hollywoodchicago.com/sites/default/files/Ran1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAging samurai warlord Hidetora Ichimonji announces his wish to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro and Saburo. The eldest two welcome their father's decision with false pledges of love, while Saburo believes his decision is insane, as he thinks the brothers will fight for control of the kingdom and end up destroying it. Shocked, Hidetora banishes Saburo in a rage, but his son's prophecy soon proves correct as his kingdom and family are torn apart by war, revenge and an insatiable thirst for power, driving the old lord to the darkest depths of madness. It is a sad end to a powerful life. The most expensive Japanese film ever made at the time, Ran was a colossal undertaking by Kurosawa that he handled with the assurance and vigor of a master at the top of his game. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design (which it won) and Best Direction, losing most to Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa. Only a modest success in 1985, Ran, with the passing of time, has come to be considered one of Kurosawa's finest works, both critically and popularly, and is perhaps the ultimate film adaptation of Shakespeare, arguably even surpassing the play it is based on.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/57/75057-004-BF0FF502.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nKurosawa's worldview became progressively bleaker and bleaker over the years, as his career plummeted, friends and family passed away and the world found itself on the brink of nuclear apocalypse. The death, isolation and utter hopelessness in the human spirit that so haunted the legendary director were manifested in this masterwork, in which he poured all his rage, nihilism and sadness. The haunting final shot of Tsurumaru standing atop the ruins of his family castle perfectly summarizes Kurosawa's feelings on the human condition: blind, fragile, alone and on the edge of oblivion. Ran is a film that shows us the brutal and destructive consequences of violence and the betrayal of family, and the folly of war, power and greed. It shows us a world that is doomed to suffer endless cycles of violence and death, and not even the heroic, the upright, the virtuous or the innocent are spared. This film is a plea for peace that urges the viewer to transcend his primitive nature and love his brother, or else be damned to a meaningless existence and a painful death.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://wird.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4e45ca36964d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe director's all encompassing cinematic vision constantly propels the film to new heights of cinematic power. This was Kurosawa's attempt to outdo himself, and he succeeds in all respects. Ran has a contemplative length, depth and grandeur that commands respect and demands our attention. He is never afraid to linger on a near motionless scene, and yet can encompass sweeping sequences of carefully choreographed action with equal panache. As expected, the epic massed battle scenes are superbly realized, and a silent massacre sequence set to Toru Takemitsu's music is one of cinema's most nightmarish. It is not surprising that Kurosawa storyboarded every single shot as paintings, as there is not a single shot that I couldn't hang up on my wall. The film is composed mostly in wide shots with no fast cutting and little camera movement, as if the film is from God's eye view as He looks sadly down on His children, who wage inexplicable war upon each other and think themselves all powerful. Kurosawa's use of the four elements is unrivaled, even by Tarkovsky, and the colors (predominantly red, blue and yellow) jump right off the screen. Truly a visual feast for the eyes!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.discuss.com.hk/d/attachments/day_130714/20130714_f88110142c2d819405afqj31x3538Ons.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe performances of Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada as Hidetora and Lady Kaede deserve special mention. As the old lord haunted by his violent past and in search of redemption, Nakadai gives what is arguably his best performance, while Harada gives exceptional power and conviction to one of the most memorable characters in film history. Translated into Chaos in English, Ran is Kurosawa's vision of a world on the brink of destruction, and a world that needs to change. It is a vision unparalleled in the history of cinema, and one that is still fully relevant. Ran is the triumphant final flourish of a master who overcame every obstacle and gave one last great gift to humanity, which of course failed to recognize it as the cinematic masterpiece that it was until years later. But a cinematic masterpiece it is, and certainly one of the most important ever made.

Ran is definitely one of his all-time greats, and it is quite an achievement not only because he made this film at the age of 75, but because it also pushes his greatness as a director to new heights even as time changed. Ran is easily one of the greatest film epics of all time, and I'll do my best to explain why this is so.\n\nWhen Lord Hidetora of the Ichimonji Clan's age begins to take a toll on him, he decides to step down from the throne and divide his castles among his three sons to rule over those particular territories. Taro gets First Castle and will become leader of the Ichimonji Clan, Jiro gets Second Castle, and Saburo will receive Third Castle, while Hidetora will retain his title, but remain mostly in the background of his sons' rule.\n\nWhen Lord Hidetora presents a lesson based on three arrows that can't be broken when together, his son, Saburo takes the arrows and breaks them, stating that the lesson means nothing and that such an alliance can be broken, and also stating that the sons will probably not remain loyal. After all, Hidetora himself used brutal methods to conquer his territories, and his sons have a high probability of following in his footsteps to gain sole control of the territories.\n\nUpon hearing this brutal honesty from Saburo and having suspicions of him, Hidetora banishes him, along with a servant named Tango who stands up for Saburo. Taro and Jiro still have their castles, which Hidetora remains in control of Third Castle.\n\nShortly after his decrees, Taro and his wife, Lady Kaede (Whose family used to rule over First Castle, but were savagely murdered by Hidetora and wants revenge) begin to plot to take control of the territories and take away Hidetora's title as Great Lord. Enraged by his son's offer, Hidetora leaves his castle and travels to Jiro's only to discover that Jiro is just fine with Taro's plan and has similar desires.\n\nHidetora leaves that castle as well and decides to take refuge at Third Castle, only to have it be attacked by forces from both Taro and Jiro who attempt to kill him and his forces. Hidetora escapes death, but is left to descend into madness in the wilderness as he is forced to live with bad decisions and misdeeds come back to haunt him.\n\nIn the midst of the battle, Taro is killed, leaving Jiro vying for control over the Ichimonji Clan and its territories, while also striking up an affair with Taro's scheming wife, Lady Kaede who uses him as a pawn for her own schemes through her seduction and beauty.\n\nNow, an all-out war threatens to tear apart his entire clan, and he is left with to go insane with only a few devotees in the wilderness to keep him company in his personal hell.\n\nThe story is a grand and magnificent tragedy with a deep story and rich characters. There are many layers contained within the plot and every bit of it is engaging and riveting to follow as the characters descend into their inevitable tragedies. There's betrayal, madness, seduction, murder, war, compassion, and many other themes to be found in the tremendous storyline that will give the viewer a lot to think about and process.\n\nThe acting for such a grand epic is stellar, especially Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora. Though I've only seen two other films of his where he had a major role (Harakiri, Kagemusha), once again he delivers a great performance like he did in those previous two films I've seen. However, the actors playing the three sons are also magnificent in their roles, as well as Mieko Harada as the manipulative and seductive Lady Kaede. This time, it wasn't just one actor who dominated, there were so many great performances that you can't help but admire.\n\nRan is a glorious epic filled with virtually everything anyone could ever want from a grand, epic tragedy. It's a riveting and deep film that will make its 160-minute running time feel like nothing because there is so much that it has to offer. If you love film epics, Ran is not something to miss.",

Now watching it on blu-ray (but with only a 32\" screen), setpieces, such as the brutal battle which leaves the castle in flames, are still pretty amazing.  True, its epic length could be a bit wearying and the plot operates well on a grand scale and not so sensitively on a smaller interpersonal scale.

It's always been a magnificent film but watching it on bluray was incredible. The format lends itself to Kurosawa's epic story beautifully. The cinematography and use of widescreen is breathtaking and the film has never looked so good. If you've never seen it, it's a Japanese retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear. Combined with Japanese lore the film tells of a ruler gone mad who abdicates his position to his eldest son and divides his land amongst all 3 sons. When one of them rejects the offer believing his father's whim to be out of insanity, he is banished. As the father sinks deeper into madness a power struggle begins between the other two brothers. It's a richly textured film, both visually and thematically. When it needs to be violent the blood is let brutally and when it needs to be tender the emotions are worn on it's sleeve. Many consider this to be Kurosawa's masterpeice and it definitely is amongst his best, but I personally think his next film, Dreams, was his best and most personal. Nevertheless as he was nearing the end of his career (and life), Ran still feels like a personal film. It is very much a statement about the nature of man and I can't help but feel that Kurosawa was disheartened by this. It is even spoken in the film that man seems more content being at war with each other that it wishes for peace. Ran is an epic film made all the more powerful on bluray.",

Kurosawa's brilliant epic is a powerful look at the insatiable lust for power that lurks in the hearts of men. How congeniality can turn to savagery at the slightest hint of gain. \nAlso, and what I think is his most effective message of the film: We as a people lie, cheat, steal, and in some instances murder, yet expect the world to be fair to us in return. \nLike all Kurosawa films, he loves using nature to reflect what is happening in the story. As the family bonds being to fray, he often cuts to ominous clouds descending upon the castle. When the father realizes that he is no longer welcome in his kingdom, we get a close up of the sun and the sweat beading on his brow. These are just classic Kurosawa staples that are done beautifully here. While I was expecting this focus on nature, I was not however prepared for how graphic the film would be.\nThere are extended gory battle sequences that frankly were very shocking to me. I have nothing against violence, I just haven't seen Kurosawa tackle it with such intensity. Although it is arresting, it is very fitting to the film as Kurosawa shows that these aren't men engaged in acts of valor, this is wanton violence brought on by greed. The music that plays over it isn't triumphant, it is of something lost. At the tender age of 75, you would think he wouldn't want to dabble in such brutality. But I guess 75 is as good as age as any to show some good old-fashion double suicides. \nWhile there is a lot to chew on, I think that if Kurosawa wants you to walk away with one message, it is to never give up power, especially to your rotten kids.",

Tatsuya Nakadai gives a masterful performance as a once fierce and now shell-shocked old emperor. He is surrounded by a terrific cast. Kurosawa's vision however must ultimately be applauded for managing to show us just how gruesome the Bard's tale is; through the gore and violence, which make Tarantino's films look PG, teaching us the same lessons about war which Shakespeare wanted to teach us.

To me, from head to toe, this Kurosawa's picture which symbolizes downfall is absolute stunning - such gorgeousness in a film is utterly rare, and of course, it is one of the Kurosawa's many best films. Ran is a success - having nominated for Academy Awards for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design and best direction and won one. Ran was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.\r\n\r\nI repeat this - Ran, from head to toe, is absolutely stunning, and of course this movie is perfect. The film's cinematography, which is top notch, is a killer. The way Kurosawa captured the images of burning castle, a moving horses, dead soldiers, battle scenes are all undeniably respectable, and sublime too, and one great example would be the scenes where the attack of the third castle  was occurring. Very much in evidence that Kurosawa's talent in film-making is transcending. The film's script which was being written by Kurosawa himself, Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide is yet admirable. The exploitation on poetic lines are proven to be effective and fitting for the movie.\r\n\r\nOne would see great performances in Ran. Good acting by the players, but to me, the two actors who stood up above the rest are Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada. Tatsuya Nakadai plays the great lord Tatsuya Nakadai. The great lord is old, fragile and somewhat defenseless and the character is well characterized by him. Mieko Harada plays a female villain Lady Kaede, whose character is hungry for revenge. Her amazing performance which is raw and gripping, plays a very important part for the success of the movie.\r\n\r\nSurely there are several movie elements which are worthy to be carried out for discussions, but to me, the main highlight of Ran is its cinematography, and it is one hell of a show.\r\n\r\n[10/10]",

When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying. She is nearly a carbon copy of the woman who played the wife of Mifune's Macbeth character in \"Throne of Blood.\" I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon and am convinced that this may be his finest work.",

If Kurosawa's main intention with this movie was to honestly show Ichimonji's demise of the mind, he's succeeded in a way that can only be seen to prove it.  What this means to the viewer is that you will feel completely worn out and like shit when it's over.

            "content": "I came to this without having seen any of Kurosawa's films (Seven Samurai and Rashomon most significantly so) and was surprised by many elements. I didn't expect this film to be so theatrical, even down to the make-up which seemed more theatrical than usual for naturalistic cinema. I do wonder if maybe Kurosawa in his later period was delicate to Japanese criticisms that he was too \"western\" in his technique, and wanted to give it more of a Japanese feel; or perhaps he was deliberately paying tribute to the theatrical origin of the story. Even so, this is certainly a great movie, epic in range and with a huge emotional impact. \r\n\r\n\"Ran\" is basically an updating of Shakespeare's King Lear; the film sees the elderly Lord Hidetora Ichimonji deciding to hand over the reins of power to his three sons. His eldest, Taro, becomes the new Lord, while his younger sons Jiro and Saburo are each granted a province of their own to rule over. Saburo however protests, believing it to be a foolish decision that will split the clan and Hidetora banishes his third son. It isn't long however until Taro and Jiro's ambitions of power lead them to betray their father and the nation begins to fall apart, spurred on by Taro's manipulating wife lady Kaede.\r\n\r\nKurosawa thus blends Shakespearean tragedy with a sweeping historical epic about the loss and gain of power. At the center of it all is a remarkable acting presence in the shape of Tatsuya Nakadai as the displaced elderly Samurai. At the beginning of the film he is a man of stubborn pride, but as his world crumbles and his people die, he soon finds himself with nowhere else to go. The emotional turbulence of being betrayed by his own flesh and blood drives him to his limits, but nevertheless he still refuses to contact Saburo because his warrior principles will not allow him. There seems to be a definite element of Kurosawa himself up there on screen, the director having been near the end of his career with his health failing and his wife having tragically passed away during shooting. Hidetora isn't a perfect ruler but as evidence of his cruelty and oppression during his reign mount up, he remains a sympathetic character, questioning his past decisions and what exactly it is he has achieved in his lifetime. He is the pillar that holds the film together and no mistake. He is aided by some impressive performances all round. Daisuke Ryo's impetuous, outspoken but loyal Saburo is a highpoint of course even if his screen time is limited, spending the majority of the storyline in exile. Jinpachi Nezu's Jiro is another remarkable presence, equally proud and stubborn as his father but beset by insecurities and mistrust. Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede is the film's most hated rouge; her performance is spot on as Kaede is a cold, calculating woman with vengeance on her mind at the best of times, during one pivotal scene towards the middle, she explodes with one dramatic emotional outburst to another, ranting, screaming and licking blood from a knife wound.\r\n\r\nThe battle scene that forms the centerpiece is absolutely breathtaking, with legions of Samurai warriors storming a castle in total silence. There are no sound effects, no speech, just the sad musical overture for the majority of the fighting, until a particularly important gunshot rings out and we are plunged right into the maelstrom. Bodies are filled with arrows, blood drips everywhere and hundreds of warriors are slaughtered in spectacular fashion. It may be a glorious sight to behold, but it is the closest thing a historical epic has got to show that war is hell, no matter what period of human history it is set in. The more blood thirsty among us may then be disappointed by the second clash towards the end, a far more unremarkable skirmish that promised to be incredible after several scenes of armies maneuvering in anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Ran doesn't end at its visuals though. There is a fantastic narrative within these vivid and colorful vistas. It is a very slow paced film that dwells on certain scenes for a very long time, yet never overbearingly long. The story itself is fairly complex, as would be expected from such a grand scheme of a picture, yet as long as you stay with it, it is an incredible story with a great deal of subtext and underlying themes that serve to give it an even greater purpose as a revolutionary film. With any epic film like this you'd expect it to cover a lot of proverbial and existential ground and it certainly does. We see everything from the themes of close family bonds and loyalties, to the traumatic effects of war on the human mind and soul. Ran is a dramatic tragedy of lost innocence and peace. It is a harrowing look at the destruction of family and kingdom. Yet, despite these bleak themes, it still manages to be a stunningly beautiful film. This beauty serves to drive home the emotional impact of the film, engraving some very gripping images into your mind.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Ran is an artistic masterpiece of such beauty and grandeur, that it can put one in an immense state of awe and wonder. It may seem theatrical at times, but like a watercolor painting that moves, it is beautiful to watch time and time again. \r\n\r\nStory: B+\r\nActing: B+\r\nDirection: B\r\nVisuals: A\r\nOverall: B\r\n\r\n*** out of 4 stars",

Another stunning film, it's a sharp contrast to his earlier black and white films with stark, gritty cinematography. Ran is shot in colour with lots of bright reds, yellows and blue's to help give the film a unique, artistic look, more of an achievement when you consider that Kurosawa was almost completely blind when he directed it.

Nakadai is good (lots of the performances are way over the top, however, but you come to expect this from Japanese films), but everything else is lacking; the camera shots and action scenes are so stolid that I keep feeling like we were watching one of those fake reenactment battles some people do for hobbies - the setting literally just looked like they'd picked the nearest field (the 'castles' and such that they used were great, however). Costume design, etc. is great, but you can't call a film good just for that. The whole film focuses on shaming this old Lord and his horrible, power-grabbing sons. There's little to no story development and structure - certainly not worthy of what I have seen in other Kurosawa films anyway. It's a real shame for me that I didn't like this.

            "content": "King Lear remake or Akira Kurosawa biopic? Maybe both, and either way, it's the most entertaining, engrossing, and engaging Shakespeare that I've ever seen, and a completely believeable allegory for a life of mistakes regretted.\r\n\r\nThe story of King Lear is well known: an ageing king divides his kingdom between two fawning daughters and excommunicates the third who dares to tell the truth. In time, he lives to regret his decision, discovering during a descent into madness that, to paraphrase Junius, the subject who is truly loyal to the chief magistrate does not flatter.\r\n\r\nAs a piece of cinema, it's hard to fault Ran. Although the near-3 hour running time seems daunting, the telling of the story rarely drags. Where Shakespeare sometimes loses you in a barrage of Dukes and Earls of various bits of England and navel-gazing soliloquies, Kurosawa's streamlined Lear keeps us focussed on the matter at hand and the key players. The addition of the viscerally evil Kaede (or is she?), while sure to disappoint Lear purists, adds complexity beyond pure greed as motivation for the villains. The scenery and visuals are stunning, from the castles (ruined or not), to the Japanese mountain-scape, to the desert. The score is well judged, never intrusive and never sounding a wrong note.\r\n\r\nThe acting too is faultless. The minor characters are rich and complex, struggling with their decisions, balancing loyalty and honour, greed and lust; never one-dimensional, never purely detestable nor loveable. And Hidetora (Lear) himself is a simply stunningly brilliant portrayal of madness - madness that comes from realizing that his own miserable fate is entirely of his own making. To err is human; to realize that your error has cost you everything you love is the road to madness, and the portrayal here is entirely convincing.\r\n\r\nSo is it Lear? Not in any conventional sense. But stripped of the arcane language, transposed to a different place, and with subtle tweaks to motivation and morality, this is the most accessible Lear I've ever experienced; I truly felt that I understood the point of the play after I saw Ran in a way that a straight reading or literalist film adaptation won't achieve. And is it a biopic? If so, perhaps we can understand the tortured soul of Kurosawa a little better through this, surely his masterwork.",

The film follows a family of samurais who vye for being their father's favourite, and unfortunately, the consequences are bloody, brutal, fiery, and highly disturbing. Wars galore in this film. The three previous films I have seen under Japanese master's direction were all from the 1950's, the latest being the masterpiece \"The Seven Samurai.\" Kurosawa is not afraid to show bloodshed here in abosolutely excessive matters, perhaps as much as Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch.\" He is also not afraid of taking colour to his advantage, exposing the gorgeous set pieces and scenery within this feature film. \"Ran\" is another great work under Akira Kurosawa.\r\n\r\nOne other note I would like to make is the father in the film. He is allegidly controlled by spirits and although, perhaps there is more to it than that. I believe, because of his age, he may have gone totally senial, sparking utter insanity. He does act really crazy in the film and he passes the effects of his weak mentality onto his sons and the kingdom, resulting in disaster. Kurosawa does a fine job showing the father's craziness, as well as casting actors in terrific performances.",

Do I love Akira films??? Yes I do and I have watched them over and over, this movie about the struggle of power and of course Kurosawa is very crone to Shakespeare that's how he made this movie all on his work but a more of our Japanese style to it. I remember when I first watched this and that was like years ago I didn't really like the film back then but today, this is one of my favourite epics ever. \r\n\r\nI read somewhere that Akira Kurosawa painted everything before he under took the movie and he get the idea from Lucio Fulci from his masterpiece The Beyond. The way Fucli painted the powerful images of hell and then took them to the screen with the films ending climax with the two Americans in an atheist vision of hell. As well as the croned haunted hell house. I just admire Kurosawa's visions of this epic with the burning of the 3rd castle that was just amazing.\r\n\r\nA story of greed, a lust for power, and ultimate revenge. The Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji has decided to step aside to make room for the younger blood of his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo, the Lord's only wish now being to live out his years as an honored guest in the castle of each of his sons in turn. While the older two sons flatter their father, the youngest son attempts to warn him of the folly of expecting the three sons to remain united; enraged at the younger son's attempt to point out the danger, the father banishes him. True to the younger son's warning, however, the oldest Son soon conspires with the second son to strip The Great Lord of everything, even his title. \r\n\r\nI admire the films themes of \r\n\r\nWarfare: Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.\r\n\r\nChaos: The ultimate example of chaos is the absence of gods. When Hidetora sees Lady Sue, a devout Buddhist and the most religious character in the film, he tells her, Buddha is gone from this miserable world. Sue, despite her belief in love and forgiveness, eventually has her head cut off. When Kyoami claims that the gods either do not exist or are the cause of human suffering, Tango responds, the gods can't save us from ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd of course there are powerful themes of Power, Greed and Nihilism.\r\n\r\nEven though it may not appear so it is based on the struggle of King Lear, well not entirely directed towards or near it I see the similarities or the two stories and how it was based on it. I read the book once upon a time and it was just beautiful to know were he got inspiration besides overusing Shakespeare. (Not in a bad way at all).\r\n\r\nThe acting style is very strange and controversial. It's rather more body language and the way people reflect on there situation. It's mainly influenced by Noh theatre, it also more body language as I have sated and the distraction of silences that goes into that scene. Not just focusing on the scenery and what is happening to this struggle. Noh aspects of these two characters emphasize their ruthless, passionate, and single minded natures.\r\n\r\nI really liked the way with the camera instead of the simple one camera stands there and...Take done. No he uses more of the old technique and advances more on Long shots to catch the beauty of that scene and what is in view of it, such as the people and the building as well as catching there responses to that action. As well as the arrow hitting the man and the peoples reaction to the perpetrator doing so.\r\n\r\nI really liked the costume designs they took more then two years to make all of them by hand and for every lead and every extra and done so with such creative talent it's not just the leads that get the best it's all of them. I really liked the aspect of course with all the detail put into it, It's not today you see these sort of things anymore. So overall it was worthy of its Oscar for best costume design and I can think of a million other categories it should have won. \r\n\r\nThe sets are just breathing again Akira spent years painting everything to his likening and everything had to be right down to every detail. The burning of the 3rd castle was just incredible no miniatures no computer generated imagery...No. Everything was burned to the ground in the order that it should and every actor or extra needed to know what they were doing. And its not just sets its scenery I remember the scene with the filed of gold they just went for miles and she was walking throw it like nothing because she was no greedy man.\r\n\r\nI think by the end every man, women, child needs to view this epic masterpiece.\r\n\r\nKeiko's score 100%",

The movie itself is huge in its scope and bleak vision. It is not simply a remake of Lear although it clearly owes a lot to Shakespeare. I thought the best scene was the seduction of Jiro (second son) by Lady Kaede, the recent widow of Taro (first son). The scene owes more to Richard III than Lear but with the twist that it is the woman doing the forced seduction. I was reminded of Richard's famous speech:\r\n    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?\r\n    Was ever woman in this humour won?\r\nThe movie grinds on to its inevitable tragic end. There are wonderful, if slightly overblown, scenes of samurai warfare. I was somewhat puzzled by the use of firearms but research showed that by the time of Mori Motonari (the most likely model for Lord Hidetora) firearms would have been recently introduced to Japan.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy movie to respect. A hard movie to love. It has none of the endearing self deprecating humour of Seven Samurai. But it is a film great.",

Throne of Blood is dark and menacing as is Peter Brook's  version of King Lear. Kurosawa's Lear seems so fragile as he shuttles between the conquests he's just bequeathed to his sons. The grandeur of the scenery and costumes doesn't mask his vulnerability.

Both starred Nakadai, who is perhaps my favorite Japanese actor. But in Kagemusha, Nakadai had humor to give his character redeeming qualities. Here he has nothing but maniacal redemption, resentment and a desire for absolution. And all of these come after he is punished for his greed. I do have a slight problem with the battle scenes, I had wished they were more...battle-y but they weren't bad. The blood and gore worked well and came out as shocking. \r\n\r\nRan did perhaps contain one of the most well deserved and bloody beheadings in film history though. I don't want to heap praise onto this film just because the consensus is to do so. I think I prefer kurosawa in black and white and he has made quite a few movies better than this one.

            "content": "Well. This movie scares the fuck out of me. As if Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" wasn't brutal enough, the world famous Akira Kurosawa, a man known for making depressing and violent movies has tackled this tragedy.\r\n\r\nRan, based on King Lear, is about an aged warlord who passes on his land and rule to his sons. But his youngest son rejects his offer because of his belief that his father's violent and bloody past has affected the minds and fates of his family. And how right he is. From then on the story is all about greed, trechory, murder, and the father's descent into madness. Though there are many changes and the story is more simplified compared to King Lear, it does not hurt the movie at all. Kurosawa's vision of King Lear in an Ancient Japan setting gives the story a new respectable look. This movie not only hightens the feelings and lessons of King Lear, but Kurosawa's also focuses on a \"godlessness\" theme which becomes incredably horrifying. \r\n\r\nAkira Kurosawa is one of, if not, the greatest film director of all time. And he gives it his all in this movie. With a greater budget than his other films, everything in this movie is perfect. Unbelievable costumes details, fantastic makeup, chilling music score, and not to mention the movie's achitecture and sets, one tower which was built just for the purpose of burning it down. That's commitment. All combined with Kurosawa's years of filmmeking knowledge to make this movie an epic like no other. And not to mention the wonderful and haunting preformances, especially from the ones who played the scary Lord Hidetora and the femme fetal Lady Kaede.\r\n\r\nKurosawa's inspiration knows no bounds for he is the one who created modern cinema. With his representation of the world in his films, he not only opened new bounds in storytelling to touch, but new ways to show them. Though Ran is one of his latest, it is still just as impressive as any other of his films and a must see for movie buffs.",

The performances, particularly Nakadai's decimated Lord Ichimonji and Meiko Harada's ominous, spidery Lady Kaede, are beyond criticism, and the photography is likely the most sumptuous I have ever seen (approached, in my mind, only by Kubrick's Barry Lyndon).

Some of the things that are done in this movie probably couldn't even have been done as effectively with CG (which is what the modern film maker would have resorted to). This movie trots itself around the screen as a prize visual masterpiece. Let's face it - it's a moving work of art. \n\nThe acting in this movie is also pretty fucking good - as much so as you can expect from Tatsuya Nakadai. I cringed a little bit when I saw the ridiculous over acting of Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede) but maybe that's just me. \n\nAnother thing that fits with the aesthetic quality of this movie is the fact that the score was written by Toru Takemitsu - the product does not disappoint the name. \n\nNow time for the bad part. As we all know, 'Ran' is an appropriation of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' - which is a good play in its own right. And to the credit of Ran, it does a wonderful job of translating that play in to its own cultural context whilst retaining its own identity as a story. \n\nThe one thing that this story keeps which I wish it wouldn't is Shakespeare's story structure. The ridiculous and meticulous and numerous folds of narrative that is a Shakespearean play does not translate as well as one would hope to the big screen. Perhaps it is because the modern audience doesn't feel it has the time for 20 different archs to unfold which a simultaneous circular narrative is in place - We love Shakespeare because he is a genius and because his stuff is flat out impressive. We don't love Shakespeare because his stuff makes for bland appropriations and re-interpretations. \n\nWhat this movie needed was the inspiration of Shakespeare and the sweetness of Akira Kurosawa (who is a modern Shakespeare in his own right) - we do not see that sweetness in 'Ran'.\n\nBUT - if you can stomach a 2h 40m spiral in to depression, then enjoy this otherwise masterful work.",

            "content": "In my opinion Ran is Kurosawa's masterpiece and one of the best films ever made.  It is also one of my top 5 favourite films and will probably be for a long time. \r\n\r\nIt is one of the rare films that succeeds in every possible way and watching it is a very powerful experience. Ran works equally well as a family drama, a period piece, an anti-war film, there are elements of comedy, romance and revenge. For me it is the definition of an Epic film. \r\n\r\nRan means Chaos, it is loosely based on Shakespeare's play King Lear, an ageing warlord named Hidetora Ichimonji retires and divides his kingdom between his three sons Taro, Jiro and Saburo. Chaos, War and Tragedy ensue. \r\n\r\nWith this film Kurosawa proves to have been one of the greatest film makers to have lived, but he also proves to be an exceptional artist, this film is a work of art. \r\n\r\nThe direction and cinematography are exceptional and astounding, every single shot is flawless, the colours are vibrant and powerful, the locations are breathtaking, the editing is very smooth, almost imperceptible. I liked the way he filmed the action sequences, he stays quite aloof from the action instead of getting up too close as is the trend these days, thus it has more of an impact and is much more comprehensible. \r\nKurosawa spent 10 years painting each shot of this film before even beginning filming, and it shows. I don't think such a beautiful film has ever been made or will ever be made again. \r\nThe scale of it all is beyond belief; he built the Third Castle on the slopes of Mount Fiji only to burn it down in one of the finest scenes in the film. He ordered thousands of suits of armour, weapons and horses, He used over 1,400 extras.  The film cost the equivalent of 12 million dollars, it was the most expensive Japanese film to be made at the time. \r\nSeveral scenes stand out throughout the film but I would say the most brilliant is the attack on the Third Castle, such a powerful scene that shows the horrors of war better than any modern war film. Hidetora's descent into insanity during that horrific scene is amazing to watch and his silent walk away from the burning castle is haunting. \r\nOther scenes that really amazed me were the whole battle scenes between Jiro's forces and Saburo's, the scene in Tsurumaru's hovel and the final shot. \r\n\r\nThe acting was brilliant from the whole cast, I can't think of any one actor who diminished the brilliance of the film, on the contrary they enhanced it especially Tatsuya Nakadai who plays the Warlord Hiderota and whose performance is crucial to the film as well as being one of the best I've seen. The whole cast really became their characters and seemed at perfect ease in the time they were depicting, probably because of the excellent costume design. \r\n\r\nThe characters were all well developed and all had a purpose, I think a lot of work was put into them. Even those will smaller roles were interesting, but there are some who are fascinating to watch, such as Hidetora, his change throughout the film is quite remarkable, he goes from being a rather proud, pompous unlikeable man to a man who has lost his mind to a man who has discovered himself and wants forgiveness for his sins. Another character that is interesting to watch is the \"fool\" Kyoami who at first seems rather insignificant but later becomes one of the main characters and is very important for his role in the events that take place. \r\nI liked the fact that each character was easily identifiable, on previous Kurosawa films I have sometimes been confused to who some characters were exactly, but in Ran it\u0092s much clearer. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is interesting, I can't say I like it but I don't really think it was meant to be enjoyable or even likeable. I think it evokes the main theme of the film which is Chaos perfectly so in my opinion it succeeds at what it was intended for. \r\n\r\nWell I think I\u0092ve said enough about the technical aspects of the film and the various qualities, so I think I\u0092ll say a bit about the themes and the overall message of the film which is very important. \r\n\r\nOne theme that is ever present and mostly quite dominant is that of Chaos, the events are chaotic and unpredictable; often moments of calm are quickly destroyed by moments of violence all of which are sudden.  \r\nThe absence of religion is also a sign of the Chaos, the only religious character is Lady Sue and her fate is tragic, when the fool Kyoami curses the gods Tango replies that the gods cannot save them from themselves. The gods play no part in this film, it only shows the cruelty of man. \r\n\r\nThe strong theme of nihilism is present especially towards the end, Saburo\u0092s death just as victory was attained, the murder of lady Sue just when you thought the bloodshed was over, the fate of Tsurumaru... \r\n\r\nI thought the way Kurosawa used Tsurumaru standing alone and blind on top of a ruined castle with an image of Buddha that he dropped lying in the darkness to be very powerful and very clear; Kurosawa was showing modern mans condition. \r\n\r\nThe way good characters are slain pointlessly such as Saburo and Lady Sue and the way evil characters continue to do their evil deeds until they meet violent ends such as Jiro and Lady Kaede is quite depressing, Ran is easily one of Kurosawa\u0092s darker works, it doesn\u0092t contain such deeds of heroism as the Seven Samourai, instead heroic men are treacherously gunned down by faceless enemies. \r\n\r\nKurosawa made this film at a very difficult period of his life, he was going blind, he had attempted suicide and his wife died during production. But he continued work relentlessly and ended up with one of the finest and most powerful films ever made, and I admire him greatly for that.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u0092t seen this film then delay no longer, it is essential viewing although grim and dark in tone it will not leave you unaffected. But if you are like the people I have seen give bad reviews to this film because it was too long or too boring then I suggest you stay away from it and be content with latest Hollywood Blockbuster.",

Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master director. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty..

After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theater.\nColorful clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene, and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?\nThe Acting in this film was powerful and superb. The colorized version of this film was really applied to this one than Kurosawa's previous works to make the scenery and shots look realistic as they were in a Shakespearean version tragedy.\nWhile Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen. This one has more story and makes you serious on what's going on with these family about themselves. Just stick with it and you'll never forget this masterpiece of Kurosawa.",

            "content": "Ran could have been a victory lap. In 1950 Akira Kurosawa turned the conventions of film narrative on their ear with Rashomon, a film so unlike anything before it that Kurosawa's producers and actors insisted it didn't make sense (it did), and in 1954 he made The Seven Samurai which is not only the most influential action/adventure movie of all time, but is one of the 4 or 5 best movies ever made by anyone. With a handful of other classics thrown in for good measure (Ikiru, Throne of Blood, Yojimbo), Kurosawa's place as one of the masters of cinema is undeniable. By 1985, he had absolutely nothing to prove, except maybe to himself.\r\n\r\nBy the late 60s Kurosawa's native Japan had turned on him, declaring that his style had become too westernized and he was essentially banished from the Japanese studio system. He was signed to work on his first American film in 1970, but was fired by 20th Century Fox. He attempted suicide, his eyesight was going, and nobody wanted to finance his films. To make things worse, at the ripe age of 65, Kurosawa had his biggest idea yet, a massive adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear set amongst the warlords of 15th century Japan. He spent ten years storyboarding the shots for the film he would call Run (which translates to chaos or revolt), designing the costumes, and most importantly, trying to rustle up the money to make what would eventually be the most expensive production in Japanese history. After this decade of preparation, he would team with French film producer Serge Silberman, and Ran would finally get off the ground. \r\n\r\nLike Lear, Ran begins with a man dividing his land among his children. Lord Hidetora has spent his whole life taking over all the land he could see, and killing everyone who stood in his way. Now, in his 70s he has given his land to his three sons in hopes that this will allow him to live his remaining years in peace. What he's actually done, is given everybody access to an army. This is Kurosawa's bleakest film, a sense of dread hangs over all the proceedings. This may also be Kurosawa's deepest work thematically: madness, honor, death, war, sex, God, and family are all within the auteur's wide grasp.\r\n\r\nVisually, Kurosawa has few equals. He fills every inch of the frame with his unique mixture of authenticity and artistry. It's not just the cinematography, which is of course exhilarating, it's the production design, the costumes, the make up. Ran is a complete visual experience. Kurosawa's battle scenes are a reminder of just how poorly most battle scenes are filmed. Instead of obsessing over trying to make the audience feel like we're in the middle of the action (which we never really will anyway) Kurosawa pulls back and let's us see the whole gruesome spectacle. The majesty, the violence, the hatred.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out about Ran for me, as it does for all Kurosawa's work, is his purity as a storyteller. He's the undeniable master of the cinematic epic (David Lean is #2 and then it's a long way down to #3), and you can't make films with the weight and length that he does without perfect pacing. A Kurosawa film is never rushed, never hectic, but also never boring and never lethargic. He always moves at just the right speed, and for the life of me I can't point out an example of this aspect of his genius. So, how did he do it? Why did his films move so much more smoothly then other filmmakers? It must come from inside of him. No, tricks, no techniques, this is the only way he knew how to tell a story. He probably never even thought about it, and that is the sign of a great filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRan is brilliant in every way a film can be brilliant. It strikes us in our hearts, our heads, and our eyes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the philosophy that Kurosawa so tastefully sprinkled through all of his movies. His films were always full of interesting questions, and in Ran he poses one of his toughest. Is God somehow permissive of human atrocity or having created human beings is He Himself powerless to stop us?",

Methodical and purposeful, the film is a mix of political intrigue and philosophical observations that will reel you in for an unforgettable and blistering 162 minute ride. \r\n\r\nFrom the opening moments, I knew I was in for something special.  The memorable cinematic moments just kept coming, scene after scene, frame after frame.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a partial myth that Kurisawa had King Lear in mind during development of Ran, Shakespearean elements are nonetheless present.   Key characters are evident, but they are supplemented by secondary characters who have a forceful and memorable impact on the story.  Kurisawa also injects a fool, or jester, who provides continuous insight, musings, and commentary on the madness that surrounds him.\r\n\r\nSome may have issues with the subtitles, and discerning who's who in the various personal conflicts and armed battles.  A generous and strategic utilization of rewind may be in order.  Other than these occasional confusions that rear their head, Ran is a masterpiece of the highest order.",

Entering the battle late seeing only the aftermath of the destruction and the removal of all sound except the soundtrack, created a dismal hellish atmosphere. Brining across the true chaos and destruction of war. It is as innovative as when Kurosawa invented the slow motion death in Seven Samurai. As the film went on the hell of war became worse and worse.  Ending with almost every character dead, and a final image of the Lord Buddha.

Kurosawa does an excellent job once again with the cinematography. Yet, in my opinion, its not one of Kurosawa's best works.All of the characters with the exception of Saburo were rotten to the core acting entirely out of self-interest. While such a characterization may have been part of the message Kurosawa sought to get through, I found it difficult to truly accept the almost exaggerated egotism of many of the characters.

A companion piece, as it were, to three previous Kurosawa films, \"Seven Samurai\", \"Throne of Blood\", and \"Kagemusha\", but \"Ran\" stands alone as the pessimistic, apocalyptic vision of a master filmmaker who feels his time may be near, and though he'd still make films for another eight years, this is the film that effectively sums up his career, both glorious, difficult, and overwhelmingly dark, a devastating portrait of human frailty, greed, and betrayal at it's bleakest.
