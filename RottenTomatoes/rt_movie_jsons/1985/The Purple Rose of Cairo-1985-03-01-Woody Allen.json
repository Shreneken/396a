To assuage her loneliness, Cecilia escapes to the picture show and becomes transfixed with the movie \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" and especially with its lead character, archeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). When Tom literally steps off of the screen and into her life, both realities are thrown into chaos.",

            "content": "another one of the great Woody Allen's earliest works Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, and James Aiello along with several other players it's the 1930's in New Jersey and the biggest movie called 'Purple Rose of Cairo' is playing at the Jewel theater Farrow is Cecilia, married and waiting tables at a diner trying to salvage what's become of the Great Depression her husband, Monk is less attentive and prefers to spend his time with his male buddies Cecilia decides to go to a screening of the film and something miraculous happens....the main character Tom Baxter played by Daniels actually steps outside of the movie! Yes, you heard that right his character actually comes into our real world turns out he's sick of doing the same thing all the time even if it's scripted, he wants to find true love and happyness the object of his affection is Cecilia yet she can't fathom why he would be interested in someone like her the truth is though she doesn't want to admit she's unhappy but Baxter constantly wants her to open her eyes as well as her heart it's unbelievable something like this can actually happen yet for everyone else it's causing a lot of chaos particularly for the actor that played Baxter in the actual film this film not only has excellent actors but a wonderful gem of a premise, I didn't expect this from Woody Allen at all he manages to blend a fantasy element with a romance and genuine comedy plus there's great intellectual discussions about what makes us very happy, content, loved etc. some say you can't find consistency in real-life, some say you have to, the real world doesn't work like the movies but it can play like one, some characters are so well-conceived that they become real, some want fiction to be real others just prefer the opposite, the most human of all attributes is making a choice gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by the way Woody Allen handled this one with the time period, the sharp acting, the clever story, and the wakeup call we all need 'Purple Rose of Cairo' is a remarkable gem in itself",

            "content": "This is not just a film, it transcends the realm of regular film and moves into a masterclass of its own going above and beyond the ordinary. This is a film i have adored and cherished for a very long time and just now realized that i had not rated it. I was in a state of mortification and amended that error at once. This glimmering cinematic jewel needs to be seen by anyone who truly and sincerely loves the art form we call cinema. The soul, the inventiveness, the beguiling charm, the cinematic artistry and wit of this masterpiece are light years ahead of nearly every film i have seen. It is the most personal film i have had the pleasure of viewing for the sheer fact that it is a film lovers movie and eloquently shows us why we love film, or should i say why i love film because i felt a connection so personal and profound. The escapist enchantment of film in a situation of true zaniness is captured here in The Purple Rose of Cairo. The fantasy, a fantasy many of us have had about film characters coming to life, the stark contrast of the charm and magic of the silver screen and the harsh cold reality so deftly portrayed. The hardships and three dimensions of life, the choices we make and their consequences, the acceptance/facing of reality and the hard truths and ironies this life presents form just some of the philosophical depth this breathtaking gem of cinema possesses. It goes above and beyond that by demonstrating that we are in charge of our destinies and sometimes all we will have is ourselves and no one will rescue us but ourselves. It gets satirical and comedic and strange and just becomes a pure pleasure to behold. The seamless coming together of comedy, sweeping romance, charm, fairy tale enchantment, bittersweet and sometimes sour truths and the pure celebration of the personal effect movies can have on people who are hurting exemplify the enchantment that such art, such film, can infuse into peoples lives. The masterful direction, the down trodden and heartbreaking heroine so perfectly and beautifully portrayed by the iconic Mia Farrow and the period setting together with this astounding screenplay make this film an event like no other.",

The plot is so silly yet works so well and played in just the right tone. Where fiction and reality blend which is basically where Woody is the strongest.

This is one of the greatest movies ever made and it's easily Woody Allen's best movie. The movie is more than a comedy, it is a poignant story featuring some of the best acting I've ever encountered in a Hollywood movie. There is nothing that I can say of a negative nature about this movie. It is as if Woody Allen reached deep down into the depths of his creative process to create this marvelous work of art. This movie could have easily become just another goofy piece of Hollywood corn, but Woody Allen invested this movie with a special quality that transformed it to a sublime work of art. This movie deserves all the praise it has received and Woody Allen must be given the credit for making what is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece.",

I am not a film major so for me this movie was a real treat to watch and I watched it with someone who knows a thing or two about good films. Correction this person has years and years of experience in all aspects of film making. From makeup to writing. His short stories will be best sellers... A very intriguing experience. I could not stop laughing...even at the parts that were beyond my comprehension or level of understanding. That is another reason why I liked it. Mia Farrow's choice was obvious...It was hilarious how the characters in the movie of the film all suddenly fell unimportant once that cast member went out of the picture. The \u2018fading out\u2019 seen was funny. I want to see more Woody Allen movies because I have no judgments about the way he has conducted his life. Art is art. Art is art but good art raises questions and gives the viewer (in the case of films) something...something to think about, something to talk about, something to debate about (my favorite activity).",

Even those who don't like Woody Allen may find that they might enjoy the film. With the luminous photography showing off the equally striking locations, The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of Allen's most visually stunning films, perhaps second to Manhattan. The music is memorable and understated, having a presence while not being overbearing. Allen's direction is more sympathetic than usual but every bit as thoughtful and assured, there is no signs of self-indulgence. The Purple Rose of Cairo has a truly wonderful script as well, there is the smart and witty touch that has Woody Allen all over it and also a genuine poignancy that has not been matched by many other Allen films. It is also very too the point and doesn't become rambling. The story has themes that anybody in the same situation can relate to, it's steadily paced but the writing, how the characters and their relationships are explored and the heart and truthfulness really captivate here, so it's never tedious. Other than the emotional impact, what makes The Purple Rose of Cairo perhaps one of Allen's most accessible and relatable is that it is one of his least neurotic, but even without that the characters are still compellingly real, which just goes to show that good writing and characters can happen without neurotises(and this is not meant in a bad way, it is a style that doesn't click with many but I've never had a problem with it). The ending is one that may fall flat with some but strike a chord with others, the latter was the case with me, but it is understandable why anybody would think otherwise because it does take a different tone to the rest of the film. The acting is great all round, Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels are incredibly charming and the performances from both rank among their best. Their chemistry also is magic. Overall, a fantastic film. ",

            "content": "Woody Allen from Annie Hall through to Crimes and Misdemeanors really was a master of his art. Everything he took on whether it be romance, comedy, mockumentary, or fantasy, he managed with unparallelled panache and creativity. In The Purple Rose of Cairo he delivers a film that is so wonderfully balanced between the lines of fantasy and reality that it truly strikes at the heart of cinematic genius. The basic plot is that Cecilia, played by Mia Farrow, is unemployed and in an abusive marriage in the midst of Depression-era New Jersey, and her one method of escape from the drudgery of her surroundings is via the movies. One day whilst watching her favourite film for the fifth time one of the characters suddenly starts interacting with her and from there starts a chain of events that range from the absurd to the deeply touching, handled in a way that only Woody Allen could pull-off. It may be easy for younger cineastes to underrate Woody Allen and his contribution to cinema based on the Luke-warm fare that is now attached to his name but for anyone curious about one the most inventive, hilarious and brilliant film directors to have emerged in the entirety of cinema's history, watching films like this one will reveal just how brilliant Woody Allen is at his best. This film is a meditation on the nature of existence, reality and love, reflecting on the merits of escapism versus the value of acceptance of reality, whilst also being extremely entertaining and immensely original and creative. It should also be mentioned that Mia Farrow's performance is one of the most enchanting I have ever witnessed. What a lovely and wonderful film created by one of cinema's greatest talents.",

            "content": "Woody's stories are often derivative, but he's forgiven that, usually, because the results are good and ultimately do deserve his signature. For PURPLE ROSE, he swipes Buster Keaton's gimmick in SHERLOCK, JR., then lets his imagination run free as he did in the best of his NEW YORKER stories. We wind up with the most fascinating and realistic meditation regarding what it is to be an audience, a viewer's relationship to art, art's relationship to reality. The triumph is amazing, because, despite the depth of the symbolism, PURPLE ROSE can also be seen as sheer entertainment; on its surface, it is still one of the most entertaining pictures Woody has ever made. Farrow and Aiello are marvelous here; Mia, who is quite underrated, has only been as good once -- in BROADWAY DANNY ROSE. The photography is superb, influenced perhaps by Edward Hopper with generally less obvious light sources.",

A movie about the love of something not quite real but that it becomes the more real thing in our lives. The transportation that Mia Farrow goes through while sitting in the movie theater brought tears to my eyes - my friend turned to me in disbelief \u2018Are you weeping?\u2019 He asked. Well yes, I was. I can't explain it. Have you seen the movie? Sometimes I felt I wanted to sit next to Mia Farrow in see the movie she's watching all the way through.

But other than the people not freaking out talking o movie characters, there is no jokes or comedy. The tone of most of the movie is a domestic abuse drama, and there is nothing funny about domestic abuse. Finally,  SPOILER WARNING:  IF YOU DON'T WANT IT SPOILED THEN STOP READING: Gil Shepherd the actor who played Tom shows up to put Tom back in the movie.  Gil convinces Cecilia that he loves her, just to get Tom back in the movie.  Gil stands her up for the meeting and she goes back to her life as it was.  Except the way she left things with her jerk husband, he's going to end up killing her.  Great comedy, knowing full well that the star is going to be beaten to death by a drunken deadbeat.

How could it not be? Compared to the perfection found in movies, normal life is just dull. This movie is a reminder that movies are just movies, so don't get lost in them. But also, they are always there for us, to inspire, awe, and put a smile upon our face. I'd keep it from being a must-see only because some may find the ending depressing, but it is just reality.

People don't watch movies to see the ordinary, they want diversion, which can be anything from fantastical action to deeply introspective comments on the world around us. The industry is built on the ability to sit down for a couple of hours and slip into the shoes of someone else. Allen's film is a beautiful depiction of the emotions that movies give us, like daydreams that come with popcorn, as well as a cautionary tale concerning how invested audiences should actually be; once those credits roll, you do have to step back into the outside world. Farrow and Daniels have great chemistry, and you do ultimately feel the warmth that the screenplay seeks to instill in you, though to be fair the easiest way to appeal to cinema lovers is to show them a mirror and tell them that \"everybody has problems and uses movies to cope, you're not alone\".\n\nAlso, can we talk about how well-rendered this film is despite being only 82 minutes? Studios, you don't have to make two and a half hour behemoths to be compelling, you just need good writing and a solid premise. (3.5/5)",

First off, similar to \"Radio Days,\" there's a tremendously tender hand assigned to filling this world with as much detail and texture as possible, in order to make it feel totally period accurate. It's evocative and warm, hearkening back to an era that's so far gone, yet so aesthetic. Pile on some trademark Woody Allen magical realism and you're dealt a movie that's just too hard to dislike. Say what we will about the many flaws and intricacies of him as a human being (and there's a hell of a lot to say) I'll be damned if the man can't write a watchable movie at the very least. \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" however, is thankfully not only watchable, but a thoroughly delightful and a blast at times to watch, featuring two incredible performances from Jeff Daniels.",

Yes, you heard that right his character actually comes into our real world\nturns out he's sick of doing the same thing all the time even if it's scripted, he wants to find true love and happyness\nthe object of his affection is Cecilia yet she can't fathom why he would be interested in someone like her\nthe truth is though she doesn't want to admit she's unhappy but Baxter constantly wants her to open her eyes as well as her heart\nit's unbelievable something like this can actually happen yet for everyone else it's causing a lot of chaos particularly for the actor that played Baxter in the actual film\nthis film not only has excellent actors but a wonderful gem of a premise, I didn't expect this from Woody Allen at all\nhe manages to blend a fantasy element with a romance and genuine comedy\nplus there's great intellectual discussions about what makes us very happy, content, loved etc.\nsome say you can't find consistency in real-life, some say you have to, the real world doesn't work like the movies but it can play like one, some characters are so well-conceived that they become real, some want fiction to be real others just prefer the opposite, the most human of all attributes is making a choice\ngotta say I was pleasantly surprised by the way Woody Allen handled this one with the time period, the sharp acting, the clever story, and the wakeup call we all need\n'Purple Rose of Cairo' is a remarkable gem in itself",

            "content": "Rarely have I cried so intensely at the end of a film or related to a character more than I did with this melancholy reflection on love and the expectations we have of those we care about. As a young woman who watches a great deal of films, at least in part as an attempt at escapism, and who longs to have some man sweep me off my feet I could not help but be drawn into the film. I am one of those silly teenage girls who imagines that love will be just like it is in the movies because as of yet I have never been in a relationship and the difficult emotional truths that this film presented hit me hard.\n\nIn New Jersey during the Great Depression a lonely and depressed waitress Cecilia, Mia Farrow, is trapped in a marriage to the physically abusive Monk, Danny Aiello, and escapes from her painful everyday life by watching films. She particularly enjoys \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" and falls in love with the character of Tom Baxter but he begins to fall in love with her himself and steps out of the screen to experience freedom and pursue a relationship with her. The two fall in love as she teaches him about how to live in the real world and he treats her with love and care she has not experienced before. Complications arise when the other characters in the film are trapped in the screen and the film cannot continue to play without him. He goes into hiding with Cecilia's help but the selfish aspiring actor Gil Shepherd, Jeff Daniels, who plays him arrives in town to force his character back on the screen so his reputation will not be ruined. He manipulates Cecilia into believing that he loves her and convinces her to choose him over the \u2018fake' Baxter but later abandons her and leads her to continue attending films as a form of escapism.\n\nThere is something undeniably romantic about the film as a woman lacking in almost anybody to love and support her finally finds what she wants in a man who is willing to go against everything that defines him to be with her. Their momentary joy together was sweet and pleasurable to watch as they frolic about and explore the city while tragedy looms in the form of Baxter being forced back onto the screen and Cecilia losing him forever. You can't help but feel horror as you see Shepherd take an interest in her purely because she feeds his ego and not because he sees anything in her to be interested in. The contrast between the innocence and purity of the love between Baxter and the fake connection between an awestruck film fan and an insecure film star provides for some great laughs and a sad realization that we often don't value the right things in the people we choose to love. The moment when Cecilia finds out that she has been abandoned is so sad because we could easily foresee this occurring and in some small part of her mind so does she. \n\nThe production design is gorgeous of course as it often is in Allen period pieces and Farrow's costuming is delightful as while they can't quite hide the fact that she is a beauty her skirts and tweed jackets help to frump her up. Farrow gives possibly her best performance in this film as this character fits all of her unique features with that little girl voice and big, expressive eyes fitting the tone of the film and the unique pitch that this character is set at. When she looks up at Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing to \"Cheek to Cheek\" she is all of us as the pain melts away from her face and she gives herself over to the joy of watching two people who can dance better than almost anybody else do what they do best. Daniels plays two very different roles and excels in both of them as he is especially convincing as the smarmy, self-absorbed actor who always thinks about himself as a star.\n\nAllen also throws in a few good jokes about the film industry as every actor in the titular film within a film believes that they are a lead and audiences complain about the lack of plot, possibly a call to criticisms of Allen's own films. This humor brightens up a film sure to make you cry and this makes it one of Allen's best.",

I thought it was great how everyone acted as if a character in a movie walking off the screen actually made sense. I knew nothing about the movie going in so that surprised me, and added to the humor when I'm the only one acting like something impossible occurred.\n\n\nJeff Daniels was great in his dual role and I could see differences in his performance depending on which character he was portraying. Mia Farrow was a perfect love interest because she is so sweet and unassuming, and her passion for the movies makes it believable that she could connect with these men. I also loved all the familiar faces on the screen in the movie within the movie. Their scenes were absolutely hilarious.\n\nMost of this movie worked like a charm for me. Hearing the stories of what was happening at other theaters showing the movie made me laugh. It was great watching the studio executives debating what to do, as if the obvious question of \"how is this happening?\" never even enters their minds. Then there's even a scene where the characters walk back into the screen and everything goes crazy.\n\nI wish they had shown a little more of the movie within the movie just so we had a better idea of the themes and who Tom Baxter was within his world (then we wouldn't need him to tell us so often.) Also there's the terribly disappointing conclusion to the film. After all that magic and fun throughout the movie it made me sad to step back down to reality at the end. \n\nWith my slight complaints aside I have to say this is easily my second favorite Woody Allen film. It speaks to the cinema lover in me because the magic of movies is on full display in The Purple Rose of Cairo. It had me laughing frequently, and had charm to spare. What a nice treat.",

It sounded like a sillier version of Last Action Hero, if you can imagine. What exits here isn't silly. It's lovely, thoughtful and ultimately bittersweet. Farrow is so small and delicate as Cecelia, whose no-good lout of a husband gambles away their money and roughs her up. Times are bleak, the town is dying and she can't enjoy any moment of her real life, but in the movies everything is perfect. There's beauty, grace, charm and everything ends happily. Sweetheart archaeologist Tom Baxter believes in love at first sight over and over as he travels to New York with the countess to fall in love with a lounge singer. Once he's escaped the celluloid to woo Cecelia he remains perfect, unburdened by the pessimism that exists in reality. He doesn't cheat, he can't be hurt, and he's always thoughtful. Here Allen explores our adulation for art within life. We want life to be perfect, but know it can't be true. That's the beauty of Hollywood escapism, we know it's not reality, but for just a few hours in a darkened room we can be swept away.\nSo what happens to all the upper class neurosis that's prevalent in his other movies? Brilliantly, Allen has incorporated that into the movie within the movie. The film can't continue without Tom Baxter so the characters are forced to sit and wait for days, eventually loosing their minds and debating reality. In an homage to Allen's detractors one patron shouts \"I don't pay to watch those socialites sit around up there, staring at us making nasty remarks.\"\nWhile not always happy, this is a very rewarding watch for everything from Jeff Daniels' two endearing performances (as the actor & his subject), and one of the most magical and original films I've seen.",

            "content": "\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is pure genius.  Woody Allen's script is interesting, clever, and very complex as he creates a bridge between the real world and a fictional film world.  Many of us can relate to a moment of wishing that we could enter the world of our favorite movie characters, but how often does a movie character wish that they could enter ours?  This story is set in depression-era New Jersey and focuses on Mia Farrow, a waitress who is unhappy in her job and her marriage.  While the entire story is lighthearted, it is easy to see why Farrow needs to visit the movie theater to escape her own life.  Danny Aiello is great as her abusive husband who uses her for the money that she earns as he gambles it away.  A man like that could drive any woman to long for an adventure like The Purple Rose of Cairo.  The film takes a turn when one of the movie characters, played by Jeff Daniels, notices Farrow in the audience and decides to walk out of the movie (literally through the screen) to meet her.  The series of events that follows is gold.  Woody explores this situation from several different angles including Daniels' ignorance of our world (and a lack of real money), the frustration of the on-screen characters as their movie cannot continue, and the panicked \"real life\" actor who is trying to get his character back into the film.  The scenes in which the audience interacts with the on-screen characters must have been very difficult to shoot as it required perfect timing when the initial scene was filmed, and then for the audience to interact with the preexisting scene.  I laughed and laughed through the entire second half of the film as the escalation of the situation gets more and more hilarious.  I cannot remember the last time that I was this entertained by a plot device.  I have always loved Woody Allen's work but this may be my favorite of his films.  \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is incredibly clever and keeps you guessing until the very end.",

            "content": "Jeff Daniels plays an actor who played a character in an escapist film, and Mia Farrow plays a woman who needs to escape. In this movie about people's intimate relationship with movies, virtually every meta-angle is explored, with humor and heart. The ideas are not new: at issue are the distinctions between movie problems and real world problems, celluloid romance and real life love, the idealism that art reflects and the cynical business of making art. It is, however, rare for a film to be able to critique its own medium without abandoning the medium's conventions; it is difficult to be truly experimental and yet to tell a relatable story with a familiar dramatic arc. \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" finds a way, and it works as both a commentary on classical movie stories and as a classical movie story in its own right.\n\nTom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) is a minor character in a big RKO release sometime in the 1930s, a decade when incomes were down but box office revenues were up. He is earnest and heroic and wealthy and romantic because it's \"written in his character\" to be those things. When he meets Mia Farrow's Cecilia, a woman from the real world, he is a breath of fresh air from her distinctly unromantic problems of poverty and an unhappy marriage. Baxter doesn't know about the Depression, about brothels, even about God; those things aren't written, which provides an opening to discuss them and to contrast the world that is with the world that we like to imagine could be. Leaving no permutation unturned, the film also examines the downsides of life on the other side of the silver screen. Movie characters, were they to become cognizant, would face existential questions about the limits of their free will and about what happens to them when the projectors shut off. Though real people have more or less the same uncertainties, the film eschews the macabre and maintains a humorous tone. There are moments of real emotional weight, though, as when Cecilia must choose between Baxter and the man who brought him to life, Gil Shepherd, whose excuse for being less perfect than his creation is \"I'm real.\" The darkest the film gets is the fatalistic final sequence in which Cecilia, having chosen to live in the real world and to experience the perfect life of movie characters only vicariously, is denied a Hollywood ending. Farrow's face is achingly expressive as it slowly changes over a few long shots.\n\nIt must have been difficult to create a rapport between the actors in the fictional movie and the actors watching the movie, and between the two characters played via split screen by Jeff Daniels, but the pace of the dialogue is steady and the jokes are well-timed. Yet the script is not Woody Allen's densest or wittiest. Some of the words feel ad libbed, even in crucial plot-moving scenes between Baxter, Shepherd, and Cecilia. There is also a fair amount of repetition despite the movie's short runtime. Some of this is essential, as in the two scenes when Cecilia's manipulative husband tells her she'll be back despite her apparent intention to leave him. But there is perhaps one scene too many of Hollywood producers debating and fictional movie characters bickering about the absence of a supposedly minor player. More interesting are the vignettes that explore the implications of Baxter's existence: what happens if he gets in a fight? What will he do for money? Can he make love without a Hays Code-era fade out? The movie's answers manage to be funny, touching, and thoughtful all at once.",

In this movie, her character is in a unloving relationship and she looks for escapism by going to the cinema and imagines a life with the film stars. When one of the actors walks out of the screen, into real life, which causing an uproar in the community, he turns to Mia Farrow to show him life in the real world. After falling deeply in love with her, which causes more problems in her troubled relationship, she is left with the decision to leave her husband for a life in her dream world. I think that you can tell that the storyline is completely far fetched, but it's a sweat love story without any of Woody Allens slapstick comedy. I personally found the movie boring and uninteresting, but I'm sure that there are people out there that will enjoy it. Average!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nAlthough this movie made a loss at the box office, it is one of Woody Allens popular films that are highly rated. I personally can't see why it's was so highly rated or were the $15 million dollar budget went, but thats just my opinion. The acting isn't totally bad from the cast, except for Mia Farrow who whines her way through the whole film. The same concept was used in the Last Action Hero, we're Annie walks out of the screen and finds it hard to adapt to the real world, but that didn't really work either. On the plus side, Woody Allen did portray the period well but thats about it.\n\nBudget: $15million\nWorldwide Gross: $10.6million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a woman in a troubled relationship and searches for happiness at the cinema. 3/10",

If one was living in the lower class during that time, one's life wouldn't be satisfying as everywhere you look shows the suffering of people, the decay of the environment around them, and ideas like beauty and luxury are nowhere in sight. During that time, people like Cecilia purely wanted to escape from their difficult and depressing life and a lot of them did that through the viewing of films. Films were one of the most accessible and cheapest activities people can undergo to gain that sense of enjoyment, even if it\u00e2??s just a small glimmer of happiness, though there are others, like Cecilia, who are currently in their lowest when living reality and she doesn't just want to view a film, but to live it. She wants to touch and feel the characters she sees on screen as they are the perfect individuals, containing very few flaws and the ones that are present are right there on the surface. Though the film's setting takes place in a world where the environment is rough, but it still has the power to connect with contemporary audience, no matter what their economic or social status is. I, myself have been affected, in a way, the same way as Cecilia has when watching something on screen; television programs like Friends and Community and films like Lost In Translation have pulled me in so deep that sometimes reality isn't satisfying anymore, so I come back to it time and time again and hoping that someday it would also happen to me. Woody Allen demonstrates to us the power of films, showing us just how deep we could get when it sucks us in and at the same time display how beautiful it is when we just let ourselves go. The way Allen ends the film is definitely an interesting and logical choice. I didn't have a problem with this because it definitely is appropriate with the nature and logic of humanity and reality; it is important to move forward and deal with it.\n\nThe film's concept was definitely daring and something I have never experienced in a film before. I adore the seriousness that the characters are taking towards the situation, as this allowed the situation to feel both hilarious and romantically genuine. If the film's tone and the writing instead make fun of the subject and the situation then this film would have been a spoof and a put-down to Cecilia and the audiences that are just like her. One can definitely tell that Allen at one point was Cecilia, I think there was a film long ago that he has seen that affected his life more than he thought it would; one can see how much Allen cares about this character and how important it is to get the emotions between her relationships as accurate as needed in order for the film to feel effective in an emotional sense. This was definitely something I felt was lacking in Manhattan, aside from the obsession quality in the character that the director also plays as that is present in both films, it just purely lacked the love for the story and the concept, unlike this film.\n\nGordon Willis is a legendary cinematographer and his work for this film may not be in the same level or power as his earlier work, The Godfather and Manhattan, but I believe his contribution for this film still shines. Willis clearly wanted to make a clear contrast of both the virtual and actual, as the way the camera is used on both sides is quite different and one can truly tell which one is what. One of my favourite scenes was the \"Night on the Town\" sequence as Willis truly immerses us in this world to the point where the film almost completely transitioned to a new world with a new story.\n\nI don't remember much of Dick Hyman's score, but I do recall a sound that was influenced by the films of that era; the big band/jazz type of sound which I felt actually worked with the film's atmosphere and tone. It remains upbeat through most of the film, with a couple of gentle moments during emotional scenes, and it works in sucking you in while also gaining some sort of nostalgia. I think I would appreciate it better the more I listen to it.\n\nThe acting in this film was fantastic with great performance from Mia Farrow, who plays this internally sad person who watches films in order to escape or gain a glimmer of happiness, even if it isn't her. Jeff Daniels was definitely the highlight of the film, playing two different characters, one fictional and one actual. He was able to bring something unique and different with each character, truly having each one feel like it's another person that we are watching on screen, this is definitely something not all actors could do. At the same time, he was able to demonstrate wonderful chemistry with Farrow, even more impressive as both characters he plays were able to convince me of their connection with the leading lady. Danny Aiello as Monk was great as the antagonist as he was able to show just how mean his character is, and never reaching to a point of disbelief.\n\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo has convinced me that Allen is a brilliant director, who is able to deliver into it his passion for cinema without forgetting to tell a wonderful story. I hope the next film I see from his would be just as great as this.",

This movie is chock-full of fantastic ideas, and it is made of that movie magic that will both break your heart and win you over with a smile.  The core concept itself is fantastic, and it is so charming, it is just infectious.  This is from Woody Allen, who is actually a much better fantasy director than people give him credit for, and that is because this is not fantasy in the traditional sense; between this and Midnight in Paris, he has all the credentials you need to know about, and he has brilliant ideas that he just runs with.  While I would praise this because I never at any point knew how it would play out, one criticism I have to make is that it all ends on a super cynical note that feels contradictory to the rest of the film's upbeat tone... but at the same, because it does that, it does make it extremely memorable, so it's a double-edged sword.

Her only escape is cinema where she falls in love with the characters, the songs, and watches the same movies repeatedly. When she sees \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" for another time, the film's main character, Tom Baxter, comes off the screen and falls in love with her. At the same time, the actor of the character, Gil Shepard, tries to get Tom Baxter back to the screen but falls in love with Cecelia. The strong point of the film is the writing which has some of the best dialogue of cinematic history, but an interesting plot as well. Woody Allen does not just rely on the premise but continues to surprise us repeatedly. We watch movies to forget about our troubled lives.   To meet characters who are more interesting than reality. However, film itself is an illusion; a collection of pictures played at 24 frames per second. The humor is undeniably genius. For instance, Mia Farrow upon meeting Tom Baxter says \"I just met a wonderful new man. He's fictional but you can't have everything.\" \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is Woody Allen's best comedy film and also the greatest film that shows why we love movies. A showcase of brilliant and inventive writing filled with instantly quotable funny dialogue, and a daring ending for all feel-good movies.",

The writing is sharp, the dialog witty and Allen's familiar feminist themes are again in the focus.\n\nThis is about as typical a Woody Allen flick as you can find and as such doubtlessly splits opinions.

He steps off the screen and goes with her into the real world. It's a cool concept, and it's done with heart and a clear love for movies. Despite this movie being filmed in 1985, it seems like Woody Allen directed the actors in such a way to make them act like they were in a movie from the 30's (which is when the film takes place). So it seems like you're watching a movie that is much older than it actually is, which is interesting but comedic at the same time. When the fictional movie character fights Cecilia's husband, it's clear that Allen was tributing the now cheesy style of old black and white films. The ending further capitalizes on the idea of people escaping to the movies when things get bad, or when we make bad decisions. Like alcoholics drink alcohol to forget their problems, as drug addicts do drugs, Cecilia (along with the normal people in society) uses movie theaters as an escape- and what a beautiful escape it is.",

It's a touching and gentle comic fantasy with an original idea at the centre, it's a homage to the cinema of old and the films Woody grew up with as well, it's a joy to watch. Set during the Great Depression in the 1930's, waitress Cecilia (Mia Farrow) gets by in her job and her loveless marriage to the abusive Monk (Danny Aiello). But Cecilia finds solace in going to the cinema, and there's a new film on called The Purple Rose of Cairo which she goes to see again and again, and it gets to the point where one of the characters in the film, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), notices Cecilia, and comes out of the screen to be with her, leaving the characters on screen clueless as to whats happened. While Cecilia and Tom go out together, this strange occurence has the film's producer Raoul Hirsch (Alexander Cohen) and the star of the film Gil Shepherd (Daniels again), who plays Tom Baxter in the film, to come to New Jersey to sort the problem out, but then Cecilia falls for Gil as well. It's a very odd but magical romantic fantasy, cut from similar cloth to what Woody would use to make Midnight in Paris (2011), it's a wonder Woody hasn't tried stuff like this more often, as it brings out a nostalgic side to him that works on film, but it has laughs and poignancy too, like the old classics used to have.",

For her, seeing the movies is the one bright spot in her life. Now the new movie in town, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is her focus, and she goes to the film almost every day. To her surprise, a character in the movie, Tom Baxter (Daniels), takes notice, and jumps right out of the screen and into her life. The two begin an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love, and this causes the movie to fail-- all of the other \"actors\" can't jump out of the scream, and they're worrying about what to do without the essential Tom. Considering it's becoming a box-office bomb, the actor who plays Tom (also Daniels) does anything he can to get his character back into the movie since his career is at stake. \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is a hilarious, classic Woody Allen that has the charms that his movies almost always deliver. But considering it was done during the same time as \"Broadway Danny Rose\" and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", this film is often overlooked. Well, it shouldn't be. The idea for the film is ingenious, and nobody could have pulled it off better than Allen-- he creates a screenplay fitting for each and every character, and the banter going on the movie inside the movie is the highlight of the show. The screenplay is so clever and witty, and all of the actors, especially Daniels, pull off their silly characters and make it their own. This is one of my favorite Woody Allen films, and I hope others who see it feel the same way. \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is one of those bittersweet comedies that just get better with age. This is timeless Allen. Recommended.",

Who could not love and feel for her character.  Just as Tom falls in love with her, so do we.

First things first, the film is superbly directed. Whilst it balances elements of reality and fantasy, it never becomes cheesy or over-the-top, and the surrealist elements work perfectly. The film is pleasant to watch, and never feels heavy, yet it does not compromise its artistic integrity. It has the airy charm of a golden age Hollywood classic, yet it winds up as a contemporary picture which is fitting for modern-day audiences. Ultimately, the ending is thought-provoking, conveying the fact that whilst great films may inspire a person to dream of an ideal life, the reality is different and much harsher. All in all, a classy, well-directed film which features good performances from the leading roles, and which is successfully able to combine a pleasant plot with a great level of depth.",

Her life is stuck in a rut until one day her favourite actor (played by Jeff Daniels) walks out of the silver screen and into her life...\n\nNot the landmark of Annie Hall or the sharp wit of Manhattan, but still a good 82 minutes about the love of film and it's power to take us to a better place.",

Mia Farrow is irrefutably underrated; nobody has seemed to ever understand her potential, and I strongly feel that she is, in fact, one of the most outstanding Hollywood actresses from the latter half of the twentieth century.  Not only is she beautiful, her delivery is brilliant, and her chemistry with Jeff Daniels-who delivers just a slightly less powerful performance-is grand.\n\nWhat more can I say about THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO?  It isn't perfect, but it's very much close.  I'm talking about a sheer motion picture that represents the 1930s in perchance the utmost picturesque, vivid manner possible.  The writing is guaranteed pleasure for those who don't generally view film as a work of art, but for just about any cinephile watching this is bound to get a magical thrill similar to the kind a young child receives when he or she enters a candy shop.  In just two, simplistic words, it's magnificent.\n\nread it all at themoviefreakblog.com",

It's well crafted as well, showing some fine effects and that typical \"overacted 30-50's way\" of acting.\n\nEven if it was original it remainded me in some ways of some of my favorites like \"Cinema Paradiso\" and \"Groundhog Day\", and that is surely a good thing.

The result is weird yet charming and at times hilarious, yet it's utterly unique and unlike most other movies I've seen. Jeff Daniels shows a lot of promise in one of his earlier roles and Mia Farrow is good as usual. Contains the sort of sharp humour you'd expect from a Woody Allen movie although he doesn't have a role this time, those looking for a few laughs won't be disappointed and may even shed a tear or two.

He's fictional, but you can't have everything.\"\r\n\r\nThat wonderful line of dialogue from the magical pen of Woody Allen sums up the genius behind \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\".  \"Cairo\" is a funny, fun, clever and touching tale of an unhappy New Jersey housewife during the Great Depression who is swept away by a celluloid Prince Charming who comes into her life right off of the movie screen.  \r\n\r\nWhat at first can sound like a shallow movie plot shows remarkable depth as the device is used merely as a vehicle to explore how sad reality can be.  Cecilia (the affecting Mia Farrow) spends her afternoons escaping her harsh married life in the town's movie house taking in the pictures.  When \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" a picture about a dashing Egyptologist Tom Baxter played by fictional actor Gil Shephard (played by real actor Jeff Daniels) comes to town, Cecilia watches the movie several times until all of a sudden he breaks the fourth wall and notices Cecilia in the movie theater.  He steps off the screen and romances the down-on-her-luck Cecilia.\r\n\r\nThis of course wreaks havoc with the film and sets in motion a series of events that ultimately leads up to Cecilia having to make a potentially life-changing decision.  This film is well renown among Allen's films for how it unfolds and it does so brilliantly and without compromise and without sacrificing the film's tone.  \r\n\r\nThe performances, particularly Farrow, were spot on, but \"Cairo\"'s biggest achievement is its ability to take such a fantastical plot point (remember how poorly \"The Last Action Hero\" did it?) and make it work so beautifully.  \r\n\r\n\"Purple Rose of Cairo\" ranks among Woody Allen's best and is one of his most underappreciated classics.",

            "content": "Another amazing film by Woody Allen.  I can see why this would be his favorite.  It fully covers his ideas on love, but at the same time is really charming.  Jeff Daniels was great as Tom Baxter, an explorer from a movie called The Purple Rose of Cairo, who somehow sees a woman in the audience and falls in love with her so much that he decides to leave his film and enter the real world to be with her.  Cecilia isn't loved by her husband and seems to only have one friend, so when Tom takes her away she leaves without a second thought.  Yeah, a man strangely exits the screen, but she is lonely and she has been in love with him since the first time she saw the movie.  Woody Allen continues the story line between the two while answering questions about the two worlds colliding without ever taking a break.  I loved when Tom goes into the brothel and has no idea what is happening.  Even though there are many charming and happy moments throughout the film I always felt an underlying sense of sadness.  She is finding new love, but at the same time she is still married to the jerk who cheats right in front of her.  This broken marriage is constantly stopping her from showing her true love to a man who wants nothing except her love.  It is strange to be screaming \"cheat on the husband!\" but that's what was going on.  Allen creates such a great connection to Cecilia that we care a great deal about every little choice she will make.  Perhaps because we watch movies to escape our lives, and Cecilia is the same way and she has the opportunity that we have always wanted.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nOf course, the movie ends with Woody Allen keeping to his true self and his views on love.  Cecilia decides that she wants the actor, Gil Shepherd, instead of his character, Tom, simply because he is real.  She thinks she has gone completely insane falling for a fictional character.  But she does believe that true love exists.  Unfortunately, Gil was just playing her so that he could get his character to go back on screen.  It's such a heartbreaking revelation in the film, but the ending is perfect with Cecilia sitting in the theater watching the famous scene \"heaven, I'm in heaven\" by Ginger and Fred, and she slowly gets a smile on her face.  According to Allen, love does not last, it's only for movies.  If she wanted true happiness she should have stayed in the film with Tom, or else she can go back to reality where the husband beats and cheats on her and the actor lies about loving her.",

            "content": "Plot:\r\n\r\nPerhaps the least appreciated of Allen's great films, The Purple Rose of Cairo, is arguably his most playful, albeit direct, outing. Set in New Jersey during the great depression of the 1930's, Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a film aficionado and broken housewife. Recently, her marriage has since turned into a considerable disaster and she finds herself in frequent disagreement with her out-of-work, abusive, and even womanizing husband, Monk (Danny Aiello). \r\n\r\nToo afraid to be on her own, she naturally finds escape at the local cinema where she sits upon hours in admiration of the actors on screen and the lives in which their characters live. When the theater first features the film entitled The Purple Rose of Cario, Cecilia finds herself enamored by the film and its subsequent character, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).  The following day while at work as a waitress, she finds herself distracted from the mere memory of the feature and due to the nature of her reverie is there upon fired for her demeanor. She later frequents the film over and again and it is not until the happening of one her later viewings, perhaps the sixth time over, that her presence attracts the attention of Tom Baxter, causing him to come off-screen and appear before her and all others in the theater.\r\n\r\nAs he confesses his attraction toward her, together the two run off as the audience and too the characters on screen (as if suddenly viable actors taking part in play) remain caught in panic and awe. Word soon spreads that a character in a feature film has walked off screen, discovering the real-world. Expectedly the news spreads quickly to ears of the film's producer, Raoul Hirsch, and the actor who portrays Tom Baxter, Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels). Mr. Hirsch's objective here is to stop the mass running of his picture to cease any further occurrences that share semblance and potential lawsuits. Gil Shepherd finds himself frightened at the thought of losing his growing popularity due to what crimes he believes the character he created, his essential double for all intensive purposes, may be out committing.\r\n\r\nCecelia You're Breaking My Heart:\r\n\r\nMia Farrow's interpretation of Cecilia is simply charming. It is with such perfection that she plays the role of this lonely, na\u00efve romantic in search of change. Her lamenting disposition and reserved attitude, together, truly make her irresistible to any viewer and impossible for one not to feel sympathetic toward her plight.\r\n\r\nJeff Daniels does as well a marvelous job as both Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd. He very well may be amongst Hollywood's underrated.\r\n\r\nFilm as a World of its Own:\r\n\r\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo presents yet another interesting aspect in the sense that Allen depicts the world on the theater screen as a world entirely of its own; and it is! Cecelia mentions over and again her desire for a world similar to the depictions on screen and it is with a high degree of craft that Allen creates that so sought after world. The scene in the picture itself, when Tom Baxter leaves, can no longer move forward or backward, but must remain in place. The characters however are free to move about, discuss at will topics of interest, as well as see outwardly, beyond the screen, into the theater. These characters on screen are alive, disturbed even. Their world of routine has since been interrupted and they are left in a state of restlessness and wait for there is nothing more they desire than to continue their life of pattern. One character even mentions excitedly how he is a \"dramatic character\" and needs \"forward motion\" while another mentions the fear he has of the screen going \"black\". In their impatience others pass time arbitrarily by poking jokes at the audience. As a whole these sequences make for brilliant satire that only Allen could write.\r\n\r\nTom Baxter leaves the picture and enters the real-world where he remains no longer a victim of repetitiveness. Moviegoers, however enthusiastic, wish to enter the very world of a Hollywood picture in the hope of escaping theirs.\r\n\r\nThe two worlds do exist and perhaps are separate equals, but after all, what is a life without the movies? What is a life without wanting to or even having an escape, even if only for a little while?\r\n\r\nLove, Actually:\r\n\r\nWhat else Purple Rose so genuinely explores is the unrequited love one may share for a fictional character; be that of literature, film, or even our very own imaginative perception of those so in which living life surrounds us with to a great abundance. Cecilia found herself enthralled by the character Tom Baxter even before he took his first steps off-screen. His charm, his romanticism, looks and perfections that captivated her so, all of course translated to the real-world. However, his limited knowledge of the living-world, what is past and now, as well as being only capable of what has been written into his character, hinders Tom Baxter from certain human emotions. Also, as aforementioned, he, Tom Baxter, is in practical sense, fictional.\r\n\r\nOne has to wonder if it is the artist whom they love or his creation. It is here in Allen's piece that Cecilia falls too in deep affection toward the actor who portrays Tom Baxter. He is certainly a man of a great many faults no doubt, but an artist no less and more importantly, the man who gave life to Tom Baxter. It is such that Cecilia finds herself amidst the grand decision of choosing reality or fantasy for her ultimate happiness.\r\n\r\nOne Sentence Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo is a fantastic, probing piece of cinema in which, through comedic, romantic tones, great acting and of course music, leaves the viewer appreciating cinema that much more than what was once before.",

The film is indeed appropriately set smackdab in the middle of the Great Depression, where lonely Cecilia struggles hard to make ends meet.

She must go there often as she's on a first name basis with all the employees.  Sure, during the day her life may suck, but for a few hours each week, she can be transported off to exotic locations and expensive night clubs, experiencing the fleeting affairs and romances of beautiful movie stars.  She especially enjoys the new film, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", taking in several matinees.  One character, the \"aww shucks\", all around good guy and egyptologist, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), especially catches her eye.  She apparently also catches his eye, as one day he turns to her and begins speaking to her from up on the screen.  Moments later, he steps down off the screen and the two run off together, bringing scene to a halt.  The characters in the movie don't know what to do without Tom there, and so just sit and wait for him to return, much to the chagrin of the audience in attendance (they begin to heckle the screen, and the people in the movie begin to heckle the members of the audience in return).  Word quickly spreads of this strange phenomenon and soon the town is bustling with hollywood agents looking to put an end to the \"bad publicity\".  Meanwhile, Cecilia and Tom grow acquainted and of course like any old time movie character, Tom almost immediately proclaims his love for her.  Cecilia seems more concerned with just catching her breath after all the supernatural goings on, but she's entirely sympathetic to the idea.  Much like her fantasies of leaving her husband, her fantasies of running off with Tom seem like they are so very possible.  The craziness only heightens when the actor who portrayed Tom Baxter in the movie, Gil Shepherd, comes to town to try and save his career in hollywood (just suppose this living incarnation of his performance commits some crime or \"rapes some woman\", as his agents so often remind him).  He too, meets and becomes attracted to Cecilia, who is then caught in a sort of love triangle between a movie star and his character.  It's a quaint little film that still manages to give us a bit of melancholy near the end, as per Allen's more serious films.  The Tom Baxter character is the stand in for Woody this time, fulfilling Woody's usual role of being an outsider looking in (or is it an insider looking out?).  He makes no bones about his feelings about anything: love, religion, society.  The character is the perfect man as invisioned by Woody.  And yet, he's also a very apt tribute to the great film characters of the early days of cinema.  In fact, the Purple Rose of Cairo is a love letter to the golden age of film.  The care put forth into creating a 1930s film, from the lighting and film type, to the music and make up, it all looks authentic.  The Purple Rose of Cairo is a film that aims small, but hits big.",

The story has some really funny and inventive developments from there. The dialogue is frequently hilarious. Mia Farrow gives the best performance I've seen from her so far, as a woman who is delicate and timid but lovable. Jeff Daniels is fantastic as both the movie character she meets and the actor who played that character. The scenes with that character are great, because he only understands the simple romantic world of his movie and has trouble grasping the real world he finds himself in. Danny Aiello is suitably loutish as Farrow's abusive husband, and Dianne Wiest has an amusing bit part as a prostitute. The movie-within-the-movie is a convincing re-creation of the style of 1930s Hollywood pictures. The only problem with the movie is that it lacks a satisfactory ending.

Her most common escape is at the local movie theater, where she watches films such as \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (both the name of the movie itself, as well as the film-within-a-film spurring the plot).\n\nDuring a repeat viewing of the titular picture, one character, Tom (Jeff Daniels), steps outside of the screen to meet Cecilia, with whom he has become infatuated during her regular appearances at the theater. The two run away together, much to the chagrin of Cecilia's husband, the theater owners, and especially the Hollywood big-wigs backing \"Rose,\" including Gil Norton (also Daniels), a rising star who portrayed Tom onscreen.\n\nWhat follows is a masterful meditation on both the power of escapism movies offer, as well as a trenchant examination of the line separating fantasy and reality; with Allen's portrait here, the border is fairly blurry.",

It's a nice change of pace for Woody, avoiding neurotic and pretentious characters and exchanging them for romantics and idealists -- though no less broken. \"Purple Rose of Cairo\" is about escapism at the movies and the hazardous line between fiction and reality. Though silly, it drops some terrifically poignant lines like \"I just met a wonderful new man. He's fictional, but you can't have everything.\"",

It certainly ranks among the top contenders. It's absolutely delightful! Jeff Daniels was so great in this and I really enjoyed watching him play out these two different characters. Mia Farrow, who typically sort of annoys me, was actually pretty perfect for this role, and the overall concept was beyond wonderful and creative! We've all dreamt of meeting and falling in love with a specific character, whether it be from a movie or book, and this film does such a splendid job of bringing that premise to life! I found myself torn between which of Jeff Daniel's \"characters\" she should choose and end up with...It'd be awfully strange to fall in love with and go on to marry a fictional movie character, and even more so to live within a movie but hey, it'd also be pretty magical! The ending was a little sad, but then again I think it shows that real life doesn't always have a happy ending and by her returning to the theatre in the end, I think it also showed that movies, for all of us, are sort of a form of escapism and they teleport you to a dream-like fantasy.

            "content": "Ask any fan to name Woody Allen's top five films and the usual suspects include Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979). The Purple Rose Of Cairo is another familiar face. In my opinion, it is slightly overrated, but I have to admit that the film showcases Allen at his most creative. Starring Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels, this romantic-comedy is unconventional and hardly contains neurotic dialogue that Allen is so famous for. Yet there is no doubting the quality of the film, which thus far, remains to be one of Allen's most unique efforts.\n\nThe Purple Rose Of Cairo is set in the Depression era and tells the story of Cecilia (Farrow), a poor waitress with a beast of a husband. She spends most of her free time watching movies at a nearby theater, perhaps recognizing that it is the only comforting consistency in her life. While she watches a film entitled The Purple Rose Of Cairo(for the eighth time!), the picture's hero Tom Baxter (Daniels) pops out of the screen into reality to the surprise of Cecilia, the audience and the movie characters. Together, Baxter and Cecilia explore life (and love) as it goes with hilarious circumstances.\n\nWith Baxter literally out of the picture, the cast refuse to carry on acting to the ire of paying moviegoers. Gil Shepherd (Daniels in his second role) who plays Tom Baxter worries that his career will careen downhill. He comes out with a plan to seduce Cecilia. This triangle relationship makes it a fascinating watch. Cecilia falls in love with two men who are, well, the same guy. Baxter is a fantasy; he is fiction- turned-reality. On the other hand, Shepherd is real and far from fiction.\n\nAllen's direction is gentle and soft, allowing his characters space to be themselves. He succeeds in blurring the lines that divide fantasy and reality, giving the film a subtle feel of surrealism. In addition, he uses color and black-and-white scenes to brilliant effect. Reality is painted with drab and dull colors while fantasy is colored so beautifully in black-and-white. Despite the layered narrative, Allen makes the film a breeze to sit through. He ensures there are no serious undertones that lurk beneath the main plot, opting for more comedy and less melodrama. Dramatic scenes are bittersweet and there is always that upbeat feel that radiates from the picture.\n\nThe movie-in-a-movie approach still remains fresh after more than two decades. The Purple Rose Of Cairo is perhaps the director's homage to cinema, to the joy it brings, the illusion it creates, and the magic it weaves. It makes us wonder and dream that maybe one day our favorite actor or actress will come off the screen and sweep us off our feet too. What would we do?\n\nSCORE: 8.5/10\n[www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com]\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED!",

            "content": "\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is an interesting idea gone awry. Its premise is unique. The movie is set in the Depression Era where Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is an unhappily married woman who loves the movies. One night, after a fight with her drunk, unemployed husband, she watches the movie \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" multiple times. One of the characters in the film, Tom Baxtor (Jeff Daniels) falls in love with her and comes out of the screen to be with her! This causes a sensation all over the nation and the real actor, Guild Shepherd (Jeff Daniels) finds his rising career threatened.  In the meantime, Cecilia is feeling loved for the first time in her life but does not know what to do. As these three characters cross each other's paths, they find themselves in a unique love triangle where one character is fictional and hence, perfect while the other is flawed but real. \n\nThe premise is an extremely charming one on paper and the movie is not without its strengths. The dialogues in several places are superb and bring out the difference between reel and real life and its characters well. They also remind us why we love movies so much. It is because, in the end, things always work out one way or the other. This is especially true of the old movies. The characters are always consistent and the movies are our source of escape from the pains of reality. Another strength is in the principal performances. Mia Farrow is beautiful and charming as the confused but kind-hearted Cecilia. She strikes an almost perfect balance in portraying the timidity of her character in the initial reels and her subsequent transformation. Jeff Daniels is so good as both, Tom and Guild. As Tom, he is idealistic, honest, courageous and ultimately somewhat one-dimensional. As Guild, he is convincing as the movie star on the rise who is in love with Cecilia. \n\nHowever, the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem is in the execution of the premise laid out above. Given that the premise is rather fantastical, one expects a more convincing execution. However, here, the manner in which the story unfolds once Tom leaves the screen is rather ludicrous. Moreover, the movie as a whole is dull, clunky and seems too long even at 82 minutes. It fails to engage the viewer except for a few individual scenes. It lacks the romance and the intrigue that is essential to build up in a premise like this. But most of all, its most painful aspect is its cynicism which seems completely out of place in a movie like this. While, at some levels, it is essential in bringing out the contrast between real and reel life, the manner in which it is utilised here is a little too depressing. As far as bittersweet movie experiences go, this one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tad too bitter. Consequently, despite the sincerest efforts of the actors, the movie just fails to impress on the whole. \n\nOverall, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is one of the lesser works of Woody Allen. While it works in some parts, on the whole, the experience is a tad too dull and morose to be memorable. It is a good example of a good idea translating into a forgettable film. Disappointing!",

Sometimes his films can drag but PROC doesn't waste a shot or line of dialogue. The play on the whole 'appearance vs. reality' trick to tell the story of how dreams in celluloid don't always transfer to the everyday was clever. The concept of having a character come right 'out' of the film and into the theatre to change the life of a small town woman is so Brechtian . Allen set the bar for movies that play with the devices and medium of cinema but of course, no filmmaker can do it like he can.This film deserves all the praise and accolades it has received over the years.",
