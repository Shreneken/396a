            "content": "This movie was incredibly annoying. This might be the worst Steven Spielberg film I've ever watched (even though he's not even the director). All the characters act absolutely filthy and braindead (which is sad because these actors went on to do much better things in their lives). The script (yes, there is a script) is just so awful I'm starting to either wonder if the MPAA was dumb or if the script-writers just didn't even care what the age for this film is. In fact, the actual age is so confusing that when I look up Corey Feldman on this site, his bio lies to me about the films he starred in (the site claims that \"Gremlins\" and this film are \"kid-friendly\" even though when you watch them, you'll realize that they're actually not). Anyway, back to this. The story is cliche. The Goonies themselves are so annoying and are just constantly fighting over each other. They yell, swear, fight, and start literally doing not kid-friendly stuff (such as looking up people's skirts and making jokes about a statue's penis). The most annoying character of all, Chunk, gets kidnapped by the villains and literally just cries and whines his ass off for like five minutes in front of them. Literally right in front of them. While the villains threaten to chop his fingers off. What was Spielberg even thinking? You are such a legend and you think that will entertain the kids?! Then he feeds the deformed guy I can't even remember the name of Baby Ruth (wow.) Then the other brats find the ship, Chunk reunites with the kids, then the ship just sails off and eventually sinks. I just don't really care anymore. I know all of you guys like this film, but throughout the movie, I was hoping for all the kids to fall to their deaths or something like that. All I will say is, if you want a good Spielberg film, just watch Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, and all other stuff. This did not deserve my time at all. Even Gremlins is better compared to this. And the fact that my mom likes this film makes this whole thing worse. Just avoid this. Anyone who says this is good is an idiot.",

I felt the pacing and direction was going good in the starting but it started to feel weak in the last 1 hour due to which I started getting bored at one point but overall it is a good film that the whole family should enjoy.

Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden.

Having a few bad people thrown into the mix to make things more difficult creates tension and the possibility of failure. A love interest was obvious at the ages of Brand & Andy, and is a sidebar comedy situation in itself. The way the entire story is neatly sewn together to allow the kids to reign supreme in the end, as well as a parallel of One-Eyed Willy's booby traps that are similar to Mikey's gate-opening design sequence multi-stage mechanisms, show how they both think on the same page on many levels.",

            "content": "The Goonies\n\nThis film is one of my childhood favorites. I practically grew up with this film.\n\n \nThe story is about a gang of criminals on the run while an innocent group of kids get caught up in an adventure. Four of them are a group of boys determined to save their house from being demolished. Another one is the older brother to the boy Mikey (who gets the idea of saving the house) and two girls, one called Andi who is in love with the older brother Brand and another girl tagging along with Andi. Eventually all the kids are caught in a wildcat adventure of getting money to save their house by finding some treasure while along the way they come across the bandits who want the treasure too. \n\nThe film is similar to an Indiana Jones film. It even has the same kid actor from Temple Of Doom. However it's more kid friendly but has the same structure of an Indiana Jones story. Lots of comedy and adventure and thrills. Most of the comedy stems from the fish out of water aspects of where the characters are. As stated, these kids have reasons why they have gone on this adventure. Mikey is the one who gets the idea of saving the house, while his friends, Mouth (the blabbermouth) Chunk (the big eater) and Data (the tech whiz) come along as their homes are in danger of being demolished too. As you can tell by the names, Mikey's friends are pretty eccentric yet have potential talents. Mouth, despite barely shutting up, uses his mouth to his advantage with his gift for Spanish. Chunk may be obsessed with food but he ends up saving his friends after coming in contact with one of the less mean criminals. And Data's inventions prove to be pretty useful along the adventure as silly as they can be.\n Holding this group together is Mikey. The most normal of the group and the guide for the audience. He's pretty much the most relatable low key member of  the group. He's fearless and the most determined out of all his friends despite being the least eccentric.\n Then there's Mikey's brother Brand. He doesn't mind too much about moving and comes along reluctantly as he's trying to protect his brother. It's only when Andi comes along that Brand decides to come along. In turn, Andi comes along because as long as she's with Brand, Andi doesn't mind going on the adventure. While she does overcome her naivety along the journey, learning about the dangers she has put herself in, its not all for the bad. Andi uses her piano skills to help during a perilous part of the adventure. Like Andi, Steff doesn't have any idea of the perils of the journey either but comes along as she shares close ties with Andi. However, unlike Andi, Steff is more cynical and sarcastic and not as na\u00efve as Andi\n\nThe Goonies is a great adventure flick. Even as an adult I still like it. I would recommend it to a friend who would likes fun adventure films.",

It's the movie I compare other 80s movies to when I want to judge just how much of an 80s vibe the other movie gives off. I will say that rewatching it as an adult took some of the magic away as some of the booby traps they navigate through felt redundant and some of the banter didn't really land, but as a result Chunk was even greater comedic relief to me this time than he had been before. The romance subplots felt a little tacked on too, but otherwise the villains were excellent and the child actors acquitted themselves well. The production design was solid, though I have an issue where I noticed that 1982's Poltergeist and 1993's Jurassic Park had practically the exact same prop tree in it and realized that Spielberg has an ultra-distinct style of prop/background design that has made other movies he's involved in look less realistic to me. The score really follows the action well and crescendos at all the appropriate moments. I'll surely rewatch this again in a few years.",

The obvious comparison, again, is \"The Monster Squad\" and the key difference is, in the latter, there's always the sense of real danger for the kids, while in \"The Goonies\" the sensation of urgency and danger is completely dilluted thanks to the Spielberg-disneyesque production company having all its footprints over the film.",

Despite my lack of interest in censorship, showing the underage Andy's panties in the car scene is creeperstown from Spielberg, and the family can't have that anymore.
