    "summary": "During World War I, two British soldiers -- Lance Cpl. Schofield and Lance Cpl. Blake -- receive seemingly impossible orders. In a race against time, they must cross over into enemy territory to deliver a message that could potentially save 1,600 of their fellow comrades -- including Blake's own brother.",

            "content": "If you want to watch a shallow lead painfully bumble through two hours of awful decisions no soldier would ever make while taking in a lot of really great cinematography - have at it.\n\nThe last 2/3 of the movie I was checking regularly to see how much more I would have to sit through.\n\nIt's sort of the movie equivalent of that dream where you know what you need to do but can't do it somehow. The whole movie - just bad decision after bad decision. Go into the undoubtedly-booby-trapped bunker and set off a booby trap. Investigate meaningless buildings instead of avoiding them. Don't check captured enemies for weapons. Stand in the fatal funnel when you open the door that you KNOW an enemy is behind. Go straight through the town. Drop your weapon. Wait for the sweet song to end before telling everyone why you're there.\n\nIf you know anything about soldiering and war - watching this is torture. It feels like a bunch of artsy historians and zero actual soldiers were consulted in the making of this film.\n\nStunning visuals of one of the worst wars in history are its only saving grace, but most of that's done by the halfway point.",

            "content": "\"1917\" directed by Sam Mendes, is a war film that depicts the harrowing journey of two young British soldiers, Schofield and Blake, who are tasked with delivering a message deep into enemy territory to call off a planned attack that could lead to the deaths of thousands of soldiers, including Blake's brother.\n\nThe movie was widely acclaimed and received numerous accolades for its exceptional cinematography, immersive storytelling, and compelling performances by the cast.\n\nOne of the most outstanding aspects of \"1917\" is the way it was filmed. The entire movie was shot to appear as one continuous take, giving the audience a sense of being alongside the characters on their perilous journey. The long takes and seamless camera movements were masterfully executed by cinematographer Roger Deakins, who won an Academy Award for his work on the film. The visuals are stunning, capturing the beauty and brutality of war simultaneously.\n\nThe film's storytelling is equally impressive, taking the audience through a range of emotions as they follow the two soldiers on their mission. The tension builds throughout the movie as the soldiers encounter various obstacles and challenges, and the audience is left on the edge of their seats, wondering if they will make it to their destination in time.\n\nThe performances by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, who play Schofield and Blake, respectively, were outstanding. The two actors were able to convey a range of emotions through their subtle gestures and expressions, making their characters feel authentic and relatable. The supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Mark Strong, all deliver strong performances as well.\n\nOverall, \"1917\" is a powerful and emotionally gripping film that captures the horrors of war and the bravery of soldiers in a way that is both compelling and unforgettable. It is a must-see movie for anyone interested in cinema, history, or human resilience.",

            "content": "This film truly captures the brutality and horrors of the First World War. The cinematography is outstanding, with the camera work giving the viewer a real sense of the devastation and chaos of the battlefield.\n\nThe plot follows two young soldiers, Blake and Schofield, who are sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message that could save the lives of 1,600 men. The journey is perilous and fraught with danger, as the two men must navigate enemy lines and treacherous terrain to reach their destination. One aspect of the film that truly impressed me was the way it portrayed the futility of war. The soldiers are depicted as pawns in a larger game, with their lives being sacrificed for the sake of political and strategic goals. This message is conveyed without being overly preachy or didactic, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost of conflict.\n\nThe performances of the actors are also noteworthy. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver excellent performances as Blake and Schofield, respectively. The supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Mark Strong, also gives strong performances. Overall, I highly recommend 1917 to anyone who is interested in history, war movies, or just great filmmaking in general. It is a gripping and emotional journey that will leave you breathless and with a newfound appreciation for the sacrifices made by those who fought in the Great War.",

Every actor did a great job but obviously George MacKay carries the film as he is the one we follow. Which brings me to the awesome \"one take\" camera work.

            "content": "I thought I was not in the habit of commenting on movies I didn't like, because it's nicer to talk about what we like instead. But since there is no major Oscar-nominated performance this year (except of course the \"Joker\", which should be discussed somewhere else), and undeserved praise comes for really bad examples of movies that should not be watched, I decided to look back at the following title, from the director Sam Mendes, whose other films left me indifferent.\n\nPlease note that the commentary will consist mainly of spoilers, because there is nothing else to comment on. The only praise for this movie is the truly impressive long shots, which could be considered a masterpiece, if only they were better integrated with rather poor CGI effects, and served a basic story, that is pure clich\u00e9, and nothing more than that.\n\nThere is no comment on acting because there is no any reason for that. Benedict Cumberbatch and Collin Firth appear too briefly in the film to make any contribution to the plot, leaving only the wooden appearances of the other actors, in all either dull, or impossible situations. From the very beginning, the two main characters stand out from their surroundings, as they just exit from the beauty salon, unlike the other characters with faces and clothes dirty, as the soldiers should be. They are given an impossible task, which seem only they can accomplish. One dies in an attempt to rescue an enemy pilot without any logic. From that moment on, every step is predictable to the end. The rest of the hero arrives to meet even a female person who, apart from mere appearance, is of no relevance to the story. At crucial moments, he even leaves the weapon, so that by some miracle, avoiding all the bullets of the enemy, he will reach the target.\n\nThe most irritating of all l'art pour l'artistic shots, that are too many in this movie, is when the long run in front of the trench is shown at the end, when the unfortunate hero runs and collides with soldiers who, like a miracle, constantly emerge from the same trench, in order to get to the command and stop this futile attack (it would seem, as futile as this movie is). It would have been easier if he had remained to run in an empty trench, since the attack had already begun, when only these soldiers would not constantly sprout from nowhere. Or, to run behind, instead of in front of the trench, because there is no one there, but in that case we would not have such a long and beautifully shot frame, would we?\n\nUnfortunately, this movie failed to be the anything else but the annoying attempt of an imitation of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" portrayed in World War I. Why the title is exactly this year, and what does it have to do with the fictional event being described, remains a mystery.",

Its thrilling action, to personal perspective storytelling enhances the audience's engagement for feeling and sparks a connection between its viewers and its characters.\n\nSam Mendes and Roger Deakins bring visually easy on the eye, spectacular shots to the big screen for 2019, and its decade for film. The movies natural look strengthened the story, and due to the correct use of specific color choices and amazing cinematography skills from Deakins, the film purifies and shows us the beauty side of war, and its attractivity of violence.\n\nThe impressive use of long tracking shots puts us in perspective of the film. Effortlessly the lacking in noticeability in cutting helps pull of such an effect.\n\nThis film also has its dark side, and being a war film, its easily understandably not its own fault. The audience doesn't need another war film to tell them about the crazy, treacherous side of war. For the viewers who want to watch that experience, its easily agreeable that Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins bring something to 1917 that not every other war film has been able to bring to the screen.\n\nThe film does a great job with identifying friendships during a war, and how an enemy solider has their own perspective of thought even when is the worst situations possible. The film explores how a civilian can be impacted, and how the rank hierarchy affects soldiers too, even when given specific rules to follow.\n\n1917 has a runtime of 1 hour and 59 minutes, and was shot using the ARRI Alexa Mini LF. The camera is a digital cinema camera that pulls of a clean slick look, that other war films shot on film can not often do.\n\nThe films story is living moment by moment, as the characters can be affected so easily by a small crack in their path, its almost unrealistic how lucky, and easily the characters feel on their purpose in war. Yes there may be emotion, but the characters are easily changed and soon recovered back to their normal selves, and only strike back when something serious happens, the thought of their purpose in the film is upsettingly unrealistic due to their perspective during their \"lucky\" mission.\n\nBy the end of the film, with its closing shots, its brings the normal viewer relief, after a vicious desperate journey across the concept of war, and what soldiers had to experience, it serves as a salute to those whom fought, and to those whom passed. The film does an exceptionally outstanding job for that concept.",

It is truly a master class in filmmaking to seamlessly tell a story in a single cut. \n\nThe mission itself is the point, where the will to live and save lives, to sacrifice for the greater good, can infect even the most nonchalant of protagonists. In turn, such sacrifice can lead to inner peace and resolution of old hurts. \n\nThere are moments of utter terror where our heroes are running for their lives and complete peace where they take a moment to enjoy the miracle of life itself.

It was a revolutionary film from a cinematographic aspect and the costumes/scenery was absolutely splendid but the story was simple and the acting from supporting characters were quite dull.

Mendes once again proves himself to be one of the best directors of the 2010s, and the cast proves extremely talented in each of their roles. The cinematography was groundbreaking, and the special effects were done extremely well.

The soundtrack was also fantastic and fit the film very well. Overall, a must-watch war movie that is sure to become a timeless masterpiece.",

Mantiene en suspenso al espectador y al borde de su asiento en cada escena potentemente tensa. Sam Mendes reconstruye de una forma cre\u00edble y evocadora los escenarios requeridos para revivir la primera guerra mundial y convierte una historia sencilla en una experiencia repleta de suspenso y tensi\u00f3n acompa\u00f1ada de planos secuencia incesantes que consiguen capturar la emoci\u00f3n y brindar una experiencia sublime, que te hace sentir como si se estuviese viviendo la guerra en primera persona. NO es una obra que entrega violencia gratuita omnipresente, pero logra ser cruda y revivir una historia cruenta, lo cual me pareci\u00f3 excelente. Es una monta\u00f1a rusa llena de altibajos, no es una cinta perfecta; en lo personal me pareci\u00f3 que la cinta fue decayendo en  la segunda mitad, siendo ocasionalmente inveros\u00edmil, reduciendo el suspenso y sustituy\u00e9ndolo por acci\u00f3n, y culminando en un final que si bien no es malo, es bastante simple comparado con el desarrollo de la historia. Sin embargo, es una buena pel\u00edcula, con buenos efectos especiales y CGI bien elaborados, pero con defectos que desmeritan su calidad. La recomiendo much\u00edsimo para aquellos que disfrutan del suspenso y historias bien contadas y atrapantes. 7,9 de 10.",

This movie hit every single mark I have for a great movie, and it actually gets better with each viewing. I watched it three times in the theater before COVID shut down the venues, and would go to a theater showing today if it were available.

No es fren\u00e9tica, pero da una sensaci\u00f3n real de primera persona y de que est\u00e1s haciendo el viaje con el protagonista. Yo creo que lo que mas se destaca de la pel\u00edcula es su hermosa cinematograf\u00eda y paisajes asombrosos. Tambi\u00e9n destaca el trabajo de c\u00e1mara por parte de Sam Mendes, que hace un trabajo excepcional dando la sensaci\u00f3n de que la pel\u00edcula esta filmada toda en una sola toma, y eso esta implementado de una manera tremenda. Las actuaciones son muy buenas y realistas, destaco principalmente a George MacKay, aunque todo el reparto es perfecto. Adem\u00e1s, la m\u00fasica y todo el sonido en general de la pel\u00edcula es sobresaliente. Por otro lado, estuve entretenido durante toda la pel\u00edcula; raro ya que este tipo de historias me suelen aburrir. Hay algunas pausas en la trama que le permiten al espectador recuperar el aliento. Finalmente, no me di cuenta del tiempo que pasaba con esta pel\u00edcula, me quede con ganas de ver mucho mas. En conclusi\u00f3n, creo que es una obra maestra del genero b\u00e9lico que logra cautivarte a trav\u00e9s de su historia y de sus audiovisuales. Muy recomendada.",

In terms of camerawork, this is the best movie EVER made, in my opinion. So thumbs up for Roger Deakins. \nAnd as for the plot, it's a pretty basic formula, where someone gets a mission to complete.

            "content": "If you can overlook the stupidity of the central premise of Sam Mendes' '1917', there's a good bit to enjoy about it. But, it can be difficult to ignore the idea that any General, worth his salt, would send two men through seemingly abandoned enemy lines to pass on a message to another position, when there is air power that can be utilised instead that would have a much better chance of success and at a speedier rate too. But the hook which Mendes hangs his narrative coat on sees two British Army non-coms, Tom Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Will Schofield (George MacKay), being \"volunteered\" to bring an important communique to the 2nd Batt. Devonshire Reg. to hold off on an attack on German lines south of Arras, on the Western Front in April 1917. The Germans have \"retreated\" (presumably to the Hindenburg Line) and the British believe that they have \"the hun on the run\". However, aerial reconnaissance has shown that this is not the case and sixteen hundred men are possibly heading into a trap. The mission also has a special added importance for Lance Corporal Blake as his brother is in the regiment that's set to go \"over the top\".\n\nThe fanciful set up of '1917' is certainly not anything we haven't seen in war movies before. Reducing the story down to a few individuals on a mission is a staple of war movies, as there is always the danger of audience confusion of who's who when confronted by too many characters, and armies, whether at platoon, battalion, brigade or whatever level have so many characters.to keep track of. So 1917's \"men on patrol behind enemy lines\" is familiar territory, even if the war it's taking place in hasn't been the subject of too many movies. There were, of course, \"runners\" who were used to send messages back and forth between the forward and rear trenches during the First World War (a certain Adolf Hitler was one) and it was an extremely dangerous job. But their utilisation here is a complete flight of fancy. But, if one ignores the unrealistic set up, there is enough realism to be found elsewhere for those of a certain bend toward that direction.\n\nOf course, no war movie has ever been a truly realistic depiction of man's most awful pursuit, but the little details that '1917' gets right are pretty admirable in that regard. The long scene at the beginning of teh film detailing Blake and Schofield's meandering trek through their own forward trench shows us a decent representation of what it was like on the British front line. Likewise, the uniforms the two wear are quite accurate, including the badge on Lance Corporal Blake's Brodie helmet and the leather jerkins that were a common sight on \"Tommies\" during the period.\n\nIn fact, from a technical perspective, '1917' does an admirable job indeed and seen on a big screen it's a fairly immersive experience, especially if you have a interest in the war. It's just the story that lets it down, while not completely sinking the whole picture and, perhaps, if it wasn't so well produced, it wouldn't be getting the high praise that it has received upon its release, not to mention the Oscar nods. Obviously, central to this praise has the set design by Dennis Gassner and Roger Deakins' excellent cinematography, which has rightly been lauded, even though I wasn't that impressed by the pseudo one shot gimmick he employed. Curiously though, it's up for a Best Writing award too.\n\nIt's directed well enough, without any kind of revelations in that respect and it's acted decently by the two leads. There are also a number of familiar faced cameos to spot as well, for people who want to play that game.\n\n'1917' is a pretty good movie, while never being amazing, and it has some gruelling battlefield scenes that can be wince inducing in a commendable way. It also offers some views of the First World War that are rarely seen in movies about that conflict as the story strays from the trenches that we are all familiar with and associate with that particular conflict. So, while I wouldn't expect to be bowled over by any of it, it's two hours are a relatively entertaining way to pass the time even if it's all rather predictable.",

Although my brain has been conditioned for scene-breaks at certain moments, I found the directorial decision refreshing. While all war is Hell, World War One's iteration is always considered some of the most hellish as men \u2014 boys really, a lot of them were just boys \u2014 scurry from their holes and rush headlong into certain death. The plot is a simple one, and one as old as time, as an \"Accidental Hero,\" \"False Protagonist,\" whatever trope you want to call it, Lance Corporal William Schofield (George MacKay) is selected to aid his comrade (Dean-Charles Chapman) in a death-defying mission simply because he was sitting nearby. The mission, if successful, will save (or prolong) the lives of 1,600 British soldiers. Lance Corporal Thomas Blake (Chapman) has a personal stake in the outcome \u2014 his older brother is with the frontline regiment \u2014 but Schofield solely has the motivation for duty to one's country; a duty that doesn't always seem worth it. What we get is a \"man behind enemy lines\" story that is filled with as much action as there are bloated bodies floating down the river. I'm annoyed with myself for not viewing 1917 earlier, as Dunkirk didn't wow me and WWI was more known for soldiers losing their minds in the underground tunnels from the incessant shelling than for gripping, cinematic heroics. As for \"the run,\" the promotional scene for the movie, was better than I had imagined. We get snippets of some of our favorite British actors \u2014 Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Richard Madden \u2014 but Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie was my favorite supporting character, sending our two heroes off in a baptism of scotch. The ending said to me, \"We might end up where we started, but we'll never be the same,\" and I liked that. 1917 reminds us why movies are special.",

Chapman especially shines through his fantastic ability to express so much through simply his eyes. Unless we believe wholeheartedly in the relationship between the two leads it would not have the effect it needs to have, and Chapman and MacKay give wonderful, very touching performances.\n\nWhen tackling World War 1 on the big screen it is essential to capture the utter madness of those four years and Mendes does that and then some. Beautifully scripted, beautifully shot, beautifully directed and beautifully acted. \n\nIn my eyes the greatest film this century and the best British film since The Third Man.

This military history student especially appreciated the attention to historical detail shown by the cast, creative crew, and the screenplay; the revised history showing senior officers being concerned about casualties and wanting to prevent unnecessary losses in contrast to the oft-repeated myth of \"lions led by donkeys\" is a welcome addition, as is the film's showing Indian Army soldiers assisting the British to remind us that the British Empire was represented by more than just white men, though the latter is somewhat anachronistic as most Indian troops had left the Western Front by 1917. The story is consistently engaging despite certain inconsistencies.

In the British trenches, with field telephone lines cut, two young British lance corporals, William Schofield (George MacKay), a veteran of the Somme, and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off a scheduled attack the next morning that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother Joseph, a lieutenant...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Hard-hitting, immersive, and an impressive technical achievement, 1917 captures the trench warfare of World War I with raw, startling immediacy.\" Several critics named the film among the best of 2019, including Kate Erbland of IndieWire and Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter. Writing for the Hindustan Times, Rohan Naahar stated, \"I can only imagine the effect 1917 will have on audiences that aren't familiar with the techniques Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins are about to unleash upon them.\" In his review for NPR, Justin Chang was less positive. He agreed the film was a \"mind-boggling technical achievement\" but did not think it was that spectacular overall, as Mendes's style with its impression of a continuous take \"can be as distracting as it is immersive\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film, \"A carefully organized and sanitized war picture [...] that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.\" Alison Willmore of Vulture compared it unfavourably to the war film Dunkirk (2017), writing, \"The artifice of the aesthetic premise overwhelms any of the film's other intentions.\"\n\n\"1917\" has great cinematography with never seems to end shots, editing, sceneries and direction from Sam Mendes. But, it also has wobbly and not convicing acting, a formulaic storyline, no proper emotional balance and it\u00b4s a way too slowpaced film that never really takes off. Plus the ending is just a puff of smoke to me. A disappointment in my book. Had huge hopes. The film was nevertheless a critical and box office success, grossing $384.9 million worldwide. Among its accolades, it received ten nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, and three wins, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Mixing.",

He also play with the light settings to make a breathtaking atmosphere but still realistic. These outstanding filming techniques make us live this absorbing adventure. The acting is convincing see spectacular, we feel the emotions of the characters like stress, sadness or hatred. And the script is easily understandable but so touching.

Rather than making a traditional war film based around combat and the plight of soldiers, 1917's story is akin to Christopher Nolan's film Dunkirk. Like that film, the tension and theme is suspense and survival. We follow two soldiers who act as messengers between two british troops. They must warn the other troop to not go into battle, as they would be falling into a trap. Shot and edited to mimic a one shot visual experience, Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins create a tour de force experience. The two men have crafted a film based around the survival of these messengers, and how they must go against all odds to get their message to the receiver. There are some really amazing scenes in the film which use the one shot technique to its full capacity. Deakins has delivered some of his best cinematography in his career, and continues to show why he's one of the greatest cinematographers in film history. Mendes delivers his best film since Skyfall, as he brings a simple story into a crazy ride of survival. The way he flows from one setting to the other is spectacular, and he shows great attention to detail. The two lead actors do a splendid job with what they are given, with cameos from some famous british actors helping fill out the remainder of the cast. One of the best films of 2019 for sure.",

The acting is nigh-on risible (could you have chosen 2 more wooden lead actors?), the dialogue boring, there is no deepening of character, the ridiculous coincidences (how likely was it that that plane would crash just a few feet away from them?), why did they go into the German bunker at all? Why didn't they just go round it? I could see that rat was going to trigger the tripwire from a mile off - why didn't they anticipate it quicker? And how come they weren't blown to smithereens? How come the Germans were such bad shots? I mean, running down an alley between 2 walls - you couldn't miss! Yet they all did. Except for one, when the British soldier was blown several feet backwards by the German sniper (whom he had wounded with a random shot through a window - okay, it could happen, but come on, but then he just banged his head and got up again - hold on, was he shot or not - I don't get it? And why exactly did he run through the troops storming over the top of the bunker when he could have just waited for them to leave the trench and THEN run to the commanding officer? Wouldn't that have been quicker? Duh. Listen, it's easy to pick holes in a plot, but there are so many in this film that it could be Swiss cheese.",

The two main characters are intensely human and incredibly well acted, and continual appearance of well-known faces in minor roles seems to draw the audience into mimicking the soldier's respect of their leaders. By following the footsteps of the two protagonists we get a strong climpse of what the Front experience was like: the stress, the mess, the constant threat and psychological damage it caused. The film captures the importance of diplomatic solutions that we still need to internalise as a species.",

In this gritty World War 1 movie you get to see the brutality of war with the two main main characters who act as messengers for the British in a sense. The two main characters have to cross enemy lines and the way they do it in the movie is so gut wrenching and enjoyable. This movie has some of the best cinematography with the greatest long take that I've seen in any movie. This movie didn't need long takes but it was incredibly appreciated and the way they blended in the cuts made it seem like the movie was just one long take, it was brilliant. The only reason this movie doesn't receive a 10/10 is due to some slow parts that didn't add to the story and were kind of pointless and aggravating in the end, but as the movie stands its an amazing watch from the cinematography alone. The acting is also very well done with actors playing great roles and adding emotional depth that is enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. If you like war movies or movies with just great camera work in general then this is a must watch for you.",

Dos cabos del ej\u00e9rcito brit\u00e1nico, William Schofield y Tom Blake (George MacKay y Dean-Charles Chapman, respectivamente) son enviados a llevar una nota para detener la ofensiva de otro batall\u00f3n ingl\u00e9s sobre las l\u00edneas alemanas a las que cree en retirada, cuando en realidad los alemanes se replegaron all\u00ed para emboscarlo. Una verdadera misi\u00f3n suicida, estimulada sin embargo con el aliciente del reencuentro de Blake  con su hermano en ese batall\u00f3n.\n\n1917 es una asombrosa experiencia inmersiva en los horrores de la guerra de trincheras de la Primera Guerra Mundial, filmada en un (casi) plano secuencia que acompa\u00f1a en todo momento a los protagonistas, por lo que la pel\u00edcula transcurre pr\u00e1cticamente en tiempo real. En ciertos momentos, el car\u00e1cter b\u00e9lico cede su lugar pr\u00e1cticamente al cine de terror. La an\u00e9cdota, entonces, es m\u00ednima, as\u00ed como los personajes. La potencia de las im\u00e1genes, del sonido y de la m\u00fasica (de Thomas Newman) es portentosa. La fotograf\u00eda de Roger Deakins (multipremiada, as\u00ed como la pel\u00edcula en general) es bell\u00edsima y sus virajes son fundamentales en la creaci\u00f3n de los diferentes climas de la pel\u00edcula. Hay una secuencia nocturna que es sencillamente antol\u00f3gica por su tensi\u00f3n, su est\u00e9tica y la variedad de sentimientos y sensaciones que pone en juego y produce.\n\n\n\n\nCierta cr\u00edtica le ha objetado a esta pel\u00edcula del ecl\u00e9ctico Sam Mendes dos aspectos centrales que en mi opini\u00f3n son virtudes. Uno de ellos es que las peripecias de los protagonistas y el plano secuencia en movimiento asemejan la percepci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula a la experiencia a un videojuego. \u00bfY no ser\u00e1 al rev\u00e9s?\u00bfLos video juegos simplemente no reflejan acaso la experiencia de la guerra y sobre todo ahora con sus aspectos de control remoto y virtual? La Primera Guerra fue una guerra de trincheras laber\u00ednticas.\n\nLa otra cr\u00edtica es la falta de \"historia personal\" de los protagonistas, lo cual les quitar\u00eda profundidad psicol\u00f3gica. 1917 en este sentido se parece a Dunkerque: aborda a sus personajes in media res, es decir, en pleno frente batalla. Pues debo decir que esa \"falta\" y la sencillez de sus motivaciones ubica a los protagonistas en la piel de verdaderos \"soldados an\u00f3nimos\".\n\n1917 es de esas pel\u00edculas que uno lamenta no haber visto en el cine, un despliegue cinematogr\u00e1fico con may\u00fasculas al servicio de una historia de guerra donde la desesperaci\u00f3n y el deber se dan la mano.\n\nIt runs 1917 on the French front. Two British Army corporals, William Schofield and Tom Blake (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, respectively) are sent to carry a note to stop the offensive of another English battalion on German lines that he believes are in retreat, when in fact the Germans fell back there to ambush him. A true suicide mission, stimulated however by the incentive of Blake's reunion with his brother in that battalion.\n\n1917 is an astonishing immersive experience in the horrors of the trench warfare of World War I, filmed in a (almost) shot sequence that accompanies the protagonists at all times, so the film takes place practically in real time. At certain times, the warlike character gives way practically to horror movies. The anecdote, then, is minimal, as well as the characters. The power of images, sound and music (by Thomas Newman) is prodigious. Roger Deakins' photography (multi-award winning, as well as the film in general) is beautiful and his twists are fundamental in creating the different climates of the film. There is a nocturnal sequence that is simply anthological because of its tension, its aesthetics and the variety of feelings and sensations that it brings into play and produces.\n\nSome critics have objected to this film by the eclectic Sam Mendes two central aspects that in my opinion are virtues. One of them is that the adventures of the protagonists and the sequence shot in motion resemble the perception of the film to the experience of a video game. And will it not be the other way around? Video games simply don't reflect the experience of war and especially now with its remote and virtual control aspects? The First War was a labyrinthine trench warfare.\n\nThe other criticism is the lack of \"personal history\" of the protagonists, which would take away psychological depth. 1917 in this sense resembles Dunkirk: it addresses its characters in media res, that is, in the middle of the battle front. Well, I must say that this \"lack\" and the simplicity of their motivations places the protagonists in the shoes of true \"anonymous soldiers.\"\n\n1917 is one of those films that one regrets not having seen in the cinema, a cinematographic display with capital letters at the service of a war story where despair and duty go hand in hand.",

But it also feels a little bit awkward sometimes too. But I praise this film for showing us the very realistic and gruesome conditions of the soldier during World War I, the visuals of this movie are absolutely breathtaking. It's a movie of courage, strength and determination. And it's elevated by two strong acts by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman. Overall, 1917 is a British war movie of quality, I found it interesting, but I wouldn't call it the best war movie either. Recommended!!",

El \u00fanico problema es que ambos est\u00e1n solos, van contra reloj y tienen que atravesar territorio hostil. \nUna pel\u00edcula que dura cerca de dos horas, pero, a pesar de este tiempo y la tem\u00e1tica b\u00e9lica, no se vuelve tediosa o aburrida, sino m\u00e1s bien, desde los primeros minutos la cinta te atrapa y te hace part\u00edcipe de la misi\u00f3n de los protagonistas. Por lo que cuando menos sientes ya ha pasado m\u00e1s de la mitad del filme, y ni te has dado cuenta.\nEsto debido a la impresionante puesta en escena que realiza el director Sam Mendes, junto a la fotograf\u00eda de Roger Deakins, en el que utilizan el plano secuencia para narrar la historia. Un plano que sigue las acciones de los protagonistas de forma l\u00ednea, adoptando puntos de vista de los soldados para lograr una inmersi\u00f3n del espectador en el drama que viven, haci\u00e9ndonos un acompa\u00f1ante de ellos y compartiendo su angustia o esp\u00edritu de lucha.\nEl uso de esta falsa secuencia \u00fanica hace que no te despegues de la cinta ya que no hay tiempo para poner una pausa o para volver atr\u00e1s porque el tiempo est\u00e1 corriendo. En este sentido, el director tambi\u00e9n sabe jugar muy bien con la intensidad de la pel\u00edcula y es que debido a ser una \u00fanica toma por secuencia podr\u00eda tornarse aburrida, sin embargo, se mezclan muy bien las secuencias llena acci\u00f3n para despu\u00e9s ir un poco m\u00e1s lento y llenarnos de angustia.\nIgualmente, Sam Mendes logra coordinar a la perfecci\u00f3n todos los aspectos t\u00e9cnicos que ocurren en los sets a campo abierto dando la apariencia de que todo est\u00e1 planeado detalladamente. Hasta este punto me gustar\u00eda hacerte la invitaci\u00f3n a ver el detr\u00e1s de c\u00e1maras de la pel\u00edcula ya que te sorprender\u00e1s sobre la forma en la que fue grabada esta cinta.\nAs\u00ed mismo, el uso que le dan a los escenarios con las trincheras es muy bueno ya que estas marcan una forma lineal que, indirectamente, dan la sensaci\u00f3n de no acabar aumentando el suspenso en el espectador en especial al momento de crear el cl\u00edmax final de la pel\u00edcula.\nPor otra parte, la banda sonora de Thomas Newman tambi\u00e9n es un punto importante a destacar, ya que aporta en la construcci\u00f3n de las escenas al momento de crear la tensi\u00f3n y suspenso con unos efectos de sonido muy buenos. Por lo que si vez esta pel\u00edcula desde la comodidad de tu hogar te recomiendo el uso de aud\u00edfonos o un buen equipo de sonido para una mejor experiencia.\nY si bien, el filme logra generar emoci\u00f3n, suspenso y un poco de terror ante lo que se muestra en pantalla, el desarrollo de los personajes se queda un bastante corto. Ya que en ning\u00fan momento se logra que el espectador se apegue o conecte emocionalmente con los protagonistas y que a partir de esto se generen esas sensaciones iniciales, sino que, m\u00e1s parece que en realidad es gracias a la experiencia que se vive junto a ellos y no por ellos.\nEsto debido tambi\u00e9n a la falta de di\u00e1logos que hay en la cinta lo cual provoca que no se construya una narrativa a partir de los personajes sino a partir de lo que se ve que hacen. En este sentido, impacta bastante lo que ellos transmiten corporalmente porque as\u00ed nosotros como audiencia que los acompa\u00f1a sentimos en parte lo que ellos sienten.\nEn definitiva, esta pel\u00edcula b\u00e9lica se gana su puesto dentro del g\u00e9nero y variando un poco en el contexto ya que visibilizan los hechos de la primera guerra mundial. Y tambi\u00e9n establece una reflexi\u00f3n enmarcada en un mensaje de esperanza e inspiraci\u00f3n que se refleja m\u00e1s que nada en las acciones de los protagonistas en un gran despliegue t\u00e9cnico que se vuelve sublime.",

Yet, that's what they did and the result is a pacing and a set that always feels incredibly 'off'.\n\nI don't like the acting performance either, but I don't want to blame that on the actors themselves, but rather the writing. There's no way to give a believable performance when you've got a script that doesn't allow for any pause or moments of consideration. It all falls very flat if you ask me. Giving each act no more than 5 minutes of stage time might work well at a circus, but it's a poor way of making a movie.\n\nThe next time you need to deliver a message across a short field, just use a megaphone.

One of the most astonishing parts of the movie is, of course, cinematography. The entire movie is filmed like if it does not have any cuts, although once you re-watch it, you can clearly see where they were put. The operator, Roger Deakins, did a tremendous job of letting the viewer dive into the feeling of World War I, for which he got an Oscar, which is absolutely deserved. \t\nThe movie is taking the viewer on a journey of two young men delivering a message to the commanders. While a viewer is on the journey, because of a marvelous work of both actors playing two main heroes, he is basically taking an emotional trip. In some moments of the movie I really felt what the actors felt, as the true horrors of war are shown, such terms as trench warfare and no man's land are described really clearly, as well as the movie is historically accurate, which is very rare for modern movies. One of the best moments in the movie is the plane scene, as it is one of the greatest scenes I have seen in years, as it is showing that both sides had feelings, human feelings, which were changed drastically because of the \"War to end all wars\".",

The first act of the movie was extremely good, but as soon as the two deuteragonists reached the farmhouse, the movie went down from there. I was expecting a similar tale to All Quiet on the Western Front, and the \"camarade, camarade, camarade\" moment with Paul Baumer.\n\nWhat do we get instead? Bloodthirsty Germans with little describable difference between themselves and Nazis. When your life is saved and you're pulled from the burning wreckage of your plane, outnumbered 2:1, whose first response wouldn't be to stab and kill your saviors?  The majority of men in both World War I and World War II did not shoot to kill, as Lindybeige details in his YouTube video. You have to be trained to be that bloodthirsty, and that training did not exist in the German Empire.\n\nThen, as one of the deuteragonists dies from blood loss in front of a BURNING BUILDING, neither of them think to cauterize the wound to try and stop the bleeding. Yes, soldiers actually did know what cauterizing a wound was in World War I. A short time later, and we then get essentially what is the same as the \"White Savior\" trope, where the heroic British soldier gives food to the starving French woman and child, suffering under the evil Germans.\n\nOnce again, there was a moment for a \"camarade\" moment with the young German, who is instead strangled to death. If the soldier had remained quiet, but the other drunk soldier had called the guards, then this would have been a much, much more powerful moment humanizing both the English and the Germans. Instead, it succeeds in further demonizing Germans as bloodthirsty devils as this movie has done excellently so far.\n\nOn a final note, it was obvious because of the trailer showing the deuteragonist running perpendicular to men rushing out of the trench that he doesn't make it there in time to call off the order. The trailer completely spoiled the ending of this movie.",

Couldn't find the cut in \"Birdman\", but that was no Hitchcock film.  Here, In 1917, the cut was easy to see: after about an hour, the screen goes blank for about 5 seconds then the hero appears, having fallen down a concrete staircase.  The hero has been out for a while, so the cut works, but it's so obvious.  That said, once the tension ramps up after a rather slow 15 minute opening, the film never lets up. warning: there will be tears at your house.  The last hour or so is thrilling, horrific, beautiful, and oh so very sad.  Yes, as far as war films go, this is no \"Apocalypse Now\" or \"Full Metal Jacket\", but director Mendez hasn't reached the heights of Kubrick...although he might.  I found the performances solid, but not sensational. And the destruction of all that magnificent architecture, and of course the loss of almost an entire generation of young men, is so hard to accept.  Let's hope as humans we never see this type of thing - in the real world - again.",

The only reason I saw this movie is because this movie won the golden globe for best drama so this movie is basically going to win the Oscar. And man this movie got me. I cared so much for the two main guys and I wanted them to make it so bad. And then the movie pulled the thing that I knew they were going to do but I didn't know when they would. But man when they did it I wasn't expecting it. The musical score in this movie makes the movie what it is. So the Oscar in my opinion has to go to this movie. But hold on why the flip is the two main guys not nominated for an Oscar. I know they're basically nobodies but still, their performances are some of the best I've seen this year. Oscars make no sense. The cinematography is also beautiful and also deserves the Oscar. I was legit on the edge of my seat watching this movie and man this movie already has an iconic scene. That running scene that's in the trailers just a little bit but in the movie you're rooting for him. It's a full rocky moment right there. And also this movie feels like the most stressful video game in the world aka war so hopefully we don't get into any wars in the future. Final thought and little criticism, when Sam mendes at the golden globes said this movie is shot in one take fake news it is. I can clearly tell when they took a break and I know it's basically impossible to film an entire shot in one take but he tried and failed so stop promoting it then. But besides that this is a Great War movie that I never expected to be worth my time. I'll maybe watch this movie again if it's on ITunes for 4 bucks.",

It's not your typical war film as there's not that much shooting and such but it's more about the journey. The production is the most impressive and important thing here.\n\nSome very long scenes, and it's doing a nice job trying to look as a one shot film. It's not but there are some very nice cuts here making it look constant. I dig the colors and sound and taht dreamy part that's so very needed when the film easily could have turned repitative or flatter. It's not very intense, but some scenes sure give you some adrenaline boosts. Nice acting and a good story and a fresh, new-ish take and a classic film concept. It works very well.\n\n8 out of 10 trenches.",

I don't think its that great, it's just a movie about a guy who wants to deliver a message to save 1600 of his fellow comrades. but after I watched this movie I'm proud to say that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my whole life.\n\n1917 is a movie that shows you every single thing that every single soldier went through during world war 1, really enjoyed every single thing about the movie from the music to the customs to the cinematography to the scriptwriting. The movie shows us the disgusting stuff that they went through. This movie is so deep and emotional, 2 hours passed by so fast I didn't even feel it, I didn't even want the movie to come to an end. And I saved the best for the last, the fact that the movie is a \"one-shot\" is just unbelievable, you are literally there In every single thing they are going through or doing, some people will say that its boring (because of the one-shot), but the director wants you to be there in every single scene and every single detail that's why its a \"one-shot\"\n\nA perfect movie that would be better to watch on the big screen (Would be way better if its IMAX) unless you won't have the perfect experience.

The troops are too clean and tidy, the fields are too fresh, the trenches have too obviously just been dug with a back hoe, and the field hospitals look like they were created with the last few dollars of the production budget.

The certainty that the film is shot with one shot gives us the experience of experiencing combat with the two troopers because it's as if we're one of the cadets following them, and going into combat with them and this enables us to experience fearfulness and apprehension with them as well. The same kind of occurrence is experienced briefly in the war classic Saving Private Ryan where the audience briefly experiences World War 2 through Captain Miller's eyes when they are enabled to barely hear anything along with Captain Miller. There were even a couple moments where I cringed in fear not just because they were very loud moments but moments that felt so real. One occasion involving an explosion and another occasion involving a gunshot. \n\tDean Charles Chapman and George Mackay generate bravery yet also fear into the characters of Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield with their acting ability. Dean Charles Chapman provokes plenty of fear and plenty of bravery in Lance Corporal Blake during his final times in the film. \n\t1917 enables audience to fell all the pains of battle along with soldiers which creates lots of realism, and it is a must see just for this reason alone. I give 1917 a 9 out of 10.",

There's a complete dearth of wit in this movie and thus the audience is left wondering...should we like this character?\n\nI highly doubt, eff words were spoken in 1917, as there were in this film, ruining it's authenticity. Being disingenuous to \"look cool\" is not cool at all. \n\nThe only reason to watch this movie (literally) is for the set. The set designers and CGI people did an above & beyond amazing job. Weaving in and out of trenches was memorable. Seeing what those in 1917 would have gone through, memorable. \n\nBut the story itself seemed forced while the real goal was to create a period piece \"documentary\" of the war. Had it been based on a real story, or a post-film bio of fictional characters shown, it would have added tremendously to the movies likability. As such we were given no reason to like a single character in the movie beside maybe the main characters tenacity to get from point a to point b. I just can't give it more than 3 stars.",

The cinematography will prove to be a high point in the career of Roger Deakins - a career littered with more remarkable achievements than most working in any area of film. Somehow he conjured images and moment of striking beauty, nightmarish hellscapes, touching intimacy - all without sacrificing the narrative propulsion which the apparent one-take style serves; we're left with the sense that this story is but one part of an endlessly, relentlessly flowing river which is sweeping a whole generation mercilessly along. \n\nRemarkable though his work is, it's not just Deakins' achievements that should be mentioned. The visual effects are more or less faultless; Thomas Newman's omnipresent score is startling; the story itself replete with razor-wire tension, humanity and emotion. It all manages to evoke the hell of war without giving in to the increasingly tiresome war-is-hell cinema clich\u00e9s we've grown so accustomed to. \n\nWhat's rarely mentioned are the two central performances by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, perfectly understated enough to draw us in and take us into the heart of ordinary people caught up in events no one should ever have to experience. \n\n1917 is a brilliant, exhausting, thrilling, moving achievement to stand alongside Dunkirk to make a pair of modern war films that will stand as pillars of the genre.",

Its raw, its brutal, its heartbreaking and yet, its completely mesmerising.\nClearly, the MVP of this film, its the perceived 'One Take' approach to shooting. I personally love this style, with the opening number to La La Land and the chase scene in Extraction as examples that spring to mind. You cant help but respect and admire the level of skill that went into achieving this feat. Yes, there are moment when you can see where the cuts are, but they are minor, yet seamless. There are some questionable character movements and directions they take that are clearly there to cover the edit. But, it still feels like you are watching a two act play in the open world. \nThe action isn't  the typical over the top war film action. There are no unnecessary explosions, no exaggerated stunt work, no gun fights with an unlimited supply of ammo. The action is grounded, some might argue its tame compare to the realities of war, but the actors are clearly in the thick of it and you believe every stumble or look of horror. There is no ridiculous and unrealistic CGI, you really believe they are blowing up trenches and setting fire to villages.\nThe direction is superb, the script is human and faultless, the cinematography is awe inspiring. But, what mustn't be forgotten or over looked is George McKay. I could not envision anyone else in this role. It would have been easy to but Matt Damon or Zac Efron in this role to increase market appeal. But they made a big budget war film with a relative unknown... and its better for it. His performance is sincere and heartfelt. He looks and behaves like a normal young man caught up in the First World War. He's out of his depth, he scared, hes saddened, but hes duty bound. There are some big name performances along the way, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden etc, but they are glorified cameos. And yet, they never steal the scene or take the focus away from McKay. There is a reason these big names where not on the poster. This isn't their film... Its George McKays.\nThe final 20 minutes alone, show that this an instant classic, and that George McKay is one to watch. The final act is so packed with emotion and stunning action work. This is a film that will stay with you for a long time.",

But let me begin by saying that I'm a fan of this era, and the reality its people went through that set the stage for who/what western civilization is today. However, this movie misses the mark on every level. It's over-reliance on modern affect-oriented storytelling destroys a viewer's ability to see the world of 1917 as it might have been. So much of what is developed as a plot line reveals the writer's weakness at character building or an understanding of the inner mind of a young man amid the violence of war. Not once during the entire course of the film do we see inside Will Schofield's motivation or get a sense of his resolve in the face the maelstrom. That it was developed from \"fragments\" of grandfather Mendes' stories is too plainly evident. The only through line ever developed is a soldier's willingness to follow orders, so that we wind up as far removed from Will as when we first met him. As a medium, it is well made, though the actors were left to wander about in a faux post-modernist way.",

The issue I do have with the movie \ud83c\udfa5 is the use of CGI on the animals like the rats \ud83d\udc00 and cows \ud83d\udc04, while used only sparingly and when needed it did really take me out of it personally.

I still fully believe that Avengers: Endgame should have won best visual effects at the Oscars, even if it is a superhero movie. One thing I found that was flawed with this movie was that since it was just two long takes put together, there were some parts of the movie that were boring to watch since the main characters were just walking to places. Then that filled up a lot of the runtime. But my favorite part of this movie is at the end when William goes out onto the edge of the battlefield and starts running. It was a really powerful and prideful moment. It is easily the best part of the film. This film does an excellent job of showing how brutal and unfair war is.

We don't see even 1 German soldier in the film!  some shooting from snipers,  a  downed  German pilot and that was it.  Most of the movie shows  the young man going across the countryside , and eventually  at night.  Big fires all around  a few people come after him  and he  falls into a river  and is carried  almost to where he needs to be. He walks up to them and knows they are who is looking for.  The  trenches you see and the soldiers are so real  and you see a little action, but then the movie is over.  So this is NOT  a   movie about  COMBAT.  Not at all.  if you watch it thinking this is what you will see, you will be sadly disappointed.  But otherwise the point of the movie is showing the effort that is made to stop  this attack.  The filming  was excellent.  The actors were excellent.  I just wished to see some combat.",

            "content": "This film opened in January and since then there have been only a handful of days where this movie is not on my mind. This film draws the audience in as almost a third character in the film so all the ups and downs of the characters become the ups and downs of the audience. The film is not as action heavy as the trailer shows, but the tension of every moment in the film is as strong as any battle scene, if not stronger. This movie is enjoyable for a wide audience and thanks to the character actions this film can be enjoyed by people that would not normally enjoy watching a war film. \nThis film is made to be accepted by a diverse audience, but I think the diversity in thought makes it hard to be appreciated to its full value by all audiences. Most film experts have praised the technical aspects of the film, such as the amazing cinematography, but some of their biggest issues with the film have been lack of meaningful dialogue and character backstories. I disagree with these criticisms because I believe that anyone that understands military life, whether they have served themselves or have friends and family that have served, will understand the relationship between the two leads and how much story there is without the movie saying it. Another understanding from the military perspective is how attached you can become to someone in such a short amount of time. This is true for all military generations but especially during the two world wars because soldiers were dying in numbers never seen before and yet soldiers would make friends someone they met the day before just to have that friend die the next day. I have heard critics say that they didn't care as much about the characters as they should of because there wasn't enough backstory, but that is such a real military experience because these soldiers were losing friends left and right, friends they cared about but probably didn't know much better than a classmate you're doing a project with. I think this aspect of having probably about only 10 lines of backstory in the film is going unappreciated by film experts that grew up far from a military influence. Another issue I would dispute is that the movie is slow or doesn't have action scenes. Again this will be mostly appreciated by those familiar with military life because they wholeheartedly understand the motto hurry up and wait. The leads don't wait around, but since this is a 'single-shot' film putting these leads into action scene after action scene would be dishonest. There are a lot of tense moments and as any soldier can attest sometimes the downtime messes with your anxiety more. Soldiers are trained for battle so once the fighting starts your instincts takeover over and you don't really have time to think because everything is happening so fast, but the downtime when you don't know when the next big thing will happen is when your brain begins to panic because you have time to think about everything and dwell on every single one of your worst fears. The downtimes never get rid of the tension entirely and there is never a downtime long enough to forget the hardship of the mission that lies ahead. The lack of consistent makes this story more plausible because if the leads saw action for the entire hour and 59 minutes they would seem invincible like a Marvel superhero. \nLastly I believe that even with film knowledge and military familiarity the movie still isn't full appreciated without an in depth knowledge of WW1 history. I am a history major and the accuracy of the film is impeccable. There are critics that say the film was fantastical and not based in reality but if they studied history for years like I have they would instantly be proven wrong. The Night Window scene is my favorite in the film and I was once told that it's pretty but weird that the Germans are shooting so many flares; no it's not. This is in the late stages of the war and this town was now a battlefield so with the Allies on either side of the city it is there job to keep watch 24 hours a day which includes night and rural France in 1917 was not known for its amazing electrical infrastructure. In order to protect a town at night you have to be able to see the town and even if they had lamps in that town they would be dimmer than a full moon so they used flares because lightbulbs were not that bright or cheap in 1917. Another important thing related to both military life and history is the date. The film begins on April 6, 1917 which is the day the United States joined the war which was very important for Europe, but there is not a single mention of it in the film. That is extremely realistic because as important as it is too history, to a single soldier on a mission it is not worth a mention. In military life there are times where the mission is the most important thing in the world and other times when the mission feels pointless because the war will keep killing people, but what this movie does well is show how many times a soldier can alternate those thoughts in a single day. The movie ends the way it started, under a tree. That serenity after the chaos of the movie will only last as long as the serenity of the first scene because despite a journey that most of us can agree is so harrowing that it should only be done once we also know he will be plucked from that tree again because he will still be a soldier tomorrow.  \nGeorge MacKay is fantastic in this film and all that character backstory is given through a few words and his deeply talented facial expressions. Everything important about his character, and the juxtaposition to the other lead, can be seen in MacKay's eyes. The music in the film is phenomenal and like the film is perfect without needing to be too fantastical. This film reminds me why I play my instruments, why I love history, and why I love movies. The Night Window scene is my favorite where every single aspect of filmmaking lines up from the cinematography to the music to the acting. This scene is one of the only moments in movie history that I can claim as absolutely perfect.",

However I found the emotion to be too forced and somewhat predictable. The last 45 minutes are boring.

            "content": "1917 is a YouTube 'special' bigged up to be a box office hit. Yes, I will admit that the filming and the methods that are used are fantastic, I would rate it as one of the most brilliantly and beautifully filmed War Movies I've watched. But... and this is a big one... but it's a film based on the FIRST WORLD WAR. One of/if not the most brutal war in human history where the sacrifice of 'everyday' men was beyond modern comprehension. This film shows non of that... absolutely nothing of the horrors of war, non of the gore or the emotional toll it takes on soldiers and men. The script and dialect of the actors says to me that they shouldn't be arsed with filming and that they wanted to go back to their nice warm hotels to get a shower. Which to me means that's the director or screenwriters fault and not the actors themselves as the cast line-up is one of the best britain has to offer. As for the other issues... well to start the rifle drills are appalling. Considering the main character has served at the Somme he seems very reluctant to cycle his rifle bolt to continue the engagement with the enemy. Secondly, the scenery changes too often with very little information to the viewer. First you start in a picture perfect representation of what the trenches were and then you end up in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. All of a sudden you are thrown out the back of a Bedford lorry with nothing around only to find that there is a half destroyed village just to your left, why the german sniper didnt start engaging immediately I dont know. Then once you go down a river you're in a new trench, freshly dug yet a completely different soil colour to the first (traditional salisbury plain) with no actual explanation or story might I add that leads to how far the character has travelled. There are many other problems with this film that will take too long to cover so to summarise this I will say that it is a brilliantly filmed movie, however it lacks the substance, storyline and accuracy to be a believable war movie that immerses the viewer into the First World War. As such, to say that the film is for Alfred H Mendes I find disappointing. No doubt he was an extremely brave man and deserving to be called a national hero as all of the service personnel were in their time, yet I wonder what he would think of the films depiction of the war... my great grandfather and childhood hero wouldn't be so full of praise.\nI created this account just to write this review.",

People look upon that war shamefully, the Lost Generation as it was known in the years after it was fought and lost. But slowly and steadily movies set during this period were becoming more respected. Wonder Woman was set during World War I and it was phenomenal. With that experience, I was more than eager to feel this movie was more than worth it.\n\n\tIt is that and more. Just like Birdman, this movie does an incredible job of using phenomenal camerawork in making this feel like it was filmed in one continuous shot. No doubt to simulate realism but more importantly the scope of the battlefield from start to finish to gain a real education into the fight that was first World War.\n\n\tThere are plenty of familiar faces as well as some great moments but the whole film is a masterpiece and I am so glad to have seen it.

Here we have closer, more personal look at soldiers life rather than on the great scale of military operations. At the same time we don't loose the high stakes or epic magnitude of action, we just learn to see them from a more claustrophobic perspective, which is more that adequate, given the very nature of the trench war. And while supporting cast of really famous actors serves here its purpose, I found characters played by relatively unknown thespians, especially those playing two main roles, to be especially well-played.",

Whether on screen for two hours or two minutes, every member of the cast shines in such a waythat if I hadn\u2019t known any better (and recognized a few faces), I might\u2019ve thought I was actually watching World War 1.

The film is set near Ecouste-Saint-Mein in Northern France. The trailer depicts a scene where Will Schofield (George MacKay) jumps into a raging river. There are no rivers in Ecouste, aside from a very small stream. Other than that, the area around Ecouste and the film's shooting locations are similar.

            "content": "Sam Mendes directed this drama set during World War I about two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman), who are ordered to deliver a message, across German lines, to call off an attack. One of the soldiers has a brother taking part in the attack. Mendes based the story on an incident from the war that was retold to him by his grandfather. Filmed by cinematographer Roger Deakins to look as if it was done in one fluid, continuous shot; the film is visually marvelous with several amazingly choreographed and staged action sequences. However, like other contemporary war movies about the other war from that period, \"Saving Private Ryan\" and Dunkirk,\" characterization and drama are minimized in favor of action to detrimental effect. The lead actors, who give good performances in their confined roles, don't have distinctive personalities to draw us in emotionally. This is about the visceral experience of war with nothing pertinent to say about war itself. There is one brief, touching moment where a soldier hides in the home of a German woman and her newborn and they are able to connect despite their different nationalities and language barriers. (This scene reminds us of Renoir's \"Grand Illusion.\") Written by Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Music is by Thomas Newman. Won Oscars for Best Cinematography, Visual Effects, and Sound Mixing. With Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch.",

            "content": "A harrowing journey into the trenches of World War I!\n\nSam Mendes' war thriller 1917 (2019) is a magnificent cinematic experience. It's all about the odyssey of what two young British soldiers endure to warn 2 battalions about a German trap to save 1000's of lives. Part Paths of Glory, part All Quiet on the Western Front, and part Dunkirk, 1917 tries and succeeds in making you feel sympathy for the average foot soldiers rendered helpless during WWI. I would say Saving Private Ryan, Patton, or The Thin Red Line are better war films, but 1917 has heart and skillful direction to keep you enthralled by the striking horror of it all. \n\n1917 is shot like you are running across No Man's Land or maneuvering through crowded trenches. It's an impressive technical feat as Roger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography appears as if 1917 was shot in one long take. It's a cool effect to be sure, but most effective in holding the audience captive like you are stuck on this suicide mission with these two brave, young men. I love the burning building shot at night as Deakins spins the camera around to give you a feel for how scary the situation would be. Mendes' direction is excellent and suspenseful as anything can happen at any moment.\n\nThomas Newman's score is haunting as he beautifully composed pieces for each and every little moment of 1917. I loved George MacKay's lead role in 1917. You see every bit of fear and courage he displays in a brave and vulnerable role for 1917. I liked Dean-Charles Chapman, but I feel like he not only got less to do than MacKay, but he was not as engrossing or mature. Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden all get neat cameos in strong shows of character acting from the lot of them. My only complaint is that each of them only gets a minute long cameo and that's it. I wish we got more time from each of them. Claire Duburcq gets a heartfelt cameo alongside MacKay for a nice quiet scene.\n\nI enjoyed 1917 for its fast pace and impressive direction, but I wanted more from the other lead and more of the supporting cast in general. There's not that much action either, but there are riveting sequences in here scattered among the debris.",

Technically speaking, this film is incredible to watch. The journey throughout the war torn country side is unsettling to watch, and those long takes pay off. 1917 always had an ambitious uphill battle, but I'm happy to say it is all worth it. The relatively unknown leads are surrounded by strong character actors in support. This is much in line with Dunkirk, with both Mendes and Nolan rising to fame in the same era. I'm happy this wasn't the best picture for 2019, I feel Parasite was the correct choice, but this is still a great film, just not an instant classic. Time will tell with this and maybe you'll find me eating my words in 10 years time. 24/03/2020",

The plot may not be the best that exists in today's cinema, because it is not. However it is a good plot for the war scenario, but it loses to Hacksaw Ridge in my opinion. The visual effects and the choice of the setting are essential for this film, given the time and style that is a war.

The \"nonstop\" camera shot is neat, but it results in a lot of lulls in the movie in order to offer some semblance of believability.  It didn't really feel particularly satisfying in the end, either, which surprised me.  I know it's supposed to be historical, and history doesn't always play out like a movie, but it just kind of ended.  I'm sure they could have done more with it if they'd used a more traditional filming style, but I still think there are better ways you could have tied up the ending.",

There's a lot of nothing, then stints of unequivocal horror, and if you live, there's more nothing. This is a bit like that.

There are emotions and the story is beautiful, but that's it, there's nothing special about the story and there's nothing that stands out about it. A great movie needs to have great visuals and audios, but the story is one of the, if not the most important factor of them all, because that it the entire purpose of films: to tell stories that make something, change something or teach something, and sadly, 1917 doesn't accomplish that.",

The way this was filmed, the cinematography, editing, sound, camera angles, everything ... it truly felt like I had oculus 3D glasses on and I was in the film experiencing everything.  Because it was edited to be continuous shots, it really truly allowed you to be immersed in the experience to the point that I was not distracted by anything else but the mission of the plot, it really gave me anxiety at times as I was so carried away with it.

The end was predictable, and it just... stopped.  Almost like they ran out of film.  (#2) BORING CHARACTERS. Mendes's decision to have two \"everyman\" soldiers made it emotionally distant. I didn't know the dudes, didn't care about them. (#1) TOLD THE WRONG STORY. It's 2019, can we stop having movies with a cast of 99% white males? (And this coming from me, a white male.) OK, yes, the British military in 1917 was probably 99% white. So, it's not the casting that's the problem... it's the story Mendes chose to tell. The most interesting character in the movie with the best story, we saw for five minutes -- a young woman caring for an infant that wasn't her own in a bombed-out city. Who is she, how did she get there, and WHAT HAPPENS to them?  I want THAT movie, not the two nobodies racing to a conclusion I already know about before it starts.",

For starters, it drastically under represents the vastness of WW1 when the characters keep arriving at their destinations so quickly, \"oh, they are there already?\". Our eventual main character gets a bad cut holding barbed wire at the barb... really? Ok... things happen I guess. A rat almost kills them...sure, why not? Save a German from a horrific flaming death, then leave him unguarded and unrestrained? Doesn't seem logical during war but at least we are minus 1 character I didn't care at all about. Whoah, a company of soldiers just appears in the no man's land that they have been fighting for every inch up to... hmmm. Onto a truck then about a mile to the burned out city (maybe 2 miles total travel at this point). Kill the sniper, then when a German in plain sight in open ground fires at our hero, a trained combat soldier in a war zone, he runs away. Our brave character, seeking a hiding spot, meets a girl and baby and he suddenly has loads of food and milk he fortuitously filled his canteen with, never mind that there's no way to give it to the baby or that it wouldn't last but a feeding or 2... the baby is saved. Back out to the city where he happens upon upon a young German soldier and puts his hand over his mouth... gee, that didn't work so he somehow strangles him then heroically drops his weapon and runs away from a drunken German soldier who can barely stand up. Our weaponless warrior then bravely runs through enemy fire where he jumps into river rapids and \"escapes\". I'm about ready to leave the theater but Iv'e invested time, I'm trying to see it through. Another few hundred yards and he finds the troop he was looking for listening to some guy sing a boring song that we are forced to sit through as well... yawn, falling asleep. Some other stuff happens, not paying much attention at this point. Another couple hundred yards and he  arrives at the front lines where he is to stop the battle. He makes it to a commander as the troops are leaving the trenches to get slaughtered and the commander, like a true bad-ass who commands young men during wartime, is crying like a baby. That's it, I throw up my arms and leave the theater to wait for my girlfriend outside. She said I didn't miss anything. I should have walked out like I did when Forest started running in that other academy award winning piece of garbage. On a positive note, I thought the costumes were great and I hope they won the academy award for it but the academy awards are irrelevant now anyway, since they just pander to the wokest tripe, so actually... whatever.",

Some of the set pieces are quite nice, some only a little annoying, and a few are damn close to intolerable. \n\nI just saw \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" another--one of a whole category--film on the horrors of war. So there's NOTHING new here, it's just one movie-trope after another. Finally--and what a shock--that woman in the bombed out house just happened to be young and ravishingly beautiful. It's this kind of retro clich\u00e9--as well as the anachronisms in the dialogue (\"Fuck off,\" \"I hate to interrupt your busy schedule,\" etc.) that put the lie to the intolerable pomposity of the direction/storyline.\n\nI think Mendes' father got his own memories mixed up with all the (anti-)war movies he saw.",

The scope, both large and small, is just why the film is so powerful. The screenplay is a carefully crafted, neatly unfolding portrayal of vulnerability, loss and growing up in the most treacherous and horrible of places. But what's magical about the film, if we can use such a term for a \"war movie,\" is that it simply doesn't feel like any other film about war. 1917 is a story about relationships, about love, about loss and brotherhood - and this is all achieved while barely knowing anything about our characters lives outside the unfolding action and the present demands upon them. That is an accomplishment in storytelling, and in this case, kudos to all departments for helping create what we see one moment after the next. Indeed, the film moves fluidly by, and when it was over it felt like I'd seen a slice of life and a glimpse into war I had not known before. It felt new, and felt, fresh.",

A revolutionary feat in cinema history never done before. \n\nGripping, intense, immersive. This movie made me think about war on different levels that I haven't thought about watching other war movies. I thought about the harrowing experiences these soldiers go through and the psychological distress that comes with losing a close friend or coming close to death.\n\nA fantastic thrill ride through a journey of what might be one of the most important and suspenseful moments in WWI history.

If you ever loved books like \"Forgotten Voices of the Great War\" or \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" then this movie will surely match your taste and expectations.\nWith no intention to undermine Parasite as a movie, I do believe that 1917 did deserve more oscar awards.",

Certainly, it conveyed the urgency and immediacy of the situation and the story, but it distracted horribly from the audience's ability to absorb and understand what was happening. In order to optimize the horrors of war an audience (especially one over a hundred years removed from an event) that has no historical or collective memory of the event, needs a background on which they can contrast the action on the screen. the actors did a magnificent job with what they had to work with. However, I felt that not even they had enough understanding of the situation and its gravity historically or personally to have developed the depth of character one hopes to see in a good film. I cannot say that I was ever able to empathize with any of the characters, I did not know; who they were outside of their names, where they came from, their family status, their backgrounds, experiences, aspirations or anything else about them that would have made it easier for me to relate to them. All of these things are easily established with bits of dialogue. And getting to know something a wee bit more personal about the character is how a filmmaker gets us emotionally invested in his characters and ultimately his story and film. that emotional investment is what creates the lump in our throats or the tears in our eyes when one of the main characters loses his life or whatever. I haven't seen \"Saving Private Ryan\" in a decade or more but I still remember that Tom Hanks' character was a schoolteacher before the war. I couldn't tell you what Lance Corporals Blake and Scofield had done before the war and I just walked out of the theatre less than an hour ago. the failure of the director to develop the identities and depth in his two main characters was the single most distracting element of this film. it made his characters two dimensional and thus his film no matter how stunning it was visually could not get beyond two dimensional at best itself. if you want to understand what I am talking about watch the 1981 Classic directed by Peter Weir and titled \"Gallipoli\", a quite similar story but directed with infinitely more feeling and understanding.",

The ending quote brought a lot of questions. A dedication to Sam Mendes' grand-father \u00ab who told us the stories \u00bb. Here I was in a theatre, seeing another World War movie in this desire of keeping the memory of those who fought. Another Great Britain memory to keep the history in our minds. I Think I've had enough of that story. \n\nThat said, i'm not asking to forget. Never forget. Here comes my contradiction. To never forget you have to tell the story in repeat. Specifically to those who weren't there, those that look at history as something from the past. \n\nThe consequence of history, creates the present as we know it. \n\nI'm concerned about all those stories that we might have never heard of. Here, in great America. First nations. Massacres. Blood on hands of the colonizers. Same colonizers who created the history that have been told in my early school years. In their perspectives to remember part of it and an attempt to minimize, erase other less infamous parts of it. \n\nI need to see more diversity. We all deserve to know where we come from to truly understand who we are to build a clearer knowledge surrounding history. All part of history. Know the responsibilities that comes from our past.  \n\nLooking at Chile made me realize the effect of forgetting the past. A story of a dictature that wasn't really told. A population incapable to communicate their stories to their children. Scared of the consequences after seeing so much violence. The country evolved without evolving. Justice was never made. The perpetrators still in power with the money. Here we are, years later, to see the story happening again with the same ugliness but in a different way. \n\nStories need to survive time, but I guess it's also time that European grandpas start to listen others outside themself.  \n\nThe movie makes an interesting choice of showing through one-shots sequences its course. One of them will haunt you with its grandiose. Too much music. George Mackay delivers an incredible performance. A simple plot to express the courageous grandeur of humans beings.\n\nMy inspiration has run dry and that's what is goin'on. Nothin's right, I'm torn.",

It is a tense, nerve jangling story of heroism and tragedy. There is no flinching from the brutal and terrible nature of trench warfare and there are some really graphic and disturbing scenes. However, Sam Mendes handles the subject matter beautifully and though horrific, the violence is never gratuitous. Some great performances from a solid cast make this a truly memorable cinema experience and 1917 has rightly won a clutch of awards at the BAFTAs and Oscars.",

It's a very simple story, basically two-guys have to get a message to a place otherwise a lot of people will die.  Simple, but effective.  Interestingly as well, we really don't know a lot about either of these guys either.  Funny thing though, it wasn't until we learned a tiny bit about one of them in the final shots that I even realized this.  We still become attached to them in their journey.  Perhaps because they're all we have, and we're stuck with them, just as they're stuck with each other.  That's not to say there isn't character, there is, but it's just told in a unique way, a way that feels genuine to the wartime setting.  It's an unusual form of narrative, and it surprisingly works.

The technical achievements here are unmistakable; strongly bolstered by Roger Deakins' amazing (No surprise there) cinematography and a virtually seamless blend of production values to put you right in the trenches with the characters. Not to mention Thomas Newman's score is pretty darn great, it is very understated but rousing in the right moments of escalation. Like 'Dunkirk', this war flick is not character-driven in the traditional sense but unlike the former, it does a better job developing the lead(s) enough to be emotionally engaged with them - 8.5/10 (A-)",

Not to mention it never cuts away to a different persons point of view, so you know as much as these characters we follow.\n\nThere isn't much character development provided, however it isn't necessary as everything feels so real, and any sort of time developing them would have felt unnatural. Despite knowing little about the characters, following them into uncharted territory was extremely suspenseful and tension packed.\n\nThe story is simple, but the execution is flawless, capturing all kinds of emotions while never straying from the main plot. Despite it being a war film, it doesn't contain that much action, which is rare however not disappointing. 1917 (2019) tells a very personal story in World War I and manages to pull off every thing it goes for thanks to its truly fantastic cinematography.",

I am baffled that the script has gotten as far as it got in the nominations this year.

The film not only aims to move its audience with a rather simple yet moving plot, but aims to give viewers a unique visual and auditory experience of the trenches and shelled cities of The Great War which are rarely presented in this fashion in movies past. Its use of clever cinematography, detailed set pieces, and brilliant soundtrack creates an eerie and tense aura for most of the film that is sure to keep moviegoers at the edge of their seats. Complex and intricate dialogue are not the focus of this film. We as an audience are denied flashy battle scenes found in countless war movies. Rather, the focus is solely on conveying raw emotion and tension felt by the two main characters as they set out on a seemingly impossible mission to deliver a message that will save sixteen hundred comrades from walking into a trap. 1917 is a film that stands out amidst other similar works, and is a film with relevant and important subject matter. It is a work of art that pays homage to the struggles endured by all who fought in The War to End All Wars; a subject that is almost all but forgotten in today's society. 1917 reminds viewers to never forget the sacrifices made by those who came before us, and will continue to serve this purpose from this day until our last ones.",

The skies looked like someone  did a bad pastel painting for the early scenes.   I did feel like the plot was borrowed partially from Saving Private Ryan, but with the added twist of avoiding a German trap.   The best part of the movie for me was the juxtaposition of the English trenches to the German ones.   The scene setup the feeling like the Germans were well advanced and that gave more credit to the trap plot.",

O trabalho e dedica\u00e7\u00e3o do Sam Mendes aqui \u00e9 not\u00e1vel. Todo o filme estava friamente conectado. A dire\u00e7\u00e3o faz com que a cinematografia tenha um controle total de como tudo ocorre, como se fossemos um hospedeiro e/ou todo cen\u00e1rio fosse uma esteira, e falando nisso, que cenografia absurda - que contribui e muito para a atmosfera. E aqui vem uma curiosidade: como foi poss\u00edvel planos t\u00e3o longos? \u00c9 como se o cen\u00e1rio n\u00e3o acabasse mais.\n\nO roteiro tem seus m\u00e9ritos.

The plot felt purposeful, the stakes felt high, the actors felt talented beyond what their experience would suggest, and the climax had hearts pounding audibly throughout the theater. \n\nA small complaint is the film was a bit over-scored. The thunderous and booming soundtrack clashed with the gritty and visceral imagery. A tense but altogether quieter score would perhaps have had more of an impact but even the tracks used were not distracting enough to break immersion.   \n\n1917 is a movie that has earned its place among the year's best pictures and should be remembered as nothing less than a brilliantly made ode to the brutality of the first World War.",

            "content": "There's no denying that 1917 is a technical triumph. Give it all the technical awards. It earns them all. But that's all it achieves. The plot follows two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) in constant unbroken motion as they embark on an impossible mission beyond German lines to deliver a life-saving message on foot. It makes the promise that you're going to be feeling everything the characters feel all the way to the end. The results are mixed. In its flashy insistence to immerse you in the horror of WWI, aiming to capture the immediacy of a war zone in constant tension, 1917 loses sight of all the other things that cinema can do to capture the hearts of those watching it.\n\nThe film opens with its heroes waking from an improvised slumber in a bed of flowers. Blake (Dean-Charles Chapmen), baby-faced and big-mouthed, nominates his friend Schofield (George MacKay) to tag along on what he thinks is a routine delivery job. There are whispers of the Germans retreating and the British going home to roast dinners. This is a false dawn, shattered without a trace of humour by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) who drags the boys into his tent, delivers a thirty-second mission from hell and sends them on their way with the most unconvincing \u2018good-luck'. This is all happening in one smooth, anxiety-inducing take, which is clearly divided into two, and made up of at least a dozen more, creatively smoothed into the fabric of the film by careful editing. A keen eye will spot them, such as when bodies fill the screen and the soldiers are briefly lost. This is by no means a slight of the film. It is not illegal to have more than one shot in your entire film, and making it feel like one breathless experience is an achievement on its own. In this regard, 1917 rightfully should be commended. It is a visual powerhouse. The problem is that the film is completely shackled by its impressive camerawork.\n\nThe opening really is terrific as the camera slowly stalks Blake and Schofield weaving through the impeccably designed trenches, festering with ghost-eyed soldiers hunkering down for brief solitude, writing letters, sleeping against each other with only rats for company.  A ticking drumbeat adds to the tension, Blake and Schofield exchanging glances, Blake anxiously pacing ahead, Schofield losing track of him in the swarm of bodies. Blake has a personal attachment to the mission with his brother part of the company that's due to assault German troops in the morning, 1,600 of them unknowingly heading into a brutal trap. It's a great start and it is unfortunate that these early scenes don't build to something better.\n\nWhat is most disappointing about 1917 is that, for all its technical achievement and incredible recreation of no-man's land (astoundingly shot by Roger Deakins), it simply doesn't do enough to make you care about its characters. War is terrifying, and the landscape created by Mendes and Deakins here is convincing in depicting that terror, but only on a visual level. There's no significant attempt to explore the characters in depth, or really, anything else. The film is only concerned with getting from point A to B and literally showing the audience every step the characters took to get there. There's nothing wrong with that initially because the film always looks astonishing and for a while you do feel like it could be your hand plunging into the cavity of a rotting corpse. This is the immediacy that Mendes wanted his entire film to be. And it works for half-hour. After that, the bare-bones script becomes more pronounced than the head of a decaying horse, and each meticulously crafted scene starts to resemble strict events in an on-the-rails first-person shooting game. This artificial nature is made worse when you consider all the two-minute star cameos placed throughout.\n\nFor all its good work, there's no getting around that every frame of this film has been designed like an exhibit you pass through, barely letting you breathe before you're thrust forward to the next puddle of corpses. You're immersed in everything and feel nothing \u2014 even when bullets crack like thunder. Any tense encounter is preceded by the ticking drumbeat that accompanies Schofield all the way on his journey. Rather than have explosions burst from nowhere, there's always an expectation that something is about to happen because the music only kicks it when it does. It's counter-productive in the film's attempts to create a sense of total immersion. Schofield is never in real danger because the film necessitates that he keeps moving forward.\n\n1917 adds up to a film that looks harrowing without ever feeling it. Locking the narrative directly onto the distressed face of George Mackay, who is very good and should go onto better things, the film requires you to feel invested in his character in order to succeed. If you are, that's great, it's as thrilling as Mendes intended. If you're not, you're immediately distanced from the film because there's nothing else to connect with.\n\nIts proud insistence on pretending to be one shot is both the film's biggest strength and weakness. It creates intimacy at the same time it unfailingly distracts because the script has no choice but to serve the one-shot gimmick, and there was never a moment that I wasn't aware of this.",

Let's be honest that the two long shots could definitely drive anyone asleep especially when they are almost two hours long. However this is not the case, Sam Mendes is such a genius that he totally made 1917 a masterpiece. I love the way the frame keeps focus on Sco so that we won't know what's gonna happen next to him until he knows it. In a nutshell I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of war movies (or not).",

            "content": "In my review for \"Dunkirk\", the last narrative war flick I attended that is not a (certain) documentary, I had opened with explaining our general complicated relationship with the genre due to the gruesome nature and how a filmmaker make it a challenge to authenticate the storytelling process without any glamour except for the used techniques.\n\nSince then, I find myself wanting to see a war film released consecutively each year like it has become a special theatrical tradition for that kind of narrative built up by compelling direction varied by different, award-winning filmmakers taking the challenging helm. So far, only three spiked in the mainstream radar, probably overshadowing hidden gems by their own debris, from Christopher Nolan's masterful visionary mask to Peter Jackson's innovative remastering. Sam Mendes arrives as a one-man third wave with what could be the genre's best technical marvel in \"1917\".\n\nStraight forward and simplistic is better said than done as seen, heard and felt, all synergistically haunted by the war-ridden grounds, whereas two young British soldiers, Schofield and Blake, are given a mission to cross enemy territory to call off an attack that is instead marching into a trap. Hundreds of soldiers' lives are at stake, with Blake's brother among them, and the brave pair must race against time as the first World War heightens.\n\nEach of the three war films, including \"They Shall Not Grow Old\", are great in their own significance defined by the aforementioned compelling direction each have as their defined technical marvel, and \"1917\" is the top experience. In terms of war horrors that are usually violently painted, the splatter was kept to a minimum, the casualties seemingly however went the farthest in presenting with just dry gore but still disturbingly graphic. Aside from the red taints on the battlegrounds, the elaborate settings required across the soldiers' mission made the production design amazing to the point of being immersive within the grounds while the taut cinematography, by Mendes' cinematographic collaborator Roger Deakins, is ultimately well-maneuvered to enable great editing to mask the total apparatus as one continuous shot.\n\nThe resulted vision of the finest craftsmanship that makes this war classic gritty and especially transportive is more a technical revelatory than just descriptively a marvel. It provokes a question on what the best formatted flow when telling a story. Being immersed completely is another way feeling emotionally trapped as we can actually empathize the tense emotions going through the onscreen soldiers' veins as they carefully trek across the battlegrounds behind enemy line. The \"shot\" never gets disrupted with a cut that would threateningly break the mental experience, and the editing to make it appear is very carefully placed like going through a minefield of ruining flaws. If the film was done in any other way with cuts, it would be a different experience, a different story, and total acceptance to watch it downsized.\n\nWhen people watch films on any screen to the tiniest of their addictive mobile devices to their televisions to the big silver screen, they are downsizing the experience's initial value. \"1917\" is definitely one of those films that are best seen on the big screen otherwise the story is practically an equivalent to a veteran telling you a story in person. There is a required dimension for this kind of film and the freestyling comfort zone that a home provides, with accessible lighting, cannot guarantee the exact effect a theatrical experience provides. At the theater when you are not at home, the screen overshadows you, encasing you in darkness with the only light being the only window to the world via the screen. Sounds like having no choice but to survive in a war, or safely riding along the rough, bullet shells covered, blood-stained, dug-up terrain, guided by an excellent cast and their fantastic, well-driven performances.\n\nSam Mendes' \"1917\" is the best war film of the decade that has solidified my vote for Best Picture; and the only way to see it best is on the big screen while seeing it downsized means you have seen it and want to admire its filmmaking quality over and over again \u2013 not the topic or that would glamorizes the war that invited involuntary sacrifices.

            "content": "1917 was a masterpiece of cinema. I've seen a lot of war movies over the years, but never one so cleverly directed. As two young men are sent behind enemy lines to deliver an important, time sensitive message; you're right their with them, the camera working like a third man on the trek. The tension is intense, as you feel a sense of unease woven into every second of screen time. You never feel safe because the characters never feel safe.\n\nThe film does a great job capturing the reality of something like World War I. Our protagonists are not the best their squad has to offer. They're not specialists at anything. They're not hardened combat veterans. They don't have super powers. They're just two kids trying to stay alive against the odds. You genuinely don't know if they'll succeed or not, because ultimately, they're expendable and their lives don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. It could've been any random set of teenagers and when you realize that over the course of the film, the true horror of it all starts to set in. \n\nSam Mendes avoids the wide shots you usually get in a war film, preferring to keep everything close in what appears to be one, continuous shot. You see what the boys see, which means you don't get to see the German soldier slightly offscreen plotting an attack ahead of time. You don't see the sniper in the window. Danger is everywhere, even in the quiet moments, and one bad move or staying in one place too long can get you killed. It's less about the scope of conflict and more about the effect it can have on the individual level. You can't help but put yourself in their shoes.\n\nI sang the praises of Dunkirk when it came out, but this blows that film out of the water (no pun intended). It truly needs to be experienced on the big screen for maximum effect. It's so simple, but leaves such a big impact. What feels like hell to us is just another day on the front to them. 1917 has a staunch anti-war message, but it doesn't come from anything that's said. Just the feelings of pain, anguish, hopelessness, terror, loss, and grief conveyed by watching one of the most destructive and pointless conflicts in world history unfold as it happened. There is no glory to be had. There is no victory. Everything has a cost and the price usually isn't worth it. Showing the reality of war is all the anti-war propaganda you will ever need.",

If you don't know much about WWI this movie definitely gives the viewer a raw unfiltered look at the horribly brutal and savage fighting and waiting that soldiers experienced during WWI. The cinematography was supremely well thought out and executed which provided stunning visuals and spectacular scenes throughout the movie. I'm not sure if I was expecting more action in the movie because I did feel somewhat bored at various points during the movie but I can appreciate the real-time continuous camera shots which made for a unique cinematic experience.

Over and over again, there were opportunities for an interesting turn to be injected into the movie, and they were passed on. For example, the initial discussion that set up the entire plot of the movie was extremely brief, and the potentially momentous bookend meeting at the end was not much longer and mostly devoid of any drama. The battle scenes were not particularly interesting. And whose fresh milk was in that bucket? I guess nobody cares. Finally, prior to watching the movie, I did not know about the fact that it is basically one long continuous shot. I think this has produced a lot of fascination around the movie... but not being aware of it as I watched, I realize now that I was subconsciously annoyed by it. It's kind of mentally exhausting, and places limits on the director's ability to do story-telling. In other words, there are very good reasons why Hollywood developed all kind of film-making conventions and shots - they make for better movies! Who makes videos that are just one long shot? Oh yeah, you or me, right before we post it on Youtube.\n\nAfter seeing the movie the night before the Oscars, I could not stomach voting for it as \"Best Picture\" in my Oscars pool, and took \"Parasite\" instead, which I never even saw.

Sort of a one man against the world to save the world type of movie.

            "content": "There are movies which are good, there are movies which great and then there are movies which are unforgettable. The latter are rare gems, which only come about when a strong story fuses with spectacular acting and exquisite cinematography. This is the case with 1917. The highlight of the movie is Roger Deakins cinematography which consists of the much admired one-shot take as well as stunning images of war horrors. \nLets first address the one-shot take. It has been attempted several times in the past with mixed results, however this time (ignoring the waterfall scene) it works on multiple levels. Firstly, the camera moves similarly to a human, which feels familiar to the audience, making them part of the perilous journey. Secondly, cutscenes usually tend to divide the plot as well as give the viewer a break to catch their breath and collect their thoughts, similarly to blinking their eyes after staring too long. Here they are absent, which keeps the audience on their toes, unwilling to give them even a short break. Finally, although there obviously were cut-scenes throughout filming, the camera takes were 8-10 minutes long, thus the actors actually had to act throughout a longer period than normal. This includes physically demanding scenes, which could not feel more authentic, as the actors actually had to run for several minutes, making their fatigue incredibly plausible. \nRoger Deakins has a gift for making movie scenes resemble art. This is incredibly effective when depicting horror war scenes, as the viewer is confused whether he should admire them or be in shock. The burning town of \u00c9coust is such an example- I could not help myself but marvel at the beauty of the burning church or the shadow-play during Schofield`s run. \nConcerning the actors, I myself became completely immersed in their story, they felt authentic and I was not troubled by the lack of backstory or character development. I concur with the tactic of having two relatively unknown actors, both of which perform superbly on the big stage, making me optimistic as to the future generation of actors. I could not however suppress a satisfactory smile whenever a cameo of an elite British actor occurred. These were sprinkled throughout the plot, grounding and entire story.\nFinally there is the question of the score. I consider Thomas Newman to be up there with James Newton Howard, Patrick Doyle or James Horner. His score was prolific as well as emotional, however was in some parts perhaps too disturbing, attempting to magnify emotions which were already present in heaps.\nIn conclusion, 1917 is a technological marvel, something I have never witnessed on a big screen with a thrilling story, superb performances and an adequate score. It is rare for me to leave the cinema stunned by such a hyped movie, the only other case was Villenue`s Arrival.",

The film has palpable war scenes: with the most visual effects and eccentric action of the camera, the film becomes an unbecomingly immersive example of a true war film. If you need to look beyond the genuine depiction, there are beautiful emotional highs. Mendes' craft is excellent- he drives the film as it's invisible hero. \nBut the storyline is simplistic, and the movie contributes in further simplifying these. \nThat downbeats the film- and believe- it does, a LOT! But watch '1917' because it's scale and passion is what makes it a frequently organic film. Just don't go in for a deep plot.",

I failed to connect to the mission that the two soldiers were tasked to complete due to things that were happening that made no sense what so ever.  I wont go into more details to not give in the movie, but if you expect to go and see artistic movie like All quiet on the western front or Saving Private Ryan, this is not it.

            "content": "On December 25th, the WWI film 1917 came to theaters with an exceptional opening and will likely go down as one of the best movies of the entire year due to not only a great story and incredible acting but some of the most interesting cinematography of any movie in recent memory. \n\nOne of the largest draws to this movie was the news that it was filmed in a \"single shot.\" This news is not technically true as the movie has dozens of shots but due to the thorough editing, the film appears to play continuously as if filmed in a single take. This allows for a smooth flow of action and plot. \n\nThis film has a plot designed perfectly for this type of cinematography as it follows a journey by two friends tasked to save a group of soldiers that are following faulty information. The two friends, one of which has a brother in the endangered group, trek across no man's land and then enemy territory in an effort to rescue the company of soldiers.\n\nThis films cinematography, that focuses on following the main characters, is only possible with great acting by these main characters. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman lead the movie and create likeable and deep characters. George MacKay's character, Lance Corporal Schofield, is one of the most impressive displays of acting talent during this film. MacKay effectively shows the deep brotherhood soldiers share when in similar situations and the lengths they'll go to in order to help one another.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated score for this film was created by Thomas Newman and brings to life many of the otherwise silent scenes in the movie. The score brings together classic war music and slower classical music to create uniquely slow but triumphic tones through the movie. Newman aimed to avoid writing music about the tone of the movie and aimed to instead bring life to the movie. Newman successfully accentuated the single take idea of the film by blending moods and created music that doesn't get tired as the film proceeds.\n\nOverall, 1917 is a great film that has earned its six academy awards with a good balance of acting, directing, and musical skills.",

It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silences than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. \n\nI also absolutely loved the ending - it was so brilliantly, purposefully anti-climactic and perfectly captured this feeling of helplessness, meaningless, and tragedy: Schofield had achieved his task, but next week a different order would come down and the men would still die, and he'd lost his best friend, ultimately, for nothing. If that doesn't encapsulate the pointlessness and futility of war, I don't know what does. A masterpiece. I'd watch a sequel/prequel about him in a heartbeat.",

        {
            "content": "There are not many films about World War I. The most well-known ones are anti-war dramas: All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Grand Illusion (1938), Paths of Glory (1957), Gallipoli (1981). On the surface 1917 is a well-done, thrilling action-war movie. It is also such an immersive and intense experience that without making any overt political statement it is firmly an antiwar film. It may be a good, thrilling movie but it is never exciting in the way an adventure movie is exciting. Even in the quiet moments 1917 makes you want to be as far away from this war as possible and hope another one like it never happens.\n\nThe plot is simple and very straightforward. Two young British soldiers are selected to deliver a message to a distant regiment calling off an attack the next morning. If the attack goes forward 1,600 soldiers, including the brother of one of the messengers, will charge into a trap. The encounters Corporals Blake and Schofield (Dean-Charles Chapman and Georgy MacKay) have as they make their journey across enemy territory are what you might expect from a story about soldiers on a mission: attacks from the enemy, crossing paths with another group of soldiers, finding shelter that is actually dangerous, even stumbling across a villager trying to care for a child. 1917 isn't a total onslaught to the senses for two hours though. There are respites here and there that allow us to get to know Blake and Schofield. There are some surprising cameos by well-known British actors along the way too (or unsurprising if you've seen the trailer or the cast list on IMDb). Fortunately, none of these cameos take you out of the movie (Andrew Scott and Mark Strong could slip comfortably into just about any movie).\n\nDirector Sam Mendes employs long takes and expert, precise cinematography by Roger Deakins and stealthy editing by Lee Smith to make the film look and feel as though it exists in one long unbroken shot. This gimmick works well for the movie when it is not distracting. In its successful moments the one-shot effect is largely responsible for the film's frantic, immersive effect. The climatic sequence of Schofield running like mad across the top of a trench as a battle begins to find the colonel to call off the attack makes excellent use of the one shot effect; it had me gripping the armrests of my seat. Also, the nighttime sequence in a bombed-out village where flairs illuminate the night with a bright, eerie white light and a fire rages in the distance is surreal and terrifying. Other scenes, however, like when a group of soldiers (and the camera) climb into the back of a truck, then get out to push the truck, then climb back in again feel like they are straining to keep the shot unbroken. Though I think there's nothing in 1917 that couldn't have been achieved with conventional editing, I understand why Mendes chose to present his film as a single unbroken shot. It puts us right there with the two soldiers and we are as unsure as they are of what will happen next.      \n\nThere are two consequences of using the one-shot/single-take gimmick in a war film. 1) Whether intentional or not, the one-shot effect, which keeps the camera right behind, or in front of, or over the shoulder of the characters, along with the nature of the story makes the film feel like a video game at certain times. This is not really a fault against the film. It is more likely due to video games being influenced by movies and then filtering back into the culture, but the comparison comes to mind nonetheless. 2) I think all of the focus and talk surrounding the one-shot effect actually diverts attention away from the harrowing experience of the characters in the film. 1917 has already won several awards and praise as a technical achievement (which it certainly is). I just hope people can get past the film's style to fully appreciate and experience the events on screen.\n\n1917 only tangentially touches on the larger scale of the war. One character makes a background comment on the unimpressive patch of land they've been fighting the Germans over for years. Mendes chose not to focus on the politics of the war but instead tell the story of the enlisted men that fought in the trenches and in open fields. This movie is based in part on the experiences of Lance Corporal Alfred Mendes, Sam Mendes's grandfather, to whom the film is dedicated. Mends co-wrote the screenplay, his only writing credit. For all the unrelenting action in 1917, the final shot makes this an emotional and affecting movie.",

It is meant to be shown as one seamless cut (you can tell when the 'cuts' happen) so that you as the viewer feel like you are walking with these characters through hell every step of the way. It didn't hit high enough emotional soars for me like with other Oscar contenders this year, but I still really enjoyed the ride this movie takes you on.

I felt an emotional connection to the main characters, though I agree with ScreenRant that this element could have been strengthened by more character development. Better development would have made for more for the actors to latch on to as well, as many moments between them felt flat and unrehearsed. But the exhilarating pace of the movie, mixed with a genuine depiction of the horrors of war, the beauty of the human spirit, and some razzle dazzle cinematography (I bet 5 films a year use flares now, though not the JJ kind), all combine to make a thrilling film.",

I'm sorry but dead horses with flies and slipping on a body is just cliche at this point and not scary or depressing and after 911 really its all just so tame. Unbelievably overrated.

While Spielberg houses Saving Private Ryan in a groundbreaking, bombastic and terrifying shell to shock a reminder to the world of the sacrifices made in recent history to afford us our freedom and complacency, 1917 is a love letter to those who never gave up, and enlisted a purity of spirit to see their missions to their end. And like Saving Private Ryan, Sam Mendes does this with no less bravura and potency.\n\nIn many ways, despite the comparisons, 1917 is the antithesis of Dunkirk, a film that is more of an exercise than a cinematic experience, one that strains the limits of its medium in a different way, a finely tuned watch turned out and rearranged in front of you, and with a sadistic and pervading intent to accost and unbalance you immediately and not let go until the final moments.\n\n1917, however, goes out of its way to show you the linearity and simplicity of its thrust; the trenches, such as they were designed to be, are the perfect proof of concept to get the audience on board and lulled to this new version of cinema presentation with the long takes. The film takes the time to show you the world through environmental storytelling (not the first time in this review I'll reference video games!) and whereas Gravity put its bland characters and dialogue front and centre, 1917 carefully uses the extra characters and dialogue as a subconscious layer or normality, to draw you in to a hypnotic trance as Deakins' camerawork and lighting slowly pulls out of the faces of the leads their grief or exhaustion, wracked with unimaginable thoughts we are blessed never to have to think. \n\nAnd as such, and due to its vibrant camera work and unstuffy photography, it doesn't feel twee or old at all. The approach of ensuring 1917 didn't feel rote or samey and instead feel exceptionally present and modern and human also allows it to be relatable and less of an archive document and more resonant to now. \n\nMany of Deakins' shots are incredible. In fact almost all of them are, not content with stitching multiple long takes together, Mendes/Deakins et al have crafted a million moving paintings. And the long takes are a thing of beauty; a few conveniently placed rocks or cuts to black in the cloth of someone's back notwithstanding, this is the absolute best I've seen this kind of technology and approach being used. It's a far cry from the awkward shoehorning of some of Birdman's obvious cuts and even pips Cuaron's Children of Men for most impactful use of long takes. \n\nThis is most felt in moments of real loss. The camera, lingering there as we know it will, injected into me a deep sadness at the normality of death, the general lack of significance or theatricality. The acting then benefits greatly from these long takes, the characters feeling like they are ebbing and flowing physically and emotionally towards and away from us as if we're running to keep up with a busy friend, afraid we'll lose them. As they draw away they seem to emotionally retreat into themselves, and when we're gifted a close up, it's such a palpable and tacit moment that it eclipses theatre (the medium compared to 1917 most in early interviews) by proving us with the heartbreaking simplicity of looking into another\u2018s face. Mark Strong acts up a treat in the small part he's in and he's an enigmatic and welcome role and one that proves he can still act beyond generic villains with unconvincing American accents. \n\n1917 owes a great debt to video games; the walking simulator, the first person shooter and the stealth game. Certain moments feeling like they are ripped directly from video games; the tense barren walk listening for gunfire or footsteps, twitch finger on the trigger ready for when that enemy rounds the corner in Call of Duty, will you shoot or flee? Or those moments of respite and story in Metro, between the gunfire and struggle, as you wander through an enclave of survivors, or silently taking down an enemy as you spin the camera around to see if his mate can see you in his cone of vision. All these moments are fresh and immediate in a way that's missing from something like Dunkirk. However, I don't think that's the only reason for this, I think that using much more of a recognised first person perspective approach mirrors the diaries and letters and journals chronicling World War I and so 1917 manages to be authentic my borrowing from a very modern medium and arches backwards by reaching forwards.\n\nI'm intrigued why, besides in order to advance the timeline, that Mendes chose to put that single obvious cut in the film. And I'm not sure I liked or needed the subtitles, it pulled me right out of the experience and reminded me I was watching a film and it served little purpose, especially because the French was designed to be simple and he didn't really understand it anyway. I'm reminded of Polanski and his one regret with Chinatown when he wished he'd put the image on a camera lens upside down as it would have been in real life but for studio pressure he relented and put it the incorrect way for clarity. I wonder if Mendes would look back on this the same way.\n\nBut that notwithstanding the film is close to flawless. And despite being half an hour longer than Dunkirk, it doesn't feel it and I wouldn't have taken anything out. Interestingly it must have been tight and bold screenplay to allow for almost no wiggle room and little retiming. I guess that's Mendes' theatre experience kicking in. The film is full of little moments but they are the most meaningful parts. In some slim ways I thought Tarkovsky may be proud of it, and I had partial and welcome Stalker and Andrei Rublev flashbacks.\n\nThe film is essentially about you and this soldier. And how much you really connect with him is a testament to how earned and fist-pumping the more (brief) saccharine moments are. There's a close up towards the end of the film and I felt as if I could read the characters mind and I was completely urging him to make the decision I knew he would make anyway. That's powerful stuff and a feeling I never really get in cinema very much anymore.\n\nThose moments are swept up, bolstered, underscored or otherwise lifted by Thomas Newman's incredible score. Newman, not a stranger to iconic, recognisable and listen-to-able scores manages to do the impossible (for him) and creates a powerful score that doesn't immediately sound like his work. It's a score that tells all that's missing in a scene without the film having to resort to exposition. It's not an an obvious score until it wants to be. And it's a world away from Zimmer's now predictable cacophony even though it sometimes scantily resembles it in places.  \n\nThere was a moment in the film, a very deliberate moment of drama and arch-power when I realised what an aural and visual treat this movie was. It was like being on the stage of an opera; it was grandiose and energetic and flamboyant and iconic and at the centre was this small figure running through what for many could have been their afterlife. This \"afterlife\" moment felt like adrenaline itself; not shock, just awe; danger, fragility, beauty and purity. I have never wanted a moment in a movie, without realising it, more. It was cinematic bliss. Good job 1917. My day started and I was at work. But by the end of it, I was exactly where I wanted to be.",

The beginning defeated odds and probably the best part of the movie. To the escape , the 1 on 1 battled and running from all types of angles mainly supported the movie for viewers to continue to watch. The middle is the worst part of the movie, besides the part with the fire and the corporal meeting the woman that was a very touching and edge of your seat type of scene but other than that , the part where he's alone is the boring part of the movie because it didn't have really anything to make you want to watch it, so I see why they rushed his journey to reached the end of his destination to meet up with the captain, which brings the ending part which was a realllllll good scene and made me boost it up to an 8/10. The scene where he ran from across the battlefield was amazing. Could've been an 9 if the middle part wasn't an ehh.",

The best thing about it for me was the extraordinary amount  of mis-en-scene happening in the background of every shot. At least one of our two main characters are center frame for most of the movie as the camera follows them through a grimy, bloody, war torn country, and the detail really makes the movie. Whether they are wading through mud with bodies impacted into it, traveling through the crowded trenches of the front lines filled with soldiers, or darting through a demolished city at night with flares occasionally lighting up the sky and the German army in hot pursuit, the detail in the settings and the costumes really pulls you into the film.\n\nThe same can be said of the camera work and the one take style employed by the director, although here is where the film seemed a bit uneven to me. It was undoubtedly ambitious for director Sam Mendes to commit to the one take style, and for the most part, it was captivating watching the action unfold I real time. There were some quite astonishing sequences, including the apparent live crash landing of a German plane into a barn where the main characters had been standing moments ago. There were also parts where the fanciness of the camerawork was distracting. I found myself wondering how they could have set up the camera to float continuously over a pond or pirouette through the narrow hallways of a German bunker, which, while cool, takes away somewhat from the somberness of the subject matter. Finally, there were a couple of panning shots where the digitization wasnt quite right and leads to some graininess that bumped me from the movie for a time.\n\nStill, even the flaws are worth going to see the film, its an engrossing cinematic experience. I imagine a second viewing might make it better now that the novelty of the film making has fully sunk in, I might have to seek it out again in the future.",

The film is filled with historical errors, from the overall plot to smaller things like post war German helmets being worn. But most of these flaws can be brought back to the needs of the style of the film, such as having heavy artillery only about 100 metres behind the front line, a necessary flaw in a single shot film, unless they wanted to make it go for ten hours as the characters travel back kms to the guns. This is simply one of the few films where the historical errors can be ignored in order to enjoy the experience of the drama. Overall this is an absolute must see film.",

My only criticism would be that the tone changes near the end to more of a surreal effect, which I thought slightly detracted from the experience.  Also, while a war movie and rated R, it is not as gory as say, Saving Private Ryan or similar war movies.  Ultimately, it's a dangerous adventure story involving the quest of two soldiers to complete a life-saving mission that is very well told.  I highly recommend 1917.",

But the movie is so much more than just this unprecedented technical achievement. It is a film about brotherhood and friendship, it's downright heartbreaking in some scenes and its most impressive achievement is how it was conceptualized as an immersive adventure film and an exciting video game.

(Spoilers ahead) I found it difficult to connect to characters when they were portrayed from the beginning as one dimensional, particularly in the case of the jaded, recalcitrant protagonist who ends up taking the movie to its conclusion. The audience is given very little sense of who he is as a person before he becomes the one we're supposed to be rooting for. This made it difficult for me to cheer for him outside of \"do it for your deceased comrade who I felt more empathetic to!\" However, it has been said before and I will gladly say it again: in terms of cinematography, this movie is a masterpiece. I had heard that it was a lumi\u00e9re-style movie and thus from the beginning I was on the edge of my seat trying to find all the hidden cuts, and ready to criticize the camerawork within an inch of its life. However, not only was the editing seamless, but the camerawork, the set, the tasteful film score, and pretty much every aspect of the film simply absorbed you into it and by the half hour mark I had mostly forgotten my quest to find mistakes in favor of gripping the seat in front of me as I watched the story unfold with baited breath. Of course, the outcome was rather obvious from the beginning, but how would it be achieved? What obstacles would present themselves? These were the questions that unraveled before us in incredibly satisfying fashion, with delightful pacing and excellent cinematography. I appreciated, also, that blood and gore was utilised sparingly, only insofar as was needed to show the horror of the characters' experience and the nature of the war they were fighting. During one scene in particular, where the character paused to look with muted shock upon the face of a dead man, I fully expected the camera to pan to show his face to the audience, and was pleasantly surprised when this wasn't the case. The director was sensitive enough to understand that we only needed to see the protagonist's reaction to know what kind of scene he was looking at. Knowing what elements of shock were and weren't necessary paid off largely with this war film. 4/5 stars!",

You can almost see the hard work that the actors, set crew, and camera operators had to go through.\nI think that this movie is rather unique in the war movie genre because, other than other war movies (Saving Private Ryan, for example), this movie relies on the deafening silence that happens between these scenes of cold-blooded battles to get the emotions of the audience flowing, whereas other war films rely on the brutal battles that are fought. There isn't too much dialogue in the second act of the movie and the film relies on how the characters are reacting to these problems that they are faced with and their emotions that convey the true weight of these events, at hand.\nAnother aspect of this movie that I find rather pleasing is the ability to capture the claustrophobic horrors in the trenches, to the vastly open fields of this grand traverse that moves us from scene to scene. Another good thing that comes to mind is this movie's ability to build up suspense in every set piece if there will be a grand event or not.\nOf course, I love the one-shot look of the movie and, they are right, it does, sort of,  immerse you into this bleak-desolate world that was German-occupied France in 1917.\nOverall, exceptional WW1 movie. We all deserve to learn about the brave men on the front lines and beyond.\nSilas F.\n12 years old",

This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME! think one of the most impressive thing apart from the one looking shot is the AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. This shouldn't be no surprising since it is the legend himself Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 Cinematographer). Every scene feels like a painting and it is absolutely stunning. There is a scene at night where the lighting was done in such a creative way that heighten the tension of the scene. On that note there must also be praise for the score by Thomas Newman who somehow manages to make a score that somehow manages toe elevate every scene and help tell the story. There is also some amazing sound design that manages to make the War actually scary with moments that give horror movie jump scares a run for its money. Additionally, the props and set design should also get praise for creating such large,realistic but elaborate sets to accommodate for a more natural one shot scene. Everything in this film just feels like a technical achievement. We haven't even touched on the acting or story yet but just for the way this was filmed is already engaging enough. Nevertheless, the two main actors George MacKay as Lance Corporal William \"Will\" Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapma as Lance Corporal Thomas \"Tom\" Blake manages to do a phenomenal job in showing the horror of war and giving authentic,believable characters. The story, while relatively simple, is engaging enough to keep you invested in the objective of the main characters. They must send a message to allies stop them running into a trap. It's simple but works well for the aim of one shot as now it makes the audience a part of the journey.\n\nThere isn't much negative to this movie but I guess if I have to be quite nitpicky it is the fact that halfway through the movie there is a obvious cut. So this movie is actually really a two shot film. The cut was necessary to make the situation more desperate and allow for a unique change in scenery even though it was a bit of a jarring cut. Another sort of nitpick is that we don't really get much info on the main characters. We get their names and we know what their mission is but their backstory is just given in tidbits. It goes in a Dunkirk route in which we care about these characters because of the situation they are in rather than the fact that we are invested in the characters. It can be argued that the tidbits more than gives you enough info about the characters but it's really up to the audience in the end. Personally, I don't find it too much of a fault but can see how others could consider it so.\n\nHonestly my negatives are just nitpicks. This movie is amazing and it is definitely worth watching right now.",

While there were these components in 1917, it did not distract from the story. It did so well keeping a strong focus on the plight of the two main characters. Remarkably, might I add. This film also highlighted a key characteristic of the soldiers who fought in WWI - their age. There was no doubt that the men in the trenches and on the battlefronts were considerably young.

The acting is fine but nothing outstanding. The plot is very simple, and there isn't much action but a lot of the film is full of suspense. The set, costumes, and practical effects were all great but some of the CGI (such as when the main character jumps into water) could have been better. The main character should have died if the German soldiers didn't have Stormtrooper aim - he was running in straight lines half the time and instead of the German's stopping to shoot, they were running after him... Overall, I did enjoy the film but it's more art than action and some of the plot was pretty stupid.

The director chose to follow the actors with one camera and one continuous shot...it felt like the entire movie was one enormous theatrical play. Without changing cameras or camera angles, they had to be very creative with where they would take their breaks. Some of the scenes felt like 20 minutes or more, without stopping. That aspect alone, made it feel like you were in the trenches with the cast. It was perfectly timed like a dance that had been rehearsed a million times, yet also had an improvised feel, due to the fact that they just kept moving. I feel like any mistakes that happened during the filming, which there had to be at least a few, were covered by these very well prepared actors and it only helped make it appear more authentic. They depicted World War I with such detail, they really gave the audience an very comprehensive education. It was a great story and it was extremely tense. There were surprises around every corner. Again, from start to finish, this movie was an amazing attention grabber. 1917 is an epic film, in the truest sense of the word and a definite must see! If you\u2019re tired of CGI and you like character driven movies with a good story and great acting, you won\u2019t be disappointed with 1917.",

In 1917, during World War I, two British soldiers are assigned to race against time and deliver a message that will stop 1,600 men, from walking straight into a deadly trap. An intense war movie like any other that takes its audience 100 years back into the horror that men experienced in that terrible affair. This immersive, unnerving and nightmarish story was only possible due to the ambitious technical achievements in cinematography, production design and directing by Roger Deakins, Dennis Gassner and Sam Mendes, respectively.The daunting score of Thomas Newman deserves some praise as well as the main leads who convinced us of the courage and tenacity of the main characters. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, fearing for the safety of the soldiers and reminding us all the time that war is the worst thing that can happen to humanity, a bloody spectacle with no purpose other than causing trauma or death.\nLEST WE FORGET! \ud83c\udf3a\nBest of lucks!",

Eventually they were in segregated units but for sure not in the British Army\n- since the British Army was classist, it is unheard of that two brothers were one an officer and the other a corporal and British officers don't break down in tears especially in front of a subordinate\n-the characters were bidimensional and behaving like a today's millennial liberal art college instead of a battle hardened veteran after 3 years of war\n-German soldiers bivouacking in a Disneyland village scattered and in small units.\nAbsolutely one of the  most pathetic war movies I have ever watched, full of historical, geographical and character mistakes. Watch Band of brothers tv serie or Saving private Ryan to watch a believable war movie.

This is not a spoiler because similar comments appear in reviews. The dialogue gave me a bit of trouble understanding the British accent of the men, but all in all it was a well played movie about the hell the WWI doughboys went through. Somewhat graphic war scenes, but the overarching emotion for me was the heroism of the two men to continue onward at all cost. \n\nThe plot included character development, visuals of the trenches and the terrible mud impeding progress, sights of no man's land, the horror of the maimed and dead and a constant following by the camera of the two men as they struggled to complete the mission.

            "content": "The Sam Mendes' 1917 has been winning rave reviews from both critics and audiences for it's dazzling technical expertise and ultra-graphic depictions of the horrors of the First World War. When it comes to showing combat from the point of view of the front-line soldier, it does indeed capture the experience of mud, blood and sudden death as convincingly as any war movie since Saving Private Ryan, from which this film is clearly derived. But for a movie that is touted as being as realistic as all get-out, the details and premise of 1917 manage to utterly ignore the simplest realities of modern warfare  and basic common sense. \nThe story is about two British lance corporals who are given what we are to understand is a very dangerous, probably fatal mission: to carry orders to a Colonel, ordering the latter to call off his regiment's attack  on the Germans, because the High Command has learned that the German position is too strong to be taken, and the attack will be a massacre (also, and purely by coincidence, the brother of one of the couriers is serving in the doomed regiment.) The Germans have withdrawn to new positions, and the Colonel believes this indicates that they are ready to break if attacked, so he has advanced into the zone the Germans have evacuated, and is now isolated from the remainder of the British Army. This attack is planned for dawn the following day, but the orders cannot given by field telephone, because the Germans have cut the telephone wires. They will only need to travel  nine miles, through an area that the Germans have evacuated, but one of the corporals is sure they will need to start right away, although they must have more than 12 hours to complete the mission. \n There are so many things wrong with this that it is difficult to know where to start. First of all, if the Germans have indeed pulled out, why does everyone, from the general down, act as if the 2 corporals are on a suicide mission? Why did the Germans cut the telephone wire after they abandoned their old lines, and for that matter how, if their soldiers were gone? Why can't the British just repair the broken telephone line? Surely that would be faster and easier than sending couriers, who will probably be killed and thus fail to deliver the orders. Since the general knows exactly where and when the regiment will be attacking, we must assume he received this information from the Colonel.  So, if the Colonel (a waste of the talented Benedict Cumberbatch) is attacking without authorization, (more on this momentarily), as is implied, why wasn't he ordered to cancel his attack when he told the general about it in the first place? \nThe filmmakers clearly believe that consistency is for petty minds, and they cannot be bothered with anything so trivial.  Again, even though almost the first thing we are told is that the enemy has pulled out, the couriers somehow keep finding Germans to shoot at them.  At one point, one of the corporals encounters a British truck convoy headed toward his destination. So why couldn't the general send the messengers in a car, or give them to a motorcycle courier? It is hard to imagine a reason, and the writers do not even try. \nBut these are just a few of the minor holes in the contrived script. Even more serious is the way the screenwriters and director (the latter bears most of the blame, since he approved this brainless script,) blithely display their complete ignorance of the scale and operations of armies in the Twentieth Century in general, and the First world War in particular, in the film's premise. \nThe British  regiment in question, we are told, consists of 2 battalions of 1600 men each. We supposed  to believe that the Colonel thinks he can defeat a German army which had  somewhat more than  4 million men. Unless the Colonel was actively psychotic, he would understand that his regiment  could not accomplish by itself, even if I could break through the German lines (which it could not.)\nThis bring us to another sore point: the chain of command. Colonel was (and is) not a particularly high rank in an army of millions, and he is not any sort of free agent. At a minimum,  over him would be the Brigadier General commanding his brigade, a Major General in charge of the division, a Field Army commander, (a Lieutenant General or higher) and the Commander in Chief (or Chief of the General Staff,) a full General or Field Marshal  Without authorization from above, no Colonel still in possession of even a handful of his marbles would think about attacking the Germans with his lone regiment, and if he was crazy enough to try it, he would be relieved of command and committed to an asylum.\nFinally, even the details, which we are told are so very realistic, are falsified for cinematic effect. The climactic battle sequence (which was supposed to happen at dawn, but clearly is starting much later) as shown completely loses touch with reality. The Germans start shelling the British trenches the moment the attack starts, as if they had the schedule.  The hero runs across the deadly bombardment, with soldiers dropping everywhere around him, while he, quite unbelievably, remains untouched. We supposed to be watching a Company attack, roughly 100 men (attacking a Company at a time is even more ludicrous than idea of the one-regiment offensive,) but we see hundreds of extras leaping up out of the trenches to be slaughtered, a  battalion, at least. This of course, is because a company size attack would look puny and unimpressive, so forget about consistency.  And although we witness what appears to be the destruction of the entire attacking force, it seems that when they return (and seems to happens in the blink an eye, after the Colonel reads the order,) there are a fair number of wounded men  being brought back, but most of them seem to be unhurt. Yet, we saw them drop like flies when they went over the top just a few minutes before.\nWhile 1917  is acclaimed for showing the truth about World War One, all it truly shows is how little respect director Sam Mendes has for the facts, and how easy it is for a fraud like this film to pass itself off as history.",

Did not think this movie was going to be that good, and then I saw it and it blew my mind. The biggest thing I can say is that its just not what it seems when you first walk in to see it. It will suprise you and take you on that journey with them, with an amzing story. Must see in theaters to get that full experience; like the vibrations of bombs, the full view of the battle fields, the full volume of the music, and the rest of the audience audibly reacting. Going to see it again this weekend.",

Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes' hard work paid off here. I think I was most impressed with \u00c9coust at night, the lighting was done only by flares, yet I could still see what was happening in the movie (unlike a certain show that starts with G and ends with ame of Thrones). The one-shot felt smooth, immersive, and the script never seems to drag, another shoutout to Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \nThe acting was also phenomenal too. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are outstanding. Blake and Schofield are both the heart of the film, and I was very impressed with Schofield's character development, and George MacKay's performance. Also nice to see Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden in the mix. \nPlease see this movie in any way shape or form.

As it is rated-R, I expected the violence and the F-bombs. While I don't swear myself and am against it, this sat with me fine as in the place, time and situation, it makes perfect sense for the realism you feel. The violence wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting and I was pleasantly surprised they didn't need tons of it for added shock value. \nThere is a certain kind of beauty in silence. I explain this to others often, but a movie doesn't need narration. Someone doesn't need to always be talking. This movie made you absorb the atmosphere of quiet. It forced you to linger on mere emotions, expressions and desperation. And, if not silence, the eerie booms and bangs penetrates your being and serves as a reminder of the husk of war. The amount of unsurety that spills into a bountiful amount of determination that is seen through the film is breathtaking. \n\nAny thoughts that coax the urge to look back fade a way and all there is left is to press forward. \n\nAnd, besides the story, the cinematography was staggering. I've never felt both horrified and enthralled like this at once. Everything I watched was a disaster, but I was sure that I was watching shooting stars fly by and manipulate the shadows around the main soldier. As if making wishes on bullets and bombs was the resort one should take. \nThis movie, is, without a doubt, something to behold and envelope. Your emotions will go from the slightest of laughs, to the largest of anger and fear, to just wallow in sorrow of events that occurred.",

You root for them, you worry about their safety, and you care about them. This film relies heavily on the performances of George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman. They both give fantastic performances.

After awhile though you forget you're watching a continuous shot though, and you're just left with writing and plot. That's where this movie lost me. The main character should have (well WOULD have) died no less than four times in this movie based on the events that took place. Somehow though, he comes out relatively unscathed. Even when they make you think he was shot, apparently it just grazed his ear and he fell down the steps and was knocked unconscious. Near the end, he walks into a group of soldiers, his own in fairness, but not a single soldier was on lookout. He just walks up and sits next to them up against a tree. I mean wtf? the biggest issue with this movie is that time after time it sacrifices believe-ability for a great visual shot. When in truth, the main character is an idiot and never would have completed his mission. Yet too much Mendes chooses the great shot over a believable scene. Lastly, German soldiers make Storekeepers look like sharp shooters.",

Superb acting moves the audience, making simple scenes hit like artillery shells. The way the tension is ratcheted up with our protagonsists urgently darting through the trenches to the front line and finally across No Man's Land had me physically on edge. Dread filled me, waiting for something awful to happen, a similar sentiment to those lives being depicted. Yet, this was tempered with moments of light banter, dark humour shared between blokes trying to get through this terrible experience. This movie moved me to sobbing tears, an experience last felt during the wonderful Dunkirk. The futility of war was highlighted so beautifully, as was the glimmers of hope and kindness. Strangers sharing rations, drinks or even hope. I urge you to move yourself to a cinema, sit down and be swept away by Sam Mendes' stirring tribute to his grandfather.",

The plot is unpredictable and keeps the audience guessing as to where the next treachery will occur. The constant tension is interrupted by scenes such as the burning village of \u00c9coust, which can only be described as art. No less impressive is the stellar supporting cast (Firth, Cumberbath, Strong), who only have a few seconds to make their mark, but fill up these moments to the brink. Finally, there comes the question of the score. Although some viewers may find the score too vivid, disturbing their visual experience, I consider it a strength, as it ends up willing the characters through their treacherous journey. Overall, the movie succeeds technically as well as emotionally, without falling into the predictable kitsch of war movies.",

George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it's the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It's meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won't get at home. It's going straight into my Top10: Best Movies of 2019, and I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\"",

The plot is rather simple: deliver a letter across enemy lines or else thousands will die. It's straightforward and the action moves quickly.\n\nOne area that I appreciate about this film is the respect it pays to WWI. Special attention is given to the hell-like conditions that the soldiers had to face. 1917 does an excellent job showing how the Great War turned normal men into savages. It also did a great job showing the life-and-death conditions that people faced.\n\nBut, there were times I felt disconnected from the film. Is it from the dizzying speed the camera moves around? Is it the lack of character development and cheesy dialogue? Is it from the rather cliche plot? I felt no real connection to the characters until close to the end. Shame that this movie was missing that special something.\n\n1917 is a good movie to watch. Yet, I wouldn't call it too memorable. With a bit more polishing, this could have been a much stronger movie.\n\n3/5 or 3.5/5. Average or above average. Sam Mendes was missing that special something to take this movie to the next level.",

Also the main character lost his rifle along the way and I couldn't help but laugh when I saw him ditch his rifle. I could probably point out another 10 or so flaws along the way with this movie but see no point in it. I've conducted joint operations and training exercises alongside Her Majesty's own the Royal British Marines. Even during World War I British troops were better trained than this. In my personal opinion the director could have had a military consultant come in to make sure that movie was represented in an authentic light or at least near authentic. In my personal opinion I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has ever served in the armed forces. Even the coast guard knows better. I just don't understand how two people can be out in the open strolling laxadaisicle  shooting the shit. All in all this movie was shit and had onslaught of plot holes that left me with more questions than I had antisapated. I understand that this movie might have been based on a true story and some of the things could have happened but it could have been portrayed and or executed in a better manner.

The German troop dispositions left behind as the Germans executed their planned retreat to the very formidable Hindenburg Line were authentic, complete with the planned destruction of anything the Brits might find of use, and the occasional sniper. Many of the German troops left to destroy warehouse supplies that could not be evacuated from the heavily shelled town in the movie were drunk, which inevitably happens when troops are directed to destroy items that they can use for their own purposes, such as French wine,etc. The scenes from this part of the movie were quite authentic, complete with so many Germans shooting at the hero....and missing. It's hard to hit anything when you are 9/10 in the bag. \nThe story line moved along and kept pulling you in until you felt like you were there.

They were on a mission to save thousands of there comrades in arms no time for prisoners, mission first. Then the German Soldier started shooting from the tower he should Have avoided taken it out and slipped by and accomplished the mission.

            "content": "1917, I'm going to go out on a limb and say subtlety and warfare don't really go hand and hand. Had it's moments but didn't really work. It could have been because I was expecting a WW1 version of Saving Private Ryan given the trailer looked like a fireworks display. The marketing team played us well with an old fashioned bait and switch. If you were wondering how someone made a movie based around a flying plastic bag and made it art and then two decades later tried the same thing with a spinning plane out of control; you can say he's evolved quite a bit as a filmmaker. The character dimension is lacking here however and it makes me want to revisit American Beauty or Revolutionary Road to feel how a movie really touches your soul. \n\n\nI'm waiting for that lady who saw Drive and sued the film studio for making her think it would be a Fast and Furious movie sue Sam Mendes. The difference being Drive was a sensational movie and that lady was better off seeing that thought provoking and truly poignant work of art. \n\nI would recommend seeing 1917 based on your expectations being different than mine. Do not expect it to be a military spectacle like SPR, Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now, Blackhawk Down, etc. Nor should you expect it to have the same sentimentality as his earlier works. You should expect it to be an introspective look at what it's like sneaking behind enemy lines with rats jumping at you left, right, and centre. Did I mention there are a lot of rats in this movie? \n\nFor those gamers out there who have experienced the adrenaline rush of the very visceral Battlefield 1, I must tell you, you will find moments of ecstacy here and there but for the most part you may find yourself checking your phone while the protagonist tends to some random baby. He does attach his bayonet at one point however, now whether or not he actually uses it I will not say. There are also horses in the film, but whether or not he rides them and decapitates people with a sword, I will also not say. \n\nI will say this, the movie is a bit pretentious and a bit self-serving in that it's based on a story told by the director's grandfather that more than likely was grossly exaggerated for the sake of making it more enthralling and dramatic than it actually was. If you are curious as I was to see the movie, go check it out. I question how deserving the film is of all the accolades it has received so far, but that's material for another discussion. I'm giving this film one bayonet out of four. Not so much for the lack of bayonets, but the lack of: storyline, character development and scope; it's focus on wowing us with sometimes superfluous long takes; a lack of screen time for actors with last names similar to Cucumber and Cabbagepatch; lack of any of the Jonas Brothers; lack of any mention of Canadian involvement, and a lack of any overall suspense.\n\nIt's gets one bayonet for having some excellent art direction, costuming, and special effects but my goodness son save your canvas for painting us a picture of the dangerous state of America, something socially relevant, something with more substance, something meaningful, something poetic, something more deserving. War is cruel, war is random, war is brutal. It's not a series of scripted events that sees the character narrowly escape from each time. This is not Indiana Jones, but it felt like it. Next time at least have the decency to put Harrison Ford in the movie.",

(Apparently the schools are on strike so the cinema has matines all week.)\n\nThe movie takes place during the aftermath of the German \"March retreat\" of 1917. In March 1917 the Germans abandonned the Somme and retired to the formidable \"Hindenburg Line\". Colin Firth's character does not name the line but refers to its strength. \n\nIn fact the action doesnt take place on the Somme but a few kilometers South of Arras on the Artois front. (On the extreme left flank of the Somme Front.) \n\nThe story is entirely fictional and unlikely to have happened as depicted.\n\nI am not an expert on fortifications so i can't comment on the accuracy of the construction of the trenches. (I understand the famous historian Andy Robertshaw was a consultant so i assume the details are correct.) However I doubt the \"no man's land\" in this area as depicted was as devestated as was shown. But movies about WW1 always show devestated areas with shellholes...bodies and dead horses wether its true or not. To my understanding there was no serious fighting in this area since 1914 and there certainly wern't any derelict tanks on this part of the front at this time or ever. (I'm an expert on british tank operations in WW1.)\n\nBeyond \"no mans land\" there in fact were green fields and lots of vandalism as shown in the movie. The germans cut down trees along the roads and cut down orchards and poisonned wells. Buildings were destroyed and booby traps left behind.\n\nHowever there was no canal at Ecoust (the village depicted in the film) and certainly no raging river. That's all fabrication. I might be accused of being picky but there was also no fountain in Ecoust. There are surviving photos of the ruins at Ecoust but none were used in the reconstruction.\n\nI doubt there was ever something as foolish as an unsupported two-battalion attack on the Hindenburg Line near Ecoust on April 6 1917. The larger multi-division Battle of Bullecourt was fought a few days later nearby as part of the greater \"Battle of Arras 1917\" where tanks were used, to disastrous results.\n\nSo. What did i think of the film?  It's a good movie but considering the number of Great War historians that could have been available to help the producers, the movie falls short of depicting the actual history.",

Having rescued a shot-down German pilot who, in gratitude, stabs one of the soldiers to death, the remaining soldier is then surrounded by hundreds of soldiers who have mysteriously and silently appeared at the farm in trucks. Beam me down Scotty came to mind.  Dropped off close to his destination, the soldier is shot during  a gunfight with a German sniper but his injuries mysteriously heal leaving him without a mark. After being chased by more Germans, he hides in a derelict basement only to find a French girl and an obviously well fed baby who the girl explains needs milk. I neglected to  mention that he is suddenly fluent in French and she in English as he produces his water bottle which he conveniently filled with milk from the aforementioned bucket he'd found in the middle of the field. Forging on to his destination, he encounters numerous Germans but evades them all, ending up in river rapids and going over a Niagara sized waterfall during which he looses all his gear but finally arrives at his goal to produce the driest, cleanest and most pristine piece of paper with orders to stop the attack.  The orders must have been written with a yet to be invented indelible marker having survived all of the above. If this film wins an Oscar then I'll eat my hat.",

The rest of the cast are great in their roles as well, but the best character has to be the setting itself. WWI with its chaos and destruction is so grippingly portrayed that one could be forgiven if they thought that this entire film were created in 1917 with modern technology.\n\nAll in all, this is the best film that I have personally seen not just in 2019 but in the last 3 or 4 years.

            "content": "1917, the new movie directed Sam Mendez, is a cinematic masterpiece and nothing less. The directing's perfect, the acting's perfect, the sound design is perfect, the cinematography is perfect, the script is, well the script is perfectly fine. It's intense, it's emotional, it's stunning, it's horrific, it's a much-watch for everyone who exists. As you may or may not know, the whole movie is shot to feel like one take and it all serves to make you feel like you're really down in the trenches with them. Everything is almost always in motion so the plot also always has forward momentum. There's really not a single dull moment in this movie. It's a treat to watch from beginning to end.\nA lot of reviews I've read so far have praised the technical ingenuity of this film and I won't go into that because they've all said it better than I could. Suffice to say, check out all of the behind the scenes stuff you can find because it's almost as interesting as the movie. But one thing I really haven't heard a lot about is the sheer brutalness of it all. The protagonists will be crawling through no-man's land and you'll see the corpses buried in the mud with ghastly holes in their bodies and an entire ecosystem feeding off of them. This movie is not for the squeamish. That's not to say they shouldn't watch it. In an industry all to preoccupied now with cramming fan-service and nostalgia down your throat or beating you over the head with a message or both (not that either are particularly bad things, I personally just feel like they're over-played) It's nice to see a film that just lets the story speak for itself. It doesn't need Captain America wielding Mjolnir and it doesn't need to scream at you war is bad, it just has to exist and it says everything it needs to and it keeps you engaged the whole way through.\nSpeaking of it's anti-war message, that kinda leads to my one nitpick about the film. At one point, about halfway through, a character gives the protagonist a warning about his message that just kinda turns out to be nothing to worry about. That little scene felt like it was a remnant of a draft that was more explicit about it's message and it just was never cut. Other than that the message works really well. The whole central conflict almost feels pointless (that's not a knock against the movie, that's a knock against WWI), and it really shows just how meaningless the war really was. There was one scene where the protagonists do a good deed and I quietly thought to myself, \"Oh, here's the scene that shows how great the British are\" but no! The protagonists get punished for trying to be good people! And that's the movie, it's both nihilistic and optimistic in some crazy way. It's literally shot so it looks like the protagonist got back to where he started! And yet, it also feels like some good came out of this. It feels like the protagonists helped people that otherwise would not have been helped and that even through the craziness of war there are still god people. It's almost a shame that the technical aspects are so great because it means that not enough people are talking about the fantastic way it handles its themes.\nThe other aspect of the movie that is not talked enough about is the cleverness of how it resolves tension. It's hard to get into specifics without giving spoilers, but basically the movie has its protagonist go through one stressful scenario that makes you worry about one thing, for example at one point early one they go through what they think is an abandoned German trench and the audience is on the edge of their seat waiting for the German army to pop up, only for the tension to be resolved in a completely unexpected way. It's never clear until the very end if the protagonists are going to succeed on their goal because the movie throws so many wrenches, some little, some big, into what would otherwise be a very straight-forward plot into a riveting ride where you're never sure what's going to happen next.\nThe acting is also great. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were relative unknowns going into this but they are astounding in this. Their relative anonymity really makes them feel like actual soldiers and you're not thinking of them as the actors, you're thinking of them as young men in over their heads. In addition, the celebrity pop-ins, including the likes of: Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong and Richard Madden are all excellent. Most likely they were not getting paid a lot to do this and you can really tell watching them that they all really want to act in this movie. Nobody is holding anything back and nobody looks like their phoning it in. But HOLY SHIT Richard Madden! It's one thing to not phone a performance in and it's another thing entirely to own the movie with like two minutes of screen time. He probably was on set for like, half a day max, and he kills it. Like, whatever it is, he absolutely slaughtered it. He goes from excited and happy to absolutely devastated in just a couple seconds and he absolutely nails it. That one short scene has really cemented Richard Madden as a great actor and one that I excitedly anticipate following his career in the future.\nBut back to 1917. 1917 is a fantastic movie and definitely deserves the Best Picture nomination and would deserve to win it too if it can manage that. I walked out of that movie, my head spinning and my brain not working quite right. No other media has ever had that affect on me. So yeah, I mentioned before that this movie is not for the squeamish, but the squeamish should still watch it anyway. 1917 is not just a movie, it's an experience, and it's one that as many people should feel as possible. 1917 is a masterpiece.\n\nP.S. This movie also has one of the most triumphant climaxes ever. Like, I found it more effective than Endgame's massive CGI battle. Because it's not about fictional superhero's punching things. It's about actual human beings pushing themselves to the limit and pervading against all odds.",

Whilst 1917 lacked narrative and solidification as a story, having no where to go nor conveying an ultimatum, the film was not about narrative. It was not about storytelling. Instead, 1917 wanted to challenge the limits of film making - pushing it from an experience in the cinema into an modern art gallery performance. From a gorgeous colour scheme, outstanding lighting and shots which just capture the epitome of beauty - 1917 must be one of the most beautiful films I've ever witnessed. It contained the realism of war through sublime composition and created a personal feel with the main character as he battled the hardships of war. And whilst we still don't really know who the character is by the end of the film due to the lack of context and establishment of his characterisation, we feel content for him as the sun beams down on his face, creating deep broad shadows which signify hope for the future. In terms of production, it is truly a beautiful film and worthy of its box office acclaim",

With his latest feature, writer/director Sam Mendes has crafted a stunning portrait of World War I. Working alongside acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes draws viewers deep into the trenches of the war. From a technical standpoint, \"1917\" is an incredibly impressive film. Roger Deakins' one-shot technique is a risky approach, but it works tremendously well. Deakins' cinematography is as always gorgeous, immersing viewers in the setting of World War I. It is hard to not admire the excellent performances from the cast. George MacKay delivers a dazzling debut performance as Corporal Schofield. With riveting expressions, he captures the fear, terror and determination of a soldier on a life-threatening mission. It's a star-making performance that deserves to be recognized come awards season. Although \"1917\" is a technical triumph, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. Its story is slightly formulaic, and lacks strong character development of the best films in the genre. It is hard to be emotionally invested in the story when you barely know the characters. Nevertheless, fans of war films will definitely enjoy \"1917\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. At a time when war films are a rarity in Hollywood, its a timely reminder that the stories of war deserve to be seen and told.",

Compounding that video game feeling were the improbable situations and decisions that our heroes were presented with and distracted by:\n\nInstead of going over the German trenches\u2014my choice if I were on a vital mission with little time to complete it\u2014the two \"players\" improbably decide to go through and under the trenches. Of course, this leads to new, unnecessary adventures and challenges, otherwise needless and counterintuitive for a couple of guys on a vital mission and little time to complete it.\n\nFor example, they get distracted (did they forget to take their Ritalin?) by having fun bouncing on a German infantry mattress. Don't they have a vital mission to complete and just a few hours to do it?\n\nAnd then the explosion within the German tunnel. Under non-video game circumstances, the air inside the tunnel would have been so clouded and full of dusty crud they would have never been able to see to get out. Or breathe. Game over.\n\nNo matter that one of them was buried under a pile of rocks that should have killed him outright. (It's just that dust in my eyes!) Anyone else, if not already dead, would have had bruises and cuts covering their face and body for the rest of the movie.\n\nAnd a concussion. Experiencing a blast like that at close range would have ended the game right then and there from brain injuries\u2014apparently not convenient, however, to plot lines.\n\nOkay, I'm being harsh. But anyone else on a vital mission with just a few hours to complete it would have gone way around that farmhouse, not through it. Here our two heroes lose vital time unnecessarily undergoing a search and kill mission inside a deserted farmhouse that they should have left behind long ago.\n\nAnd why is it that English soldiers are always wanting to show compassion to the enemy while the Germans are only interested in killing them? This is war propaganda stuff. Didn't we get over that long ago?\n\nBut wait! The one surviving soldier has just a few hours to get his vital message to those 1500 troops who are going to die, and what is he doing? Playing with a baby! (A starving baby in a burned-out cellar hole, dressed like it is going to a Christening.)\n\nOkay, I'll give you the beautiful woman in that cellar hole. This is where beautiful woman like to hang out, of course. And we all know that the first thing any normal, healthy English soldier on a vital mission thinks about is sex.\n\nI said video game plot. You are given choices: hidden doors to go through, abandoned houses to enter, beautiful women, yeah, we know the software. Apparently 1917 was made by and for people who grew up playing video games and still see the world that way. A military drone operator must feel the same way.",

The film also suffers from a lack of charismatic players and characters, which you find hard time connecting emotionally.

Many dynamic shots feel static and boring. 1917 could be an educational movie about the boredom of cinematography. It's a pure technical film, and that's not a compliment. 1917 should be screened at a filmmaking educational institutes as a reference to exaggerated and unnecessary long takes",

I hadn't heard (living under a rock, apparently) about the genius long take cinematography that makes it seem like the film is one long shot, but I quickly figured it out and is so effective. Not just effective visually, and absolutely it is, but to the story.  These young men are on a mission to deliver a message that will save 1600 lives. They are undeniably heroic, but when you find yourself thinking about this film days later you will think that every one of those men they hurried past in those trenches would've tried to do the same. The film is essentially one day bookended by reflection under a tree on what really matters in life. And you know as a viewer that 6 April 1917 is only a little over halfway through the Great War. The Germans aren't on the run. The tides aren't turning anytime soon. Those men have another nearly two years of grinding along the dirty, infectious, festering, cramped, exhausted, starving, terrified, lonely, monotonous, brutal uncertain edge of life and death. It's hard for a modern privileged person today to even fathom that. That's why this movie is great. It opens your eyes to what your grandfather's father (etc.) lived. I think I got so much out of 1917 because I loved They Shall Not Grow Old, Peter Jackson's excellent WWI documentary. I can't forget the acting either, because besides the great cameos, George MacKay and Dean Charles-Chapman are both wonderful and should have received more accolades for  performances beyond their years. Sam Mendes is a master of nuance and 1917 will certainly be considered one of his greatest accomplishments. His grandfather would be proud, not only for the film, but for keeping those young men's deeds and sacrifices on our minds.",

            "content": "Written by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, and directed by Mendes, unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know that 1917 has been done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two shots (the marketing material says one, but it's two \u2013 there's a time-jump where no attempt is made to hide the transition). In reality, there are a lot more than two shots, but the edits have been digitally 'hidden', much like Birdman (2014) or Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli (2018). And although I have some issues with it, I think Mendes has made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are tightly matched, with the style effectively delivering the story in a thematically justified manner.\n\nApril 6, 1917; the Western Front. German forces have fallen back, and a pursuing British colonel believes that if he attacks now, he can turn the tide of the war. However, he's unaware that the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, two British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are assigned to physically carry an order calling off the following morning's attack. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered.\n\nSo, the film's big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable type of form that whenever it's used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way, or the form becomes gimmicky. Think of Rope (1948) which was edited to look like one shot, or Victoria (2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design. Compare this with one-shot films such as Russkij Kovcheg (2002) or the aforementioned Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli, both of which tie form to content. And I think Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins achieve like synergy.\n\nIs the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you're trying to spot where editor Lee Smith has hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits, instead letting the cinematography do exactly what it's supposed to do \u2013 immerse you.\n\nThe opening scene is a superb introduction to the technique. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then the mess, then down a ramp into the trenches. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we're moving in real-time through the milieu; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this sequence conventionally, and you undercut that.\n\nAlong slightly more conventional lines, one has to commend Deakins's work during the nighttime scenes in \u00c9coust-Saint-Mein. As we pass through the ruined town, the only light is from flares creating very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the light traverses the sky, it's as if the ground itself is in motion. You won't find a better study in how to compose a sequence using light and shadow.\n\nThematically, by its very nature, 1917 is far more focused on the micro than the macro \u2013 you might learn something about life on the front, but you'll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict. Partly because of this, it avoids, for the most part, the kind of cartoonish jingoism that make films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) so obnoxious. Indeed, the protagonists' nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film. On the other hand, you shouldn't expect too much psychological insight. The Thin Red Line (1998) it most definitely isn't.\n\nThe story is unquestionably paper-thin, but that's by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake are. One only need watch They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, they look like they've just stepped out of the makeup trailer most of the time, and it's glaring enough to pull you out of things on occasion.\n\nAll things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed 1917. The single-shot strategy worked well, and even if the film is weak from a character/storyline/theme perspective, it didn't really matter when form and content are this well matched. It could have been an empty technical exercise, but Mendes hasn't allowed that to happen. The Great War was hell on Earth. 1917 doesn't make us feel what that hell was like. Because no art form can do that. But it's a very fine approximation.",

Don't misunderstand- there is definitely fighting, explosions, and way related things, but the focus is on the journey. These two soldiers must deliver a message and they must pass through the enemy to get to their fellow troops. The first gunshot of the film made me literally jump, I physically left my seat for a second because I jumped so high. It caught me off guard because I was so focused on the story and characters. I highly recommend this movie. I will say it's not for everyone. There were times when it seemed to move a bit slowly, but the action always returned. There were scenes that may cause sensitive people to freak out a little- dead and mutilated bodies, etc. Lessons to be learned: loyalty, dedication, friendship, brotherhood, perseverance, courage, creative thinking. Probably more, but that's all I can think of at the moment. I watched the movie 10 hours ago, just now have the time and energy to write all this. If you fall asleep easily to movies with slower moving stories, you may want to wait until this one is on something other than the big screen, but it's definitely worth seeing on the big screen if you're into this kind of movie. I hope this helps someone make an informed decision. Have an awesome day!?! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",

You get on at the beginning and are propelled along the way on the edge of your seat. The lulls are like much needed breathers. It's visually stunning. There's a night sequence, which I won't spoil, that truly made my jaw drop. This is superior film making, there's no doubt about it. Mendes is in top form. He has cemented his place among the greatest film makers of all time with this film. For all the inevitable comparisons to \"Saving Private Ryan\" I have to say I think the two are perfect companions to each other. For how well SPR conveyed WW2 this film does WW1. See it.

They come across a farm, which inexplicably they decide they have to explore.  Any reasonable person would go around this farm, not to it.  I came out of the movie questioning if it was a war movie.

            "content": "1917 - A BEST PICTURE?\n1917 - A Best Picture?\n\nby armen pandola\n\nDo you like war movies?  What are your favorites?\n\nIf you like war movies and Saving Private Ryan or The Paths of Glory or even The Longest Day are among your favorites, then you will like !917, directed and co-written by Sam Mendes.  If you don't, chances are, 1917 will not make  a believer of you in spite of the fact that it is an odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nMendes won an Oscar for his first feature film, American Beauty, which no one watches any longer because it starred Kevin Spacey and because his character, a middle-aged man on the brink of a breakdown, has sexual fantasies about his teenage daughter's friend. \n\nSince then, Mendes has directed a couple of good movies (Road to Perdition and Revolutionary Road), a couple of so-so movies (Jarhead and Away We Go) and a couple of Bond movies (Spectre and Skyfall).  He comes from the theatre and continues to direct for the stage. 1917 is his first co-writing credit.\n\nSo, what does 1917 bring to the 'war movie' table that wasn't there already? \n\nPeter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old  has all of the horror of World War I,  Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory has all of its despicable commanders, All Quiet on the Western Front (1931) has the folly of its 'patriots' and Gallipoli (1981) has the tragedy of senseless slaughter. What else is there to say or show?\n\nMendes brings us a war movie that follows two soldiers for one day, keeping his camera on only these two and what they see and experience. Shot in segments several minutes long, the movie is stitched together seamlessly - or seemingly so. From its opening to its closing, the camera stays focused on the two protagonists. What does this add to the movie?\n\n'Tracking shots' are shots that go on for a minute or more without the action stopping in order to set-up a new shot. Alfred Hitchcock shot one of his least successful movies, Rope, the story of two rich kids who kill someone for the fun of it, in a few very long takes. Orson Welles starts off Touch of Evil with a three and a half minute tracking shot that ends in an explosion. Paths of Glory has a shorter (91 seconds) tracking shot of a general walking through the trenches. Scorsese's Goodfellas has a three minute tracking shot of Henry Hill and Karen walking through the kitchen of the Copacabana to front row seats. If you have noticed such scenes, then you are probably a film buff. \n\nWhat do tracking shots add to a movie? In the movies I have mentioned, long tracking shots have furthered the story. For example, in Goodfellas, the long tracking shot shows us how Henry, a small-time mobster, has special privileges because of his insider status, privileges that impress his date, Karen.\n\nWhat has filming 1917 like one long sequence added to its message?  It has focused our attention on two soldiers and two soldiers alone. This is a view of war from the bottom up. The stench and mud and rats are brought to the fore as two young corporals, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), undertake a mission to save sixteen hundred fellow soldiers from a senseless slaughter.  Sadly, Mendes decides to add to the mix a few 'special appearances' from famous actors a la The Longest Day (1962). The movie stops dead for brief appearances by Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, taking us out of the gory frontlines and into the world of make-believe. \n\nThere is not much depth in 1917.  Two soldiers are given what seems to be a suicide mission which one of them is eager to undertake because he has a personal motive - his brother is one of the soldiers who may be saved. Along the way, we are told small bits and pieces of their lives. They are not especially memorable, and the self-imposed technical limitations make it impossible for us to have a fully rounded portrait of them. In the end, they are just two soldiers, much like millions of others who were fighting on both sides - and dying. And that is 1917's virtue and its limitation. Given its narrow scope, 1917 can only appeal to our most sentimental feelings.\n\nThe best war movie that I have ever seen has not been in circulation in years - there are some pirated versions available on Amazon. The Victors is a 1963 British-American WWII movie written, produced and directed by Carl Foreman, starring George Peppard, George Hamilton, Melina Mercouri, Jeanne Moreau, Elke Sommer and Eli Wallach - yes, an odd cast, but an excellent one. The movie dares to be an anti-war movie in an era when such feelings were suppressed. WWII was the 'good war,' yet there was no sentimentality in The Victors - in fact, it showed the execution by firing squad of a GI deserter (a scene inspired by the real-life 1945 execution of Pvt. Eddie Slovik). \n\n In The Victors, war didn't make the men 'better' or more 'giving' or 'caring.' War did to the young men it trapped exactly what violence does to young men - it makes them worse, not better. There is a scene in which a new member of the squad finds a dog and starts to take care of it. When the squad pulls out of its camp, the sergeant tells the young soldier that no dogs are allowed on the trucks. As the young recruit sadly sits in the truck with his fellow soldiers, one hardened veteran tells the recruit to call the dog, so the recruit whistles to the dog, thinking they will hide it on the truck. Instead, the veteran shots it. That's what war does to young men, at least those who survive.  The Victors won no awards for presenting war as it is - and The Victors has been forgotten. A great loss.",

Sam Mendez directs an incredibly well shot movie filled with scenes that I will not soon forget. One scene in particular which took place in a French town at night was one of the most visually striking scenes of the year.  Roger Deakins continues to cement his legacy as one of the best cinematographers in film making with 1917, which is one of his greatest achievements. The only aspect of the movie that I feel holds it back somewhat is its lack of character development. The movie asks you to feel for characters which really do not receive much development throughout the film. That being said, I think the movie is still excellent and is well deserving of the praise it has received.",

What stood out to me was the \"one-shot-esque\" take, the haunting score, the creative lighting choices, the intense pacing and plot, and most importantly was the unique was the film provoked the audience's emotions. The acting from George McKay was stellar, where Dean-Charles Chapman's performance was great yet a bit forced. All in all though, my expectations for 1917 were rather high, but this film absolutely blew me away!",

            "content": "This is a review of the movie 1917. I gave it a D rating both for premise, historical accuracy, and dialogue. I compare it to Private Ryan which was a mostly \u2018A\" movie with only some illogical parts.\n\nThe premise is that it has been 3 years of trench warfare and for some reason in April 1917 the Germans in some sector have pulled back to a defensive line in the rear. A British battalion, without orders and for some reason, is chasing the withdrawing Germans thinking they have them on the run.\n\n1.\tThe scene opens with our two heroes walking through a trench. Their uniforms are clean, trench is very clean, wood is clean as are the sandbags. Reality was that after 3 years of trench warfare the trenches were filled with one to two feet of mud and water. Trench foot was a real problem. There was nothing clean.\n\n\tSo the movie begins like a 1950's Western and continues in this same vein.\n\n2.\tThe two heroes are given an assignment to travel several miles across no-mans land to give a message to this wayward battalion that they are running into a trap. Now its not actually a trap but rather another defensive line, but the movie keeps calling it a trap. \n\n\tWe don't know why two routine no account soldiers are given this duty rather than say actual couriers or intelligence people. Further, no reason why a group of say 10 soldiers aren't sent out at different spots to make sure the message gets through that the battalion is not to attack.\n\nWe are told that the British can't communicate with the battalion because the wires have been cut. What wires? This is supposed to be a fast action pursuit of a withdrawing enemy yet they have time to lay wire across enemy lines? Even so, after 3 years of war the British know how to fix cut wires. Further, the regular thing was to drop dispatches by planes and we see planes flying in this movie. So they would have dropped dispatches in reality.\n\nSo the premise is extremely nonsensical.\n\n3.\tSo the heroes jump out of the trench and start across no-mans land. We are told that two days before the Germans had killed a bunch of folks but now the way is all clear. The heroes jog across the bad land standing up for the most part. No crawling is allowed in this movie. No German snipers around I suppose. \n\n\tThey pass a dead horse. If the clean trench wasn't bad, this is absurd. If you look at dead horses and mules on the battlefield as in Civil War pictures you notice that their stomachs are all bloated from the internal gas. Just like humans. And they have shrapnel wounds, bullet holes and cannons have shot off legs and such. But not this horse. He looks like he is sleeping. Just lying there all nice and clean.\n\n\tWhat is worse is that horses were never in no mans land. They were behind the lines. They might get killed by artillery but to put them in front is to say there was a cavalry charge. No cavalry charges in WW1. Wrong war.  \n\n4.\tThen one hero gets stabbed by barb wire. No gloves. So now he has tetanus.  He's going to die. We don't get antibiotics until around 1945. We used sulfur before that but not even that in WW1. He's going to die. He wraps a bandage around his wound.\n\n\t\n5.\tThen they pass a tank in a crater. The Mark 1 British tank was first used in the fall of 1916. They didn't have the Mark 2 and 3 until late April and summer of 1917. This tank appears to be a Mark 3 so it wasn't in use in April 1917. They also did not send tanks across craters. The tanks went about 8 miles an hour and constantly had mechanical problems. They did use them to cross barb wire and trenches but not craters.    \n\n\tBTW, Americans like Patton and my Great Uncle George used French tanks cause the US didn't make any.\n\n6. Our heroes get to the German abandoned trench. They keep saying they are on a time constraint and must keep moving but they divert to explore some underground lair. Made no sense.\n\n6.\tThey get to a bombed out farm house and what do you know, there's a cow? So after 3 years the Germans have not gotten around to eating this cow. Riiiight\n\n\tAnd there is a bucket of milk. Now this is old unpasturized bacteria filled milk bucket and our guy thinks it's just great and fills his canteen. Riiiiight\n\n7.\tThen we come to the German airplane scene. The plane is shot down. Most of the time in these sorts of crashes the pilots were dead. Maybe a few survived all unconscious and all broken up. But not in this movie.\n\n\tAfter our heroes pull the pilot out of the burning plane saving his life, the pilot is on the ground in the lap of one of our boys, who the German pilot then stabs in the stomach!!\n\n\tOur boy never sees the pilot pull the knife because he is too busy? Looking at his cell phone? So our guy is lying there stabbed and is now in the lap of his buddy. I thought I was watching a 50's Western with Audie Murphy. You have the usual dialogue,  \"You'll tell Mom won't you?\" Of course, I will. Am I dying? Of course, you are.\"\n\nI wanted to add, \" And tell my girlfriend Sally won't you? Yes, as soon as I screw her brains in cause you're not there cause you're dead.\" But no dialogue like that.\n\nNow this same buddy has just wrapped his tetanus diseased hand in a bandage. But he never takes his friend's shirt off, pour water over the wound to clean it and then wrap another bandage around the entry. Because wouldn't you know but about a minute later another company of men show up and they have a medic. Or in real life they would've.\n\nAnd stomach wounds can be fatal if they hit a vital part or not. Seward, who bought Alaska from the Russians, was assassinated on the same night as Lincoln by the same group of people. He was stabbed multiple times. BUT because he was so grossly FAT none of the wounds were fatal and he survived!\n\n8.\tSo now we are down to one hero. He gets in a truck with the others. And in the truck is a Kurkha or a Sikh. Ridiculous. Colonial troops did not serve with regular British troops. They had their own unit officered by the white man. But in this movie, they show him with regular British troops. \n\n\tIn the war in Italy in WW2 the French used Algerian Colonials who had these really long knives. They routinely would go into an Italian village and rape all the women and kill the men. They did not serve with regular troops.  But they were on our side.\n\n9.\tOur hero gets off the truck and crosses a river. There is a German sniper in the window. If this is familiar it is because they stole the scene from Private Ryan. In that movie the sniper does not miss because he's a sniper. But in this copy the sniper is a terrible shot. He misses and continues to miss. Our hero shoots blindly at a window and by golly wounds the sniper.\n\n\tHe then goes up the stairs after the sniper. Forget the mission, Forget the time constraint. Lets go up the stairs. The going up the stair scene is another Private Ryan copy. He opens the door and shoots the German just like the German did in Private Ryan.\n\nBy the way he is using an automatic Enfield, which did not exist nor does it today. The Taliban used these same Enfields against the Russians. They don't today cause they have lots of our weapons. The Enfield in WW1 was a single shot rifle with a lever for ejecting the shell and inserting the next cartridge. You could have a 5 or 10 shot magazine but you still had to pull the lever. Not in this movie. It shoots like an M1. \n\n\tThen he finally makes it to some burned out village. No idea why it is burned out since it was in the rear lines of the Germans but no matter. The village is full of Germans. Don't know why since they had withdrawn but no matter. The Germans shoot at him. Point blank. And miss.\n\n\tBut wait there's a woman. Every other person has evacuated but not this woman. And the Germans haven't raped her. They haven't raped her because they just can't seem to find her and they are too busy missing at point blank range.\n\nIn WW2 the American army left plenty of raped French woman behind. I am reminded of my Uncle's unit where they told me a story of coming upon a farm house and the husband charged the men American dollars to go upstairs and have a go with his wife.\n\nAnd wait, she has a baby!! That's right, the whole town is gone except for her and this baby. And she needs milk. So he gives her his rancid milk. He doesn't know that women who have babies carry their own supply.   \n\t\nThe woman talks French and he speaks only English but somehow they understand each other perfectly! Seriously! I think they were reading the subtitles.\n\n10.\tHe is then chased by Germans again who again miss at point blank range. Then stealing from Last of the Mohicans he jumps into a raging river and waterfall. It is the exact same scene from Last of the Mohicans.\n\n11.\tThe river carries him exactly to the lost battalion he was trying to find. So our hero doesn't have to stumble around for a hundred miles trying to find them, the river brings him right to them. Such luck!\n\n12.\tHe then runs through a trench to find the Command Post to tell the General, who we are told doesn't obey orders, to call off the attack.\n\nTrench? What trench? Why is there a trench? I thought this battalion was chasing the Germans. Yet they had the time to dig a very clean trench with a very clean sandbagged and all Command Post. Must have taken weeks. Not in this movie.\n\n13.\tHe reaches the General. The General says\u2026.wait for it\u2026..he says ok, the attack is off. And the movie is over just like that.\n\n\tI think a \"D\" might be too generous.",

On the Western Front the Germans have retreated.  The Commanders of the second Division of the Devonshire Regiment are under the impression that the Germans are weak and one decisive attack on them will force Germany into surrender.  However it is revealed that the Germans have retreated as part of a tactical strategy and are actually preparing a major counterattack and hope to lure the Allies in and overwhelming them.  Two British soldiers are ordered to go to the front line and deliver a message to the commanders of Devonshire to call off  the attack.   The two soldiers somewhat reluctantly go to carry out their orders and meet with dangerous obstacles.   Sound familiar?  That does not mean that \"1917\" is bad, it is just a bit disappointing and unoriginal.

            "content": "An achievement in movie making, for sure.. but Best Picture?  I don't think so.\n\nLets start with the good.  The most obvious is the telling of this story in one single view. No cuts or passing of time. Everything occurring real time. The number of extras involved, the battle sequences, its is choreographed so wonderfully that the movie offers something that no other movie provides.  A real perspective... as if you are on the journey with them.  It is wonderful way to view this story and one we don't see used often (like in Birdman). However, it does come at a cost in this story and that is a lack of any real emotional connection to the characters.  \n\nThe movie begins with two soldiers being told to see the Generals and from that point, they are off. How much do we really get to know about these characters?  Why should we care about them other than the importance that they be successful in the mission they have been tasked with?  \n\nAs they are trekking through No-Mans land, they are on the look out for enemy Germans. Not really an opportune time to have any real conversations of any real substance so we never really do get to know the characters.  The mission, and ONLY the mission seems to be real focus.\n\n1917 is definitely fascinating to watch and certainly worthy of  a trip to the theater but it carries very little emotional impact on the viewer as compared to other war movies that have used more conventional methods of film making (Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Band of Brothers).\n\nI almost feel that the movie would have been better served allowing us to get to know these characters first before moving on to the one take perspective.  Give the audience something to connect them to these soldiers before they carry out their arduous, incredibly treacherous mission.  Yes the stakes are high, for them and for the success of the mission... but if we know our history, we already know how the story ends, so what is needed is the journey, which is not just the mission itself but what it means in terms of what the characters have to lose.  That all gets lost without SOME focus on the characters.\n\nThe point is this.. The movie is interesting because of its perspective, but beyond that, does it make you think? Does it make you feel?  If it doesn't, as war movies go, isn't that kind of the point?  To make you feel or think.. about something... anything?  \n\nFor me, this movie simply felt like a movie where I came in at the point where the film was starting the beginning of its build towards a climax but I had missed all the exposition prior to it.   So while there is tension and there is peril, there nothing to connect my interest in the characters other than the success of the mission.\n\nSo the movie deserves high marks for its direction (no easy feat to coordinate a one take perspective for 1hr 30 minutes). It worked well in Birdman.. but the difference is, in Birdman, we also got to KNOW the character and connect with him through the length of that movie.\n\nGive the movie its props for cinematography, set pieces, visual effects, etc.. as well. Academy... nominate away.\n\nBut Best Picture? Based on that list of nominees, there are others that I believe to far more deserving.",

The only problem with this movie is it was obviously not being truthful. It showed one ridiculously unlikely event after another and the believability was lost about ten minutes in -- and it got even more ridiculous from there.  The final deal breaker for me was the scene where the two leads pull an enemy soldier from a burning plane. Made no sense especially, right after the speech one of them had just given about being so intent on getting the message to his brother and the 1600 soldiers whom they needed to save. So suddenly his priority was saving a dangerous  enemy soldier, putting his own life in jeopardy. And what happened after that was something I've seen in dozens of movies. In fact a lot of stuff in this movie seemed ripped off from other movies.  Another really bad thing about this movie was the scoring, which was horrific and didn't fit the movie at all. At times it seemed like music for a cheap horror film and other times it seemed a throw back to some patriotic propaganda movie from the 60s.  The long shots with no edits seemed to go on and on...were pretentious and extremely boring.  I really didn't like this, nor did my husband, who had pretty much the same thoughts on it.",

You were not invested in the characters.In Hacksaw Ridge movie about a true guy that pulled many  injured men off the cliff there was character development.\nIt was confusing when the guy died that right around the corner was a whole troop on the other side of the house. They came up quietly and none of us heard it. It occurred really quickly.It was awkward. \nThe first women in the movie was seen 1 hour and 5 min in the movie. I felt they put her in just to have a woman in the movie.  The other two movies were edited better as well. \nThis I did not have any emotional investment.  They are just two guys who we do not know go through a harrowing ordeal to save others. I also did not know how a guy in a wool uniform in such a short span of time how he got dry so fast. Only the lower part of uniform wet. The movie did not do it for me.

If they fail, thousands die.\n\nThe film portrays no glory of war. It holds back from being over the top dramatic. Instead, it sucks you in to the action. The whole timeline of the film is just a few hours of action, with just a handful of characters. You get an ever so tiny view into war, from an angle you would have experienced. No big overview. No information that the characters don't get. \n\nThe whole film is designed to appear as a single shot, the camera following these brave young men the whole way. Every now and then, though some of the subtlest camera work I've seen, you're drawn to a horror of war that hardly seems to impact the battle scarred youngsters. \n\nThe film hits home. The story would have been played out thousands and thousands of times, every day, for years. \n\nIf anything, this film is a lesson in perspective. \n\n- Putting our current struggles into perspective\n\n- Putting war into perspective. It's not Nation Vs. Nation, it's man vs. man. Individuals vs. individuals. A life vs. a life. \n\n- Putting people into perspective. There are two moments, in particular, when the duty towards others trumps the duty to one self. \n\nA great film. 100% would watch it again. Please go see it if you can.\n\nFor many of us younger folk, we know nothing of the horror these men went through. Either our relatives didn't talk about it. Or we've had our knowledge crafted Hollywood. \n\nGood work Sam Mendes et al.",

So many obstacles to negotiate, extras to co-ordinate and marks to hit, only a seasoned director like Sam Mendes could have pulled it off. It features a lot of big names, but much like The Thin Red Line many of them are only on screen for a few minutes, raising the question of why they needed such stars in the first place. The film is a solid piece of work, but aside from the one-shot style, there's nothing that distinguishes it from most other high-profile war films. Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Apocalypse Now; all of these films were made with more conventional styles, yet all were more emotionally resonate, tense and impactful. Mendes has a crafted a film that is more to be admired than enjoyed. I get the impression that if it had been shot in an ordinary fashion it wouldn't have attracted the plaudits it has. But I'm not trying to take anything away from the production. I really liked how it was put together, giving us a sense of escalation, making the viewer a third character, showing how far the lead has to go to accomplish his mission, which is to deliver a message. It's definitely worth a watch, and on the big screen I imagine its attributes will be increased tenfold, but in years to come, I suspect it will be regarded as a film that audiences will marvel at, rather than be moved by.",

            "content": "So we all know that war is ugly. War is gross. War is full of heart wrenching experiences and unfathomable grief. That is why war has been romanticized throughout the ages. It can capture your imagination and twist your emotions up in knot and get up in your face and grab your soul . We all root for the \"hero\", the \"good guy\" who is fighting the \"enemy\". We want him (or her) to \"win\" and settle in the end with a justified outcome. The outcome in a war story told for the big screen makes us feel good. The end result justifies the means, over and over again. At least in the movies. If a movie were to realistically depict all the consequences, and not just the justified ones of combat, the realism would make us sick. Not that movies haven't tried to portray realism, but they pick and choose what to describe in order to illicit a response from the viewer. 1917 is no exception. \nOne thing I didn't know going into this movie is that there are no Americans present. You have to listen to the dialog with the British accents, which occasionally were lost on my ear not accustomed to Brit speak. We Americans are so used to seeing and hearing war stories with the Americans winning and holding the Stars and Stripes up high, that it was like \"oh\u2026.okay, no Americans here\" and it took awhile to sink in.  \nThe opening scene shows the trenches in France where British soldiers are hanging out waiting for their next move. We've all heard the expression \"battling in the trenches\" but we've never really experienced it, have we? There's hardly any color available for the eye to grab on to. Everything is bland and near monotone of brown and gray. Mud, dirt, and rocks and war torn men in same color battle gear are all that's there. A skinny trench of a hell hole existence for these men who are there either willingly or maybe not. I do have to say that one thing this movie does well is make you feel like you are there, so that afterwards you kind of have a small puny inkling of what it may have been like to actually have been present. That's exactly what this movie tries to do more than other war movies. The panoramic views of desolation and barrenness gives the viewer a sense of desperation and hollowness. It's as if everything that is good on this green earth has been stolen and forgotten. \nThe two men who are chosen to go on a special mission at the beginning just seem like two random guys in the middle of the pack. We don't know anything about them. There is no back story about who they are or where they've been prior to latch onto . That is one thing I wish the movie had done. For when we get to intimately know a character first, we get more sucked in to the story. We can only imagine, because really at this point they just seem like \"soldier No. 1 and soldier No. 2\" dudes. That's not part of the story. The character development is made simultaneously as it moves full steam ahead. The plot is pretty simple: Two seemingly brave yet afraid men go on an outwardly impossible mission to save a huge number of other men from complete annihilation. If they complete their task, they will be heroes. It kind of makes you wonder though, if in real life if such a mission was thwarted by any number of possible situations, they would never be remembered as heroes, but just one of the many casualty numbers. Hmmm\u2026\u2026 how many men died out in the battlefield trying their best to be brave but didn't get to complete their heroic task? They are all but forgotten by the world. But here, this is a movie, and of course the outcome has to be the good one or it was all for naught.  The movie's direct objective is to get you to like the ending so you can walk away with a justified sense of the war's purpose. The men don't know what they are about to encounter and they know it's extremely dangerous. One man, Blake, sets out with willful determination all gung ho style, because he was chosen for the fact that one of the men who will be saved, should they complete their mission, is his brother. \"No time to waste let's go!\" The other soldier in the duo was his combat friend next to him that Blake chose himself, before he knew what they were in for. Of course his choice proves to be providence. This guy (Schofield)  is anxious and fearful, he doesn't want to go at all and tries to think through the plan of action so as to improve the odds of survival. So here we have two opposing forces which sets itself up right away as the dominating pull. The fact that war is awful, terrifying, and revolting, yet brings up the courage and bravery inside a human soul that they didn't even know was there to defeat the enemy which stands in the way of going home to be at rest and safe. There, that is basically the whole plot. It's the details that get laid down that make up the bulk of the movie. Probably typical scenes described by former veterans, all jumbled into one inclusive narrative. This is probably one of the few quarrels I have with this movie. It puts too many typical WWI war  incidents all into one two hours long story.  I had wondered if this tale had any basis in any real life event, but come to find out no, but it \"could have happened\" is the footing. I mean, if we are watching something outlandish like The Avengers, we know it's all made up make believe science fiction, but when we watch something like this, while  in the back of our minds we think \"this could have really happened\", it automatically sets you up for a different reaction. The movie's set design all along the way is this film's forte. It's what captures your empathy. If there are any worthy Academy awards to be handed out, it should be for cinematography and set design. When my son saw this movie before I did his review was \"you need to see it on a big screen\". Yes, that is true. Otherwise you are missing out on the film's primary force. The film has a  sitting on the edge of your seat type of nervous tension as the men go about trying to get to their goal, which is to cross no man's land of enemy territory to get to the ranks of 1600 men's general  about to head into an enemy planned trap, to call off the attack before it's too late. We know they don't have much time to get there, and there will be a lot of possible snares. It's the \"snares\" that we are watching in real time, at least that is what the movie makers have you perceive. It was supposed to take about 6  hours as stated in the beginning of the mission, but we get to see it all unfold in about 2 hours. \nIn the end it's like you just went on a wild thrill ride where you scream at every drop and tense your muscles at every whip turn, only to breathe a sigh of relief as it pulls into the exit gate. Isn't that the goal of the every screenwriter, director, set engineer, actor and actress ? Speaking of such, there's hardly any women in the character list. The one and only female turns out to be an abandoned French girl living in a basement of a blown out building, with nothing other than an orphaned baby that she doesn't even know that she's trying dutifully take care of. And of course, this young woman rises up above all the misery and shows the tender side of humanity that hasn't been lost yet, while she tries to communicate with a non French speaking soldier and give him wound care. We see the soldier respond with likewise compassion when he gives his milk he saved in his canteen for the baby's survival. Here we see translation subtitles for the French dialog.  (I love hearing French spoken since I tried to learn it with 5 years of French classes in school but I'm still not fluent, \u2026.oops I digress)  Okay, that was clich\u00e9! I felt like the movie could've done without this part, but then there wouldn't have been any female roles to play at all! Of course the female represents all the opposite attributes of war. It's in fact the men's mothers and sisters they think of, and have pictures of that they hold dearly to their chests, when faced with these dreadful sufferings of war. \nThere are a few other clich\u00e9's too, like the man angelically singing a folk song in the middle of the woods to the men waiting to go to battle on the next wave of the attack. The main character, Schofield, hears his voice way off in the distance and he follows it to end up in the ranks he wanted to find. Of course, he obtains his primary goal, by the hair of his chinny-chin-chin while we all hold our breath. Everyone in the cinema was silent, I suppose from all the breath holding and lack of oxygen. I stayed until all the credits rolled because I love to hear the score, and I try to read some of the roles, locations, and names whizzing by in rapid tempo. Did you ever bother to notice the score playing at the end of a movie? It's like a nightcap on day's end, or a silk cover of a book being closed. You should really try to stay to the absolute end of the reel's roll the next time you attend the cinema. I always felt that jumping up out of your seat and going back out in the hallway during the credit roll is like skipping the best encore song of a band at a concert so you can get a jump on the traffic! What the heck? Why make the effort and spend the money if you don't even bother to stay to the very end? Your missing out on a part of your experience. You're cutting the movie short and not giving due attention to the whole realm. Of course, if you hated the movie and you were squirming in your pants the whole time waiting to get out of there, the credit roll is your cue to depart, like a dog being let of its leash.\nWhat I did notice in the credits was the numerous names listed for the set design creation. As I said, this is the film's forte. It does it's job of sucking you in and giving you thought provoking after effects. Yes, it is a well crafted movie for experience's sake, and I give it a 7/10 in the end, or with Rotten Tomatoes it's a 3.5 out of 5",

            "content": "War is a brutal and painful for all involved so it is generally a subject that I do like seeing represented on screen as it is either glamorized in a disgusting fashion or is seen in all it's horror and depresses me intensely. Fortunately this film is the second type of film as it does not share the pro-war sentiments of Patton (1970) or The Longest Day (1962) but unlike a classic like The Deer Hunter (1978) it never emotionally grabbed me. The film's primary selling point is the incredible cinematography of the legendary Roger Deakins who makes most of the film seem as though it was filmed in one shot and brings the lovely orange tint that denotes most of his work to the picture.\n\nIn April 1917 during World War II the British troops are settled in the Western Front in France and are planning to attack the Germans whom they believe are weak and will be easily overpowered. General Erinmore, Colin Firth, has received word that the Germans have in fact fooled the British and retreated for tactical purposes as they will easily be able to defeat the 1600 British soldiers who will be deployed. He enlists two young soldier, Lance Corporal William Schofield, George MacKay, and Lance Corporal Tom Blake, Dean-Charles Chapman, to inform the soldiers waiting to attack at the Hindenburg Line that they should call off the battle. The two young men struggle to make their way across no man's land and Blake dies in the process lying in his newfound friend's arms. Schofield keeps going but is momentarily diverted in Ecoust Saint-Mein where he is knocked out by the bullet of a German soldier and treated by a French woman who is caring for a child who is not her own. He abandons them and continues on his quest but just barely escapes being shot by several Germans who want to murder him.\n\nDeakins is a master of his craft and that is on display here as he takes a gimmicky idea and makes it work with the film being enhanced by the sense that battle is non-stop and inescapable. Where we would usually cut away from men walking through fields, reminiscing about their fellow soldiers and the silly mistakes they once made this film allows the camera to remain on them. We get an understanding of the boredom that can come with being involved in a war as well as the fear and tension built up by being a few seconds away from death at all time. The boredom and monotony of having to walk over a terrain that seemingly never ends accompanied by one man who you probably do not know all that well is something that many soldiers probably experienced and these dull frustrations only serve to highlight the terror of later scenes of action. When we do reach the bombed out French town that Schofield takes refuge in for a few moments we see the flickering yellow light that will appear every few seconds to illuminate the targets of the German soldiers already settled there before being plunged back into darkness. I did find it funny that the film I was most reminded of while watching Schofield's daring escape from his enemies was The Fugitive (1993) but I have seen few films in which men jump off the top of a waterfall. He is deservedly picking up a lot of accolades for his work and he makes a film that I was otherwise unimpressed with remarkable in some ways.\n\nBeyond the impressive visuals the film is not much to behold however as it's plot is unexceptional and the actors and the screenplay do little to make us care for the young men we follow over nearly two hours. They are fragile and face incredible danger no matter what they do but when we know so little about them it is difficult to see them as valuable people and not just nameless, faceless robotic soldiers. MacKay is a fine actor and gives a good performance in Captain Fantastic (2016) but he does not get enough to work with here to make Schofield a great heroic figure and Chapman is on screen for what feels like so little time that we barely get to know Blake. If the film had put more effort into making me care for these men I would have been emotionally moved and incensed at the fact that so many young men lost their lives because of a meaningless conflict as I should have been.",

The cinematography is amazing because of the fact it makes the whole movie look like it's shot in one take but that overshadows the story that is quite lacking from my point of view. I also noticed this in Dunkirk aswell. So for the video game-ish look of the movie and a strong performance from George MacKay this movie is still good, but it could have been better with more character development.\nSo if you liked Dunkirk, you'll also love 1917. If you didn't, then not very much",

WWI is the war with anonymous boys defecating and dying in the mud. 1917 is both a powerful anti-war film and commentary on the history of war films. A seamless take from start to finish, 1917 doesn't have time to inspire us. It doesn't have time to give us real characters. Those who criticize the film for what it lacks story-telling wise fail to appreciate that these \"film-making\" sacrifices are deliberate -- and necessary in order to create a true-to-life world of war. The \"celebrity\" cameos -- brief and unexpected parody the war films that came before -- Tom Hanks and John Wayne.\n\nAnd the world in 1917 is unto itself -- an inversion of Genesis, it is built backwards from death and devastation. Earth -- the mud of No Man's Land; Wind -- the gust of tumbling wood; Fire -- the explosive destruction of machines of war; Water -- ever the way to salvation.\n\n1917 is a gospel of War -- and its visceral brilliance makes it one of the finest ever put to screen.",

The story is simple, tense and almost exhausting as the Corporal goes through his mission to get to fellow soldiers on the other side of enemy lines. The setting, cinematography and realistic grit make this movie well worth the watch. As far as the dialogue goes there isn't much, it's also hard to build a connection to any of the characters other than the two main ones. The rest of the cast are merely cameos or blips. There's been some comparison to Saving Private Ryan by some people and I can understand that. That was the first movie that came to mind when I watched as well. In my opinion Saving Private Ryan still reigns as one of the greatest ( if not the greatest) war time cinematic movie of all time. The graphics and details in both movies are amazing, however Saving Private Ryans battle scenes were much more intense and detailed. You can also have a better connection with more character's in SPR. As far as the stories go both are good with Saving Private Ryan having more memorable moments. 1917 definitely cracks the top 10 of great war movies.",

With incredible inciting incidents that push the characters to new and uncomfortable places, we see some of the finest character development of the year (2019). While the story is not the most incredible tale this generation it is convincing enough. You are told to deliver a message, it may very well save your brother\u2019s life. You can\u2019t use the phone, you must walk a piece of paper to its destination. It\u2019s convincing because setting and time period allows no other way of communicating to the person the message is for. The shots in this film are incredible and show the bloody, deadly, and most importantly destructive nature of war. This is especially highlighted when we are placed into a whole town set on fire and our hero\u2019s must navigate through it without being detected. While meeting the civilians that had gotten stuck between the fighting. In total this movie is for anyone that enjoys a good well put together story with both incredible shots and characters.",

Although to my pleasure it instead enhanced the movie experience to a level where I was near-hypnotized, something a war movie has never been able to do for me. Everything from the costume design to the set-pieces and acting were on point, as well as perfect casting and excellent obscure casting choices. Roger Deakins also continues to prove that he is the best movie cinematographer to have ever lived. The movie does an astounding job at involving the viewer, it truly sucks you into the film and its world, and will blow by as the fastest 2 hours you'll ever watch. There's nothing more that I can say, other than you MUST watch this film at some point.",

Instead it holds the movie together so well that the absence of the traditional 3 act structure is only really noticed in hindsight. Character choices are in keeping with their personalities and objectives and the acting is strong throughout. There are really nice historical touches, like the hobnail boots and swarms of flies around the dead in no man's land.

That's like if I did all my math homework for the year on one sheet of paper and got it all right. The movie wasn't that bad, but it is way too slow and takes its time to show off the sets. There were some intense scenes, but again, done too slowly. Also 2 jump scares that didn't need to be there. The music was very good and would probably get it for myself because it is by Thomas Newman who did Passengers; that's why it gets half a star more. If the movie wasn't slow going, then I would have enjoyed it more.",

They get able support from the rest of the cast, many of whom are notable British actors, bringing needed gravitas in their roles.  Behind the camera, Sam Mendes quite possibly makes his best film to date, telling the story in real time and almost looking like one shot, as the two soldiers track across the war front, encountering numerous dangerous and figures along the way.  Its a cinematic achievement in its own right but also helps the story by bringing on the level of the soldiers.  Everything is from their perspective, keeping the tension at a razor edge, along with showing off the brilliant set design and art direction.  Simply put, one of the best war movies in years and probably the best film of 2019.",

I could imagine how difficult it was to create this movie but it was done amazingly! The story line fit this type of cinematography very well and I was just amazed by the timeline. Great story. Great characters...great acting and the cinematography added to the suspense - it was like you were following the characters in real time. This was worth making mention of and it's the best movie to me, in two decades! No joke! If this doesn't win an academy award, then the oscars are a fluke because this is such. Great movie.

            "content": "This and Dunkirk were two of the most over-hyped and under-powered films I have seen in the past two years.  In order for a film to hold its audience it has to establish characters that we might care about. No such effort here.  The two protagonists set off on what resembles an extended selfie.  There is no feeling of the claustrophobia experienced in the trenches and the rows of troops huddled along the trench walls served no dramatic purpose apart from hinting at the huge number of soldiers at the front.  I felt that once the director had decided to break the world record for fewest edit points in a movie then he could think of nothing else. The last 20 minutes of the film comprised of a trip in uniform down what appeared to be a cross between Niagara Falls and an Olympic white water canoe course, followed by an extraordinary dash along the top of the trenches during which he appeared to break several land speed records in a remarkably dry uniform.  Benedict Cumberbatch appeared for a few seconds to receive the letter from HQ, and then it was the turn of Richard Madden, fresh from his role as Elton John's manager, appearing as Blake's brother. As we had never properly met the late Blake apart from his quick death scene in a French farmhouse it was not possible to empathize with his brother apart from the usual sympathy one would always extend to people who have suffered loss.  As a war film this was a travesty.  R.C. Sheriff's \"Journey's End\", and the classic film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" are fine examples of movies exploring stories set in WW1 action.  It would serve a far greater purpose if  now  all the box office receipts were given to organisations set up to care for soldiers who have gone through even worse battlefield experiences.",

I went into the theater expecting the \"one track shot\" to be distracting and annoying but I actually liked it. \n\nThe authenticity of this movie is outstanding. It looks and feels like WW1. You can tell the team behind the movie did their homework. The scenery, the uniforms, the trenches. It's all top notch. \n\nTons of really good moments of intensity and tension. This lasts throughout most of the movie. Actors did a respectable job. Some decent action sequences. \n\nNow for the bad. \n\nNot a big fan of the ending. Would've been a better ending for the messenger to go all that way to deliver the message and the commander sends the troops over the top to their deaths anyways. That would've been a very WW1 type of ending that literally personified the senselessness of the war.\n\nThere are hardly any battle sequences in the movie. When I go to see a WW1 movie, I'm expecting thousands of men running towards a trench while getting gunned down by enemy machine guns. There's very little of that here. Thus, I would classify it more as a drama, then a war film. \n\nWhat made Saving Private Ryan great was the gut wrenching battle scenes that show the true hell of war. To this day, I think of those battles scenes when I remember the movie. In 1917, there's none of that. If there had been at least 1 good battle scene for longer then a couple minutes, then I would label this more then just good. I would label it great. I just think the director missed a big opportunity to show some nasty WW1 combat.",

Thank you everyone, who helped me decided on which movie to see. 1917 the story of 2 British soldiers, during the WW1 are given an impossible mission . To deliver a message in enemy territory. This is a powerful movie. When the movie started it didn\u2019t waste no time in telling the story. Sam Mendes did a masterful job in this movie. The scenes were felt so close, like you were there with the 2 men. The cinematography was breathtaking. The depicts of war , was something to see. Beautifully done, The musical score was beautiful to listen to. The storyline was great.  The telling of these  2 young soldiers and their journey into enemy territory was tremendous. The cast of characters was perfect. The 2 young stars of this film, did a tremendous job. They held this movie together. My opinion George MacKay, who played Lance Corporal Schofield. Should haven\u2019t gotten a nomination for acting. Well done! This is a beautiful, tremendous and wonderful piece of filmmaking. This deserves the Oscar nominations and right now it deserves best picture and best director. My rating is 9/10. Go see this movie. Again thank you all for helping me pick a movie. I will do it again, that was fun. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb#1917movie #ww1 #sammendes",

The idea of giving a movie the illusion of a single take is such a new and interesting concept; it makes you feel more connected to the current scene and characters, and especially for historical war movies, it gives you a good sense of distance and physical/geographical perspective.",

            "content": "Very impressed with the wardrobe and the trench scenes but the story was total nonsense. \n\nI may have misunderstood or missed points of the plot however I have the following observations/queries:-\n\nWhy would lowly lance corporals be entrusted with such an important task?  Surly it would be an officer with at least a section or more likely a platoon for protection. \n\nHow did an infantry battalions find itself intact and able to mount a planned fresh attack so far in advance of the main battle area, amidst green rolling hills? - not feasible in 1917 - perhaps in late 1918. \n\nWhy would the Germans abandon their trenches just to lure to destruction, or ambush in the film makers vernacular, a solitary infantry battalion? \n\nWhy did the two lance corporals have to undertake a risky daylight crossing of No Man's Land and negotiate booby trapped subterranean enemy positions to get to a point which was easily accessible by road to an officer in a staff car and lorry born infantry? \n\nHow did the solitary lance corporal locate the enemy sniper, shoot and wound  him at the canal crossing scene?  The sniper, who was a very poor marksman, was concealed above him behind a solid wall in a darkened room wearing a helmet. To have hit him he would have had to have put a bullet through his head which is generally fatal or at least incapacitating.  A man so wounded would not draw his trusty Luger and sit waiting for his assailant to pop by to finish him off.\n\nWhy would he enter the sniper's building, albeit very cautiously, when he didn't know if there were shed loads of enemy present?  Surly, in view of his vital mission, he would vacate the area as rapidly as possible using cover in the direction of the 2nd Devons not risk a gun fight with myriad enemies? \n\nThis begs the question how did he navigate?  He was behind what had been the German frontline in unfamiliar territory. Earlier he had a map which was discarded because it was soaked in his comrades blood. Which begs the question what, in 1917, did lance corporals know of map reading?  I tend to think in most units such things were untrusted to officers. However once again I stand to be corrected. \n\nHaving located the second wave of 2nd Devons, a scene of melodic & bucolic unlikeliness, he then enters an apparently British communication trench leading to an apparently British front line in the middle of the enemies old rear area.  Who dug this trench system so quickly?   What is happening either side of this isolated battalion?  Presumable, as they are so far in advance of the 18th Division's front line, they are flanked by Germans.  They're  not even in a salient linked either side to the British front line.   If that was the case then the attack cancellation message could have been passed along from units on their flanks. \n\nThere's probably more I didn't notice but the above will do for now to register my discontent.\n\nI found the earlier part of the film with its attention to uniform, equipment and trench scenes very interesting, fascinating in fact. However it was spoilt by the ludicrously unfeasible story line and rolling un-war ravaged empty countryside of the later scenes.",

The only reason I saw this movie is because this movie won the golden globe for best drama so this movie is basically going to win the Oscar. And man this movie got me. I cared so much for the two main guys and I wanted them to make it so bad. And then the movie pulled the thing that I knew they were going to do but I didn\u2019t know when they would. But man when they did it I wasn\u2019t expecting it. The musical score in this movie makes the movie what it is. So the Oscar in my opinion has to go to this movie. But hold on why the flip is the two main guys not nominated for an Oscar. I know they\u2019re basically nobodies but still, their performances are some of the best I\u2019ve seen this year. Oscars make no sense. The cinematography is also beautiful and also deserves the Oscar. I was legit on the edge of my seat watching this movie and man this movie already has an iconic scene. That running scene that\u2019s in the trailers just a little bit but in the movie you\u2019re rooting for him. It\u2019s a full rocky moment right there. And also this movie feels like the most stressful video game in the world aka war so hopefully we don\u2019t get into any wars in the future. Final thought and little criticism, when Sam mendes at the golden globes said this movie is shot in one take fake news it is. I can clearly tell when they took a break and I know it\u2019s basically impossible to film an entire shot in one take but he tried and failed so stop promoting it then. But besides that this is a Great War movie that I never expected to be worth my time. I\u2019ll maybe watch this movie again if it\u2019s on ITunes for 4 bucks.",

Otra cosa que ayuda mucho a la fotograf\u00eda es el dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n, el cual es bastante bueno tambi\u00e9n.\n\nLa Banda sonora, me gust\u00f3 bastante, Thomas Newman que ha sido nominado much\u00edsimas veces al Oscar hace un gran trabajo, antes de la temporada de premios parec\u00eda que se iba a llevar la estatuilla, peor las cosas cambiaron. Es \u00e9pica, te conmueve, te emociona, aumenta la tensi\u00f3n en las escenas tensas, si gana la verdad es que no me molestar\u00eda para nada.\n\nLas actuaciones, son buenas, en especial George MacKay, hace un gran trabajo, y tambi\u00e9n los dem\u00e1s actores, pero no tienen tanto tiempo en pantalla como George. Dos de los grandes nombres, Benedict Cumberbatch y Richard Madden no salen mucho en la pelicula, lo cual es un poco decepcionante. \n\nEl guion est\u00e1 bien, no es el punto m\u00e1s fuerte de la pel\u00edcula, pero funciona, los di\u00e1logos est\u00e1n bien, hay muy poca exposici\u00f3n, y los personajes est\u00e1n bien escritos.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula no tiene muchas escenas de acci\u00f3n, si entran a verla esperando una pel\u00edcula con much\u00edsima acci\u00f3n y explosiones, probablemente terminen decepcionados. \n\nOtro punto negativo es que en lo personal en algunas partes sent\u00ed la pel\u00edcula lenta.\nT\u00e9cnicamente es la mejor pel\u00edcula del a\u00f1o.\n\nEn general es una gran pel\u00edcula, con un guion que funciona, una gran fotograf\u00eda y Banda sonora y buenas actuaciones y muy buena direcci\u00f3n por parte de Sam Mendes,",

The camera goes on and on in sweeping arcs for minutes at a time, and you find yourself holding your breath as the tension builds!\n\nThe cinematography is EXCELLENT, easily the best of 2019.  This is a MUST SEE in the theatres, in the best screen you can find.\n\nThe acting is also top notch.  If I could quibble on one minor detail, the scale of the war is not captured by this mission, as the loss of 1600 men would not even be considered as anything worth bothering over, with battles routinely losing 50,000 men a day.",

Tom's death is very sad and emotional and unexpected.  The visuals are pretty great and they have some amazing war aspects and the aspect of these guys may not come back from the war.  After Tom's death, I was very interested in the plot. There are many great scenes like when Will(The main character) meets a baby and tells her a story and gives her some milk and that is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. I like the scene where he was in this broken town and he was running for his life and even though I knew he was probably going to survive there were moments where I thought Will would die.  The movie gets really great in the third act. He has to give a message to Colonel Mackenzie to stop the attack and the way it was executed was handled very well. I like the scene where he is running away from the battle while everyone is about to fight the Germans.  I really like the Benedict Cumberbatch Cameo as Colonel Mackenzie and when the battle stops and Will meets Joseph is a great scene with great acting and emotion. The thing I like about this movie si that the story is what stands out to me and not the action.  \n\nCons: The first 30-40 minutes were boring because Tom and Will were just walking around. Sure there may have been good parts like the plan and the explosion and Tom saving Will but it isn't really much else and it was too long for them to be sneaking around. I also think that the time gaps could have been handled better because it felt a bit like a dream sequence.  I can also sometimes realize some choppy CGI because I could usually tell that they used it on a tree or a rock. \n\nI still think that this is a beautifully made film and I'm gonna give it an (A-)",

Although the film is 120 minutes long (so you know he's going to make it in the end) suspense and tension are kept alive as you wonder when is the little, mouthy fat one going to get it? Once his friend expires and the character is simply left to complete his mission then it may as well be a video game since there is no one left for us to care for. \nThis movie feels more like an exercise in camera technique than a narrative film. There are some wonderful shots though such as watching characters go from close up to wide as they cross a waterlogged bombed out crater whilst the camera tracks them from the other side only to join them again on the other side. Or entering a bombed out town at night lit by fire and flares or running through dust filled lam lit corridors.\nBut the film is like watching an Xbox game unfold as the  character goes from level to level before they get to their missions final objective.\nNina Golds casting is excellent as she tries to fill the screen with enough actors and extras to cover the cameras movement. Costume and set are excellent. The only thing missing is narrative. The characters are so thinly drawn it is a lot like playing battle of Honour or call of duty on a console with the voice overs thrown in.\nThere are better films out there whose narrative is a lot more engaging than this film which had me looking at the exit a few times. I recommend instead Gallipoli, Attack, Remember the Spartans and A Bridge Too Far.\nI realized why I didn't connect to this as much as Gallipoli. I think it's because with Gallipoli and bridge too far you spend 60 minutes getting to know the characters in different situations so that when the final battle or run occurs you really feel for them before they make their final stand. In 1917 the character  is already running  so you don't really get that in depth picture of them over all. you are learning about them as they run and for some reason it doesn't work here as well as \"Naked Prey.\" In \"1917\" it is  the cinematography that takes centre stage and you're watching that first and then the character and for me that seems to distance me from the character and empathy with what is going on.",

I understand the reasoning behind the \"one camera\" filming technique, but at times it just simply served to significantly slow down the pace of the movie.  It was also distracting that I only able to understand about half the dialogue because of a combination of low sound quality and the the thick British accent spoken by most of the cast. Normally, I find war dramas very absorbing (Saving Private Ryan being one of my all time favorite films). But 1917 had me looking at my watch more than once during the last 30 minutes.",

While I was deeply moved by the quality of the film and the powerful soundtrack to go along with it, 1917 isn't as perfect as the trailer or the accolades would have you believe. There are several moments that feel underwhelming which take away from the raw power the film provides, there is far less action as well so this feels like more of a historical visual piece rather than the all-out action war films we are used to seeing.",

Wisely presenting the film as one seemingly continuous shot, it wretches up tension and put the audience right next to the central characters for 2 full hours to unforgettable and tremendous effect. This technical challenge aptly showcases the collaborative efforts of Mendes' directing and Roger Deakins' cinematography as their meticulously composed visuals discover beauty and poetry in devastation and desolation. Equally impressive is the way Mendes, in his first writing credit, finds depth and humanity in an often wordless script that follows their journey without falling into contrivances or repetition. If there are minor quibbles, there is one less than totally smooth transition from one tragic incident into the next episode of the narrative that will require a bit more suspension of disbelief. There are also times when the film moves a little close to sentimentality and emotional manipulation but it would seem churlish to criticize either the script or Thomas Newman's sweeping score when it was done so beautifully and brilliantly. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay's performances are convincing and, at times, heartbreaking, and they prove they are worthy up-and-comers, whilst a litany of glorified cameos by Mendes's famous chums / more familiar British actors help guide the lesser known leads along with their starry presence. Perfectly orchestrated with military precision, Mendes's films stands proudly on its own as a taut and visceral thriller as well as an historical drama that honours the past and reminds us of the cruelty and pointlessness of war.",

Of course, it's actually a number of long takes cleverly stitched together. This gimmick works very well.  The story is very basic. Two soldiers are tasked to cross a WW1 battlefield to warn military division of a trap.  That's it! The camera always follows them.  The single take approach puts you right there with them, as if you were a third soldier.  What makes it effective, is that the camera is always at their level.  It's quite the achievement considering how tumultuous the battlefield is.  And like war, the action flips between, action, nothing going on, or distant action.  The attention to detail is quite remarkable.  The cinematography is excellent. Definitely in my top 10 this year.",

Chapman and Mackay are great in their roles, Mackay deserving of a few awards although he wears that harrowed/haunted visage that he's famous for throughout (understandable here). The story is cobbled together, this year's crop of movies have a few \"box-ticking\" scripts (\"Sorry we missed you\" being a fine example, where a load of different people's stories are put together as a list and \"hey, let's make a story out of that\". Doesn't work for me. There's enough major/single/human story WW1 material that hasn't been addressed yet, you don't need to create a confection like this. Along with a number of less than convincing special effects and a half-baked \"phoned-in\" score from Thomas Newman that has to be one of his weakest yet and some distracting walk on parts from Mendes's famous mates that sadly come across as tired and timeworn stereotypes at us. The \"whole movie is a single shot\" conceit, is for industry insiders to giggle at. I noticed it for the first 10 minutes, thought it to be awards bait and stopped seeing it after that. It's OK this film, but after Peter Jackson's \"They shall not grow old\" it was perhaps a mistake to not wait a bit before putting this out. Maybe using that extra time to craft the story a bit more skillfully and to find bit part actors who are a bit less well known, there are plenty of good ones who need the work!",

This film showered the dangers barbed wire had to soldiers and the extremes of barbed wire. This film showed how Germans would kill Cows or destroy armaments and set booby traps. I never seen terrain alter so much in a film. I have never seen a World War I Film like this film. This was so unique in that you never saw but one clear cut. Dog food left in bags so rats would eat it and leave as a trap I just saw 1917. I have never seen a War film or a Great War aka World War I Film like 1917. It is so unique in how the terrain would alter so much within short distances. The trenches even in films like Sergeant York (1941), Young Indiana Jones chronicles (season 2), Fly Boys (2006), War Horse (2011), They Shall not Grow Old (2018), Wonder Woman (2017), just to name a few War films do not give the scariness and give you the feeling of distance, size and time to go between the lines like 1917 does. Sergeant York (1941) is probably the closest I have seen to this comparison of the trenches in 1917 and Young Indiana Jones season 2. This film provides a unique aspect of the Great War showing the amount of men, how the battlefield terrain could change so quickly. The soldiers life from one part to the next or from one moment to the next and how a soldiers state of mind and thinking could alter from one moment to the next. The dangers, music score, Sound effects, silence were used very well to guide the tensions and feelings of the film from one moment to the next. This film showed the different War technics and thinking each side had during this war and how many would not listen even when they received order to attack or surrender or even how superiors thought.",

Arguably the most impressive feat in the film is, yes, indeed, the entire film IS shot and edited to appear as one long, continuous, seamless take (well, except for one obvious cut mid-way through serving to represent the passage of several hours), and it is a fascinatingly convincing piece of work. I played a sort of game with myself during the movie to pick out all the parts where cuts could have been made before editor magic basically erased all traces of them (quite a fun game actually, and challenging.....I'm a nerd \u2014 I like this sort of stuff). Open to debate as being even more spectacular than the technical aspects is the actual content of the film \u2014 just...lavishly layered, riddled with sounds, images, emotions, situations, conversations, intensity, calmness, accenting the big things, little things, drawing literal and metaphorical lines between death, life, hope, perseverance...Many of these things are presented simultaneously throughout the film, cascading breathlessly into a tidal wave experience that is altogether just absolutely...consuming (it's hard to put accurately into words; just watch it). This is one of those movies that you can start watching at any point, and you're hooked instantly, unable to turn away until the end. Unforgettable. From what I've seen, there's no war film quite like it.....no film quite like it, period.",

Director Sam Mendes is trying to achieve something with his direction, long camera shot continuation, and a wonderful music score by Thomas Newman. The film does well in capturing the realism and raw tone of war. The silence in walking through a mineshaft. The enemy firing at you and hearing the bullet ricocheting. Or an enemy charging at you. The audience is put right next to these soldiers as they cross enemy territory. The plot follows Will and Tom as they are assigned by their captain to cross no mans land and to warn the other battalion that they are about to fall into a trap from their enemy. It is a race against time that they will have to walk a far distance in less than a day. While watching out and avoiding their enemy. Director Sam Mendes does well in capturing a still camera shot. Mendes does not over do it like other action film directors with adding a lot of unnecessary action or explosions. He does capture the realism and raw tone of the movie. I like that he is trying to break the ground barrier with a one long continuation shot with the camera. Sure, there may be a scene cut somewhere. The editors did a great job in keeping the camera shots and direction very coherent without breaking away from a scene. It is kind of distracting. It works great with the movie. The opening scene following Will and Tom from their captain being told their assignment. To walking through the trenches around the soldiers. The cinematography by Roger Deakins did a great job in following these characters. And capturing the production set with torn down villages. Or a gritty aftermath of the battlefield with corpses on barb wires. It is just impressive. Lee Smith editing was well done in keeping the one long shot focused. The music score by Thomas Newman was beautifully done and haunting in a way. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman were also good with their characters. We learn a little about them as they talk about their history as they walk through no mans land. Plus there are other actors in here with a small appearance like Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Claire Duburcq, Richard Madden, and Benedict Cumberbatch. My one issue with the film which I dislike about it is the pacing. It is nice to see a one shot sequence with the cinematography following the characters without cutting scene to another. Basically, you're with the characters every foot step they make. Which is cool and all but it does get a little slow when they walking a long way in a field or come to a complete pause. Overall, 1917 is a good war film done by Sam Mendes and his sharp beautiful direction. With a good music composer, editor, cinematography, and cast. It is one film that is worth seeing on the big screen.",

Not only was I invested in the character\u2019s journey, I felt as if I was there beside them: living, breathing, and walking every step of the way with them. This isn\u2019t your typical war film in the sense that the film plays out more or less in real time. Sam Mendes tells a relatively simple but moving story here in the best way possible, with flawless execution. The event was ultimately inconsequential in terms of history, but in terms of story and humanity, 1917 makes you feel for these men in a way that makes you want them to succeed in their mission. It\u2019s not a matter of numbers or victory, it\u2019s a matter of saving somebody. Putting a face to the number, and in this case, that face is his brother, who is developed as a character before we even see him on screen. Roger Deakins brings the trenches to life with his outstanding cinematography as usual. However, the best part about the cinematography in this movie is that it doesn\u2019t detract from the story, it improves upon it. The \u2018all one take\u2019 gimmick is not a gimmick here\u2014it\u2019s a creative choice that serves the story by never giving the audience a break, just like the soldiers. The intensive 4 months of rehearsal days really shows in the final product. The hard work put in by both the actors and camera crew is unparalleled. In short, 1917 succeeds in telling a tale of humanity in an otherwise gruesome world\u2014and bringing the audience into that world in a seamless and hard-hitting way.",

However, for the more quieter moments, it can become distracting. The cinematography from Roger Deakins is amazing as usual. The film is stunning to look at. The weakest part of the film for me is the script. The film doesn\u2019t do enough to get you invested in the characters. You care about the situation, but not the people in it. Overall, this is still a good movie. I definitely liked it, just a lot less than most people. ",

The camera continuously tracks the leads, refusing to relent, in a way that makes it appear as though the film is done in one shot. This has a impressive effect on the viewer: we feel like we're involved in the action, but paradoxically looking in on it at the same time. It's an immersive experience. Perhaps, however, this technical wizardry may leave some people finding the film too clinical.\n\nThe production design is superb, from the labyrinthine trenches to the hellish, desolate no man's land. It's not just visually impressive but acoustically, too, with top-class sound mixing and a brilliant versatile score. The two aspects combine to provide a incredibly visceral experience. \n\nAlthough it features surprisingly few actual battle sequences, the film maintains a quick pace and is frequently both tense and intense. But the quieter moments of the film are equally hard-hitting, such as a later scene which sees the soldiers resting before their planned attack, whilst one of them sings The Wayfaring Stranger. It's hauntingly beautiful.\n\n'1917' is a masterpiece - epic, immersive, and poignant - and deserves to stand in the pantheon of greatest war films ever made.",

            "content": "\"The Messenger's Travels\"\n\n\tSam Mendes crafts a spectacularly unique war film unlike any other that refuses to relish in its combat and violence, but instead, tells its audience an emotionally captivating story through its depiction of the gritty and raw nature of unforgiving war. Legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins works to capture every visceral frame of the film and works with Thomas Newman as he constructs a potent orchestral soundtrack that perfectly underscores every moment throughout the two hour runtime. Not a single performer on screen pulls any of their punches as everyone delivers Mendes' tight script with a pure focus that sells every scene. \"1917\" is an astonishing achievement in filmmaking on all fronts that will undoubtedly be recognized and studied for years to come.\n\tThe story of \"1917\" is one of fiction that is derived from the real world stories of the world's Great War. We start by getting introduced to our central protagonists, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) as they are handpicked by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) for a mission of the utmost importance. The mission requires that both soldiers make their way to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment and relay a message to call off the assault on the supposed \"retreating\" German forces within the next twenty-four hours; if they fail, the battalion will be slaughtered and thousands of men will be lost. With the stage set and stakes known, both men embark on an arduous trek across the invaded lands of northern France making their way through an assortment of environments across the span of a single day.\n\t\"1917\" is a film that features a good plot, but not a great one; if anything it comes across as thin.. However, Mendes and Krysty WIlson-Cairns' script does include several moments that seamlessly flow from one to the next and keep the momentum of the story moving forward, while most importantly, leaving long and somber sequences for the film and the audience to breathe giving room for reflection. One of the script's greatest strengths is its pointed dialogue that says so much with so little. The performers do an excellent job to enhance the script by delivering their lines in a way that evokes a natural sense of emotion that resonates deeply with the audience. From the very start, both Chapman and MacKay come across as genuinely being close friends. We instantly buy into their relationship because every exchange the two gentleman have serves to further build their on-screen chemistry. In one of the film's earliest set pieces, Chapman and MacKay brilliantly convey their companionship as one that could be classified as a younger brother/older brother dynamic where Chapman's inexperience in the field is starkly contrasted to that of MacKay's calm demeanor; every step of the way the two are challenged and we witness their different reactions to a multitude of circumstances that further display their individual intricacies. With that being said, MacKay pulls out a true stand out performance as Schofield within this film. MacKay delivers an absolutely transformative performance that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; it is a true presentation of skill that should not be overlooked.\n\tYou can not discuss \"1917\" without speaking on the pre-production and execution of this film. Mendes took up the insurmountable challenge to shoot the entire film with the illusion of one continuous single shot (Despite the fact that a keen eye can spot where some of the cuts occur). The significance of the mission is known to both the cast and audience, so crafting this film with a single shot in mind is brilliant because as the passage of time moves forward, we stay on the edge of our seats knowing that with the exclusion of obvious cuts, the film is forced to keep pushing onward. All hands were on deck as the production team sculpted miniature sets to test their lighting rigs and get a direct layout of what needed to be accomplished. A dedicated team of designers were painstakingly tasked with bringing every \"1917\" set to life; and it pays off. With the knowledge of what track the camera was to follow and dozens of rehearsals, \"1917\" pulled off what most would not dare to try. When the actors are moving throughout these diverse environmental sets, every segment of the frame is packed to establish a dirty, yet natural world that is as beautiful as it is immersive. Whether it is an object in the background or a character in the foreground, David Crossman, Jacqueline Durran, Dennis Gassner, Lee Sandales, and Robert Voysey come together to create a world that is accurate to the times and precisely encapsulates the depressing realities of the First World War. The technical aspects that help shape \"1917\" into the marvelous film it is, serve as a reminder of the lengths a focused group of immensely talented people will go to create the best piece of work they possibly can and it should not go unnoticed.\n\t\"1917\" is an enchantingly tense piece of art that straps you in and never lets go until the final cut to black. Mendes along with the entire cast and crew craft a truly immersive experience that paints the art of war as not one of bombastic explosions and blood, but one of fear, disarray and raw emotional weight that burdens every soldier on the battlefield. \"1917\" may not have the most engaging story to tell, but it does not need it; the way in which the film was made and shot is a triumph on its own that many can look to and see that an inspired group united to create a powerful work of art that will be talked about for going above and beyond its genre. \"1917\" is without a doubt, one of Sam Mendes' finest pieces of work.\n\nFinal Verdict: B-",

There is one stand out scene that takes place at night time in a bombed out village still occupied by German soldiers.  The way this scene is filmed, the use of lighting and the music will stay with me for a long time, one of the most tense scenes ever committed to film.  Great story, superb film with a stand out performance from George Mackay. Would definitely watch again.",

I have seen 2000 pound bomb craters up close in Vietnam and the bomb craters in this film were unrealistically huge for this era.  An amateurish poorly told story with a very anti-war/military bent.  None of the solders who encountered these exhausted hungry messengers offered them anything or expressed concern.  Solders do not act like that, they would have immediately asked about what unit they were from, what their mission was and offered assistance.  Just a Hollywood propaganda film about a subject they know nothing about.  Not worth the price of admission",

The plot was full of holes and some of the running from gunfire scenes were more ridiculous than the Tom Arnold one hiding behind  a signpost in True Lies. The two main protagonists have a very millennial attitude to world war 1 which means they end up doing a huge range of stupid and illogical things (pulling the German pilot out of his plane I mean wtf) given the situation and task they face. So much of this seems to be about Sam Mendes wanting to do the cinematic thing rather than use any logic. The scene where Will is being shot at by Germans jumps in the river then can see the bridge he jumped off when he climbs out and then walks 100m into the forest to silent join in with 200 soldiers with their backs turned to him, yeah that is likely in war hear gunfire then let some dude just walk up behind you and sit down with you!!

Films like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Platoon, Dunkirk, Pearl Harbor, etc. These films focused on heroics, grand scale battles, well known actors, and some even had great stories. Then comes 1917, which is a simple plot, yet a full immersive experience the likes I haven't felt in a while. \n\n1917 feels like you're part of the mission. You feel every sound, movement, and decisions made in the film. How is this achieved? The movie was shot to appear like it's one long take, with \"no cuts.\" The camera follows our two protagonists from many angles, but there's \"never\" a cut in the action. You'll sometimes wonder just how the hell certain angles were achieved.  The camera follows the events happening from beginning to end, it is truly an amazing cinematic achievement.\n\nThe camera goes from 3rd person view to full 360 shots, to even shots where our characters haven't even seen what's up ahead. All with no edits, all one fluid motion. Obviously, there's some camera magic involved, but I don't care to know about it. All I know that audiences will literally feel like they are part of this mission. For this reason,  I recommend to splurge on premium formats like Dolby Cinema, RPX, IMAX, D-box, or 4DX. This movie should be experienced to it's full potential.\n\nThe main cast does a fantastic job with George MacKay and Dean Charles-Chapman leading the way with using every possible emotion available. You really do feel for these characters. All the tension, fear, anger, regret, happiness is felt along with them. \n\nI do have one warning: if you need there to be a lot of battle action going on in your war films, this is not the movie for you. This movie focuses on survival, stealth, and getting the mission completed at all costs. Do not expect huge battle scenes, but the tense action scenes are there to advance the story when need be.\n\nThis is truly an amazing work of art from director Sam Mendes (he won an Oscar for American Beauty 20 yrs ago) and award winning cinematographer Roger Deakins. I would put this film right next to Saving Private Ryan. It already won at the  Golden Globes, wouldn't be surprised if it wins an Oscar as well. Again go see this in a premium format to truly enjoy it.\n\nFINAL REVIEW: 9.5 out of 10.",

Also I really liked the big action set pieces, the production design, and the acting. all great things on those fronts. But this movie shows itself as weaker in its story and plot. While I think the script to the movie is good, there's nothing special to the main story of this movie. I'll be it, it does set up some cool ideas for scenes in the future, but I really feel like these scenes are mostly made special from the camera, and not really their ideas. I just feel like this movie was made more for the production than the actual plot, and I really think more thought should've been put into this aspect, and this movie would have a lot less stereotypes and be a much better movie overall.

            "content": "Award-winning director Sam Mendes based 1917's premise on his grandfather's story-- a family lore that centred on a messenger delivering an important message in the Great War, a war that was supposed to last a few weeks.  Paired with the inimitable cinematographer Roger Deakins, the pair cast the audience deep in immersion in a fluid single-take camerawork and created a very visually enthralling film-making masterpiece. \n\nBilled as such, the camera never ceased except for one noticeable cut in the third act and almost showed its seams but Roger Deakins' hand is firm and sure. This is nothing new in film-making; Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Birdman is one of those films. Some feature extended long takes like the famous long take in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Children of Men or more recently The Revenant by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu again. \n\nThe difference here is Deakins. 1917 quite literally is Best Cinematography at the bare minimum. The white-haired one brought home the Cinematography prize for his brilliant work in Blade Runner 2049. Sam Mendes looks set to win Oscar's Best Director as he had in the recent Golden Globe. \n\nThe film's colour palette is reminiscent of colourized black-and-white World War 1 photographs and Deakins having his utter disdain for green-screens and CGI, showcased his technical ability and brilliance in every frame. Cynics may say it feels arcade-y given the exhaustive length of camerawork but the third-person effect thrust the viewer alongside the characters. I must admit I feel for George MacKay's character, Schofield, (almost criminal how he received no recognition for his stunning portrayal) how must exhausted he must be.\n\nThe film begins with lush greenery as soldiers rest in perhaps a homage to All Quiet on the Western Front opening chapter in Erich Maria Remarque's timeless war classic. Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) with Schofield are tasked to be messengers, given that the radio lines are cut, to deliver a message out to stop an attack scheduled the following morning. A German retreat is in fact an organised trap for their pursuers and both messengers must reach the pursuing battalion and halt the attack. \n\nI must caution those who enjoy combat and over-the-top explosive sequences, 1917 is not an action-flick. It is something else. It is a depiction of what soldiers experience in war and heroes are never in flowing capes. Mendes never cease to show us what our earth was like through the soldier's eye-- beautiful lush landscape in a brief respite as soldiers rest, trepidation as they head through the trenches, fear in a burning, decimated town and adrenalin in the battlefield-- all of which in unending flowing sequence. Chapman and Mackay's delivery in their roles are worthy of mention, the latter delivered in spades. Even those in small roles played their part very well. \n\nThe overall result is a film that encapsulates a harrowing experience, thrusting the viewer in the visceral hellscapes of war, imprinting a profound memory in those who are willing to partake in the sensories of historical man-made catastrophes. 1917 is an astonishing film which I had the opportunity to enjoy at the IMAX theatre. Go and see it.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the storytelling in the movie with the one shot technique. It captured the hardship and emotion that the soldiers had to face just to deliver a message, especially knowing that it would save 1,000+ people. The start of the film felt like I was playing a Call of Duty Campaign, but it was a great way to introduce the tone of the film as the two men walk through the trenches and you see what all the extra soldiers are doing to keep themselves distracted. I thought that the score was really well put together with the pacing of the film and mixed really well to the storytelling of the film.\n\nI disliked how the trailer showed the climax of the film, showing Schofields running out in the open as the first wave runs out and attacked. I also felt like some of the sound effects that were added to film was really poor. One example in particular was the sniper shots when Schofields was crossing the broken down bridge, it didn't sound menacing or endangering, it could have made the scene more suspenseful.\n\nIn the end, I recommend for everyone to watch this film, keeping in mind of the one shot technique. On piece of dialogue I really  took notice of was when Schofields was talking about trading his medal for a bottle of wine. It was a great insight to a soldiers mentality of a medal not really showing the hardships, trauma and sacfricies they faced to survive the WAR.",

            "content": "1917\n2020\nDirector: Sam Mendes\nStarring Dean Charles chapman, George makay, Colin Firth, Richard Madden.Bendadict Cumberbatch etc\n\n\n1917 is based within the first world war. Where a battalion of 1,600 soldiers are sent to retreat the Germans but what they don't realise is that it's a trap and a massacre. So, it's down to Corporal Blake (Dean Charles chapman) and corporal Schofield (George makay) to stop this from happening but they will be met with multiple challenges along the way. Wow what a truly incredible movie that hit the mark on every level, visuals, acting and a compelling story lets talk more about this. \n\nFirst, the cinematography was stunning. This film really was firstly phenomenal to look at, and secondly really transported you into the world of the film, and it really made you feel a part of the time, with its scarily realistic set designs and scenery truly making you feel like you were in the battlefield with them. Leading to a truly phenomenal film just to look at and I was often sitting in awe of the film. The visual creativity as well was of the chart, making me truly respect the artistry of Sam Mendes with what he can create.\n\nNext the film really made you connect with the two main characters and their performances were fantastic. Due to the film largely being focused on just two characters it gave you more time to truly connect and spend more time with them as there friendship developed throughout the film, so they actually made a good decision by having more secondary characters with only a couple of scenes and two key characters to connect and focus on. And the performance from both Dean Charles Chapman and George Makay were truly fantastic. Considering that I had never heard of either of these two actors before they surprised me at there acting abilities. They showed emotional complexity of what it would be like being a soldier in the war, in truly versatile performances, hitting all the right notes with both serious, impactful and emotional scenes.\n\nNext the film did not hold back with showing the harsh reality of war with its gore and action sequences. In order for the film to leave the impact that it did, gory scenes showing the true horrors of war was needed, and it was most certainly shocking to watch. The film did a great job at getting under your skin with surprisingly very realistic looking bodies. A key scene that stands out to me would be when corporal Schofield, is swimming in a lake trying to get on the shore, but there is a large amount of bodies that he had to swim through in order to save himself, this scene truly left one of the biggest impact for me, and I am glad the director did not hold back with showing what war was really like, and especially glad that he didn't play it safe.\nMy only slight nit-pick that stopped the film from being truly perfect for me was that I felt that they could have been slightly more creative with the films character arcs and development. The film didn't show a lot of back story to the main characters, which I got as it was more about the developing friendship, however it would have been nice to have learned slightly more about them, but this is only a slight nit-pick. As well as the death of corporal  Blake I felt could have been saved for the final act, yes this gave corporal Scofield the motivation to find his brother, but perhaps another scenario for the film could have been where Blake reunites with his brother and then gets killed whilst the Germans were attacking, but once again I didn't have an issue with what they did but this could have been how this particular death could have been placed slightly differently.\n\nNext, I thought the film managed to achieve an extremely tense tone and well executed jump scares. The film in a lot of places didn't have any soundtrack, which worked perfectly as I felt on the edge of  my seat throughout the whole film, and I also think fear of the unknown for the audience and for the characters on the screen also made the film very tense as well. And due to this lack of sound in places there was a surprising amount of well executed jumpscares. These were largely just explosions or gun shots, but they happened completely out of the blue which I was not expecting but it was a welcome surprise for me.\n\nMy next two positives would be the films surprising amount of emotional weight and its incredible final act. Wow this film was surprisingly emotional, just seeing the large body count throughout, truly made me realise whilst watching how pointless war is, and I think that's a good message to spread. And to have corporal Blake get killed was extremely heart-breaking, due to him not being able to see his brother and the connection he had formed with Scofield you could really tell how sad he was feeling which is another credit to there acting abilities.  And the long drawn out scene of his death really allowed the audience time for what just happened to sink in, therefore making it even more emotional to watch. The final act was truly one of the best things I have ever seen. Sam Mendes did an excellent job at misleading you into what was going to happen, he could of easily went the predictable root and just let the message be delivered, but no the soldiers were already on the battlefield when Scofield was attempting to deliver the message. They went all out with fantastic cinematography, surprising cameos and an impactful ending with Blakes brother which really worked as a show of respect for the character and to make you leave the film satisfied.\n\nHowever, my final biggest positive would be how the film managed to look like one continuous take. Wow what a clever creative decision here. Yes, there was clearly a few cuts, but they were very well disguised and didn't affect the flow of the movie. Having one continuous take really gets you immersed in the film, and makes you feel like you are there with the characters truly leading to excellent experience whilst watching, as you connected with the characters more and it makes you feel like part of the movie.\n\nOverall 1917 is a true cinematic masterpiece and deserving of all its awards buzz. With a fantastically acted and fantastically crafted immersive film that might be my favourite of the year.",

Although the continuous camera is a bit distracting at first, it absolutely elevates what would have ordinarily been a pretty standard war flick into something truly remarkable.

Every bullet and every turn of the camera fills you with suspense because you don't know who or what may be just out of the camera's view.

            "content": "1917-\n\u200bWhat is WAR? More importantly why was \"The War To End All Wars\", circa WWI, not true to this prophetic hope for an end to the savagery of war? 1917 will not answer any of these questions but it will provide an insight into the horrors and anguish of war - the irony and the agony - of war through the eyes and actions of a single man. War will be presented through a series of vignettes helping to define one man's determination, hope and fear that will be shared with his audience through examples that will touch your emotions and add visual clarity to the never seen sides of war. A young British soldier is asked to grab a comrade for a mission of unknown duration or intent. His commanding officer charges him with a mission to cross enemy lines to deliver a message to the commander of thousands of British troops who are about to charge into a battle that is now known to be a trap that will kill them all. Why was this young corporal chosen for this almost suicidal mission? Because his older brother is one of the young officers who will be leading the charge to almost sure destruction and death. What follows are the actions and experiences that drive this young soldier on a mission of love and duty. First to family and almost certainly to save the lives of the thousands of comrades in arms who will be slaughtered if he fails to deliver his orders to NOT advance. This is a powerful and emotional insight into war and into the unexpected challenges that fate offers as a road map to the completion of this or any mission. If you ever wondered what it took to be a HERO - you may be surprised how much simple survival acts as the principal motivating force in allowing one to perform without thought or concern for anything but simply staying alive. \nRating: W - O - S = War's Other Side",

These include \nHistorical accuracy \nProper representation about Allied commanders - not donkeys\nGood portrayal of the enemy, a mighty foe\nAccurate depiction of the superior trench work of the Germans.\nAlthough the plot was weak, the film did a service to WW1 history as delivered by cinema.\nI'll shut up now.",

If that weren't enough the film is shot by cinematography god Roger Deakins and therefore looks consistently amazing despite the limitations of having to maintain such long takes. I'll be very surprised if this film isn't at least nominated for Best Cinematography at the Oscars if not Best Picture.\n\nThe story is very simple but fits the long take approach perfectly, two British soldiers are tasked with delivering orders to stop a massacre of their forces. Much like Dunkirk, this is a race against time, and we see every heart-racing minute of the journey as the two soldiers LCpl's Schofield & Blake are brought to life thanks to great performances by George MacKay & Dean-Charles Chapman respectively.\n\nThe film's not perfect, there are a few minor issues I had with some plot contrivances and a Lee-Enfield that fires far more rounds than it should hold. The nature of the film also prevents significant character development, though I think we get enough to identify with the characters' regardless.\n\nOverall, I found 1917 to be a beautiful depiction of the ugliness of war and a heart-wrenching examination of the incredible lengths men will go to for one another when the chips are down. See it in IMAX if you can.\n\n10/10 Brotherhood over Glory",

I'd call the surviving messenger Odysseus, but Odysseus never had it so bad. How many lives does a Hollywood character get in a war film?  Schofield didn't go five minutes into his Odyssey without cutting his bare hand on barbed wire. Most Generals would lend a pair of wire cutters when they send soldiers through No Man's Land.  Then he got buried under rocks in a trip wire explosion, but didn't bleed much. Later, I learned why the Germans lost the war-- they couldn't shoot a guy at close range after dozens of prime opportunities.  The plot called for milk, so he found a pail near a cow that the Germans donated to the Allies for the purpose of who knows. Schofield was hands down the noisiest swimmer in the war. Interesting, because British Boy Scouts were taught how to swim silently before then. He did or didn't crash into a huge rock, depending on what camera angle you choose. He did  or didn't get shot by a German, finally, but recovered quite bloodlessly and ran off. After falling down Yosemite Falls or something similar, he was out of breath, but recovered nicely, in time to listen to too many verses of Wayfaring Stranger before remembering to find the Colonel. Then he honed in on the Colonel's whereabouts like a homing pigeon. Too bad they didn't send a homing pigeon in the first place.",

I don't know what kinda movies you've been watching that warp your perception of what takes place in battles, but clearly you think they last 10 minutes and that it consists of only hard action and is filled with cliche'd garbage that has been shown to us in recent war films.\n\n\"How did they dodge the bullets while being chased?\" - Have you ever fired a bolt action rifle while running? Case closed.\n\n\"Why didn't they just send a biplane to drop pamphlets over the battlefield?\" - First off, is this even feasible? Printing pamphlets is a huge waste of time and flying an unreliable biplane over an active battlefield is not reliable. Also phone lines have been damaged, if you weren't paying attention. Also no, they aren't using radios. Like mentioned in the beginning of the film, two men are significantly faster than the organization and mobilization of an entire battalion, and this is not even mentioning the fact that that would be a waste of resources considering that the trench featured in the start of the film is a reserve trench, meaning that these soldiers are waiting for battle.\n\n\"Characters weren't developed.\" - Although I agree they weren't as fleshed out as they could be, don't act like there wasn't any character development or backstory at all, because there is some.\n\n\"They just randomly found milk.\" - Okay fair point. Not enough to justify a significantly lower rating. \n\n\"If they're in enemy territory that means they are surrounded or have the enemy surrounded.\" - Not how a trench system works. Also the main characters are making a journey from a reserve trench, past a German trench from which the enemies have fallen back, to a frontline trench, which likely would have been a repurposed German trench. WW1 battles consisted of constant pushing back and forth of the frontlines. Regardless, it is still possible to flank a trench, as trenches don't generally stretch across an entire country.\n\n\"Unrealistic plot.\" - So do you want an actual completely authentic plot? Because that would make for a horrible movie in the context of WW1.\n\n\"Schofield got shot.\" - Once again, pay attention. He is shot in the helmet and it ricochets (You can literally hear it). He then falls backwards injuring his head.\n\nUpdating this as more complaints come in.",

Muddy, rat-infested trenches are monotonous and as frustrating as the stalemate war itself. However, 1917 is the greatest depiction of that horrific conflict that Ive ever seen. Ive found war movies from the 40s-80s interesting, but the heroics and bravado make the characters 2-dimensional and laughable, imo. Saving Private Ryan forever raised the bar, and that is hardly my opinion, alone. One may invest in a story through cleverness and sensationalism, but will they care enough to be viscerally jolted by the main character's experience? George McKays (Lance Corporal Schofield) eyes, expressions and responses alone sold and held me.\nSince storytelling must evolve in any genre \u2014 Western, spy, war \u2014 to further that genre, what can be said that hasnt already been said? Answer: quirky but accurate details about the times, settings, values and vernacular details that arent essential to the story, yet immerse the viewer into the period. I look for that, and GREATLY respect it 1917 scores big in that way! Although Ive not researched this, revisionism was undetectable, and minimal political correctness pandering, which is rare anymore.\nThe highly intense, immersive nature of 1917 locked me in from beginning to end, and my only complaint is that it wasnt long enough (always a good sign). I place 1917 on the level of Saving Private Ryan, Fury, Hacksaw Ridge and Dunkirk.",

It gets you real close to the two leads\u2019 story and doesn\u2019t let you leave. One of the better things about this decision is that we get a better idea of the geography of trenches; a whole complicated structure of command trenches in the rear connected through in and out trenches to the support and frontline trenches. And boy do they feel different. Then you have the tangled mess of No Man\u2019s Land and you get taken to an actual German trench! Complete with large bunkrooms and artillery ranges. After this point the geography gets rather more shaky. To be in verdant green pastures you ought to be several miles beyond the front lines as constant artillery barrages would have left precious little else intact. And I can\u2019t see how the soil in the second line of trenches makes any sense at all given the look of the first one.",

The much spoken of \"gimmick\" aside, the film is brilliantly written. Never heavy-handed, the script is wonderfully efficient in its dialogue. It is a masterclass in show, don't tell. Back to the gimmick, it does not work if not for the performances from the two young actors. MacKay, especially, excels as a worthy Virgil in our trek through the hell of war. This is not a traditional war film. Like it's predecessor Jarhead, Mendes deconstructs war from the perspective of soldiers not to glorify or denounce war. Instead, it is a apathetic study of soldiers (humanity) in war. It is a must watch!!!",

How good can a movie be if you would never ever waist another 2 hours of your life watching it? I know many others give it very good marks but lets examine just a couple of the oddities of the movie. Very convenient to have a cow in the middle of the pasture and the milk bucket in the barn with fresh milk. Meanwhile the Germans have killed every other cow in the country, and by the way who milked the cow? Outside the barn one of the American soldiers was stabbed by the German and died. Why did the other American soldier need to move him 10 ft? And where the hell did all the soldiers come from that were pissing on the side of the house? Did they not hear or see the German plane crash into the barn and prevent their fellow soldier from being killed?\nThere wasn't enough time elapsed to even make that scene make sense.  Some how the allies have plenty of planes for \"dogfights\" but none of them can fly a message over to the front line? It's just a whole bunch of silliness and convenience when needed(french girl and baby needing milk in the ruins). The Germans are so incompetent that when it's pitch black out they cannot see her candles? Save your money maybe it will make it's way to cable in 2-3 years.",

I do wish I was brought into the character's a little more, as there may be something lacking here, but perhaps that is the trade-off with a movie like this with no flash-backs to home in London, or past run-ins with the troops that would allow for that sort of thing here.  Overall, a very impressive movie, and I have no qualms at all about giving it a four 1/2 star review.",

We as America have lately become heavily involved in the practices and preparation of war, and it is going so far that it is hinging on our nationality and freedoms. This film will serve as a reminder of how warfare has evolved in over a century and what can still be sacrificed because of the violence. This film has a basic premise, in which two soldiers must deliver a notice to stop an attack on the Germans or thousands of life will be lost (with one of the soldiers being one of the protagonist's brother). This may be the film's only true downfall as it serves no other purpose other than to get our characters from point A to B. However, the detail to trench warfare, outstanding cinematography and the sense of urgency instantly catapult this film into a Oscar Best Picture contender (even though it may have to settle for a nomination). When one can invest themselves in a time like this where lives were lost and havoc wrecked everywhere, they become aware of the pandemonium that stands in our history books today. War is beautiful yet destructive. \nThis film will not reach the heights of some other inceredible war films like Apocalyse Now or Dunkirk, but it holds a hefty message of immedicacy in times like then and now.",

This film was written by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, the dialogue between the two protagonists is minimalistic in this film, and in events where other writers would add in explanations as to why something is bad, Mendes and Wilson-Cairns allow the audience to put 2 and 2 together, which invests us more into the story, feeling like the third person alongside Blake and Schofield. This script is also written so that the audience can never rest for too long, and feel that something bad is always going to happen. One critique of the script is that the two protagonists didn't get much character building, so if they did, we would've cared more than we did when they were in danger. Characters also sometimes refer to the protagonists as Lance Corporal and then sometimes Corporal, which is a slight issue in continuity. Roger Deakins does an incredible job in  shooting this film, with camera work letting the audience cover the characters back but when we don't see in front of the characters for a while this creates tension and the audience assumes a threat. The opening shot of this scene was mesmerically beautiful, the pan shots going through barbed wire and over a body of water in a crater towards the start of the film were good pieces of camerawork, and this alongside a shot following Schofield in a river approaching a rock make the audience jump out of their seat. This was easily the best shot film of 2019 and should walk away with the Oscar for cinematography. Alongside this, Lee Smith's (editor) work to make this movie seem like it was taken in one shot was a technical masterpiece. Sam Mendes' work in this film isn't seen as the acting seems very naturalistic even though it is meticulously planned out, from the shot list to how much of the set you could use in a certain set of time. Dennis Gassner does an excellent job in production design for this film and should also walk away with the Oscar. Thomas Newman's score shows once again why he's one of the best at his job, a prime example of this was, as Schofield and Blake were approaching the first German trench, with the music feeling fanfare like and that we could celebrate, but it was still really tense and we feel that they might be walking into a death trap. Dean-Charles Chapman (Blake) and George MacKay (Schofield) do a great job at portraying themselves as in the moment even though the moments are meticulously planned, however they didn't have lots of backstory to portray, however that's as this film focuses mainly on the events going on and not the characters backstory. The audience feel like the third person alongside Blake in Schofield in this film, looking for any possible threats like their lookout. We get fully absorbed into this film as an audience, and we always feel on edge, and when there are emotional moments, they hit all the more. This is one of the great war films of all time.",

Unlike other movies the fast pace also shows how there is really no time to mourn or rest while fighting.\nSome might have a problem that there is not much fighting or that the story is to simple true the story is simple but that is the best part because you don't have to do a double take when watching trying to figure out what is happening unlike Dunkirk as for the fighting this movie does not need large shootouts or other things like that it works well with how it is.

Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins play of each other so well, it\u2019s almost as if they are two parts of the same brain. From a technical perspective it is amazingly well crafted, the two leads are phenomenal, and it\u2019s a shame that they are not getting noticed as much as they could be.

            "content": "1917 is a wonder from a film making perspective. I will take the unpopular stance that the \"single-shot\" nature of it isn't optimal, some shots leave your eye searching for the focus of the frame and some angles leave you waiting for the next interesting moment. This is most apparent at the beginning where the steady cam method of the film initially feels disorienting. It bobs with the characters as if you're walking with them but the camera is leading characters which have more similarities with a dolly or truck camera movement than a first-person perspective. So even though it seems like the intent was to make you feel as if you are walking with the character the camera is still hovering as if you are a neutral godlike observer. So from a film literacy perspective that can be disorienting since most films stick to conventional omnipotent camera movements and don't sit in this middle ground of third person/first person changing perspective.\n\nHowever, that little nitpick is my only complaint. This film is always Engaging. Within 15 minutes I forgot it was \"one-shot\" and was glued to the plight of the characters on screen. The film is two hours and it is so full of story beats and progression that I marvel at how much they fit in it. And the progression of the plot makes it very easy to recount which moments occur when and how much the characters change during the film.\n\nIf I was not concentrating on the struggles of our protagonists, I was trying to find the hidden cuts that help mask the single-shot technique. And honestly, some of them are incredibly well hidden. Others are obvious if you know what you're looking for but most viewers won't have a clue. This film is the next logical progression from 2014's Birdman in retrospect. Taking that one shot framing device and applying it to a war reenactment seems obvious while watching 1917.\n\nAnd the semi omniscient camera perspective lends itself to some amazing camera movements that will leave any filmmaker scratching their head. The camera leads and follows the action so well that it boggles the mind at how they, not only framed and timed some shots but also lit the scenes. And the angles are so wide and the focus pulling is so sharp that you rarely feel the events are \"staged\" and disconnect from the story. So much so, that I can only think of a handful of effects that were not practical. And as a filmmaker, each scene and camera move became a puzzle waiting to be solved.\n\nIf you like tense films, if you like war movies, and if you like picking apart cinematography, then you'll thoroughly enjoy 1917.",

They get tasked with delivering a message to the Colonel on the front line to let him know that he is leading 1,600 men (including one of the soldiers' brother) into a German trap.  They only have one day to hand-deliver the message and lots of ground to cover, so time is of the essence.  I finally made it; this was my most anticipated movie of 2019.  Sam Mendes is one of the most versatile directors out there, and the initial trailer looked nothing short of pulse-pounding.  I am extremely pleased to report that 1917 did not disappoint in the slightest, and if you only watch one movie this award season, this should probably be the one.  I purposely went out of my way not to read anything about this, but there was one element that I couldn't help but overhear: this movie presented in done in one continuous shot, and that did nothing but entice me even further.  In reality, this is closer to Birdman in that there are some sneaky cuts in the darkness, but I really only noticed about four spots where this was possible, and it did not take anything away from the overall effectiveness of the film.  It really pulls you in from the start, and it is not like this starts off with bombs and gunfire, it slowly guides you in as you navigate the land with these two soldiers.  The one-shot never feels like it is a gimmick, it is done for a completely engrossing effect that makes you feel like you are there on the battlefield with these men.  It isn't like there is a ton of room to operate in these trenches either, and it is mindboggling to me that they were able to choreograph not only all of these people moving at the same time but that they also somehow managed to figure out how to move the camera around everybody without interrupting the shot.  That in itself is a feat, and I'm not going to mix my words: this is some of the best modern filmmaking you will ever see, it is that well done.  The direction is the star of this, but that's not to discount the other pieces to this movie as well.  The score in this is amazing, and it really just keeps you filled with dread for what's around the next corner.  Also, it isn't just a two-hour battle because that would be exhausting, it finds quiet moments within the chaos.  This is so well-done that you don't want to take your eyes off the screen because you might miss something.  Theaters are notoriously chilly, but when I watched this, it felt about 5\u00b0 warmer from all the nervous body heat coming off the audience.  1917 is one of the best movies of the year, and it really is something special.",

The execution of its concept, the appearance of a \u2018one-take' continuous shot that propels the viewer through the narrative into a meticulous designed environment. It demonstrates a level of ambition given the genre but feels natural for such a portrayal.\n\n\nThe continuous shot provides a subjective experience of The Great War. Often 1917 paints an abstract reflection of the Tommy's state of mind in its atmosphere. Its awareness almost primitive, operating on the fumes of instinct. The imagery conjures up Romanticism in its textual analysis provoking both beauty and horror. Mendes has command over the audience's senses with overwhelming audio-visual shock and awe!\n\nPraise will no doubt fall, and rightly so, on the cinematic prowess of Roger Deakins and the design of Dennis Grassner. Grassner provides an authentic quality that complements Deakin's lens. All of which immerses the audience in Mendes's world building. This is a finely tuned collaboration.",

            "content": "This was an amazing movie and definitely a refresher from all the disappointments that came out this year. Im going to start of with the good because its easier than the bad. The acting in this movie is amazing, everybody gives such a great and realistic performance even for the characters with limited screen time. George MacKay is the stand out as he gives such a realistic and grounded approach to the role which makes you feel the horror he is experiencing during the war. Dean-Charles Chapman is also very good but is outshined by MacKay. The plot of the movie is that two young soldiers have to travel miles to deliver a message that can save 1600 men and it is executed nearly perfectly. For the whole movie you feel that you are in the war, you can feel that time is running out, the stakes are high and our characters could be shot from anywhere, there are great emotional moments which makes you feel for our heroes and the choices the characters are realistic and show that you have to make the hard choices to survive during the war. The fight scenes are really great and manage to be intense and epic without being highly choreographed. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely stunning and was definitely one of my favourite parts of the film. Finally we have the cinematography which is the absolute best part of this film. Roger Deakins never fails to blow us away, the one shot idea was great as it put you in the shoes of our heroes, the imagery is absolutely mind blowing with the standout being the shot of the village being burned. It is quite obvious that Deakins will win the Oscar for his work as it is some of the best I have ever seen. There are only 2 major problems with the film for me, the first is that the stakes were very low during the second half of the film and that pulled me out of the movie a bit. The second problem is that none of the characters are really given much character. It makes sense in a contextual perspective but from a film perspective it lacks quite a bit. I have a few other nitpicks but they don't impact the movie heavily. Overall it is an amazing movie and is one of the best from 2019. I give this movie an A and is definitely a must watch.",

We have such a compelling story. It combines the duty of the trooper, the self-sacrifice in the face of possible death of the soldier, with the personal considerations of a brother, Blake, going all out to save his real brother. The setup, an order by a general, is as grinding and astonishing as the options foisted upon Meryl Streep in \"Sophie's Choice\" by a sadistic Nazi officer. But, OK, we buy in that Firth would play on a soldier's sense of duty but also his brotherly love to be more likely to succeed in this suicide mission. Maybe it made as much sense (little) as anything decided by the military brass and politicians in World War I, where millions were thrown into the meat grinder of a horrendous war. Spoilers: When the two corporals became one, the survivor, Will Schofield, decided he must die before quitting on his word to Blake, the trooper who had saved him along the way. And when he gave his milk and all his food to a French woman and a baby, he was purifying himself for the final push, conceding his life had to be sacrificed. And when he next ran from German soldiers, all of them firing at him but none of them sharpshooters, he jumped into a raging river, the water baptizing him and sweeping him into his new sacred role of a man out to save 1,600 Brit soldiers, including Blake's brother. And the water had somehow led him to his goal, the Yorkie battalions he was out to save. Schofield had won a valor medal and traded it for a bottle of wine, saying he didn't believe he'd make it home to show anybody. But after he by hook and crook got to their commander, who called off the last part of the attack after seeing his message from the general and actually saved some of the troopers including the targeted brother Lt. Blake, the commander, Cumberbatch, didn't commend Schofield for his astonishing completion of his perilous mission, but told him to \"fuck off\" after ironically and disgustedly saying the brass might change their minds and put the attack back on in the morning. When insanity is in charge of war, anything can happen. It is a scathing piece on the insanity of war and that war. The worst, most devoid of humanity moment, was after the two Brit corporals pulled out a German pilot from his crashed, burning plane, his pants on fire, the German thanked them by stabbing Blake to death. At the end, Schofield, who surely deserved the Brit equivalent of the medal of honor, met Lt. Blake and praised his dead brother, and after, sat leaning on a tree stripped of all green, all branches, discolored, a symbol of what war does to nature; he pulled out a picture of his Mum and sister and on the back, Mum had written \"Come back to us,\" and for him, that is what mattered, where real life existed, as off in the distance he could see an array of trees with leaves in the woods, where nature had not been destroyed by war, a forest of hope. The scene when he was running to fulfill his mission on the battlefield and explosions were going off all around him for maybe a minute, I had tears in my eyes for his valor, persistence, determination, his self-discipline and his love for his friend. At picture's end, people clapped, which doesn't happen too often at the movies. Bravo. A wartime masterpiece.",

Sam Mendes manages to capture this brilliant story with super high tension despite less action than your typical war film. Not to mention the incredible performances by the main actors.

I recently watched the documentary movie \"They shall not grow old\" and with real footage, 1917 looked very clean and nothing like what was seen in real footage. I think this so attempt to create something from a passed down story (we have all had them from our grandparents), it just failed for me.",

And guess what it was great. Sam Mendes's execution of the WWI flick is a unique, edge of your seat ride that follows two men as they try and warn a battalion before they fall into an enemy trap. George Mackay of Pride(2014) is our guide through a horrific war torn landscape that's as nightmarish as it is beautiful. The execution makes you feel as if the entire venture is one non stop shot that you're unwillingly participating in. Theres not alot of development character wise and that's definitely a conscious decision but because of that I felt oddly disconnected at times. That being said the first half of the movie has an intense first person flow to it that's almost unbearable at times. But when it finally breaks for air, when our lead comes into contact with a young woman it reminded me I was in a theater. It was a solid scene but definitely broke up the pace. That being said it returns to its anxiety splitting pace not long after. When I say this movie is intense I mean it but it does stop and smell the roses so to speak. It is quiet and inspired. The lead performance from George Mackay is really fantastic and definitely deserves some award attention as does the film which I'm sure will ring it up at the Oscars and deservedly so. From the sweeping but intimate cinematography to the nerve shredding score. Its definitely one of 2019s best.",

Sam Mendes did an amazing job capturing the feeling of how one would think war would unfold in WW1.

It might seem that shooting the movie to appear as one shot would make it more interesting... but, it doesn't. The one scene might make the movie seem longer than it really is... and it sure doesn't help convey the passage of time in the movie... and well, it may have added to some of the scenes to feel like story scenes from a video game.\n\n1917 isn't a bad movie - it's just not a great movie.

From George Mackay's phenomenal performance to Mendes' directing, to the camera operators. Everyone brought their A-Game and it shows. The idea of shooting the film like it's one single take isn't just a gimmick. It helps make you feel you're on this journey with these two young men, sneaking your way through no man's land and the trenches. It never feels like it's taking over the movie, they did a brilliant job of making it feel natural. The meticulous planning it took for these shots is nothing short of perfect. The production design is also gorgeous, every set feels like your there in French countryside at the front. The true star of 1917 is Roger Deakins and his gorgeous cinematography. His cinematography tells its own story. The shot in the ruined bombed out village coming out of the window with the camera panning down with the continuous flares lighting the village gives me chills every time I've seen the film. 1917 is what movies are all about, and everything I love about movies, it has the magic that makes the movies the movies and films art.",

The beauty of the continuous filming technique was you really felt like you were there with main character from beginning to end. Many times through the film you did not want to be there with them. The reality of combat used in this war was horrific. So many lives lost. The film portrayed each soldier with so many emotions... Scared, sad, nervous, angry, anxious, homesick and some hopeful.\nObviously our modern day wars are fought in a whole new fashion. I don't think that it will ever change the men and women who are fighting\nThis movie is a must see in 2020. Will be a top contender for Best Picture",

I don't think I've seen a filmic narrative since \"The Revenant\" that's more adequately aligned itself with the term \"journey\" than this one has. It is a wild, traumatic, and relentlessly thrilling, near-real-time chronicling of a fateful day in the lives of so many that I find infinitely more epic in scope and theme than any movie I've seen in the past few years -- and some of those had more than triple the budget Mendes had at his disposal. This is what moviemaking is all about. So many moments come to pass throughout where not only the acting and writing, but the camerawork, production design, music, and thematics are firing on all cylinders, welling up feelings of wonderment, terror, anxiety, despair and grief at various points in a magnificently well-paced 2-hour running time. They absolutely do not make movies like this very often, so do yourself a favor and immediately treat yourself to viewing this masterpiece in the biggest theater you have near you.",

            "content": "Sam Mendes who is best known for winning both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Director for his directorial debut, \"American Beauty\", produces his most ambitious feat yet. \"1917\" is a taut and unyielding 2019 World War I film about two young British soldiers, Schofield and Blake (wonderfully played by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman), who set forth on a nearly impossible task of saving 1,600 men from unequivocal annihilation as they walk into a German ambush in northern France near the German front. The two soldiers must reach their destination and deliver the message in time, before the British soldier's attack the German infantry, Blake's own brother is amongst the soldiers charging. This plot twist not only heightens the suspense, but the film also operates like a ticking-clock. The two treking through booby-trapped trenches and going face to face with deadly German snipers adds raw realism to this deeply engaging film.\nThe film is made to leave the audience with the impression that the movie was filmed in one continuous take. This was an extreme challenge for both the director of photography, Roger Deakins, and the director, Sam Mendes; not to mention the toll on the cast and crew. The series of carefully orchestrated sequences had to be meticulously performed in order for Deakins and Mendes, to pull off such a cinematic achievement. This not only made the audience feel like you were living out the series of events, but we also become willing participants in suspending any disbelief, which allows us to accept the given premises of the story being told in order to empathize with the actors. This film is one of my frontrunners for best film of the year - a real tour de force. Sam Mendes other credits include \"Road to Perdition\" (2002), \"Skyfall\" (2012) and \"Spectre\" (2015).",

            "content": "I don't like war movies, never have. They usually play one of two ways - an effects-heavy love ballad to gore and violence or a hearty tale of brotherhood among men who can't wait to talk about the girls waiting back home. The ones that focus more on fact over fiction will hold my attention a little longer, but my historical interests tend to skew towards the royal court of Henry the Eighth. So no, I don't like war movies and I didn't like 1917. I loved it.\n\nThe story follows two British soldiers during the first world war and their journey across hostile territory to pass on a message that will save hundreds of lives - if they make it. Blake, played by Dean-Charles Chapman (Game of Thrones' Tommen Baratheon) and Schofield, played by George MacKay (Hamlet in the 2018 film Ophelia, which I only recently learned about and is now on my watchlist) are quickly likable and their easy, youthful friendship gives the movie a light start. Unfortunately, movies that attach you to the main characters so quickly tend to immediately send them into danger and 1917 is no exception.\n\nSchofield and Blake are called to see the general who informs them that there is an attack planned for the next morning that needs to be stopped. Turns out the Germans weren't really retreating, they were luring the British into a trap and if the attack goes on, all 1,600 men will die. Unfortunately, the phone lines have been cut and they can't call them, so the only way to warn them is by a hand-delivered letter. This is where Blake comes in - with his expert navigation skills, he should be able to make his way past the German front lines and to the camp of the 2nd battalion. In case orders aren't enough, the stakes are made even more personal when it is revealed his brother is one of the 1,600 men.\n\nThey set off on their journey and we're quickly - too quickly - exposed to the horrors of war. The devastation is immediate as we are first introduced to the wounded, and then to the dead. As the pair begin their trek across no man's land, we see horrors that no man should ever have to witness and with each devastating visual, you are reminded that this isn't just a movie - this is someone's past, someone's memory. \n\nThough the story is a work of fiction, it is in fact based in some reality - director Sam Mendes' grandfather, Alfred Mendes went on his own life-threatening journey across no man's land in his time serving during World War I. These tales of war first relayed to Mendes in his childhood, stayed with him, eventually inspiring the creation of 1917.\n\nAnd what a creation it is. Emotionally charged from start to finish, it's hard to not judge this movie from such a personal perspective. Beyond just being visually stunning, it's the way the visuals are presented that takes it to the next level - the entire thing is made to look like one continuous take.\n\nI will admit, I was skeptical about the idea when I first heard what they were doing, but within minutes of the movie starting, I was hooked. Something happens when a movie unfolds in \"real-time\" and in such close proximity - you become a part of it. You're no longer watching two soldiers delivering a message during a war. You are the third soldier, a silent partner on a dangerous mission. There isn't that detached feeling of an observer, your emotions are heightened because you're experiencing it with them - the fear, the anxiety, the sadness, the determination. I will say this again and again - movies aren't just meant to be watched, they're meant to be felt and 1917 does this brilliantly.\n\nThere is so much to like about the movie - the actors, the music, the story, the sheer artistry of it all - but it's the emotional core that gives it such a high place in my heart and my rating scale. This is more than just a war film - this is a story of humanity, determination, loyalty, and friendship. It's a harsh but necessary reminder of the cost of war, a hope that we can be better than we were before. It's a testament to the bond between a grandson and grandfather. It is a truly wonderful piece of art, the kind of movie that awards are made for. The stunning package is just the pretty ribbon attached to the medal.\n\n(This review has previously been posted on Chick and a Flick.)",

            "content": "5 Star Review: (No Spoilers here)\n1917 is a remarkable cinematic achievement that deserves to seen on the best screen possible. The film's first 15-20 minutes alone cemented this film as the year's best for 2019 and everything after placed it into the conversation for film of the decade. Directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Jarhead, Skyfall, Spectre) and in collaboration with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has 80 films to his credit, 1917 is an ambitious, gripping and stirring WWI epic about 2 young soldiers tasked with delivering a message before dawn telling a battalion of soldiers to stop their planned attack, which new intel says would be a trap and lead to the entire battalion's death. Filmed with the illusion of being shot in a single long take, 1917 takes audiences right into the heart of the action and makes us feel as if we're right there with the 2 soldiers from beginning to end. Every crucial and dangerous moment these 2 individuals experience, as a result of the one take, is amplified and a gorgeous sight to behold and experience. \nAs expected, the film's camerawork or cinematography is the real star of this film. Through careful meticulous planning, Mendes and Deakins have crafted an epic that simply stuns and mesmerizes for the film's entirety. The film's best moment comes during a scene at night where the window we see a french village lying in destruction and ruin while flares are shot off-camera from behind which then casts an eerie flash of contrasting light and shadow onto the ruined village. As the camera exits the window and pans down to ground level, the film's orchestral score swells and flourishes for dramatic effect while the light and shadows continue to flicker in a haunting yet beautiful display of cinema. This powerful scene filled me with emotion I hadn't felt for a film in a very long time. I realized I was witnessing a masterpiece of beauty and technical prowess. This is what cinema is all about.",

It didn't glorify instead it showed the thin line between doing ones duty and slipping into madness. Only people who have been through it can understand.\n\nThe movie allows one to make their own decisions on what constitutes courage and the path to survival for not only the soldiers but the local residents who suffer the most from losing their villages. So like a flock of locusts the battle lines move from side to side and everything gets destroyed or made into that days victory.\n\nThis is a very graphic movie, people in all levels of combat do what they can to survive.

            "content": "December 25, 2019 (limited)\n\nSam Mendes' \"1917\" is an exceptionally well-made war movie, told with heart and conviction, and rendered with exquisite special effects and high production values. Like many of its kind (\"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Black Hawk Down,\" \"Dunkirk\"), it places viewers, as best as any narrative film can, in the thick of the characters' dizzying and incomprehensible situations, up to the point where we practically feel their intense pain, fear and fatigue. On the same hand, we acquire their resilience, not to mention their determination to complete the mission they've been given. On the whole, this film stirs us both physically and emotionally.\n\nHowever, while I mostly have good things to say about the picture, I hesitate to lend it too much praise because of the obvious machinations embedded in Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns' screenplay, which relies on common war movie tropes to raise tension and pull on our heartstrings. These familiar devices work, mind you, but they also hold the film back from true greatness because they confine the story to what seems like a definitive, crowd-pleasing trajectory. Amidst seeing so many Hollywood war movies over the years and the becoming privy to the conventions of the genre, I wish \"1917\" had been let loose and allowed to transpire more chaotically and unpredictably, as real wars probably do.\n\nIt's likely there was pressure from the studio to tie the narrative up into a neat and not-too-risky package, in which the people and events connect the way we hope they will, as if the filmmakers wanted to reassure us that everything in life has purpose and even something as disorderly as war can be made orderly. I'm sure this approach makes a movie like \"1917\" more marketable to a mass audience, but it also gives it a certain level of romance that dilutes the reality of the conflict, and maintaining realism should have been the film's priority. Alas, it opts to stay in safe and proven territory, despite having the talent in front and behind the camera to break free from it.\n\nThat being said, to the film's credit, once it starts, it doesn't stop. It opens in April 1917 on a quiet, serene flower field in Northern France. The camera pulls back slowly and reveals two twentysomething lance corporals in the British army: Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay). Both are resting and it's evident they've already seen their fair share of war, although probably not the likes of which is to come.\n\nA superior officer approaches the boyish-faced lads and takes them to General Erinmore (Colin Firth), who gives them orders to cross \"No Man's Land,\" or the vast open space between the French and former German front lines (Erinmore assumes there will be no lingering German soldiers out gunning for them). They're to hand deliver a letter from Erinmore to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) that instructs the colonel to call off a planned attack on the Germans, whose alleged retreat was part of a strategy to lure and entrap the British army. Erinmore has chosen Blake and Schofield for the job because Blake's eldest brother is a lieutenant among the 116,000-man battalion being set up for the German ambush, and Erinmore figures saving his older brother will give Blake even more incentive to complete the mission.\n\nWhat follows is a harrowing adventure of sorts as Blake and Schofield embark on what's supposed to be a straightforward, hours-long journey between the opposing sides' trenches. It proves to be anything but, however, because the soldiers encounter obstacles and conflicts that become increasingly perilous. I would describe their ordeals in more detail but it would disclose crucial developments the film depends on for its many surprises and ultimately instilling fear and anxiety in the audience so that we might empathize with the protagonists more. \n\nWhat I can tell you, and what the film is has been justifiably touting as one of its strongest, more unique assets, is its long, uninterrupted takes effectively place us in the middle of the action. And even though this invisible edit strategy has been practiced many times before (Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope,\" Aleksandr Sokurov's \"Russian Ark\"), \"1917\" executes it in such a way that the technique doesn't draw undue attention to itself, likely because it's a war movie in which the tactic feels most appropriate, since those taking part in war hardly ever get a break themselves. \n\nAfter a while, we become aware we've been following Blake and Schofield continuously, without cuts to other characters or establishing shots of the surrounding environment, but this deepens our relationship with them and we genuinely come to care about these \"kids\" and sometimes can't believe two people who are so young could find themselves in situations so grim. Editor Lee Smith and cinematographer Roger Deakins do a remarkable job of masking the cuts that sometimes only occur up to 8 and a half minutes after following the leads. It can be exhausting but \"1917\" is meant to be a cautionary tale about the toll war can take on the human mind and body as much as an action drama.\n\nThe goal of \"1917,\" and what it achieves, is to throw the audience into the world of Blake and Schofield and to make the abstract concept of war less abstract. It's an inherently captivating and thrilling experience, made all the more hard-hitting by Dennis Gassner's expansive production design, which does an especially outstanding job of recreating destroyed towns and disemboweled structures. These striking visuals are underlined by Thomas Newman's elegiac score, which is comprised of the usual but still powerfully grandiose waves of strings and horns, which get punctuated, to great dramatic effect, by a light, child-like piano theme that accentuates the innocence of the main characters and the idea that when it comes to war, perhaps everyone involved retreats back to their childhood, feeling scared, insecure and trying desperately to navigate a world that's dangerous, overwhelming and baffling. This is how we feel watching the film and it's gripping.\n\nI've given \"1917\" a lot of compliments, but I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention its shortcomings, most of which exist at the screenplay level. Mendes has obviously made a very personal film\u2014the fictional story was inspired by one his grandfather, himself a World War I veteran, relayed to him\u2014but I wish he and Cairns had taken greater risks by not setting the plot  on such a traditional Hollywood war movie path. Its standard narrative developments and easy emotional payoffs actually undermine the film's attempt to be visually and atmospherically realistic, which it accomplishes through its technical prowess.\n\nOne of the scenes I had a hard time believing takes place when Schofield meets a young French woman and her newborn baby. She's hiding in a blown-out building and her baby is hungry, so it seems overly convenient that Schofield happened to grab exactly what the baby needed in an earlier scene. Don't get me wrong\u2014this is a touching, sweet moment, and it reminds us of the soldier's unwavering humanity, but at the same time, it feels too \"written,\" sentimental and forced, as if the filmmakers thought they were required to strike our emotional chords even if it meant ceasing the urgency of the characters' situation and succumbing to melodrama. \n\nAnother extraneous albeit well-acted scene arrives near the end when Schofield hears a fellow soldier singing the gospel song, \"Poor Wayfaring Stranger,\" and sits quietly beside a tree to listen. Again, this a reflective break from the surrounding madness, but it doesn't quite fit with the movie's overall exigent tone. \"1917\" works masterfully when it focuses on being a brutally pressing and unaffected war picture, but it loses credibility when it tries to be something else, namely a poetic drama or a suspenseful Hollywood thriller, the latter of which is most apparent during the climax when the hero faces one hurdle after another to the point where it becomes overkill.\n\nNevertheless, our admiration for \"1917\" outweighs our criticism of it. The scope of the film is enormous and Mendes and his team show they're in complete control of their resources. The nature and subject matter of war movies tend to make them easy to hold in high regard, but that doesn't make them any easier to pull or less deserving of our respect, and \"1917\" is one that merits recognition for its visuals, its score, its tempo, and the way it exercises our hearts, minds and viscera all at once. Its narrative inconsistencies hold it back from being a perfect film, but it's certainly a memorable one.",

            "content": "1917 is a remarkable cinematic achievement. It's a gripping film, a startling companion to the horror of war. A totally visceral and immersive experience that left me shaking by its conclusion. Sam Mendes has given us something that is quite unique, audacious and ambitious. The film is set in 1917, obviously, during the First World War. Two young British Lance Corporals are ordered to deliver a message to a battalion on the front. The order is to cease their attack as they will be slaughtered by a heavy Germam presence. To add further drama a brother of one of the corporals is a member of the battalion. So sets off a heart stopping expedition to deliver the message before the impending doom. To add to the drama the film is shot in 'one take'. Of course it appears this way with careful editing but the affect is quite stunning. The camera follows the two men through trenches and piles of mud and burnt out towns with maximum affect. You feel as if you are living with the men as the camera follows them. Of course some critics have dismiised this as gimmicky but I think it adds to the sheer drama of the situation. Every second feels life changing and imperative. Of course this could make the film a one trick pony but it is such an enormous trick that I was swept up in the panic and desperation of the events taking place. It really works, it had me on the edge of my seat through out. There are some big names spread throughout the film such as Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch but it is the young actors in the main roles who shine especially the very impressive George MacKay. To aid the film the production design is impeccable. You can feel the flies and rats and dead bodies piling up. And of course the cinematography by Roger Deakins is incomparable. This is high wire film making. It shoves us into the face of war and makes us feel every breath and gun shot fired. Cinema can be many things and make us feel many things. This film is unique in its own way and for that I think it is essential viewing.",

We are never allowed to look away or rest, never allowed even the small mercies of escape in the beauty of falling cherry blossoms in a river, as the camera pans to bloated corpses we must swim through to reach land.

            "content": "Starting on April 6, 1917 (the day the US joined the Great War although never referenced) and ending the next morning, two baby faced British soldiers, Lance Corporal William Schofield (George MacKay) and Lance Corporal Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) have 12 hours to maneuver through enemy lines of the Western Front. Their mission is to deliver a \u201ccall off the attack\u201d message in order to save 1,600 troops who are unknowingly marching into a German ambush that will result in the complete slaughter of the Devonshire Regiment that includes Lt. Joseph Blake (Richard Madden, Robb Stark from GoT), Tom\u2019s big brother. If you feel you are running, jumping and zig-zagging right behind Schofield and Blake through northern France\u2019s war zone of trenches, barbed wire, bayonets, snipers, booby traps, ash, mud, rats, bloated horse carcasses, rotting human corpses\u2014\u201cfollow the stench\u201d\u2014bombed out fiery ruins of abandoned French villages, mortar and mayhem, you can thank the cinematography technique that shot the terrifying no man\u2019s land dash to look like it was filmed in a single linear take. Action! It\u2019s a wrap! No cuts. At least that\u2019s how the 119 minutes feel start to finish. We don\u2019t see or hear anything that Blake or Schofield don\u2019t see or hear. They are not so much a duo as a trio, I was with them. When a foraging rat lumbers into the trip wire, I cringed anticipating the explosion. When a downed German fighter plane cartwheels towards the two young Brits, I ducked. When Schofield runs for his life plunging over a sheer drop into the river rapids below, I braced for impact. I stood and watched the eerily breathtaking beauty of the wartime night illuminated by bombs and flames. Think Apocalypse Now. The film was shot in Scotland, the landscape stunning, my senses satiated by a dramatic range of scenes, the gore of combat carnage to the beauty of cows and countryside. After the first fifteen minutes I was unabashedly in love with this movie. 1917 is defined, not by blood and battles but by bravery and brotherhood. The relationship between buddies Blake and Schofield was close enough for an engaging balance of humor and hubris to emerge that never felt forced or contrived. Yet I never warmed up to the characters. But this may be precisely the cool response the filmmaker sought. Blake and Schofield\u2018s friendship was situational, a camaraderie spawning from the killing fields of war where guarding a requisite emotional distance is as essential to foot soldiers as combat gear. I felt that distance. So when the inevitable strikes, \u201cIt\u2019s better not to dwell on it,\u201d advice given by Captain Smith (Mark Strong) to Corporal Schofield in a moment of dazed trauma, I could pick myself up and keep moving. No grieving, no lingering, the 12-hour clock is winding down. In fact I was so invested in the mission that it frustrated me when the two corporals kept making ill advised decisions when confronted by their German counterparts, predictably crushing carpe diem under the shadow of death. I even eschewed the tender moments, a pail of milk, cherry blossoms, an orphaned child, a haunting Wayfaring Stranger solo\u2014scenes that were clearly drawn up to infiltrate a symbolic flavor of humanity into the chaos and destruction\u2014but the poignant minutes lingered a tad too long for my liking, slowing the urgency of the mission. I was channeling Winston Churchill, \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d Don\u2019t stop! Hold that baby later! You\u2019ve got to get the message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch)! Now! Towards the end I kept wondering if those sentimental diversions cost lives. Still, nothing veered me away from absolutely loving this movie. Don\u2019t wait for Netflix or Amazon. This is the type of movie that demands the big screen. You will learn from the ending credits that the film is dedicated to Lance Corporal Alfred H. Mendes\u2014the director\u2019s grandfather \u201cwho told us the stories.\u201d Mendes at the age of 20 volunteered for a terrifying World War I solo mission through no man\u2019s land to locate three British companies separated from their battalion. It was this mission through the muddy Flanders fields of Belgium that served as inspiration for 1917. In honoring his grandfather, Mendes crafted an epic war drama. I predict more honors: Oscar goes to 1917 for Best Picture",

Some of the critics and reviewers insist on referencing \"Saving Private Ryan\" but that is a shallow, lowest common denominator comparison that reveals an ignorance of the genre.  This film, at is core, is a blend of \"Gallipoli\" and \"Full Metal Jacket.\"  Gallipoli for its moral and human compass aka consequences and FMJ for its overall tone of isolation, danger, doom, and fear....that you cannot see (and never really do en mass) the enemy but you know they're there...so when they do appear its very powerful and terrifying.  There are also several scenes that highlight the zero sum game of war, and the horrible choices people have to make to survive and/or win. The best compliment I can pay is that my grandfather fought in WWI...and this film honors him by not reducing it to some simplistic political or moral platitude. It honored him through the Realism of what he endured. Most definitely recommended.",

The most immersive movie I have ever seen. \n\n      The sets don't appear to be sets, but \u2018the real thing'. That is the best way to put it. The movie is an anomaly. In a time devoid of epic tales of heroism, true bravery and courage, the film is a work of art that truly encapsulates the spirit of adventure. \n\n  One theme that is perfectly displayed by the film is sacrifice. Not glorious sacrifice, but the depiction of the rewards and consequences of mans commitment to his duty.\n\nThe film has an organic and authentic sense of scale. From massive and seemingly endless green fields to lines of chain link fence that continue to the horizon or city scapes that even in their limitation have a sense of being only parts of a whole. \n\nPerhaps it's best quality is it's artistic flourishing. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWING: Right before one of the duo sent on the mission is killed, he reminisces about life back home. He tells his friend and partner in their mission about the different sorts of cherry trees and that his mother has an orchid back home. Further on in his journey, the surviving partner floats through a stream after the roughest part of the journey excluding the final push. A cherry tree blossoms as he is floating peacefully, creating a breathtaking display. \n\nAlthough it has been criticized as nationalist, it is almost the opposite, a depiction that portrays the Germans and Britains as not uniquely cruel or noble, but both as almost equal players in a tragic game. There is no enemy bashing, no assailing of the Germans as a unique enemy except for in maybe one scene where animals had been slaughtered to prevent the British army from utilizing them for food. Other than that, the film humanizes the German opponents. Showing pictures at the cots or abandoned German trenches. The British army is so devoid of British insignia and references that one could almost see it as any army, be it American or any other forces. The British army in the film features an Indian soldier and African-American soldiers and the Indian soldier is discriminated against in a bit of reflection of the actual historical climate and sentiments. It is sober in its treatment of history and does not seek to glorify war as many other films have done.",

This is an incredible piece of cinema!!!\n\nThis movie is really a ride with sort of a dreamlike feel to it as the characters are taken from one unpredictable situation to another unable to know if they'll encounter friend or foe.\n\nDirector Sam Mendes already showed in Skyfall that he commands an excellent visual style but this is a whole other level. The movie is filmed to give the illusion of one full tracking shot. Every moment the camera looks like it's following the characters. It is quite an achievement. Besides the tracking, the film also does a great job of deciding what elements of the scene to focus on.\n\nThe scenery in this is a thing of ethereal beauty. The characters travel through a constantly shifting landscape, from trenches to abandoned farms and so forth. Even the worse of environments look good. In my opinion, the war torn town at night scene is one of the best images in film history.\n\nThe one aspect that didn't always quite work for me was the music. Don't get me wrong. it's not bad. The issue is that the tracking shot gives a very natural, engrossing feel to what's going on. Suddenly, the music will boom loudly and take you out it.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this. This is a truly stunning flick.",

The use of long takes, in order to make this film seem as if it was done on just one continuous shot, was a brilliant choice for shooting because it helps illustrate the tension and urgency brought upon by the mission that our two characters must succeed in. Cinematographer Roger Deakins has outdone himself once again, not only with this technique, but just with how he makes the film look gorgeous; it brought me memories of the same aesthetic look that he worked on for Blade Runner 2049. The script itself achieves a fine balance between the dialogue and emotions experienced by our two leads, and it helps to offer a pause between the dramatic, unbroken action sequences of these continuous shots. I've heard critics say that this film lacks character development, outside of the fact that one of them has to save his older brother, but I'd like to argue the film was nuanced and to the point. You don't really need Blake and Schofield to have their own story arcs; the war that they are immersed in is its own story arc. Plus, their actors, Dean - Charles Chapman and George MacKay, were brilliant through their use of subtle body language and their facial expressions were enough for me to gravitate towards them and understand what they are going through. Whether this film wins the big one remains to be seen, but there's not doubt that this film will take you on an incredible journey filled with a lot of tension and emotion.",

The gorgeous cinematography draws you in to feel like your right there in the suspense and horror brutalities of World War 1. Director Sam Mendes does a incredible job showing the nightmare side of war being very disturbing but also not going off the rails into a complete unnecessary gore fest. The action scenes are so intense it's teeth shattering. Some scenes were so intense I caught myself sinking in my chair. The film is made to feel like one consistent shot and Sam Mendes pulls it off remarkably. So well that some shots I couldn't believe were possible had me repeatedly saying to myself \"How the hell did they shoot that !\" The set pieces are absolutely gorgeous and are done so dam well in making them feel absolutely massive in size. The two lead actors do a dam good job and are met with a great supporting cast appearances by some juggernaut actors. Just when I thought I had a firm grip on the Oscar picture of 2020 Sam Mendes comes in like a force and makes his voice heard with a purpose. I thought Irishman had it locked but I have to admit after seeing this film your probably looking at the Best Picture Winner for 2020. The Directing, cinematography, acting, set pieces, score, costume design, realism, photography, special effects and so much more beauty spills from this incredible film. Overall, 1917 is a rare remarkable achievement of a film with master class level of Directing by Sam Mendes making it the must-see movie of the year !",

The style of following the two protagonists continually on their mission is brave but ultimately flawed as it\u2019s becomes impossible to condense a 12 hour mission into a 2 hours film when the camera doesn\u2019t leave their side, the result is scenery changes that are unrealistically rapid and make the film feel more like you are are moving thought the levels of a computer game.

Deakins also captures the scale of the film with what may very well be his best camera work to date. For two hours, you are in World War 1; the tension and anxiety that the characters of Blake and Schofield experience is reflected well onto the audience. The moment when Schofield steps out of the trench on his own and begins to run felt like I was on a rollercoaster that's about to take the first plunge.

The brother is asked to come to the commander's hole and they get orders to give orders to a commander who's about to get wiped out across the enemy lines.\nThe camera follows these two main characters through the trench and eventually to the barn where the \"brother\" dies and you're left with a protagonist you know next to nothing about. Is he married? Does he have children at home? Girlfriend? Career? Family? Siblings? Who knows?\nYou follow the character all the way to where he gives the orders from the general to call off the attack. That's the story. You learn nothing about the main characters, no secondary character development is present. Everyone he meets is gone in less than five minutes of screen time.\nThink Death Race without a plot or character development. For the life of me, I can't understand why the audience is giving this movie a 92% (at the time of my writing) when you leave without learning one significant fact about any of the characters. I learn more in a single audition about the performers for Americas Got Talent than you do in 120 minutes of this movie.\nThe action and historical aspect of this movie were great otherwise, I'd give it a one star.

The \"trench eye view\" scenes are original and add an interesting and impressive perspective (I felt these were the best part of the movie), and there is much spectacular cinematography as well as some originality in the scenes. Overall, I felt the film was let down by a mainly predictable plot, and the obligatory, but unnecessary appearance of St Benedict of Cumberbatch, ahead of the \"pass me the bucket\", overly slushy, final scenes (did we really need these Sam?). SPOILER ALERT...I also felt the move drew on too many scenes from other successful war movies, particularly those of the \"Nam\" genre (the sniper scene from Full Metal Jacket is almost a direct transplant). Overall, a WW1 impression of Apocalypse Now, but without any of Coppola's edginess...if only Cumberbatch had turned out to be a British version of Col Kurtz, shot the messenger, and sent them all over the top to face oblivion...now there's an ending.",

            "content": "If you're ever in the mood to watch a war film, there's an over-abundance of them throughout history. You can almost always find one that you haven't seen before. For this reason alone, I find myself being very cautious when one is about to get a wide release. With recent releases like Hacksaw Ridge or Dunkirk, my faith in the genre is always rejuvenated. Well, 1917 is yet another war film to come along and surprise me. For all the technical reasons to love this film on top of the powerful story itself, here's why I believe 1917 is one of 2019s very best films.\u00a0\n\nThe premise is nice and simple. Two young soldiers are given the task of sneaking through enemy lines in order to deliver a message to their commander, which will, in turn, save thousands of lives if received in time. This premise makes for a very tense ride. On top of being an engaging story, this movie is filmed in such a way that it makes it feel like one continuous take, for the most part, which ultimately begs the core actors to deliver the performances of their career.\n\nAlthough I've seen him in great films like Captain Fantastic and Pride, George MacKay never really stood out to me as award-worthy, but I stand corrected. This may very well be the best performance he ever gives, but that's not a negative, because I'll always remember him for this role. Alongside him is Dean-Charles Chapman, who I've also liked in Game of Thrones and Blinded by the Light, so I knew to expect a solid performance from him. With that said, he also delivers one of the better performances I've seen in 2019, simply due to the devotion he has to his character.\u00a0\n\nNow, this would absolutely be an incomplete review if I forgot to bring up how incredible the technical aspects of this film are. Roger Deakins is basically a god in the cinematography world, so his work astounds me every single time he brings his vision to a project, and 1917 is no exception to that. The way this camera seamlessly follows these actors in and out of small or big sequences was simply astonishing. Layered on top of this jaw-dropping cinematography is the superb score by Thomas Newman. The combination of being swept up in these performances, caring about the story, being impressed by the camerawork, and then finally being moved by how well the music was composed for each scene, I found it very difficult to criticize anything here.\u00a0\n\nOverall, 1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019.",

This film honestly may have been my most anticipated film of 2019, and the wait to finally have checked it out was vicious. Because this is truly one of the most breathtaking war epics, Ive ever laid eyes on beautifully and skillfully shot by Roger Deakins using long takes, so this 2-hour film appears to be one continuous shot with no cuts whatsoever. With Mendes and Deakins leading the charge here, these are masters at work. I cannot stress enough how stunning this film looks, how it feels so authentic and true to the time period. The costume design, hair and makeup, set production, the perfect score by Thomas Newman, everything blew me away.\n\nGeorge MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are absolutely fantastic as the films leads. They give such excellent performances making the audience feel uneasy as we are along with them on their journey. One of my favorite aspects of this amazing project is just how genuine and raw this story is, really getting across the point of what these British soldiers experienced in the middle of trench warfare. There is almost always something happening on screen, rarely giving you a chance to breathe. You are right there with these two soldiers, always on the move and in the thick of it. This is a gorgeous, excellent film, a technical achievement, and a nerve-racking experience that needs to be seen on the big screen. PLEASE check it out ASAP.",

Here's all you need to know: Lance is asked to grab a comrade, they are given orders to deliver a message to Colonel MacKenzie to stop an attack against the Germans...and that's it. Once you are given that information just sit back and enjoy the one-shot experience. From the get-go, you feel immersed in the story and you feel as though you are right there with the characters.

A visual tour de force is storytelling brought to life by one continuous tracking shot with a little digital stitching here and there. The camera basically follows two soldiers as they embark on a mission to deliver orders across No Mans Land. It\u2019s a simple story brilliantly told. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is nothing short of extraordinary as the camera glides above and below our protagonists and sometimes even goes off in a different direction, then circles back to them. It\u2019s unlike any war film I have seen in quite a while. Some are hailing this as the best since Spielberg\u2019s masterpiece \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d, I\u2019m not sure about that, I\u2019d have to have a think, but it\u2019s certainly a tremendous piece of filmmaking brought to live by a wonderful director who\u2019s worked I have admired for years. Thomas Newman\u2019s music is also profoundly moving and the ending is exhilarating and heartbreaking at the same time. \u201c1917\u201d manage to impress myself and my two mates and that\u2019s a rarity these days.

Trying to out run the circle. I would watch again maybe in a couple years. I personally love movies like this, I understand it's a HUGE part in British history during World War 1, but it was drawn out. The Climax was no where to be found, and the Falling action was abrupt to the ending.

No CGI was evident, or at least I never thought to myself 'this is CGI'. The characters are not Rambo, mowing down the enemy, rather they are all too human, which is the point.\nI'm obviously not going to include spoilers, I'm only going to recommend you experience it yourself, and think not only about the past and those who have died in senseless war, but consider the dangers we now face.

History both being told and made. I have no doubt that this movie has raised the bar for anyone who dares to recreate again those dank, mud addled trenches again.

I know the cost, time and difficulty of creating war sets and effects.  \n\nThe long tracking shots of 1917 following the men through the trenches was mesmerizing but ultimately repetitive and tedious. I felt nothing for the story or the characters involved; the young actors felt generic, like human set pieces in a video game running through a lovely scenario.  I ended up only appreciating what the movie making crafts have produced and wishing Sam Mendes had cared more for acting and story.

I\u2019m not sure many would go after the sniper when going bypassing him would be much better for ones health. Or the burning German pilot would attack his rescuer. I would\u2019ve liked to see a scene where the two engaged a smaller group of retreating or hiding Germans as an action scene because again the few action scenes were pretty mundane.

This film honestly may have been my most anticipated film of 2019, and the wait to finally have checked it out was vicious. Because this is truly one of the most breathtaking war epics, I've ever laid eyes on; beautifully and skillfully shot by Roger Deakins using long takes, so this 2-hour film appears to be one continuous shot with no cuts whatsoever. With Mendes and Deakins leading the charge here, these are masters at work. I cannot stress enough how stunning this film looks, how it feels so authentic and true to the time period. The costume design, hair and makeup, set production, the perfect score by Thomas Newman, everything blew me away.\n\nGeorge MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are absolutely fantastic as the film's leads. They give such excellent performances making the audience feel uneasy as we are along with them on their journey. One of my favorite aspects of this amazing project is just how genuine and raw this story is, really getting across the point of what these British soldiers experienced in the middle of trench warfare. There is almost always something happening on screen, rarely giving you a chance to breathe. You are right there with these two soldiers, always on the move and in the thick of it. This is a gorgeous, excellent film, a technical achievement, and a nerve-racking experience that needs to be seen on the big screen. PLEASE check it out ASAP",

After seeing the picture it is obvious that the visual technique of director's Sam Mendes's collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins is what makes this movie rate so high.  It looks like the picture has been made in one continuous take with 2-3 exceptions which are carefully explained in the script by Sam Mendes, with the help of Krysty-Wilson Cairns and based on stories told by his uncle Alfred Mendes.\n\nThe story is a basic one of two young British soldiers who have to deliver a message to stop a raid which would be a deathtrap for 1600 men, one being a brother of one of the soldiers. One of the illogical parts of the script is that the two men are are too inexperienced to take on a task but 1) going to the movies in most cases you have to park your logic out in the lobby and 2) this takes place at the beginning of the movie when you are caught up in the film's technique so by the time you get involved with the story itself they have picked up much needed experience along with many coincidences that might not ring true.\n\nThe two leads, Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are more than adequate, with one carrying a heavier load than the other, while there are many cameos from such actors as Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Daniel Mays and Claire Duburcq.\n\n\"1917\" is interesting for the way it appears to have been filmed but there have been much better war movies in the past and certainly better movies in 2019.",

That being said, many elements of the plot are quite derivative of Saving Private Ryan including several close-up fights with a dying German soldier. and snipers in bell towers.  After one gets used to the gorgeous photography and very long tracking shots, the movie actually becomes a bit boring.  So I can't give the entire film 5 stars even though the cinematography is definitely Oscar-worthy.  On a closing note, this is one film that greatly benefits by being seen on a theater screen with a full audience to gasp and awe together.  It is not that it won't work on the latest high-definition TV but you really need the immersive experience of a theater.",

The film made many \"Top 10\" lists for 2019, but most people couldn't even see it until 2020. Starring relative unknowns with only a handful of side roles for established stars, we were eager to see what all the fuss was about. Wasn't this just another war movie?\n\nIt turned out to be a singular cinematic experience that was so intense, so visceral, so relentless, I was wrung out and speechless when the credits rolled. And while that sounds like something potentially bad, it was also beautiful, so beautiful. Walking out, both Jen and I said at nearly the same time, \"If Roger Deacons (the cinematographer) doesn't get another Oscar for this, there's something truly wrong with this world.\"\n\nI love reading up on movies before I see them, and I'm not spoiler averse. Yet there are some fundamental things about this movie, from its core technical conceit to how it's merely being described in reviews, that I almost wish I didn't know going in. Even knowing who has cameos leaves part of your brain wondering when they're going to turn up (there was a lot of elbowing between my wife and daughter). All of which is my way of saying, maybe avoid trailers and reviews (even this one!) before going in. A trailer being sponsored on Facebook gives away snippets of some mind-blowing moments.\n\nEven with a brain full of behind-the-scenes trivia, \"1917\" still blew me away.\n\nI've never been fully swept away by a war movie. Not my thing? Wrong generation? \"Dunkirk\" probably came the closest to achieving what \"1917\" did, and many fantastic war films were clearly going for the ground-level intensity \"1917\" embodies (how many people still specifically talk about \"the first ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan\"). But I think \"1917\" is in a class by itself.\n\nIt truly does things I've never seen on screen before, and gave me an experience that both rattled and inspired me to my core. It's definitely a \"I wish I could make movies\" movie.\n\nWe saw it in a broom closet of a theater in Mililani, and it was still incredible. If you can see it in IMAX with Dolby UltraSuperMax 3000, I would strongly recommend it.\n\nBut however you can see it, see it.",

Not only does this lend an urgency to the journey, but it boggles the mind to consider how some of the scenes were even staged/captured. The trek itself is full of setbacks that make the mission even more challenging for the soldiers and the viewer (if not a bit strained on credibility).

What should I say aside from the fact that 1917 is not only one of the best films I watched this year but also one of the best war films I've ever seen.\nSam Mendes directed this film to look like one long shot, and who else to make that possible than the man himself, Roger Deakins. If this film doesn't cement his legacy as the best cinematographer to ever live I don't know what will. This is a movie unlike 99% of movies that are released today. The next time I watch another film, I'm going to have to get used to the normal cuts you see in movies. It was THAT seamless. The way this film is shot and put together is a once in a great while deal and you have to realize that. The actors George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman were absolutely outstanding in this movie especially when looking at how long the cuts are in this movie. They have to do so much and not mess up and it all felt so real, natural, and was a true work of art what they put on screen. Their characters felt like real people asked to do a near impossible task but were written so well and we got to know everything we needed to about them. Every actor in this movie did a terrific job and what little screen time Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch had, they enhanced the proceedings even more. Again for being a film with such long takes, seeing how the events in this movie carry out from practical imagery and what little CGI there is, it's all incorporated in a way so brilliantly. I also didn't expect to be as emotional as I was during and of course when the film ended. I can honestly say I teared up at a few moments. One thing I also really appreciated about this movie was how seriously it was taken. Some spots in this movie built up tension than most horror movies do nowadays and there's a scene in this movie that startled the hell out of me. It was done so perfectly and again, it scared the crap out of me. Also, there's like no quips and one liners to make the audience chuckle or make the situation seem light hearted. This is a very serious situation and the screenplay justifies that by keeping you on edge the entire time. The musical score was also amazing and added to the level of emotion I was feeling and made the brilliant action and drama sequences feel more heavy. When you look at the big picture, this movie is a very simple story, told about as brilliantly as anyone can possibly tell it and of course executed to pure perfection. Roger Deakins is the best cinematographer ever; no one can change my mind on that and I'm praying he earns his second Oscar for cinematography for this film. I have thought about this film for a few hours and cannot come up with anything I found wrong with it. Literally everything in this movie worked for me including the pacing which I thought would've been a problem due to the long takes but again, it all felt so seamless. 2019 was a mixed bag with a lot of good movies, but unfortunately a lot of disappointing ones as well. Either those films being just okay or flat out not good, the end of this year added to my list of great films I saw with two outstanding gems being this and Marriage Story. As I stated, this year was a bit rocky, but it went out with back to back home runs. If you're a fan of war movies or just film in general, I beg you to see this. Don't let this film flop at the box office. This is a film we might not see for a long time, or one we may never see again. I'm at a loss of words, and 1917 without a doubt, gets an A+",

It's all shot as if it's one long take. And for the most part it works. I really enjoyed the two leads chemistry and it's very believable for all the stuff they go through.

First, he gave us one of the best Bond movies that modern generations will ever see and now provides us with one of the best war films of this generation. This was an absolutely amazing film and I loved every minute of it. I had heard from a few people there was not much character development or story development but I truly did not feel this was the case by any means. Our main protagonists are really well developed, and while you do not see or hear much of any of their background before the war, I don\u2019t think they really wanted you to see that. I think the point was to show us these two soldiers that are in a time crunching situation with the odds stacked against them and no choice but to keep moving forward. I feel like it developed their friendship really well that helps to add a lot of emotion to certain scenes and makes everything feel like there is much more at risk. Some of those scenes did feel abrupt and maybe a bit forced but I think they served a bigger purpose which I appreciated. I never felt like there wasn\u2019t a sense of urgency. These characters are always dealing with something, so the film does a good job of keeping you on your toes. I do suggest that you avoid the trailer for this film if you have been watching it to hype yourself up for it because there is quite a bit that is already shown in the trailer which takes away from some of the tension of certain sequences, but that is not really a critique of the film, just a suggestion to not watch the trailer and if you have- don\u2019t watch it again! Haha. Continuing on, There were so many great shots in this film and the camera angles were both wide and tight to make the atmosphere feel open yet dangerous. I give high applaud to that because that must not be easy to accomplish. The film does a great job of portraying how terrifying war can be and the choice to make this film look as if it is mostly directed in one consecutive shot- was the beat possible choice they could have made. It makes it feel as if you are there in the midst of all the chaos with these characters and I was highly impressed. The only other film I have seen nail this was Birdman (another fantastic film) so it\u2019s great to see another great director giving it a go. Guys, in the end, I absolutely loved 1917. It is a well-made war film that shows not just how bad war can be but how terrifying it can be and it shows appreciation for those who had to go through those things as well. It\u2019s intense, emotional, and gripping, even if at times abrupt. Therefore, I am going to give 1917 4.5/5 STARS ",

If the message is not received in time, 1,600 men including Corporal Blake's brother will be killed.\n\nREVIEW SUMMARY:\nThere is so much in this film to love. Obviously, although it's been done before, the form of directing where it appears to be one continuous shot throughout, really adds to the intensity of the film. The sound editing is done really well and the score is so good except for one scene where it feels like a very misplaced fantasy-like score. There are so many memorable moments in this film, but for me the film gets a bit slow for me. It's understandable as you can't have constant action from beginning to end for a film like this, but it doesn't disregard the fact that it does cause the film to get slightly boring for me at moments. If I was one that could get past those slow moments, this would probably be my favorite film of the year and so if you can really get on board with both the intense and not-so intense moments, you will love this film. The ending really topped off for me as well. A really good film and I definitely recommend this film especially in theaters and if you can, Dolby. 7.9/10.\n\n--------------------------------------BREAKDOWN-------------------------------------------\n\nDIRECTION:\nSam Mendes truly did something special with this film. Going with the one-shot illusion added SO much to this film. You feel part of the battle with the characters. This directing style for a war film really immerses you with the battle. The intense moment become that much more intense and it makes it feel that much more real. There's one moment where it fades to black and then continues right where it left off and continues the rest of the way as one continuous shot and it amazing to feel like your watching a live stream of two soldier's struggle with fear and courage while trying to get a very important message across enemy territory. Bravo on the direction here and I definitely feel Sam Mendes deserves Best Director at the Oscars.\n\nWRITING:\nNormally, I'd go into detail with the writing, however, I feel if I were to get too deep with the writing that I'd be potentially spoiling the movie so I'll leave something short. I think the decisions made with the writing were delivered very good. As I've mentioned, there are intense moments and they are written very well. You don't know when things are coming and that leads to impressive payoff. There was a point during the movie where I thought of a story idea, based off a film like this, but then they literally did what I was thinking so... scratch that I guess.\n\nACTING:\nThe acting in this is phenomenal. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were incredible in this. There was one moment where MacKay was supposed to be crying and it was an impactful moment, however, it wasn't the best as far as a cry goes. Damn, I must sound like a nit-picky b****, but hey it's important in my opinion. When someone cries I want to feel it and I could empathize and understand why he broke down, but I just put myself in that position and it wasn't really because I felt his pain specifically. Anyway, he was still very good and I really enjoyed Dean-Charles Chapman performance. I wouldn't put either performances up for Best Actor this year and that's really just a testament to how stacked that pool is this year. So many amazing performances including these, but I really feel this film shined through the direction. There was an incredible moment that did hit me in the feels at the end of the film with one of the actors and although it was very short, I loved it. I can't really expand on that here.",

Set over less than 24 hours on the Western Front, the harrowing 1917 is both simple in its story and breathtaking in its execution, intimate yet epic. Director Sam Mendes has delivered a completely engrossing survival thriller about two young British soldiers, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), on a perilous mission behind enemy lines. Neither soldier is written to be particularly exceptional upon their introduction; they\u2019re just two of the countless Everyman troops fighting in the First World War. It\u2019s their very ordinariness and almost anonymous nature that lends this duo immediate sympathy and relatability. Blake and Schofield could be anyone, but they\u2019ve been tasked with doing something extraordinary and heroic in the face of relentless danger. The conceit of 1917 is that the whole movie is presented as a single tracking shot. While this approach to moviemaking has been done several times before, Rope and Birdman being the foremost examples, here this feels less like a gimmick and instead leaves you fully immersed in the journey of Blake and Schofield. You feel the danger, bewilderment, and anxiety of their mission every grueling step of the way because you\u2019re right there with them. Sam Mendes, working from a script he co-wrote with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, crafts one ordeal and tension-fraught set-piece after another to put the young protagonists through. In 1917, death can come at you from any space, any location, whether it\u2019s in a claustrophobic German tunnel or a wide-open field. Nowhere is safe. In addition to Mendes\u2019 taut direction, the stunning cinematography by Roger Deakins, stealthy editing by Lee Smith, and exceptional production design by Dennis Gasner all contribute to making the viewer feel like they\u2019re really there on the ground in war-torn France. Visually 1917 showcases action and suspense scenes set in serene fields and fire-ravaged French villages full of lurking dangers. The rustic beauty of the quaint European countryside is frequently juxtaposed against the mangled bodies and smashed machinery of man-made carnage. It\u2019s simultaneously picturesque and grotesque. The awe and precision of the whole one-take approach wouldn\u2019t have as much impact if you didn\u2019t care about the two main characters. Details of Blake and Schofield\u2019s lives before and outside of the war come in bites; the closest thing to an exposition dump comes when they get their mission. After that, they\u2019re literally off and running with the viewer following beside them. Mendes and Wilson-Cairns wisely use restraint in exposition and lean on physical storytelling to allow us to understand what their two main characters are feeling, and 1917 is only strengthened by that. 1917 is an expertly crafted and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride behind enemy lines. Gloriously shot, deftly paced, and striking in its gruesome recreation of the time and place, Sam Mendes\u2019 1917 wisely never loses sight of the smaller, intimate elements in a fast-paced story with immense scale and action. 1917 firmly places the emphasis on what is \u201chuman\u201d in such a dehumanizing environment. It\u2019s one of the best films of the year. ",

First off, I appreciated that the soldiers' families, which are often given too much screen time, were secondary (or even tertiary) to the task at hand. I find most war movies emotionally manipulative and unbearably corny but 1917 said f**k that; give me 2 hours of intense, heart-pounding action in some of the most hauntingly beautiful set-pieces you will ever see in a film. Even in a movie that skipped the emotional manipulation, I STILL got choked up at a few moments because the emotions were earned throughout the course of the film. Despite knowing few details of the titular characters' lives, you become emotionally attached to them throughout their brutally unforgiving journey to save 1600 lives. And by the way, the film was exceptionally brutal, but in an understated, respectful, and haunting way that truly encapsulates the sheer barbarity of World War I. The performances were exceptional and believable. Not for one moment was I taken out of the film, which is key for a war movie. I didn't feel as if I had to suspend my disbelief (or if I did, I did so willingly). Though Parasite was my favorite film of the year, I will put 1917 at a close second. So long as Roger Deakins takes home another Oscar, I will be satisfied. And I would not be upset if Mendes wins the Oscar for this incredible 'one-shot' film. The immersion was immeasurable and I feel that all other war movies pale in comparison to the stunning cinematography and direction of this film. In short, it was a perfect war film.",

            "content": "I do not say this lightly at all. 1917 is a ground-breaking feat for this genre of cinema that will make its mark in the history of filmmaking in years to come. Many accolades and major awards will deservedly go to the grandiose and gripping conveyance, scoring and filming of this story. I could write an absolute essay expressing just how blown away and in love I am with the stunning cinematographic work by Roger Deakins. But what I'd really like to emphasise is just how artistically and seamlessly everything has been so effortlessly captured. So many times while watching 1917, my eyes witnessed a scene that looked so easily filmed yet my brain would acknowledge just how challenging that scene must have been to execute so flawlessly. Incredible! Other than bowling me over, the outstanding cinematography and music score immediately inject a stark realism into the film that permanently remains. Truly, from the minute these young men leave their troop, 1917 is a part of you. Like our protagonists, we have little idea of what's coming their way and when it will happen. My senses were so completely enmeshed by being in the moment, it took me some time to fully appreciate the degree of difficulty and exemplary execution of its classic set-piece sequences. It's very early into the new year, but at least a small handful of these are guaranteed to remain in my cinema highlights by the years end, and beyond. I also felt much more involved with the characters and their plight in this war film compared to most others, partially due to the narrowed character focus. There are many well-known actors in 1917, most notably Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Mark Strong, albeit each with very brief screen time. It might not sound like it, but even this compliments the film greatly. I initially resisted giving 1917 the perfect rating of 5 stars, purely because it didn't pack the emotional punch that a 5 star film ordinarily overwhelms me with. But screw that, 1917 is too bloody perfect to give anything less than the perfect score to! It is a testament to the innovative and inspired vision of Sam Mendes, who sincerely is one of the greatest filmmakers of our time. His latest, 1917 is his finest and is simply unmissable.",

            "content": "Sam Mendes has delivered quite possibly one of his best films to date in this World War One epic he directed, produced and co-wrote. 1917 centres around two soldiers in the British Army, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George McKay). \n\nThe two soldiers are located on the Western Front in France when news comes through the Germans are on the retreat. But Blake is requested to report to General Erinmore (Colin Firth) along with Schofield for an urgent task. A battalion of 1,600 soldiers led by Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) on the front line will be launching an attack on the retreating Germans the following morning. The Lance Corporals have been tasked to make a run across no man's land and deliver an urgent message to Colonel Mackenzie to halt his assault as the Germans have actually led them into a trap and are prepared for their assault with a large army waiting to meet them. Amongst the 1,600 soldiers is Blake's brother, making the mission even more critical for the young recruits to get the message delivered in time. \n\nMendes has collaborated with master cinematographer Roger Deakins for a fourth time (\"Skyfall\", \"Revolutionary Road\", \"Jarhead\"), delivering a unique visual treat for viewers. Deakins utilised long takes between scenes creating the effect that the entire movie was filmed in a single shot with no cuts (the truth being that there were indeed cuts and these were disguised in scenes such as explosions or flashes of light). The impact of Deakin's cinematic craftsmanship is that the audience accompanies Blake and Schofield with a sense of \u2018real time' on their journey to the front line - seamlessly propelled forward from one adventure and dangerous predicament to the next. This immersive effect allows the viewer to be swept into the world of the trenches and the perspective of World War One soldiers \u2013 a story most of the world no longer has the luxury of hearing in person. \n\nWe feel their hesitation with every step forward into abandoned enemy territory, fearing what may lie ahead. We look over the horizon from their line of sight wanting all hidden dangers to become apparent. We feel the claustrophobic, narrow spaces of the dark tunnels and passageways in bunkers and winding trenches that seem to continue for an age. It's a brilliant visual exercise in the appreciation of time and scale and a realisation of a unique aspect of war that is usually only recounted in heroic literature. \n\nThe senses are heightened even further with the delicious lathering of a most gripping score courtesy of the creative genius that is Thomas Newman. Each iteration of the soldiers' journey is swathed in musical purpose that captures the very emotions sought by Mendes and immerses one further into his tale. Newman thoroughly deserves recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination alongside his colleagues in Mendes and Deakins for their respective efforts in this film. \n\nAdding to the brilliance of the film are the excellent cast of supporting performances. Cumberbatch and Firth are joined by Richard Madden (playing Blake's brother Lieutenant Blake), Andrew Scott (as Lieutenant Leslie) and Mark Strong (as Captain Smith). While these supporting roles are all quite minor, their addition provides the reminder of the cruel nature of warfare during such large-scale undertakings. The world does not see individuals in a battalion of soldiers. Soldiers and officers of all levels enter and exit fleetingly. Paths cross. Lives are intertwined yet separated through death and destruction or orders from a distant or even an absent leader. Mendes introduces these supporting characters with a sense of urgency and their impact snatches us away from our otherwise constant concentration on Blake and Schofield. And as quickly as our attention is diverted, it is focussed again on Blake or Schofield as they continue their mission. \n\nAnd yet, through this journey, we discover some depth to the two protagonists. We unearth truths and their back-story to argue against the very notion that there are no individuals in war. We are reminded that there is a story to every individual and their contribution to the defence of their cause really makes their effort the ultimate sacrifice.",

Everything else just doesn't add up to a piece of the true story of WW1. To point out one instance of this, which you should've noticed from the trailers, are their terms of communication. WHERE ARE THE GODDAM PHONES?! Phones were a key element in WW1, allowing soldiers and commanders to\ncommunicate plans from different trenches.

The score was fabulous and added a much needed effect on the overall plot and drama.\n\nDownside: The film was an amazing technical feat. That said, the only downside might be the slow pacing in the beginning of the film, which was due to the one take cinematography. It wasn't a terrible downside because it did add a lot of character background to the film's leads.\n\nOverall the suspense of the movie added with the amazing acting topped off with a dramatic score resulted in an amazing war movie worthy of Oscar gold.",

Among them is \"1917,\" a WWI epic directed by Sam Mendes from his script with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Its big technical gamble is that it is edited to appear as if it were shot all in one take, \"Rope\" (1948)-style, but it would be a shame to boil it down to a gimmick, especially when the gimmick is handled in an artful way, and actually makes the film feel immediate over 100 years after the events it chronicles. British Lance Corporal Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) is informed he must choose a buddy \u2014 lucky Lance Corporal William Schofield (George MacKay) \u2014 and go behind enemy lines and warn a regiment not to attack the Germans, as they would be walking into a deadly trap. To give him inspiration to get the job done, the soldier has been chosen because his brother (Richard Madden) is in the ill-fated regiment. Without a second thought, he departs, dragging his friend through one death-defying situation after another, including a plane crash so realistic it could trigger PTSD. An excellent anti-war war movie, \"1917\" is immersive thanks to its editing, but also thanks to the very human performance by MacKay, whose character is mad as hell that he was chosen, doesn't wanna do it, then spends what could be his final hours desperately trying to get the job done. If this were called \"1942: instead, I would say it was a lock to win Best Picture. As it is, I would bet it is a lock for a much-deserved nomination.",

The fine lead performances of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, combined by the stunning photography of Roger Deakins, the riveting score of Thomas Newman and the expert direction of Sam Mendes, combine to make this truly one of the year's best.

            "content": "We all know what the immediate appeal for 1917 is and that is its bravura gimmick of making the entire two hours appear as if it is one long, unbroken film take. Long tracking shots have famously been used in films before, like Goodfellas and Atonement, and entire movies have been filmed through the illusion of a single take, from Hitchcock's Rope to Russian Ark to Best Picture-winner Birdman. The difference between those one-take movies and 1917 is that none of them were a war movie that takes place primarily outdoors in very real elements. The sheer technical audacity of the feat demands that it be see on the big screen when able. It's like a cinematic magic trick, allowing you to sit in awe at the sheer ambition and technical wizardry of the filmmakers and continue muttering, \"How did they do that?\" When done right, it can reawaken that magical feel of watching something impressively new, but is there any more than a gimmick?\n\nIt's 1917 and two ordinary British soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman, a.k.a. \"Tommen\" from Game of Thrones) and Schofield (George MacKay), are tasked with a life-saving mission. A military unit is walking into a trap, and if they do not deliver this dire message in mere hours, hundreds of men will die, including Blake's older brother. They have only hours before the fateful attack is launched and must traverse into enemy territory that may not be as deserted as they have been lead to believe.\n\nWhatever else you think about 1917, it is worth watching simply to witness the awe-inspiring technical vision from director Sam Mendes (Skyfall, American Beauty). The sheer scope of this movie is overwhelming when it comes to the logistics of being able to keep the camera roaming, which will go from handheld to crane to swooping lines above. It feels alive with that vitality of theater, knowing that if something were to go wrong that everyone would just adjust and move onward. When you see someone tip-toeing along the edge of a bridge, that's them doing so. When you watch someone diving for cover, it's really happening, and Mendes wants you to know. It brings an interesting verit\u00e9 feel to something that must have been planned within an inch of its existence. But was it? Did the actors meet the exact same blocking marks every take? Were the clouds aligned just so each time? I'm willing to credit legendary cinematographer Roger Deakens (Blade Runner 2047) with extra plaudits not just for arranging all the logistics of the busy camerawork but for finding pleasing visual compositions on the spot, using what was available. He deserves all the awards because this movie is nothing but brilliant photography and production design. A segment where we run through the ruins of a French village at night, with German flares providing momentary bursts of visible light above, is astounding. I think about the meticulous precision of the camerawork, the timing of the lighting cues, the practice of the actors and story decision to run in darkness and hide for cover in light, the pursuers giving chase, and it just makes my head hurt from all the daunting coordination. It might be dismissively viewed as a WWII video game and the characters as the avatars we urge onward, and I don't disagree. I found the entire enterprise to be deeply immersive, visceral, and thrilling in its stunning sense of verisimilitude.\n\nHowever, I'll admit, dear reader, that I was growing bored by the first ten minutes or so, and I even admit that this was in some part by design. Given its proximity to being in real time (the trek we are told should take 6 hours) it means early on there is a lot of walking. Before we venture out into No Man's Land, it feels like we're just watching people walk and walk and walk through the lengthy English trenches. It can become a bit repetitive and your mind may wander, but there is a rationale for this from Mendes and company. It communicates what the geography of battle and day-to-day life was like for the soldiers, to go from one supposedly safe section, snaking round and round to the front lines, noting the distance but also, in practical terms, how close life and death were from one another. It's also a recognition of the reality of trench warfare and you can stop and think, \"Wow, the production actually built this entire miles-long trench,\" but then you can just as easily transition to, \"Wow, people really dug in and built these structures back in 1912.\" The long walk serves as the confirmation not just of a top-notch film production but also of the hardened reality of a soldier bogged down in a trench for months. The First Act is essentially them walking to the front line, crossing over into No Man's Land, and approaching the German trench on the other side. On paper, that doesn't sound like too much in the way of story events, but it's our introduction as an audience into the life that these soldiers experienced. Each crater, each corpse strewn on the battlefield, it helps paint a larger picture of the unseen stories leading to this moment. It's a very real equivalent of \"show, don't tell\" storytelling, and the long walk better cements in our minds just how daunting this trial will be, especially since every step after the trench is fraught with danger.\n\nI figured that 1917 was going to be more about its gimmick and that the characters would suffer under the weight of this setup, and it's true that they could be sharper, but 1917 succeeds in ways that I found Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk lacking. By focusing primarily on two characters and hinging success or failure on them alone, the film does a better job of providing me a personal entry point into the larger conflict. I have someone I can follow from the start, and that's not just because the camera is confined to their immediate orbit. About halfway through, the movie makes a turn that really ups the stakes as well as my emotional involvement in a way that I never felt during 2017's Dunkirk, which felt too removed with its interchangeable, faceless characters. With Dunkirk, it was a race against time but this was muddled by its non-linear, time-hopping structure. It's a race against time but you were given three different sets of time that would crash into one another. It was too clever to feel the urgency. With 1917, it's streamlined to the essential (get to point A before X time) and the urgency is alive in every moment. Not only do our characters not know what they'll discover past the German lines, if they deviate too long, they may well arrive too late to stop a doomed attack. I assumed our characters would persevere, but as the film carried on, and the setbacks mounted, I began to doubt. Would this be another Gallipoli scenario of pointless death at the behest of arrogance, stubbornness, and bad information? By the end I didn't know and that gnawing uncertainty provided a tremendous spark of tension.\n\nIt can be episodic, it can feel more like a gimmick than a movie, but 1917 is a prime example of why we go to the movies. We go to be dazzled and transported through the magic and marvels of expert craftsmen and to throw ourselves into the complicated, messy, intriguing world of strangers that we get to cheer for, laugh with, and possibly cry over. The technical accomplishments will be heralded for years and studied long after. It's a technical feat but, thankfully, the movie is more than merely its magic act. The human drama becomes personalized, universal, and engaging. There are several moments meant to breathe, including one gorgeous moment in hiding with a Frenchwoman and a baby that is beautiful in its cross-language connection on a human level. The suspense can be overwhelming and I was rocking back and forth whether or not characters would be caught, seen, or make it out alive, always remembering the stakes of failure. Watching 1917 is like holding your breath for two hours and then exhaling at long last upon the end credits. I feel that there are enough resonating elements that provide substance for the movie to stand on its own merits but it will forever be known for its long, coordinated feature-length tracking shot. Even if that is its lasting legacy, 1917 is still a thrilling and immersive achievement in filmmaking ambition.\n\nNate's Grade: A-",

            "content": "I\u2019ve watched many movies that I love for the narrative story they tell, or the characters they present, or some other traditional factor that makes a movie great. But there are only a select handful of movies that I describe as an \u201cexperience.\u201d These movies suck me into the story to such a degree that I feel like I\u2019m there, enduring the events of the film myself. 1917 is one of those \u201cexperience\u2019 films, and it might be one of the best. Not since Gravity have I been in a theater and felt the need to remind myself to breathe. When the credits started rolling, everyone in the packed preview screening remained seated for several minutes. It wasn\u2019t because we were waiting for an MCU-style end credits scene, but because we were all awed by what we had just witnessed, and couldn\u2019t bear to move. My first comment to the friend who went with me was that I felt exhausted, as if I had been running alongside the characters for 2 hours straight. What has been, and will continue to be talked about the most when it comes to 1917, is the fact that Sam Mendes made the choice to simulate a single-take through the entire film. Perhaps the best compliment I can make is that I stopped seeking out or even caring about where a cut might have been hidden. I was so engrossed in what was happening that the movie-making melted away. I also have to say that I didn\u2019t feel like this was used solely as a gimmick to make the artistic achievement seem more impressive. Not only was the lack of cuts effective for keeping the audience locked in to every moment of the movie, but it was also used to ratchet up the tension. I was awed by the genius shown by Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins as they used the camera to capture beautifully-framed shots, to surprise the audience, and to make a massive sprawling war feel small and intimate. 1917 is one of the rare movies where I\u2019m dying to see behind-the-scenes footage of how it was made. The lead actors are relative unknowns, which works perfectly, because we don\u2019t come in with any baggage and can make no assumptions that they will survive. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay both do an amazing job with some tough physical and emotional acting. I hope we see them recognized in the 2019 awards because they also had the difficulty of getting these massively-long takes just right, which could not have been easy. As I reflect on 1917, I struggle to find anything to complain about. I guess, there was one scene that felt a bit out of place, and it included an odd coincidence. But I liked how that moment played, because it managed to lighten the mood a tiny bit in what is a very heavy film. Honestly, I don\u2019t care what criticisms people will levy against 1917 (and the quantity of critical praise will inevitably lead to someone being disappointed) it delivered in ways I never expected, and is a moment in my life that I will never forget.",

Also the performances are top notch and it is sad that this movie is only getting applauded for it technical achievements and not the astounding performance of its actors George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman who are what gives this movie its heart and soul. I highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters because it is an absolute journey that we as audience members are able to tag along and feel the fear, sadness and adrenaline these characters have to go through.",

Simple, straight-forward war epic nevertheless packs an absolutely devastating wallop, as Mendes and co-screenwriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns construct the film in two real-time passages while also imparting just enough character detail that the viewer becomes totally engrossed in what happens to these two men; enhancing all of this is the extraordinary cinematography of Roger Deakins -- the movie is filmed in such a way that it appears to be one long continuous take, which allows for one breathtaking sequence after another -- there are many highlights in the film, but one that absolutely must be singled out is a sequence set at night in the rubble of a French village, lit only by the burning ruins and flares lighting up the sky -- matched to Thomas Newman's extraordinary score, this sequence had my jaw on the floor. Yet, despite the spectacle on view, the horror and futility of this particular war is always the center of focus, leading to a genuinely heart-wrenching climax. The cast includes many notable Brits in cameo appearances -- Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden -- but it's Chapman and, especially, MacKay who dazzle with their performances. This is definitely one movie you will want to see on the biggest screen possible: go!",

The Germans have set a trap for the English troops and a letter containing instructions to cancel the attack has to be delivered. The movie shows the horrors of war, first hand. This movie makes me want to learn more about WWI, as most of the war movies I've seen are about WWII. Well worth seeing this movie, it's a visual and storytelling masterpiece. My grade: 97%",

In what is presented as a single camera shot from start to finish, we track them through the trenches, across the battle fields, into the river and the forest.... with plenty of drama and suspense. The two actors get the majority of the screen time with other people only popping up from time to time to interact with them, and they do a very good job of holding your interest. I'd say this one is a lock for multiple Oscars and is currently my favorite film of the year by a large margin.",
