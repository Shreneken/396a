    "summary": "In this lauded satire, veteran news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) discovers that he's being put out to pasture, and he's none too happy about it. After threatening to shoot himself on live television, instead he launches into an angry televised rant, which turns out to be a huge ratings boost for the UBS network. This stunt allows ambitious producer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) to develop even more outrageous programming, a concept that she takes to unsettling extremes.",

There are just so many good things to say about the film in every aspect. The script is impeccable and totally deserving of it's Oscar win as well as the actors, all of which were stunning and the first choices of the Director Sidney Lumet and Writer Paddy Chayefsky and it shows. Two of the actors including Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch for their portrayals of Diana Christensen and Howard Beale but the acting all around is on another level with all involved in the film. The way the film flows is always moving and the camera rarely dances around, rather focusing on the actors and scenery and staying fixed using straight cuts to transition and keep the film moving along at a steady pace. The film in places gets very over the top in it's acting and portrayals as well as the dialogue and it just is taken so stone-faced and works in just about every single possible way. You can just tell that creatively and during filming that everything just flowed and everyone complimented one another and put out a stunningly relevant, funny and satirical take on the complicated and fast paced world of television. While there is quite a bit of harsh language it is utilized in such a way that while prevelant has meaning behind it in the character's personalities and personas.",

It tells the story of a fictional TV network and their struggle with poor ratings until one day, Howard Beale (played by the late Peter Finch) goes on a rant that the American audience can enjoy and that's where Diane (played by Faye Dunaway) comes in to exploit on the situation in order for high ratings. What stands out for the film is the acting performances from Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, and William Holden who were all fantastic. Also, the film's writing by Paddy Chayefsky was fantastic as well due to the fact that a certain quote in this film can apply to all the characters and their actions in Network. Overall, Network is a good satirical film but I would also like to point out that this should also be considered an essay film from Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky because it tells the audience that the people behind television networks will literally do anything just for high ratings.",

For one, it did not \"predict\" anything nor was it ahead of its time; the sleaziness of those meandering behind the small screen has always been the talk of the town. There are even a few times where the producers jump into a heap of stereotypes; the problem is not the stereotypes per se, but the fact that they do not exist in reality, while reality is what the movie presumably revolves about. There are also some scenes which turn the thing into a snoozefest, especially that it could do without them. What increases the movie's feasibility however, is the vast knowledge it showcases in countless fields, and the wittiness and diction of the script, conflated with the great direction and the impeccable performances. Really, it is rare to see a film with each and every performance being great on its own. Each cast member is given the time to shine. This level of proficiency was previously confined to theater, but here it is on the big screen, and with facial expressions and body language as an addendum. The Network is a good watch as long as you keep in mind that its plot still makes sense today while concomitantly time has rendered it somewhat irrelevant.",

It can be indulgent and ostentatious in its language use at times, but there's so many thrills for the ears that it doesn't detract from the rest of the piece, which to be fair does always intend to be quite showy yet still smart. And it offers a more human, and even optimistic, story in Max's eventual denouncement of television and the walking representation of it in Diana. He breaks free.

            "content": "I was never a fan of darkly comic themes or subplots but I can  say that this is one such movie that I enjoyed immensely. That's probably because it has one of the greatest screenplays in the history of cinema and it truly makes you think. And stellar performances by Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, and the great William Holden make it riveting. (By the way, the first two got Oscars.) The movie is a cynical satire of  manipulations by the management of a TV network after a down-and-out news anchor, Howard Beale (Finch), goes off his rocker but unexpectedly pulls in viewers with his original viewpoints of the world. In a brilliant speech brilliantly delivered by the CEO (Ned Beatty in an Oscar-nominated role) finally explains to Beale that \"the world is a business\", a truth self-evident today and used to great effect in the \"Terminator \" and \"Alien\" film franchises. Another moment of dark comedy is also a side-splitting classic: the Ecumenical Liberation Army negotiating their reality TV contract with the network. (Strongly reminiscent of Woody Allen's \"Bananas\".) There is only one thing about the movie which I found to a drawback even in a satire - I never knew that female TV executives could be as gorgeous as Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) or use their looks to great effect or have such libido. The gratuitous sex with Max Schumacher (William Holden) together with the clichés could have been safely omitted from the movie without any detriment; in fact, that would have made the movie stronger. But then, Beatrice Straight would not have received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the shortest performance (a little over five minutes) in the history of the Oscars. (Were there really no other nominees that year who impacted a movie more?) In any case, this is a must-see movie; if I can enjoy a dark comedy, so will you.",

Network brilliantly lampoons the objectivity of news media under private ownership, the consumption of entertainment (or the 'boredom alleviation industry'), and between the two, the role of truth and profit. Seeing the series of reactions to Finch's Beale's) breakdown as his traditional, measured voice cracks and takes on an almost evangelical tone as he critiques modern society and its shortcomings is simply great - shock, disbelief, and disgust turning to recognition of a potential revenue stream (ironically in direct opposition to Beale's own mantras), and ultimately to disinterest and active opposition on completely different grounds from where the objections originated. Characters are given the opportunity to preach at hilariously excruciating length about their take on the film's central incident. Warfield and Burghardt are great in their rather small roles, as idealistic, radical revolutionaries that devolve into corporate stooges themselves, a transformation that includes the film's best scene - a contract negotiation that seamlessly combines gunfire and an abundance of corporate language. Much of what the film satirized, particularly global business interests and the devolution of mass entertainment to more base levels, was created with as much foresight as any screenplay ever has been, and would have cemented Chayefsky's reputation if it had been the sole output of his illustrious career.

The news arena is changing and no longer has room for the reporter whose reporting on reputable newsworthy stories anymore. The Network wants shock value news which leads to the bottom line \"ratings\", ratings is king in this new news world, content no longer counts. UBS television network has decided their long-time anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) no longer fits the format they're looking for and fire him within the next two weeks from his longstanding position at the network. He then proceeds to go on live television announcing's leaving but instead he announces he's leaving within the next two weeks, and he's going to kill himself on live television. When he does this on live television the ratings go up and it buys him back his job, his long-time colleague Max Schumacher (William Holden) is concerned for his longtime friend. Each airing Beale says more and more shocking things, while at the same time his personal life is spiraling out of control. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) the head of programming seems to not care about the man but more about the ratings so she allows Beale to speak his anger on live television and in the middle of all of this the two begin having an affair.  He does go back to his wife once he discovers this woman Diana doesn't care about anyone and she does things only for show. \nBeale has gone from being a well-respected anchor and loving husband to his wife to a pawn in big business game. What I got from this movie is executives will do anything for ratings and the people who help them get there are only pieces on the board, if or when the piece becomes of no further value to them, they are no longer needed and therefore disposable by any means necessary. Beale begins softens his message, ratings fall, so he must be replaced but not before they go out with a bang to help booster the \"next thing\"\nThis movie is known for a very famous line came from this movie that Beale ends his show with daily \"We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore.\"  a great movie about how corporate America do not place value on the older worker and they only care about the bottom line.",

Network is brilliant, but it's not very funny in the conventional sense. Those looking for a bellyful of laughs would do better renting something else. This movie has its share of amusing moments, but the comedy is so bleak that it's best appreciated on the intellectual level. I can envision a viewer chuckling grimly and nodding his or her head at some of Network's nastiest barbs; I can't see this movie causing anyone to collapse in a paroxysm of laughter the way This is Spinal Tap does. Network is best enjoyed for what it is -- a blistering social commentary that uses exaggeration to make its point. Network was brought to the screen by a film maker with a tremendous track record, and this was undoubtedly one of his greatest success stories. It earned Sidney Lumet one of his four Best Director Oscar nominations. And in my opinion its his best. ",

            "content": "This is an extremely prescient film that still feels very much like it was made in 1976, which is a great thing. I was initially unsure of how I felt about watching this because it was so revered but I found a surprisingly entertaining but still informative 2 hours that breezed by. The performances were all fantastic, I would have rewarded William Holden instead of Peter Finch with the Academy Award for Best Actor, and Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay was brilliant even rivaling his work on Marty (1955). This is a film that I don't have to recommend to anybody because it gets spoken about so much in today's modern climate but I will try to explain why I, personally, found it to be great.\n\nHoward Beale, Peter Finch, is a news reporter who is two weeks away from being removed from his longtime position as an anchor on the UBS Evening News. He has a breakdown live on air the night after learning about this and threatens to commit suicide the last night he is on air. His friend Max Schumacher, William Holden, intervenes to keep him on air but after ratings become higher due to Beale's new persona the television executives decide to keep him on air. Ambitious producer Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway, introduces a new show The Mao Tse-Tung Hour to the air and begins an affair with Max that leads to him leaving his wife for her. The executives force Beale to change his tune after he rails against an important business decision on air and Christensen plots to allow a terrorist group to murder Beale on-air. \n\nThe most fascinating character in the film is Christensen, she is a woman in a man's world who is more cutthroat than the men around her and her professional ambitions negatively affect her love life. I did not necessarily like the way the film treats her as it appears to think that Max is too good for and the only other female main character in the film is also seen to be desperate to stay with the old and not particularly desirable Max. Dunaway's performance is great as she captures the life of a woman who is completely devoted to her work and will take down any obstacle in her path even if it requires murder. The confidence she possesses when she propositions Max to have an affair is enviable but underneath that confidence is a struggling woman.\n\nThe relationship between Beale and Schumacher is also fascinating as we are told in voiceover that they are \"old friends\" and the difficulty with which Schumacher delivers the news of his friend's firing is devastating. We are meant to see Schumacher as the â~real hero' throughout which doesn't entirely work considering some of the things he does and says through a 21st century lens. Despite this minor criticism both characters are written with a specificity and a touch of disdain from Chayefsky and performed handsomely by Finch and Holden that we can't help but care for these two in the otherwise cruel world of Network.\n\nThis isn't my favorite Sidney Lumet film, that would be 12 Angry Men (1957), but this is definitely one of his best and he uses all of his abilities to pull together an insane story and build a fascinating, surprisingly believable satire. The film is shot simply but your eye is always drawn to the action, even in quieter scenes and he keeps you continuously engaged. I didn't love the long monologues that Beale gives and I found myself tuning out during them but I understand that for a lot of people those are â~genius'. It's great to see someone so capable make a film about an important subject that contains material that may not be the most digestible and yet Lumet makes it entertaining.\n\nI would not consider this to be one of the greatest films of all time, as some people do, but I do think it is a very good film and deserves to be seen by many people. I wrote an essay on Diana Christensen for an English exam and the majority of the film is worthy of that level of analysis. If I could find it in myself to love it I would but as it stands I would call it a very good film with a great Faye Dunaway performance.",

When intrinsicly motivated: news reports the truth. When extrinsicly motivated: news fuses with entrainment and becomes sensationalism.

            "content": "This is the most effective satire film I've ever watched. It's thoroughly devastating, and that's because it doesn't work on one level. While Network's wry humor is very sharp and truly sore, it's the sympathy I had for Howard Beale, Peter Finch's character, that got me. Actually, the movie's obvious flaw is that the aspect that is focused on, which is the political satirical one, is underdeveloped, or let's say that all small changes that happen don't make the story any better, instead, they made the satire less sharp, and made me less interested in the story.\n\nBy contrast, the character of Beale is continuously developed, and it's character arc is painful to witness from the very beginning to the end. However, what really made me engaged despite the semi-hollow main plot are two things:\n\nthe first thing is the intelligent dialogue; it should be listed in top 10 movie dialogues of all-time. It easily can trick us as the plot is very well-developed.\n\nThe second thing is the characters, not only Howard Beale, but almost every character is a three-dimensional one. Specially when I was totally invested in all the characters, and how couldn't I with, maybe, the greatest cast ensemble performing the roles?\nOf course, Peter Finch is great, and balances very well between his moments of wrath, and his moments of psychopathic coldness. But, c'mon, his performance is far cry from De Niro's in Taxi Driver, which is arguably the best performance in film. The performances that standout for me are William Holden's as Max Schumacher, he really deserved to win the Oscar, and Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen, which I think this is her best performance ever even better than her performance in Chinatown , and, fortunately, she took the Oscar for this role as the Best Actress in a Leading Role. Robert Duvall also, and as usual, gave a terrific performance. Needless to say, the entire cast is phenomenal!\n\nI want to say that I love Sidney Lumet direction. He always shot the conversations in his movies in a way that make us feel they actually happen in real life, and 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon are the finest examples. But in the case of Network, there are some scenes that don't need to be shot this fast, they needed a little more focus, a little more dramatic feeling. The result is some scenes that could have been more effective if they were less rushed, also, there are some acting, which is great, that seemed to be over the top. And that's just because the direction, not the acting itself, except one scene in which the acting was really hammy. Also, the ending is rushed, but it's very shocking. With that being said, Lumet established a disturbing atmosphere, that due to it, nothing in this movie would have worked.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed watching this movie that left a bitter taste in mouth, because of nothing but its accuracy which made it very relevant nowadays. And despite all its major flaws, Sidney Lumet made a satirical drama that still one of a kind.\n\n(8/10)",

But in 2017, its scathing cynicism is simply too true to the hypocrisies of the day.\n\nIn the film, broadcasters capitalise on a disturbed man's ingenious rantings and ravings, which quickly become the nation's slice of 'must-see' weekly TV.\n\nBoth on and off the air, Network features some of the greatest speeches ever to grace the silver screen, many of which deconstruct and dissect the mechanics of the modern media, the dark heart of corporate capitalism, or even the inherent pain of a doomed human existence - all 'articulating the popular rage' in the manner of a modern-day politician, or even a super-hip vlogger.\n\nNetwork is quite rightly often credited with predicting the direction of the modern media, and even the rise of reality TV. But there's so much more in this prescient picture that'll leave viewers thinking Sybil the Soothsayer should've been granted a screenwriting credit.",

            "content": "Sensationalism and corporate influence have infiltrated the mainstream media. The old school is being replaced by the new school in a bitter transition, which brings a new set of priorities geared towards ratings and money over integrity and pride. This could describe modern media and the working climate at places like the Washington Post and the New York Times but it's also the premise of 1976's 'Network'. The fact that this movie has aged so well and remains as relevant as ever is a testament to its genius. Network is a commentary on the power of money vs. journalistic integrity as well as the appeal of genuine authenticity to the American people. Peter Finch gives a stellar performance of the man caught in the middle of this struggle, providing some of the most timeless monologues ever seen on film. There's no flashy editing or big budget shots but Network still delivers a punch and stands among the giants of cinema because of its uncomfortable lesson that underneath our occupations and our legacies, we are all still human and thus we are all susceptible to the same temptations which can and will be used against us.\n\nOur story begins near the end of Howard Beale's downward spiral. He is a man at his wit's end, he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore. Beale has worked most of his life in the \"boredom-killing industry\" and has normalized negativity to the masses. Ratings rule all and stories are treated as commodities, far removed from the people affected within them. Howard spares no expense sharing his dismal outlook with the viewers of his show when he declares his intent to commit suicide on live television the following week. This moment marks the point of no return on the journey into this new age of profit over people. The initial response to his announcement is chaotic until the network-savvy Faye Dunaway's Diane Christensen sees a silver lining. The obscure announcement by Beale garnered unheard of attention and ratings soared as a result. Not one to miss a good opportunity, Christensen convinces the powers that be to provide Beale his own re-occurring show with free reign to rant and rave. The freedom provided to Howard is a true hallmark of times passed. Nobody in today's day and age would be given this type of opportunity on live television; only after a period of sophisticated and respected journalism leading up to this point could anybody even fathom such a regretful decision. \n\nDunaway's character is the epitome of the greed we see within corporate media. She seethes emptiness and lacks genuine emotion. She will do anything to anyone to achieve her shallow agenda and further her career. Her lack of humanity is contagious and we are given a glimpse of the consequences to being associated with her - both on a personal scale; through her relationship with Max Schumacher and by extension, the effect it has on his wife, but also on a social scale; through the actions of Howard Beale and by extension, the effect it has on the masses. For the first-time Howard is given the opportunity to break free from his script and speak truth to his viewers. The more he removes himself from the corporate stronghold, the more human he feels yet the more isolated he becomes. It begs the question; is he crazy, or is everyone else? \n\nRecommended For:\n-Fans of \"The Newsroom\"\n-Cinema buffs\n-Conspiracy theorists\n-People who preach about \"fake news\"",

Faye Dunaway is the ruthless, hard-nosed executive who creates the show and will stop at nothing to keep the network ahead in the ratings war. It is possibly one her best roles and you can see that she is simply relishing playing the part.

Millenials, on the other hand, would argue that we are simply doing our best to navigate the aftermath of X's lack of foresight and sustainability planning, while getting smarter all the time as the world's sum of information is at our fingertips.

            "content": "Paddy Chayefsky's brutally reflective diatribe against society, and perhaps unwittingly became a self-fulfilling prophecy.  One of the last great 70s films, with that uncompromising intellectualism and condescension.  Contrary to popular belief, the suicide of Christine Chubbuck didn't inspire the work - Paddy himself saw the future as he toured a network news studio and saw the lack of humanity unfolding.  Sobering, cautionary and raucous in a way that only unmitigated truth can be.\n\nAll I really know about the 1960s and 1970s was that I grew up one generation later than they happened. While everyone was meeting some truly cantankerous characters in the likes of The Graduate (which perfectly embodied the conflict and attraction between two generations of Americans) and the artificial intelligence of HAL, the soulless but suffering computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, I still believe that Howard Beale and UBS were among the truly great screen villains, and not because they were particularly evil, but because they were heartless-and a definitive prophesy (written very tongue in cheek by Paddy Chayefsky) of what the modern American would become in the 2000 era, should artificial TV values continue to dominate the culture. The insane and dying Howard Beale helped to spawn the modern atheist evangelist, disillusioned with everything holy in society, while Diana Christensen foretold the emergence of the secular-opportunist. The only supposedly decent and ethical man in the film, Max Schumacher, was shown to be weak, immoral and irrational in his personal life. Yet, only the sinner was able to point at the greater evil and pronounce the tragedy of humanity. Max's final deconstruction of villainy (his mistress, whose heart he breaks) serves, not as a self-righteous condemnation of what is to come, but a final farewell and fuck-you to a world that had progressed far beyond what was sensible good taste. The offspring of Network, the Mad as Hell generation, not only permeates entertainment today-but modern society who continues to scream outside of Windows and litter Facebook walls.",

The different messages and ideas expressed in this movie are something to really admire. Not many movies cover these topics the way this movie does.\n\nIt's insane to see how greedy and how far these execs will go just to get there ratings up and receive more money in return. Meanwhile, they don't see that Howard has indeed been given the gift of light which is that of the path to Enlightenment. \n\nRobert Duvall brings a whole new definition to what it means to be a charming vicious bastard. Howard's speech was amazing. It's so weird to think how they took what could be a prophet, and make a dollar out of it, exploit it in some manner. That was pretty comical how all the execs were gathered at that one black guys house. I guess they sold out in a sense. \n\nThis is vey rare to say, but this is one of the first times when I hope for something bad to happen. Whether it's Howard blowing his brains out on live television or that one group of fundamentalists getting gunned down during there TV segment. \n\nThis movie has some great lines that I wish I could use in real life when I really need to use them. I really admire the thought, attention to detail, and messages that were conveyed in this movie. The amount of information is staggering. And seeing how different generations of people represent different meanings is interesting to watch. Like how Dunaway's character represents a young generation which has become numb and used to the brutalities of death and war and violence that goes on in the world. I figured that these savage bastards would do what they did to Howard at the end. It's funny how it came back and bit them in the ass. This is a pretty cynical movie, on the inside. Especially with what the narrator said at the end about Howard. Sidney Lumet did a fantastic job at not painting what could be a very dark movie. Instead he made a pretty straight forward movie with a very subtle dark undertone to accompany it. \n\nOverall, the movie is a wonderful salute to the kind of delusional bullshit that goes on within the madness that we call news and the media. This movie has terrific and heart stopping acting. It's phenomenal. Faye Dunaway is exquisite and her character is probably the most interesting, very complex. I feel the need to have to revisit this movie in order to absorb all of the information. Awesome movie!",

The avaricious UBS network bastards who capitalize on his madness, along with a heartless, ambitious programing executive named Diana Christensen, played brilliantly by Faye Dunaway, in her Academy Award winning performance, who cares only about ratings, she builds an entire show around the maniacal newscaster as the \"Mad Prophet of the Airwaves\" who wants all us to become \"Mad as Hell!,\" Beal's show becomes the number one show on television. Chayefsky won a richly deserved Oscar for his amazing screenplay. The entire cast is amazing particularly the late William Holden, who truly delivers a wonderfully dramatic Academy Award nominated performance as Max Schumacher, the head of the news department and Beale's concerned best friend, it is one of the finest performances of Holden's career. Impressive supporting performances by Robert Duvall as Frank Hackett the network hatchet man, Ned Beatty who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his striking turn as Arthur Jensen, the evangelistical chairman of the board of the television network, and Beatrice Straight's powerfully moving Academy Award winning performance, as Holden's embittered wife Louise Schumacher. Innovative cinematography by Owen Roizman, with razor-sharp editing by Alan Heim. This film is more relevant today than when it was originally released, it predicted today's rash of trash television, shock-laden news broadcast and low-brow reality shows. A frighteningly funny American cultural landmark classic. Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Actor: Peter Finch, Best Actress: Faye Dunaway, Best Supporting Actress: Beatrice Straight, Best Screenplay: Paddy Chayefsky. \"Network\" is number 64, on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest films ever made.

            "content": "So you always thought you had what it took to be a network TV star, eh?  You believed in a certain kind of spoiled freedom that could never bring you a bad day?  You thought you had the guts to be a network producer?  You thought you could sling mud and never stop to have a conscience?  When one stops to think where corporate media has gone, one should try to imagine what the players behind the scenes might look like to get a picture of how different the world they live in is from the viewers' playfield; it's the difference between an MLB star and a town softball player.  Sydney Lumet exposes this branch of the ruling class in a film that pits young versus old, freewill versus discipline, exploitation versus morality, capitalism vs. all the other isms.  It exposes the audacity in humanity's struggle for power, as well as the inevitabilities.  \n\nThe first 10 minutes are so bold that they give the sense of being an hour and a half into any other movie; a backsliding old news anchor, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), announces he's going to commit suicide live on national TV after having enough of the world's newfound direction.  From there the phones are ringing, the networks are talking; one of TV's most prominent and respected anchors has gone mad.  But the film viewer is seeing more than what the society in the film sees, and coming from a point of empathy for old-school liberal newsmakers, bombarded by a new generation of anarchic corporate media, we quickly understand why Beale's closest friend, and the head of UBS' news division, Max Schumacher (William Holden), wants to give Beale a chance to rectify before retiring.  Beale's second chance on-air becomes a follow-up to his first spiel, the path of madness catching the eye of a spunky, hot, fresh, young producer from the programming division of CCA-UBS's corporate conglomerate, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway). One night Beale walks on-stage in his pajamas, soaking wet from the rain, and announces on TV that he wants everyone to stick their out a window and yell, \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\"  Max sees and hears the screams of real people responding to Beale, further uneased by his defeat.  Corporate media brainwashing is complete and the machine keeps rolling, having the audacity to snatch a communist party along its path.  Enter the death of news and the birth of sensationalism.  Diana has a plan to exploit Beale's rants and raves for ratings; she's out to please the moneymakers in the corporation.  Beale accepts this opportunity to be a philosophical preacher, getting sucked into a consumer-demand concept that's designed like a late-night TV stage.  Now we watch the fast descent of what Max would consider \"decency\" in media's influence.  \n\nPaddy Chayefsky's script was an intriguing cinematic exploration for Lumet.  Whenever watching the higher classes battling onscreen, it manifests fear and paranoia into its average middle-class viewer, sensing how we are rocked back and fourth by opposing ideologies, such as we see between Max and Diana.  It's this opposites attract love affair which keeps America running.  But in this film, the fighters of common decency are losing, outnumbered by capitalists, and the audience sees and feels their reactions to loss, whether it be Beale screaming like an evangelist preacher or Max successfully seduced into Diana's deceptive sexuality.  Most of the old men are rebellious to characters younger than them, yet at a certain point are revealed susceptible to the poisonous spunk generated from their liberated youthful opponents.  That ever-attractive artistic trait called irony is present.  Beale's character on TV gains viewer popularity by making enemies with the very people empowering him to be there.  Max finds himself \"in love\" with the very woman destroying his career, a woman who hustles him and reveals his corruptible side, that he'd leave his wife of 25 years to be involved with what's destined to only be a crush.  I'm always personally interested to see a 'sleeping with the enemy' love affair, one that's sparked by self-rebelling addiction.  Max is that hero you want to see hold his ground, but he's also a helpless, tempted pawn in Diana's power game.  By the time they're making love, she's already beaten his career, but she herself is attracted to her defeat of him, only temporarily.  This is a film written with absolute search for truth.  \n\nSexuality wins.  Greed wins.  Lumet taps into the real desire and corruption within people, the itch for tasty poisons, and shows why it stains idealisms.  Such is revealed when the communist spokesperson Laureen Hobbs (Marlene Warfield) is faced with a profitable offer from Diana to air a reality show about her cause.  Hobbs tries to hold her ground, but before too long she's complaining to her party superiors about the achievable self-fulfillment over the preached righteousness of collectivity.  Like Hobbs, Max tries unsuccessfully to maintain his ethics, but with Beale bought and sold he's down an ally, having to painfully watch a friend empowered by his delusions of grandeur and drunken loneliness.  And Diana is relentless in her pursuit to suck them all dry, encouraging the idea that Beale is genuinely spiritually imbued.\n\nIts amazing watching this film in the year 2011 and thinking of how concepts discussed in 1976 were prophetic; terms like \"corporate conglomerate\" and \"recession\" were not as popularly used then as they are now, and it shows Chayefsky had an intellectual ability to predict a future we should've taken warning to.  The recession shows powerful people profiting, that a recession could be advantageous, also a concept foreign to the common associations of recession-depression at the time.  Another unique element for this time is conspiracy theory, something much more practiced in today's YouTube generation, but startling to viewers at the time.  Beale is often screaming about such theories, but Lumet doesn't belittle the audience watching the film, as even the modern YouTubers do.  In Lumet's intellectually sound way, he belittles the live audience watching Beale in the film, using a particular shot from behind Beale that blatantly shows stage lights in frame, shaping a flare around Beale's body that suggests a conscious perspective of how a camera and television are such loud, demanding tools of attention, all while hearing him scream that he's a \"liar\" and an \"illusion.\"  If there's a lack of correctness Chayfesky had in predicting this scenario, it's the assumption that Beale's squealing of corporate conspiracies would remotely fluster the corporate execs.  In reality, corporations have had the last laugh on the preachers, creating a mad sense of silliness for their existence while the network stars themselves play into the sly humor; remember, when Universal and NBC were merging under the GE banner, how much Conan O'Brien would reference the merger with a certain sort of common misery about his job?  His humor cleverly spoke to the heart of middle-class America and was cause for lighthearted laughter, effectively downplaying the reality of the power shift.  But when UBS executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is yelling at his fellow UBS team, and the room breaks into verbal battering and finger pointing, we're given a stronger sense of optimism than is present in reality, optimism in the sense that these greedy capitalists may have a fail point.  Yet being that it's a threat driven by the almighty dollar, it remains consistent with the caricatures.  Diana is the voice of reason amongst vampires, reason defined as nailing a coffin to Beale's murdered career; we're being buttered for an elaborate joke about \"killed ratings,\" and poor Beale will have to suffer the joke.  Before this happens, Ned Beatty steps in to deliver the performance of a lifetime as Arthur Jensen, a former salesman turned corporate hypnotist whose manipulation quickly grinds into Beale's trigger points, walking into a rarely accessed executive board room, akin to the gods of Valhalla as Jensen himself points out.  The powerful room is darkened, giving Jensen a spotlight to now speak to Beale as Beale speaks to his audience, a reverse psychology imprinting Beale with a newfound peace for all he's been ranting about.  But turning Beale against his radical ideology turns his audience to another channel, and thus Diana's plan to fix the situation is of ultimate devilry, total lack of humanity, and all around zero business ethics: kill the problem.\n\nPretty much everything we see in Network happens in reality, making this not a mind blowing or life changing film, but confirming feelings of fear and pessimism towards a greed-controlled world and the personal damage it can cause.  Max Shumacher's damage was being obsessed with a woman tied to the capitalist code, his 25 year marriage thus turning to shit, allegorically tying to the backdrop of societal damage and zombified viewers obsessed with envy channeling through airwaves.  Like network and cable television alike, the structure of Chafesky's script is to move from one audacious moment to a further audacious moment, as the evolution of TV has suggested, reminding the audience that these people will stop at nothing.",

Just as soon as the story turns to those who have traded in feeling for success, it's onto globalisation. Just as the story looks to rest on a commentary of societal disenchantment, we're in board rooms being told how economics have displaced humanity. Chayefsky's screenplay provides a cacophony of ideologies, leaping from one to the other before we've had the opportunity to appreciate any of their individual gravities, but somehow it all works. Through all the theses and insights, Chayefsky's socio-political satire is wildly entertaining, a brazenly chaotic rave of thoughts that's as arresting as it is overblown.\n\nBut Chayefsky couldn't have provided such entertainment all on his own. There are two key assistors. The performances which breathe life into the writer's brilliantly conceived characters, and the equally brazen direction of Sidney Lumet.\n \nThe central performance belongs to Faye Dunaway as Diana Christensen, the young, pertinacious head of programming for the fledgling television network UBS. UBS is a whorehouse of a station we're told, a circus show with abysmal ratings that Diana is determined to bring a hit show to. Dunaway's performance is utterly electric, flailing her arms like a caffeinated conductress and igniting every muscle of her face as she posits her outlandish ideas (including bringing on board a group of radical terrorists as the subjects of a new series). Diana's is a desperately lonely existence, the only thing she lives for is a 30 share and a 20 rating, but she is so alarmingly inspired and aroused by success that she doesn't care. The most human thing we see from her is her having sex, but this is only done as a physical means to consummate her pleasure at work. \n\nDiana's bright idea for a hit show comes in the form of the unhinged, long-time news anchor Howard Beale (an explosive Peter Finch). Howard has lost his mind, he was the first on the chopping block amidst the ratings slump which sent him over the edge, but in his farewell speech on air (after previously promising to kill himself during a broadcast), he begins to passionately vent his rage at the hypocrisies and lost state of society, an exercise which rejuvenates his career as an \"Angry Man\" which Diana feels must be exploited. For Diana, the American people need a voice to articulate their sullenness coming out of Watergate, Vietnam and the Depression, and Howard is it. \n\nShe's right too. Howard becomes a sensation, much to the dismay of news division president and best friend to Howard, Max Schumacher (William Holden). Max is the closes thing to a moral compass in the film. He's saddened by the sideshow that the news division has so quickly become under Diana and her belligerent, make-a-buck-first-ask-questions-later boss Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), but he's also drawn to Diana, despite knowing how enclosed her life is. \n\nWilliam Holden, and the sensitive performance of his betrayed wife (played by Beatrice Straight), cut through all the mania and provide the most toned down, human turns in the film, thankfully giving us a chance to catch our breath. These toned down performances are overshadowed however. It would be the riveting Peter Finch who would win an Oscar for his maniacal, eccentric work as the batty Howard, who along with a bellowing performance from Ned Beatty as the conglomerate Arthur Jensen who preaches a \"corporate cosmology\" like he's delivering a Sermon on the Mount, and the fiery Dunaway and Duvall, rule Network with a wild and boisterous iron fist.\n\nEach character is given at least one impassioned monologue, many of them shouted at us with a booming authority. Chayefsky's dialogue is unmatched for intelligence and articulacy, but with all its cycling through unruly preaching it could all so easily have crashed and burned in a smarts flexing pretentiousness if Lumet wasn't so willing to double down. Sidney Lumet's audacity allows Chayefsky's audacity to make sense. The director gives his stage a cartoonish cynicism, where all the excessiveness seems logical. This is why we go along with it all. This is why we never question the fact that millions of people worship a clearly insane Howard Beale as a prophet. It's Lumet that permits Chayefsky's cynicism to be so biting. But the director is also sure to keep the film taut. He doesn't wallow in the monologues and melodrama which he so easily could have; he doesn't allow the screenplay's confidence to spill into arrogance. He miraculously keeps everything as straight as it could be.  \n       \nNetwork is all a bit much. With its fierce performances and net of ideologies, it knowingly bites off more than it can chew and insists on jamming it down its own throat as far it will go. But it is equally entertaining, it is mesmerising and funny and haunting, and I'd rather a film have too much ambition than none at all.   \n\nIf you enjoyed reading this, please head over to https://filmfracas.wordpress.com/ for more.",

Network is a social allegory, satire and black comedy all at once and perhaps one of the sharpest of them all. Robert Duvall and Peter Finch term in powerhouse performances while Dunaway and holden are good in their roles. The film however takes it way too over the top with a phony romance between Dunaway and Holden that even the intended satire becomes a bit too much crazy to perceive as practically possible because a character such as that of Dunaway's cannot exist in a real world no matter how bad it becomes. The dialogues in this film are so crisp and intense that it gives goosebumps. Characters are always under tight verbal confrontations and its a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is about to lost his mind.  He's (1) being sacked from his longtime job as the head anchor of UBS's evening news program, (2) threatened to kill himself on live TV, and, after being asked to publicly apologize for his outburst, (3) calls the world bullshit an irreparable number of times, the censors stunned.  \n\tBut the network, it seems, is perfectly content letting Beale's mental breakdown fly free so long as it spikes their ratings - and, what do you do know?; the public likes watching a man throw his dignity into the trash heap and let go of what's left of a sound mind.  On the first night of his network approved journey into madness, he immediately demands that the citizens of the United States of America stick their heads our their windows, gaze into the cold, cruel night, and scream \"I'M MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\" \n\tHow long Beale can keep up being a borderline insane public figure we don't know - but like the individuals who watch him, likening it to the trash TV they're only so rarely given the opportunity to devour, he could rip his hair out onscreen for all we care.  As long as the popcorn's flowing and the content is one and the same with a trainwreck, uninterrupted entertainment is the first of our worries, a man's loss of stability a distant second.  Execs tell him he's a spokesman for the 99% - a poor excuse for exploitation, if you ask me.\n\tThe best television satire ever made, \"Network\" gains relevance every year so steadily you'd swear screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky was, in actuality, a psychic who could see the direction television would head decades into the future.  Did he know that illusionist David Blaine would later rise to prominence and risk his life in TV specials over and over again for our own enjoyment? Did he know that reality shows of the \"Survivor\" kind would pit vulnerable members of society against one another while placing them in dangerously wild areas of precisely picked jungles? Did he know that such a simple thing as finding love would become a game for the world to trivialize and mock?\n\tNo way in hell is \"Network\" a reflection of reality - it is, instead, a mirror Snow White's evil queen might be okay with if her self-confidence were higher, asking us just how much we sacrifice our morality, our ethical boundaries, for the sake of escapism, and how far entertainment providers are willing to go to fuel the cannibalistic hand that feeds them.  In an Internet era where celebrities are more idealized than ever, where viral posts run amuck without considering humanity in the process, and where viewing human suffering can be a laugh-fest if the setting is right, \"Network\" is possibly even more audacious than it was in 1976.  It deserves a thousand exclamation points following its closing credits, and then some.  Some movies age badly over time - \"Network\" demolishes the notion.\n\tChayefsky, who died tragically in 1981, provides the film with one of the finest screenplays of all time, delivered in several enamoring tour-de-force monologues ambitious in their stature and razor sharp in their structuring and delivery.  The writing is a game of cat-and-mouse, meant to be read as battles of words and linguistically crescendoed exchanges.  He portrays the television industry, here depicted as the fictional Union Broadcasting System branch, as a cutthroat environment where monetary gain is so melodramatically important that even murder wouldn't be out of the equation if higher ratings arrived in return.  The world it asks us to live in, callously lined in self-gain, is almost fantastical in the outrageous ways it scours for power, for financial leadership.  And yet, Chayefsky's writing is so boisterous and so rooted in barely-there reality that we accept the film as non-fiction, even if it has less in common with the real world than a fantasy epic might.  \t\n\tBetter yet, he writes people, not parts, and \"Network\" is fitted with an ensemble so in your face that even the smallest of a character sticks out in the memory (consider that Beatrice Straight, who plays William Holden's wife in the movie, is only on screen for about six minutes and still won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress).  Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), the person behind the spotlighting of Beale's breakdown, is the career woman who prefers the professional to the personal, willing to do anything to assert her dominance in the former; Max Schumacher (William Holden) is a days-past ideologist whose probable golden boy charm has been traded for cynicism in old age.  Howard Beale is the product of a man who put off a mid-life crisis for years because he was too concerned with his job - and now that he's losing it, every regret, every doubt he's ever had about life, is hitting him like a truck.  \n\tThe film is among the finest examples of a mainstream \"acting\" movie, too; its success and interest relies on the actors' handling of Chayefksy's screenplay.  Not cast for their star power but for their memorization abilities and just how convincing they are at selling a long-winded monologue, they do not seem to be playing parts - it is as though they're subjects of an accidental documentary.  Giving one of the finest performances by an actress ever, Dunaway smashingly makes Christensen a woman so keen on furthering her status that a doubt never crosses her mind as to if what she's doing is wrong; Holden, in his final great role, cements his legendary screen persona as something more than just a handsome face with a lot of talent.  And who can forget about Peter Finch, hilariously angry and unstable, as a cinematic connoisseur of the art of the rant?\n\tEverything about \"Network\" is dazzling: its satire is cold and sharp, ruthless and concise.  We often forget that it is headed by Sidney Lumet, a dependable filmmaker whose influence spans decades, whose tight handling of the screenplay and the actors never gives us a chance to breathe.  It is so original that anything even resembling an imitation would seem uncultured.  It leaves you shaking, stunned, and maybe even wanting to watch it all over again, in order to appreciate Chayefsky's verbal luminosity and discover more gems embedded in the dialogue.",

The ideas it puts forth are much bigger than the film itself. It's like if someone actually said something smart during an SNL skit. The ideas are truly profound and too many to count. The central themes are about television culture. How we've all become brainwashed by a simulation of society, but one that doesn't reflects us properly. We've all become numb and we need to scream and get angry to feel again. This theme is mostly represented by Faye Dunaway's character. An overly ambitious \"strong and independent\" career woman who so bought into the idea that such a life is liberating that she sold her humanity and her identity. This criticism extends to everyone, not just women who own a news network. \n\nThe movie isn't as deep as it wants to be, but it's very exciting to watch.

As a modern Lady Macbeth whose \"vaulting ambition... o'erleaps itself,\" Faye Dunaway's character presents us with a specious object lesson about women in positions of power... or maybe the lesson in its not-so-specious form is about power in general and the transient nature of success.  Beatrice Straight, whose screen time is minimal, gives one of the best monologues of the film, in which she speaks for spurned wives everywhere and for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress.  In general, I think this movie is a great big \"shame on you!\" to emerging cultural mores of the seventies.",

            "content": "he Primal Forces of Network\n\nAccording to the Writers Guild of America the greatest screenplay of all time belongs to Casablanca. A sentimental favourite, no doubt, worthy for a handful of catchy one-liners capped off with a convincing dump-the-dame speech. While Bogie plays himself, Bergman, who may have been the most beautiful woman of all time, didn't have much to say. The best moments in Casablanca were, in fact, the silent ones, and without Bogie and Bergie's chemistry, it probably wouldn't have made the top 10.\n\nBest screenplay suggests best story, best plot, best characters and dialogue; best combination of drama, comedy, intrigue, emotional engagement, suspense, social and political relevance; one peppered with casual everydayisms, baited with humour and simmering with intelligence, threatening to release an experiential payload of euphoric proportions; a work that can transcend genre and demographics, build up simultaneously on various levels, plumbed by the weight of it's essential voice, sending out intuitive signals, rippling with perplexing channels and insightful glimpses that are symbolically blended into plain words on paper; all with a properly superb balance of sex, wit, desire, comfort, fear, anger and wisdom in an accelerated narrative leading us to a magnificent crescendo and--fade out--leaving us to wonder. Furthermore, great screenplays serve the motion-picture medium's incomparable ability to effortlessly jump time and space. Casablanca is static and contained, framed and nailed to the wall: a pretty photograph. \n\nDespite the WGA's endorsement, there can only be one candidate good enough to qualify for the all-time best screenplay, and fittingly it goes to the all-time best screenplay writer. Paddy Chayefsy's Network has dazzled us for four decades and counting. The scene where a mob of murderous bank-robbing terrorists who have their own reality TV show bicker over the wording of their contract alone demonstrates we are dealing with a higher grade of pertinent genius. The corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen, a pivotal lesson in global economics, tops it off, leaving all Network's competitors in the dust, burying any climactic speech written before or since, Bogie's famous brush-off farewell included, thus slamming the lid down on anything Casablanca can play. As for ill-fated romances, the doomed alliance between old-school journalism (Holden) seduced and corrupted into severing his ties with his compassionate spouse to hastily shack up with the opportunistic post-modern media wench (Dunaway) is fraught with more complications than anything Casablanca can muster, and it's only one of the sub-plots.\n\nOf course Network is most famous for the \"I'm mad as hell\" rant, which swells from a nuanced and complex story arc demonstrating the rise and fall of an iconic media star. Hell-raising public mischief aside, Howard Beale's profound narrative leads off with a suicidally desperate, washed-up newsman who impulsively hits a nerve, rockets to stardom as a modern-day prophet, then is shaped and sensationalized as an overcooked parody by the media, stigmatized by maniacal Fox-news-like delusions that overtake him until he gets too big for his britches and needs a walloping corporate scolding, causing his starry streak to fizzle out, before getting gunned down by the greedy TV execs who made him, leaving hapless undiscriminating audiences to grasp for the next new thing.\n\nNetwork is inspired writing that doesn't require heart-throbbing movie stars to pull it off. It could have been directed by my illiterate grandmother, shot on VHS in a dingy church basement, performed by eager boy scouts and girl guides, and it would still be the greatest screenplay of all time, one not just for the spectacle of projecting on a giant screen, but for doubling as a giant mirror with just enough sugar-coated satire to swallow the shitty truth about ourselves. Though calling Network a satire is like calling Hamlet a murder mystery. Satire is either spineless and passive-aggressive, or specific and short-lived. Chayefsky's bombastic pronouncements become more exceptional and relevant each passing year.",

Now, while the movie acknowledges other stations such as NBC, ABC and CBS, it focuses on this one particular network- a fictitious TV station called U.B.S.. Max Schumacher (William Holden) is the narrator, and as it starts with an announcement that a long time faithful employee, by the name of Howard Beale played by Albert Finney is going to be fired from his news casts since it has very low ratings in comparison to other news networks. The person who was supposed to break the news to him was his long time friend and producer of the news network is Max.  Once Howard gets informed about his dismissal or his firing from his news post, he decides to speak out his mind on his very last day on the air.  And then once the ratings went up, UBS managers, lead by Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) wanted to milk this for what it's worth by giving Howard Keel his very own syndicated television show. What happens next is a mirror image how networks work, reminiscent of the talk show hosts circuit work between ex-talk show host Jay Leno, Conan O' Brian and David Letterman. It also reminds me how executives are able to dictate the kind of information that is coming out, such as Rupert Murdock who owns Fox News employing well known affiliates to pass out Republican rhetoric- Bill O'Reily is a prime example of this which is paying someone enough money to say and do whatever it wants.\r\n\r\nSome of the things I was wondering about as I was watching it, is whether Howard Keal had a contract with UBS, and what was that like.  And one thing \"Network\" didn't address is that as soon as Keal had his very first show, where was the people who were supposed to dictate on him on what he can and cannot say for viewers are almost completely oblivious what he does off hours. \r\n\r\n3 out of 4 stars",

It is the tale of a TV network that is experiencing a massive financial loss, but thanks to a ranting (potentially insane) lead anchor they find that their news show can be popular enough to save the network. It's just frightening how prescient this film is, as we currently live in a time where news shows must become entertainment shows to maintain viewership. We are bombarded with shows that are dark and push the envelope of decency just to grab eyeballs. There are elements of this film that I believe were meant as satire because they took things to such extremes, but watching it for the first time now it was hard to get any humor out of it. Howard Beale might as well be talking right to me, and it's hard to call him crazy because he is so spot on even in his more depressing rants. As a result I find the movie extremely depressing. But the message it delivers is strong and you can tell that Paddy Chayefsky (the writer) was passionate about the subject matter.\n\nWhat makes Network a truly great film is the combination of 2 key elements that we don't get very often in modern films: Spectacular writing, and perfect casting. The script is so brilliant, there are a ton of long speeches that are chock-full of great insights and witty lines. Every time Howard Beale steps in front of the camera we aren't bombarded by the ramblings of a lunatic, instead we are treated to a legitimate argument that is actually quite reasonable. But he's not the only one with great speeches, it seems more than half the cast gets a moment to let loose with a brilliant nugget of wisdom. Network is infinitely quotable, and contains at least one line that even people who've never seen it will recognize. Of course all this dialogue would never work if those lines weren't coming from such amazing actors. William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall are all 100% awesome. Even Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight get moments of great speechifying. It is awfully rare you are going to find an assemblage of talent this high in quality. Network is one of those films that, after watching it, I would consider a must-see.",

Faye Dunaway stars as the heartless head of the programming department at the Union Broadcasting System. When the head newscaster, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is told by his best friend and division president Max Schumacher (William Holden) that he'll be fired in two years due to lowly ratings after many years of broadcasting on the air. The next night he says on the air that he'll shoot himself on the air, prompting Max to allow Beale a final farewell before leaving for good. His apology turns into a an angry tirade against politics, the economy, and life itself. Beale's diatribes cause an immediate spike in viewers and ratings of the network, and Diana Christensen (Dunaway) convinces her boss (Robert Duvall) to let her develop a new talk show for the crazed Beale.\n\nWhat makes Network so entertaining, but still true as a film is that it takes an absurd situation and turns it into something that seems plausible. The rise and fall of the network's experiment is intoxicating every step of the way, thanks in large part to the superb screenplay by Paddy Chayevsky, who won his third Oscar for this film, and the live-wire performances from the entire cast. The cynical realism of the story makes it just as relevant today as it was in 1976.\n\nPeter Finch steals every scene that he's in (which is a lot, mind you), as does Faye Dunaway, and they both deservedly won Academy Awards for Best Actor and Actress, respectively.  William Holden also brings a worn sophistication to his role and is easily the most sympathetic of all the characters, just trying to find balance in a business where people lose their minds to power, wealth, and fame.",

            "content": "Network is an interesting satire on the power of television networks, and what it means to be successful in the television business. After everything is said and done, ratings triumph over all, and so does money. At the end of the day, whatever sells is what keeps you on the air.\n\nHoward Beale is a news anchor that works for the UBS network. His superiors have planned to fire him. His best friend Max, who also works for the network, is told to give Beale the news. In a bit of a crisis, Beale sits down to do the news show. He doesn't do the news, he tells the truth. He tells everybody why he's going, and that he's planning to kill himself on live television in 2 weeks time. The Network scrambles as they try to assess the disaster, but soon learn that the ratings are going nowhere but up. Beale gets into heavy drinking and day dreaming, and comes back for every shift telling people the truth about life. It's interesting stuff, and more people are tuning in to watch. Since he  is boosting the profile of a falling network, they decide to give Howard his very own show with a live audience. Here, he is free to talk about the false truths of the world, and play the lone prophet for the masses of blind sheep that watch with a vigilant eye. While all this plays out, drama at the station and unfaithful relationships progress, in a story about lies, greed, justice, and exploitation.\n\nI've got a love/hate complex going on with Network right now. After watching, I've found a whole lot of the movie I think is great, but a lot of stuff that felt quite lousy to me. I'm gonna try and give it a proper run down. First off, the character of Howard Beale is what makes Network. The whole movie is not about him, but when the focus is directed to Beale, this movie really hits its high. Peter Finch is so damn good as Beale, providing manic energy for what is an excellent example of monologue acting. He is one of the big components that brings Network to life. There is one of the good things that comes to my mind when I look back on the film.\n\nOne of my bigger criticisms, which I might be alone on, is that Network can play out slow and dull, at times, while suffering from a whole lot of over acting. It's basically a two hour yelling marathon. It can be good, but annoying at times too. Howard Beale is an exception though, just because it's the nature of his character. Everybody else turns in solid performances, but a little too hard tried. Speaking of hard tried, the love story between Network employees Max and Diana took up too much time. I wanted more focus on what was going on with the Network's problems, and Howard Beale's show. The mish-mash of the plots made it feel a tad convoluted. Enough negative jabs, there are some positive things about Network that make this a solid movie.\n\nFirst off, I love the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, even if the movie is nearly 40 years old, but it fits so well with the style and the concept of the movie. I didn't feel like it was a punch it the gut, which some people thought, I thought it was a surprising conclusion. This reminds me about the film's style. It's dramatic but, features a lot more jokes than I thought. Just ten minutes in, I realized Network is supposed to be a satire, and a good one at that. The biggest component that makes it work is the amazing writing. Network features such fresh, sharp dialogue, that the screenplay pretty much raises the whole movie up to a whole new level. The writing and dialogue is so good you could listen to this shit on a tape and it would still prove entertaining. It really is the strong point of a film that left me loving it but questioning and criticizing it at the same time.\n\nNetwork can be slow and over acted, but features an amazing performance by Peter Finch, great writing, and the self referential satirical edge that it's so well known for.",

He is being let go so that the network can try to attract a younger audience.  When friend and executive Max Schumacher (William Holden) delievers the new, Beale goes into a tailspin.\r\n\r\nThe broadcast before his last Beale announces on live on air that the next night for his last show, he is going to kill himself on air.

The fact that they were able to capture what the situation is today way back in 1976 is truly amazing. On the negative, it was not very funny. It was occassionally funny, but nothing worth calling this one a comedy at all. In addition, it was honestly a bit boring. I kept checking the time because the story just never really grabbed me.

The story is about a news anchor , Max Schumacher (William Holden)who goes crazy after hearing that he will be fired in two weeks due to low ratings. This triggers two episodes of him becoming enraged and throwing a fit on national television. In the first, he says that he will commit suicide and in the second he criticizes television , and Network, his television production company. This gets his ratings through the roof and the top executives especially Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) interested. I will not spoil the rest since this film has one of the greatest plots and scripts in the history of film. Every single line is quotable due to Paddy Chayefsky's wonderful screenwriting talents. The actors are all completely invested in their performances especially Faye Dunaway who simply shocks you. I was disappointed in Robert Duvall who plays Frank Hackett, the big boss, since his performance appears mediocre compared to his fellow cast member,but is still amazing. The cinematography is not really the highlight of the film, but it only adds to the reason why this is a perfect movie. The direction, although overshadowed by the script, is ideal with Sidney Lemut in the driver's seat. The film's humor is almost universally hilarious. I think its one of the funniest drama's up there with \"Fargo.\" The critical message about society, its addiction to television, its escapism through other people's troubles, and the heartless studio executives is even more resonating today. I only know a few films that balance male and female characters evenly, that have quotable dialogue, that are laugh-out-loud funny, that have perfect performances, that have intriguing plots, that have wonderful cinematography, and on top of all of that, have a strong message. \"Network\" is the greatest satire I have ever seen.",

Perché l'unica verità che conoscete è quella che ricevete alla TV! Attualmente, c'è da noi un'intera generazione che non ha mai saputo niente che non fosse trasmesso alla TV. La TV è la loro Bibbia, la suprema rivelazione. La TV può creare o distruggere presidenti, papi, primi ministri. La TV è la più spaventosa, maledettissima forza di questo mondo senza Dio, e poveri noi, se cadesse nelle mani degli uomini sbagliati [...], perchè questa società è ora nelle mani della CCA, e quando una delle più grandi corporazioni del mondo controlla la più efficente macchina per una propaganda fasulla e vuota, io non so quale altre cazzate verranno spacciate per verità qui...\"\r\n\r\nQueste sono le parole di Howard Beale, anchorman che dopo aver annunciato il suo suicidio in diretta, convinto di essere un mandante di Dio, viene letteralmente strumentalizzato da uno dei più potenti canali televisivi statunitensi per uno show personale in cui può dichiarare apertamente tutte le sue opinioni sulla corrotta e capitalistica società americana. Ecco che viene segnato l'inizio di una nuova epoca del mondo della comunicazione, quella che vede la nascita della TV trash, della controinformazione e dei primi programmi quali si pongono in antitesi con la cultura e le istituzioni. Ma la prospettiva della realtà può cambiare radicalmete a seconda da chi tiene le mani sul timone. Qualsiasi tesi falsa potrebbe diventare veritiera, o il contrario. La televisione permette questo ed altro nel fatidico periodo delle prime emittenti private. Quinto Potere (il cui titolo ad un primo sguardo suona inflazionistico visto che in Italia si battezza dichiaratamente come sequel di Citizen Kane..) è una satira funesta sul business massmediatico, ma va ben oltre la critica sociale che vuole esporre con il suo superlativo traforo introspettivo dei personaggi (da Finch alla Dunaway fino a Duvall e Beatty, le performance sono eccezionali e sostenute da dialoghi squisitamente sopraffini); è una sorta di rassegnazione al nuovo sistema, in cui il giudizio concuslivo viene concesso al cronista meglio sorretto dalla struttura di divulgazione più potente. Lo scalpore che una notizia può suscitare sul pubblico questa volta deve assumere delle connotazioni effettistiche/provocatorie spiazzanti affinchè riesca a concentrare su di sé l'attenzione della più grossa fetta di share. Pena della malriuscita del format? La Morte!! Quella dell'individuo in primis, quella del pluralismo e dell'erudizione svincolata dal battage promozionale via etere a seguire. Ma forse è questo che tiene tutto impiedi, perchè le persone credono a quello che vogliono, e ciò comporta sempre uno stimolo per guardare al futuro. La nuova tecnica vincente per trascinare le masse è quella del pianificazione neurolinguistica, quale incoraggia l'uomo a riformattare la mente ed eseguire tutto ciò che si vede in quella scatoletta magica...\r\n\r\n\"Voi fate tutto quello che la tv vi dice: vi vestite come in tv, mangiate come in tv, tirate su i bambini come in tv, persino pensate come in tv.

Strong performances, memorable scenes and arguably still as relevant today as it was back then? \n\nNews presenter Howard Beale has just been given the sack from the TV station that he has given 25 years' service. This is partly due to the stations poor ratings and a change in management at the executive level. During his next slot he announces that he is to commit suicide live on air. This results in a rise in ratings. As a part of the changes from up on high the News dept is to be brought into line with the rest of the organisation by making them more accountable financially. This irks News chief Max Schumacher who allows Howard back on air by way of revenge. Beale then proceeds to let fly a rant about \"No more Bull\". This outburst leads to an even bigger rise in ratings and head of programming Diana Christensen spots an opportunity that could be exploited for the benefit of the station. The execs are persuaded by the ratings (and Christensen) to continue to give Beale airtime where he goes on to give possibly one of the greatest speeches in cinema history with the now infamous \"Mad as hell\" scene. This leads onto Beale being granted further slots and attaining almost evangelical status. Running alongside this are various subplots including the rising influence of the oil nations over the West, the selling out of political ideology for financial gain and the birth of the career minded woman (albeit at the expense of personal happiness). What a marvellous, thought provoking film this is, whilst Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch are the stand out performances there is not a bad turn from anybody. \n\nThe story is gripping and involving and I have my doubts if anything portrayed here is any different today. As well as the political aspects it signifies the emergence of the independently minded career woman. Be warned that this aspect is not painted in a very positive light but few of the subjects tackled here are in all honesty and this is where the film has got its cynical tag from. If this film is food for thought then it is the all you can eat buffet at the Oxo Tower Restaurant in London.",

There were some great movies in the 70's such as ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, STAR WARS, JAWS, TAXI DRIVER, THE GODFATHER PART 1, PART 2, APOCALYPSE NOW,THE FRENCH CONNECTION,CHINATOWN, THE EXORCIST, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and much much more. Those films I just mentioned have been celebrated in film for years and years. But there is also one film i forgot to mention that deserved to be in that elite list.It's a film that's been celebrated for decades but has been forgotten recently. It was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning four. The film is in AFI's Top 100 and it's in IMDB's top 250. It's been mentioned in Aaron Sorkin's speech for winning his Oscar and it's George Clooney's favorite movie of all time.With this crazy of a reputation, does it truly live up to all the hype and excitement about the movie? Is it really the greatest film with the most amazing acting ever done in cinema ever? Or is it a plain, political satire which is trying to hard to be an important film? After watching the movie, I'm glad to say it's not the second description.\r\n\r\n I think the best part about Network is the script. The dialogue in this films is brilliant. Although most of it is business talk, Network's dialogue is interesting and it keeps you engaged throughout the entire film. Plus it has one of the most memorable quotes in film history, \"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\". The acting is great and Sidney Lumet's take is very subtle and careful in directing this film. He doesnt keep you engaged in the movie with crazy music and out of this world cinematography. He lets the dialogue and the actors take the scene, almost like a play, and it comes out beautifully. The film is a metaphor on media and how it is corrupt and that people dont know what they want in televison (or anything for that matter). People are interested in crazy stupid things that they have nothing to do with when it comes to television. This is more relevant in modern times really, with all the reality TV and dumb news networks AKA Fox News and CNBC. Its just a matter of time before things in this film actually start happening in reality. Plus the film symbolizes religion and how TV can end up making us beleive in what they tell us just like how we believe in things from what religion has told us (there is an amazing scene where i think a a man is supposed to be Playing God and another man is playing a prophet). Media is corrupt and what goes on behind it is crazy enough that people might even get hurt, and thats what Newtork is about: the craziness of American media and the greed behind it. All this makes Network one of my favorite films of all time.\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Yes, it will entertain everyone, from TV lovers to movie lovers.",

Naturally, Beale doesn't go through with it -- but he does begin rambling about the horrible state of the world in general and television in particular. He concludes his tirade by admonishing his viewers to \"Go to the window and shout as loud as you can: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!'\" With that, Howard Beale becomes the hottest TV personality in America, and Diana becomes the network's fair-haired girl.

            "content": "Network caught me as the first film for an Australian Actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for British born-Australian Actor Peter Finch, which he won over Sylvester Stallone for Rocky.\n\nNetwork is a film with a very original concept, because it's one of the earlier films which handles the concept of TV studios doing anything on the quest for ratings. As the 1970's was largely the beginning of this, Network serves as a timely film which explains much of what was going on during that decade. It looks into how the entertainment industry will commercialize literally anything to be the number one channel on TV and so just how desperate the corporate world of entertainment is for popularity. In a satirical manner, the film examines the nature behind TV studios. And Paddy Chayefsky proves through the intelligent dialogue and real truth of his screenplay that he knows just how the entertainment industry functions.\nThe screenplay in Network is very original and intelligent since it deals with the painstaking nature of commercialism in the 1970's which is as valid today as it was then, and it provides a lot of strong material for the characters to work with, and it gives a strong setup to the film with many characters of interest. Most of the story is interesting, even though the pace of the film detracts in the second half and the story loses its momentum.\nThe first half of Network is thoroughly interesting and it explores a lot of concepts fresh to the cinematic world, so it's easy to look back at the film as a nostalgia piece, and it's all very well filmed and had a somewhat tense atmosphere thanks to the dedication of the cast. \nAnd it's easy to learn from Network, and many of its dramatic elements are intelligent as well as there being a lot of clever satire in the story which provides a laugh here and there, particularly in the iconic scene where Howard Beale encourages people everywhere to stick their heads out a window and shout \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\".\nBut the ending didn't make sense in my opinion. I thought that by the end of the film, it was too satirical for its own good and had run out sense, descending into a senseless joke to close everything down. For an extended period of time, Network can be seen as a legitimate satire but in its final act it descends into one last joke. If it was consistently focused moreso on comedic elements like the satirical masterpiece Dr. Strange love or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb then the ending would have been more appropriate, but it feels instead like screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had the same sense as the network heads at UBS and decided to take a concept and make it memorable without considering how that could be inappropriate. If he does this for satirical purposes, it is too satirical for the good of the film. \nMuch of the latter half of Network fails to match up to the quality of its former half, bevy are the first part of Network presents many high-concept story elements while the second part loses its focus on exploring them all evenly, focusing more on the relationship between Diana Christensen and Max Schumacher. While this is interesting, it doesn't have the same interesting qualities as Howard Beale's story which ends up characterising him as more of a supporting character than a main one, when though the Oscar that went to Peter Finch's performance in the role was for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Director Sidney Lumet isn't at his best in Network because he fails to balance things out in the second half of the film, so the momentum decreases and I found that much of the time I was just waiting in a state of boredom while actors came and went on screen but my sense of entertainment simply went. Network decreases in quality in the second half and loses a real sense of direction. Sidney Lumet fails to hold things together in Network, and so at times it's rather scattershot.\nBut the great talents of Network are undeniable and all the best come from the efforts of the largely talented cast.\nPeter Finch's lead performance is unforgettable. His gripping tenacity over the insanity of his character Howard Beale is out of place in Network, but although his character is deemed a rambling lunatic having a mental breakdown, he is the most sane character in the film. Howard Beale is the one character in Network who truly tells it like it is, being honest about the dark nature of the world and the sad life he has been stuck with. He is the most same of all the main characters in Network, and the irony behind that is fairly hilarious. Peter Finch's over-the-top effort is perfect because it never becomes excessive but is fierce and strong enough to mercilessly dominate the attention of viewers, and so of all the characters that Network has lined up, Howard Beale is the most memorable. Peter Finch's finest hour is in Network, and it his sad that he didn't live to claim the Academy Award that he won for Best Actor in a leading role.\nFaye Dunaway's performance is clearly one of, if not her absolute best performance in Network. In Network she is put in the challenging role of portraying Diana Christensen, the network head on a merciless quest for ratings. And therefore her character is the root of all the elements that Network attempts to satirize. And thanks to the relentless passion she puts into her performance, it feels truly genuine and immensely powerful. Faye Dunaway breathes so much life into her character and gives Diana Christensen the strength she needs to come off as a convincing female authority figure whose passion for her job matches nothing else in her life, and it is arguably her finest hour.\nWilliam Holden's performance practically matches up to Peter Finch's in Network. Although his character is significantly less notable than Howard Beale, anybody who appreciates the acting talents of William Holden can rejoice at the sight of one of the finest performances of his career in Network, and the final performance he gave to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In Network he proves that his talents as an actor have grown with him as he has aged, and he makes an amiable lead who shares a fine chemistry with Faye Dunaway.\nIt's interesting to see William Holden and Faye Dunaway engage onscreen in Network because while William Holden's character Max Schumacher has the wisdom of age and is appealing to Faye Dunaway's Diana Christensen, she is the one with the power at the news station since she has a high level job. So when the two characters share a conversation over dinner there is no way to actually dictate which figure is a stronger one in the relationship, and as they talk there is a really interesting chemistry that emits from what goes on between. It is simple yet it is smart, and it makes Network into an interesting examination of human relationships among other things.\nRobert Duvall's performance is a mighty powerful one, but from an actor of his talent you could expect no less from him. Whenever he is on screen he makes the effort to attempt to dominate it, and much of the time he is successful. His fierce combination of a dominant physicality, and tense facial gestures combined with his swift and sharp manner of projecting his words so that as well as reaching the other characters they essentially strike them. Robert Duvallâ(TM)s performance is surely deserving of an Academy Award nomination, and the fact that he didn')t get one is not right. Robert Duvall does an excellent job in Network.\nBeatrice Straight makes a powerful impact in her screentime which only equals up to 5 minutes and 40 seconds. Even though her character isn't the most key to the story and her only reason purpose is to characterise Max Schumacher, her fierce power in delivering the drama through her words is just immaculate. She makes a hell of an impact in such a small time on screen, so itâ(TM)s really not surprising that she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She shows off what her true talents as an actress are, and she's easy to remember for her performance in Network.\nNed Beatty's supporting performance is a strong one too and Conchata Ferrell also does a good job in her small appearance thanks simply to her dedicated line delivery.\n\nSo while Network is rather scattered and lacking a sufficient final act, the acting in it is brilliant and the satire is very clever.",

Almost 30 years after it was made, it is even more relevant.  The screenwriter, Paddy Chayefsky is responsible for a brilliant piece of writing.  I got actual chills down my spine when the chairman of CCA industries (Ned Beatty), who owns the network, calls Howard Beal (Peter Finch) into the boardroom and reads a little reality to him:  there are no more countries, there is no democracy, it's only IBM, ITT, Exxon. Can anyone say \"Citizens United?\" The subsequent drop in ratings when Howard preaches this on his tv show is so scary. Even scarier is the radical group who co-opts their ideals for subsidiary rights and distribution rights.  Hello reality television.  We can't talk about society being responsible for all the bad things that happen to us, because guess what?  We be society.",

This is a fine satire that boasts a very strong cast of talented actors. Lumet always crafts a solid picture and he pulls through yet again with this follow-up to his highly engaging film, Dog Day Afternoon. Lumet always seems to direct films that have engrossing plotlines that just grabs your attention, and this is a powerful satirical drama that evokes every quality of Sidney Lumet's unique filmmaking.  The film's high points are in its acting, and the cast that Lumet has assembled here, is really one of a kind. Several actors here give standout performances that give Network a much more intense viewing experience, one that you simply can't turn away from. The script is very solid as well and well layered to keep you engaged from start to finish.  One thing that I love about Lumet's work is his knack to tell a great story using the simplest ideas. In turn, he is able to create picture that are far better than most, and that's why he is one of cinema's greatest artists. Fans of his will surely enjoy this powerful, satirical work that blends effective drama, and dark humor into a smartly written script. Aided by a memorable cast that should delight the most demanding cinema buff, Network is a standout picture that is a must see. With every film that Lumet has made, he would craft something totally different, and reinvent the cinematic medium. Network is a flawless picture that is among the most standout work of the 1970's and solidified Sidney Lumet's reputation as a one of a kind filmmaker.  This is a film that took risks and pushed the envelope and explores media sensationalism in a very interesting way. If you want a well acted picture, with a great plot, then give Network a shot.",

A news castor who is pressed by hard luck. He looses his job, rants out the words \"Bullshit!\", is a worn out alchoholic, and a man who goes stark raving mad on live TV. In a way, Finch's character is like a signal into where American media is heading towards years from now or at that time 1976. This is a great movie and while it's satrical, I didn't really laugh. I cringed because \"Network\" is telling the truth ten fold. My fav scenes would have to be the intimate scenes between Holden and Dunaway. First they're seen together, journey on this intriguing love affair, they're both seen as happy as ever, and finally a poignant destruction during their short lived relationship. As their relationship turns sour so does the UBS executives and their low ratings. In the picture's shocking closing segment, I was left with a hammerblowing experience. I guess it just goes to show that American TV is just in it for the big dollars and big deals.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Lumet's DVD commentary to the picture is interesting to listen. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Considering this film was made in 1976, it sure was prophetic about the future. A biting satire on the world of TV, ratings, consumerism, and news as entertainment, Sidney Lumet masterfully directs an all-star cast.  This fantastic story of television extremism doesn't seem nearly as implausible today as it might have 36yrs ago on it's initial release, and that's scary to me, so I can only imagine what people who saw it when it first came out must think. A fantastic performance from Peter Finch as Howard Beale, an old anchorman who's to be put out to pasture because of a network shakeup, until he does the unthinkable on-air, and actually ends up resurrecting his career and soaring to new heights. This performance was the first posthumous winner for Best Actor in 1977, and it's well deserved. William Holden is just as strong, as Howard's friend and News division executive who serves as the closest thing to a voice of reason in the film.  This is an immoral, horrible world of network television ratings-chasers who haven't sold their souls to the devil, but  in fact, were never born with souls in the first place. Holden was rewarded with a well-deserved Best Actor nod, losing to his castmate Finch.  Faye Dunaway plays Diana, the representation of the new generation of television people, who, along with Robert Duvall (as the bottom-line, corporate-ladder climbing executive) are willing to do anything to increase ratings, ad-revenue and advance their own careers.  If this movie came out today, it wouldn't be considered shocking at all; and that must be a sad state of affairs to see how much of what was predicted in Paddy Chayevsky's Oscar-winning Screenplay came to be true. A powerful film, which may be even more important today than it was 36 years ago. A must-see.",

Further  the screenplay and the acting are just perfect  and only some development in  the story (especially about the ecumenical gang))and a few transitions seem at time exaggerated.To add upon all that the sarcastic dark and surprisingly light but sharp humor in contrast to the tragic of the story is perfectly balanced and the viewer laugh as much as he is fascinated entertained and thinking about all the meaning surrounded this movie.

It is no surprise that this film won four Oscars with its eloquent script, unique characters, and an impressive cast to bring these two things to life.  The heart of this film is its series of genius monologues that are contextually tied together by greedy network executives and a man who is losing his mind.  Peter Finch's Oscar was a no-brainer as he delivers his emotional \"Mad as Hell\" newscasts with the charisma of a television preacher to a cheering audience as he faints.  I would tell you to just look these monologues up on youtube, but the rest of the film is so good that it wouldn't be right to take these rants out of their context.  Another great emotional outburst comes from Beatrice Straight in her Oscar-winning role as she calls out her cheating husband.  She did not have an enormous role (less than 6 minutes of screen time), but her moment of movie magic obviously left an impression.  Faye Dunaway is as lovely as ever, showing both her sweet side and her aggressive side.  The crazy thing is that I just mentioned three actors that won Oscars for this film, and that still leaves William Holden and Ned Beatty who were nominated and did not win.  And even crazier is that Robert Duvall gave an incredible performance and wasn't even one of the five nominees for Best Actor/Actress!  All of these actors put on a clinic of how to create a memorable performance, but some of this credit also belongs to the Oscar-winning script by Paddy Chayevsky.  The dialogue shifts between humor and drama, but its true shining moments are contained in the monologues by Finch and the emotional outbursts by many of the other characters.  It has a fantastic pace that builds and evolves its characters until the shocking, perfectly written ending.  \"Network\" may be overlooked by many because it did not win an Oscar for Best Picture, but this film is the complete package and once you can get past the language and sexual content, it will make you rethink the power of the network executives with characters that you will never forget.",

I am sure everyone must have had similar thoughts when watching one news story or the other these days but I didn't realize this had started way back then to even make a satire of a feature film.\r\nHoward Beale, a legendary news anchor who has donned the seat for a certain network for a few decades has a mental meltdown on live television after knowing that his show is going to get canceled due to poor ratings. Diana Christensen, an ambitious and dynamic executive with a pragmatic view on morals looks at this disastrous incident in a positive way. She starts to campaign, lobby, manipulate and seduce her way to get this show going all the while paying little heed to the deteriorating mental condition of Howard.\r\nStarts with a bang and that bang propels the movie for quite a bit helped by a standout performance from Faye Dunaway wimps out in the last leg as it loses steam by the end in comparison to the pace set rest of the movie. For most part, the movie has a very practical point of view on each subject it treads on.\r\nOverall, the performances are terrific and the master of screenplay Sidney Lumet had things under control. Only problem is the script tries to wander a bit to venture partially into other subjects which does not have sufficient time or content.",

L'histoire était bonne, voire même un peu entrainante, certes, mais on se perdait parfois un peu dans de mauvaises directions.\n\nToutefois, dès que les trente dernières minutes du film approchent, on meurt. Oui, tout simplement, on meurt. Parce que les textes sont tellement si puissants, ils regorgent tellement de vérité que c'en est blessant pour tout le monde, et d'autant plus le capitalisme. Network, c'est l'illustration d'un des principes fondamental du capitalisme; soit la mort de l'individu aux dépens de la société.\n\nJe vous le jure... C'est bouleversant.\n\nD'ailleurs, une scène complète m'a entièrement fasciné tellement le texte était beaucoup trop incroyable. Si bien... Que j'ai pris la peine de la retranscrire au complet. Croyez-moi, c'est devenu une de mes citations préférés. Prenez la peine de le lire, ça vaut la peine. C'est en fait le discours d'un capitaliste convaincu qui veut convaincre un présentateur télé aux tendances communistes de l'efficacité du capitalisme. Je vous le jure, ça me donnait presque le goût d'aimer le capitalisme.\n\nYou are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations, there are no peoples! There are no Russians! There are no Arabs! There are no Third Worlds! There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems. One vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-variate... multinational dominion of dollars. Petrol dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars. Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels! It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today! That is the atomic and subatomatic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature! And you will atone! Am I getting it through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments... just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime. And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality!",

In \"Strangelove\" the bogeyman was the nuclear arms race, and in \"Network\" it is the influence of big corporations (specifically media corporations) in society.  These are legitimate fears, of course, but for dramatic and comedic impact they are taken to their most extreme conclusions in these two great comedies.  Like many comedies \"Network\" sometimes finds humor in familiar situations and other times in exaggerations and parodies.  Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway are given the freedom to take their characters, or caricatures, all the way to 11, and they are able to do so without ever merely \"acting.\"  They embody unbelievable personalities as though they have the depths and nuances of Tom Hagens and Evelyn Mulwrays.  They say ludicrous things without ever pausing for the laughs, because of course the characters don't realize how incredibly, darkly funny it all is.  In addition to the brilliant screenplay that jumps back and forth between sober stockholder meetings and the manic rants of an unstable TV populist, Duvall and Dunaway are two of the biggest reasons why \"Network\" it not only funny but also a little unsettling.  We're not quite sure how much of it to take seriously and how much is cleverly-staged absurdity.  For example, the movie's depiction of a sensationalistic, demographics-obsessed media complex seems pretty spot on, but the fluidity with which communists turn into capitalists and capitalists into cosmic nihilists is, while clever, not exactly true-to-life.  \"Dr. Strangelove\" struck a similar balance, and benefited from a similarly superb cast and script.  In that film, President Muffley was the comforting if impotent moral center, and in this movie he has two counterparts: William Holden's Max Schumacher, an elder statesman of the news business, and a disembodied narrator who is heard both infrequently and too often.  The narrator is entirely unnecessary, and truth be told Schumacher gets a little too much screentime, slowing the proceedings with one too many sermons.  Muffley never preached, he just watched in horror along with the audience.",

But I can understand that Network at least Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 satire of the television industry comes from a sincerely outraged place. See around that time there was a highly publicized scandal when a female news anchor shot herself in front of thousands of viewers in Florida being pushed to her emotional limits while suffering from depression by her relentless executives and bosses at the news network. Chayefsky saw this as the ultimate tragic consequence of an industry that obsessively chased ratings over quality and even the well being of the employees and other people responsible for making it. And so Chayefsky wrote his biting indictment of the industry and one of the darkest comedies of its day a project so controversial in subject it took almost two years to get picked up and even than only when acclaimed filmmaker Sidney Lumet attached himself to the project with some well known stars of the day. How does it hold up? Does it work as a scathing satire of its day or even god forbid of this day still? Let's take a look that's mad as hell and than we won't take it anymore.\r\n\r\nThough many people incorrectly assume the film is about the famous irate anchorman at its center in truth I believe the closest thing this shambling film has to a main character is Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway at her energetic best portraying a character with vitality, venom and even a bit of vulnerability) the head of fictional UBS is Programming Department who is obsessed with harnessing the power of the counterculture in a bitter post-Watergate America into the networks programs to turn around its poor ratings in the past. Christensen engages in a heated romance with Max Schumacher (William Holden, god damn this is a sad fucking performance) the head of the news division who is a married man half her age and is running into problems of his own as his old friend and anchorman Howard Beales (Peter Finch, the highlight of the film one of the funniest and most compelling performances of all time) is suffering a well publicized nervous breakdown after being told he will be fired from the show in two weeks time. When Beales loses on the air for two nights in a row however Christensen notices a spike in viewership and turns to her boss the shareholders well known hatchet man Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall, matching comedic wits with Finch in one of his incredibly humorous tough guy performances) to turn the news ratings around by devoting a portion of it to Beales ravings a decision which is met with great financial gain but taxes her relationship with the ousted Schumacher and Beales fragile mental health as he develops a Messianic Complex and becomes convinced he is spreading the essential and pure teachings of the Universe.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this movie is damn near perfect Beales is one of the most inspired characters in Hollywood's entire history and we get just enough of him that we're genuinely fascinated and excited when he comes on screen and some nice development and hilarity from the other characters who actually take up the bulk of the film. But its in the second half this movie starts to kind of lose traction. Beales is sort of pushed to the background and instead we get focus on two swiftly becoming uninteresting plots of Christensen's relationship with the by the end very unlikeable Schumacher, a relationship that's arc essentially amounts to the old generation was so warm and compassionate and this generation is so cold and selfish and evil a sentiment every aging generation seems to have but baffling none see the irony of. The secondary plot that floats around with Hackett floating in and out is Christensen's quest for more programming which if they were going to shove Beales into the background as almost a tertiary subplot should have held promise of some hilariously ridiculous programming but instead we get ONE silly show she comes up and tries to create and though it has some funny moments is really more stupid than witty. It all comes to a sort of resolution when Beales is taught the cynical secrets of the Universe he must preach by Ned Beatty's Executive Character which is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen but at that point we've slogged through about forty minutes of a meandering forced story with increasingly silly characters you find it harder and harder to care about or be interested in. Network can't decide if it wants to be a serious and transcendent societal criticism or just an Airplane level yuk fest and doesn't really reach either potential as a result. Moreover it holds a lot of bile and contempt for the television networks but can't decide if it would rather attack the way they run the news starting with what is more entertaining and going from there, how they exploit anti establishment ideas and cultures for pandering entertainment to simply turn a profit or their utter disregard for ethics and those that work for them so long as it makes money and  thus it's a really unfocused criticism unfortunately. The performances are great but really if it weren't for the ahead of his time and eerily prophetic of those that would end up on TV character of Howard Beales Network would be a very unremarkable film with an average story and directing.\r\n\r\nI didn't dislike Network, I laughed my ass off mostly at the scenes with Beales but even during the ones without him and I thought the performances were great and the script if not the story sharper than most but it doesn't mesh together to make anything spectacular. Peter Finch who as he deserved won the first posthumous Oscar for the role elevates the movie to greatness with his unforgettable rants as Beales and his sharp comedic edge and timing and Dunaway, Holden and Duvall are all excellent as they all were want to be at this time but even they can't save the weak second half of the story culminating in one of the most unforgiveably out of place stupid endings of all time that left me scratching my head wondering how they thought it was a good idea. It feels like almost three different great films are fighting around for dominance in here and its a shame none of the three got a chance to really shine.",

            "content": "\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\" - Howard Beale (Peter Finch) in Network\r\n\r\n\tSatires may be one of the hardest types of films that can be made into classics. Intricately directors and writers need to be able to weave in lines, plots and characters that will stay true tomorrow, yesterday and the present so it will never become dated or lose its touch. In the past decade there have been few memorable social satirical pieces, so there are probably even fewer that could be recognized as classics; the best satire I can think of in the last decade is Tropic Thunder. But despite any degree of difficulty for making a satire have a lasting cultural impact there is one classic film that has actually become more relevant with its age. This 35 plus year old masterpiece is Sidney Lumet's Network.\r\n\r\n\tBringing one of the best original screenplays ever written to vibrant life on the screen, Network unravels the tale of news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch). Beale has come across some troubled times and has turned to drinking, sometimes at work, to soothe the pain. Beale is let down easy by his old friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) who runs the news division. Fired promptly, Beale lashes out one day on the air by announcing his eminent suicide. This provokes heartless programmer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) into exploiting Beale's anger for higher ratings to appease her higher ups, including Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty). This simple quest for ratings leads to much more than one could typically imagine.\r\n\r\n\tNetwork boasts one of the best ensembles ever assembled on film. Every relevant character in the film is written for a purpose and each one of them has great lines to utter. Lumet was always considered to be an \"actor's director\" and this is just as apparent here as it was in his legendary debut film 12 Angry Men. After its release Network garnered a whopping five acting nominations at the Academy Awards for the stellar work from Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight. The winners were Finch (earning the first ever posthumous Oscar), Dunaway and Straight (her performance only occupied 5:40 of screen time the shortest to win an Oscar ever), but every actor nominated, as well as the non-nominated Duvall, deserved an award. No film since Network has won three of the four Oscars for acting.\r\n\r\n\tThe aesthetic of Network is in the extremely well-written screenplay, which was voted the 8th best of all-time by the screenwriter's guild and won a well-deserved Best Original Screenplay Oscar back in 1976. The story offers up everything from pressing social issues, corporate philosophy, to tumultuous romance and near farcical levels of satire. What makes Network such a lasting and impactful classic film is that the seeming insanity of The Howard Beale Show, the UBS executives and the TV viewers themselves is really not very far from the truth about journalism and its effects today over three decades later; in fact it's dangerously close.\r\n\r\n\tNetwork is and will always be a textbook lesson on media literacy, an awareness arousing social satire that is an essential piece of American art. Network is one of, if not the best of Lumet's greatest films. After seeing Network, turning on the TV, especially the news channel can never be looked at in quite the same way. After watching a half hour of what the decaying standard of broadcasting journalism is today it's easy to see how and why people today are still mad as hell after all these years.\r\n\r\nGrade: A\r\nReviewed by Ben Pieper on March 15th 2012",

Some might argue that the nature and moral of the film are too heavy-handed or unrealistically moralistic, but I think that that is what makes the film work: the final resolution is direct, and just pointed enough to leave the film'sintention clear while still allowing for some interpretation of the circumstances that led up to it. It is highly stylized in its cynicism and sarcasm, and I think it still makes a point that makes sense in today's network television context. Network is definitely a film that merits multiple watchings to appreciate its nuance, as well as the many tongue-in-cheek moments peppered throughout the rapid-fire repartee.",

Network was a film that was in a lot of ways ahead of it's time.  It spoke about the lengths to which networks will go for ratings, what happens when corporations control the networks, and the sensationalism to which the news has become.  The story is weaved around the fictional Union Broadcasting Systems (UBS), now controlled by a conglomerate CCA. UBS is doing consistently poor in every category against the other major networks.  It's News Division is headed by veteran television executive, Max Shumacher (William Holden), the head of network programing, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in her Oscar winning performance) lives and breaths in terms of marketing and numbers and really has no emotional or moral compass to draw from.  There is also CCA's \"hatchet man\" for UBS, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) who only looks at how UBS will make money for CCA and cares about really nothing else.  Then, there is the man who is at the center of this whole story, UBS Evening News Anchor and Max Shumacher's best friend, Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch in his legendary Oscar winning performance), who is a widower, sinking in the ratings,on the verge of complete breakdown, and has just been fired by UBS for his poor ratings...what happens next to these cast of characters made Paddy Chayevsky's screenplay come alive in an amazing way and it is why I feel that it was the Best Film of 1976.  It is a must watch for those who haven't seen it, which is why I won't give away spoilers.\n\nIf you are \"as mad as hell and not going to take this anymore!\", Prepare yourself for Howard Beale and for Network!    5/5 stars",

The movie delivers a look of the rise and fall of a television show and the multiude of factors that influence it. Howard Beale goes off the deep end when he finds out he is about to lose his job and announces that he will commit suicide live on-air. The entirely job-driven, to the point of a major fault, hatches a plan to give him his own show. And the ratings pour in. Beale begins to spout insane ramblings and conspiracy theories which get him in big trouble (See the fantastically frightening scene where Ned Beatty delivers the second best, only to the infamous \"Mad as Hell\" speech, monologues in the movie). Meanwhile, Max Schumacher (Holden) gets involved with Faye Dunaway and has an affair. Beatrice Straight, who plays Max's wife, only has, at most, about five minutes of screen time, but delivers a wonderful performance as a wife who cannot take it anymore... and then gets an Oscar for it).

Satire is in parentheses because every last one of its apparently outlandish over the top predictions about the bleak and soul destroying aspects of TV though ratings grabbing corporate capitalism have come to pass - in spades - 'reality TV' before the term had been coined.   I know this because I work in the world of 'reality TV', but all you need to do prove this is turn on your TV set.\n\nThe star of the film, and creator of a bitter, beautifully structured and frequently poetic script is that screenwriting colussus Paddy Chayefsky.  Second most valuable players are the deeply talented and spectacular cast, academy award winners Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, Beatrice Straight, but upon a recent viewing, William Holden, who is the heart and soul of this film.  One of the best ever leading men in Hollywood history for manliness, looks and acting chops, Holden gives an indelible, sad eyed, heartfelt and intelligent performance that haunts you long after screening. He was cheated of an oscar for this one.   Thirdly, the wonderful Sidney Lumet (arguably the highest quality and longest spanning list of Hollywood critical classics - over four decades -of any director) directs up to his usual high standards, but this is Chayefsky's film.\n\nYes, Chaefysky's script is preachy and declamitory throughout with very long and discursive speeches spewing his venom about the current (30 years ago) state of TV and corporate American that has only become more dire in subsequent decades.  However, these wonderful actors pull off each word with such panache and briliance that you almost don't notice the clunky aspects of the storytelling.  \n\nI do wonder if a young person (under 25) would even perceive Network as a satire at all, except for a network decision to assassinate its anchorman for ratings.  To them, this would just seem like a drama about the way things are, and a realistic one at that.  Hmmm. I take that back, even that assination plot doesn't seem that outrageous today.

I mean my favorite kind of film is one that has almost too much to say and it still turns out to be a great film. Network is the epitome of that. This is (other than Magnolia and Boogie Nights..long story) my favorite film. Lumet used a lighting scheme in which light gets more and more intimate throughout, which I thought was brilliant. That also shows that this film isn't artless. Everyone involved in this film called it \"too real to be satire\", which couldn't be closer to the truth. I showed my father this film, currently 72, and he liked it, but didn't love it, he acknowledged all the great points it made, though.

The reason I think why Network was so revolutionary, was because it portrayed the media the way it really was then: a thirsty, ruthless entity determined to resort to anything to garner more viewers. Which is why I also firmly think that it's relevant even to today's media-savvy world. It was an opposite take on the media to another journalism-related classic released that same year - All the President's Men. Network maybe highly fictional (I mean, come on, who on earth would kill a TV personality just because he has \"lousy ratings\"?). But the comedy it evokes - particularly due to strong performances by Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway - is simply too lovable and enjoyable, that one simply dispenses with all that. To me, this HAS to be the best satirical movie ever. And the subject it chooses to parody - the media - was very aptly (and at times ruthlessly) exploited to highly comedic proportions.",

That was definitely one of Sidney Lumet's strengths as a director, getting strong performances out of his cast.  The problem I have with the movie is that it gets too preachy with its satire on TV in general sometimes.  While a lot of it that's said is true, about TV execs doing just about anything to gain a big  rating, proof of this is the fact that Jersey Shore has been on air for 4 (5th in January) seasons, but the executives discussing killing Howard Beale in as a business-like manner as is possible is completely unbelievable.  I believe the TV execs are mad, but not THAT mad.  Also the movie does sort of try to do the same thing that they're accusing TV of doing.  They're trying to manipulate you into believing what Howard Beale is saying.  But one of the thing the movie, through no fault of their own did, is manage to have this satire that could, very believably, be applied to today's time just as well.  There are MANY occasions in the movie where I'm questioning, not seriously obviously, whether the movie was released in 1976 or 2011.  A lot of it does apply to now, especially now with the age of the internet.  Maybe that's why the movie is still so great.  So yea it's a movie that doesn't practice what it preaches, but it's also a massively entertaining film to watch.",

When you get right down to it, \"Network\" really is just a ridiculous film, and you'd gather that from a single viewing. Personally, the deliciously over-the-top performances are what kept me entertained. Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall are all so crazy and hot-headed in their roles that it seems almost comedic, while William Holden remains low-key to balance things out. (Ned Beatty has a scene-stealing performance as well.) \"Network\" is bizarre and doesn't really make as a much of a point as it should, but it has a share of great moments.",

Every point he successfully and acutely made in 1976 still rings true.

The growth is breathtaking. During an early scene, Finch admits, on air, that he'll be committing suicide in the days to come. This deftly foreshadows his later demise by the same corporation that made him go bonkers in the first place. Faye's manipulative, cutthroat role is the most entertaining, though: she embodies everything in the sinister corporate world that rules without flinching. The monologues prove, by themselves alone, that the supernatural acting witnessed doesn't usually occur in the same movie. Sidney Lumet, after all, is an actor's director. \"No America\" \"No Democracy\" \"The Individual is Finished\" - all of these pithy lines create the organic makeup of what Network sets out to do: inform citizens that the world is now run by a college of corporations, since it's simply a business. The content is unbreakably strong, yet the form steals the show: opening and closing with quad-screen of news stations (donut effect), the stead crescendo of intensity till the ending climax, along with many time lapses to propel the story forward swiftly. I'm thoroughly shocked the sound dept didn't walk away with a Statue but hell with it. I get chills every time one of the brilliant actors begins to raise his/her voice.

And the result was 1976's Network; a bitingly bitter and absurdly well acted satire about a veteran news anchor whose unorthodox response to being fired serves as the unintended catalyst for a new era of ever-more-provocative and exploitative nightly news. Enticing rather than repelling, Network has only grown more chillingly relevant with age.",

None of these characters are likable and yet that's what draws us to them. All they truly care about is the company and it's airwaves. Sex, Violence, Love, Hatred- it's all there, summed up like the half-hour news show at 5pm.

            "content": "First off \"Network\" is one my favorite films of all time.  It had an incredible cast including Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall.  It was directed by the incredibly talented Sidney Lumet, who also did another of my favorite films, 12 Angry Men.  The story revolves around the UBS television station.  The network has had low ratings and the crew will literally do whatever it takes to get more viewers, no matter how insane, immoral, and illegal the proposed solutions may be.  I won't go into this aspect anymore, in case people want to see the film, and I highly recommend that they do.  This film was a satire of the television industry and the ridiculous extremes that people go to to get ratings.  Over 30 years later and all of a sudden what happens in Network doesn't seem so farfetched.  Obviously, this film took it to the extreme.  However, taking a look at the news now, and how they often look for the most extreme, violent, or sexual story to get people's attention it becomes disconcerting, frightening, annoying, pick your favorite adjective.  Network also is incredibly character driven and it is one of the key reasons why it is so wonderful to watch.  Dunaway definitely earned her Oscar as Diana Christensen who is completely consumed by the false world of television, causing her not to have a firm grasp on reality.  This leads to a doomed affair with Max Schumacher (Holden) as well as her going mildly insane, along with Howard Beale (Finch), and others as they try to garner more ratings.  Finally this film won three acting Oscars, and one for its screenplay, but was nominated for many more and it is considered one of the best films of all time, according to the American Film Institute...in case that is a deciding factor for people wanting to check it out.  I'm really going to have to see it more times, twice just isn't enough.  Such a great story, although depressing and extremely serious, phenomenal actors, directing, cinematography, and everything else add up to a enjoyable, well paced 2 hours of film. \r\n\r\n4 stars out of 4...and one last thing this film has one of the most famous lines in film history: \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.\" Yes, that line really is as wonderful as you all dreamed it would be.\r\n\r\n-Joseph Sbrilli",

When you're news anchor declairs he is going to shoot himself on live TV, you fire him and get him psychiatric help. In this case, the executives at UBS decides to keep their depressed anchor on the air because he's really drawing a crowd. And when he claims the God is speaking to him to give a message to America, what do they do? They give him his own TV show. Network is a character, political and philisophical drama about the people who run the UBS station and their personal conflicts about life, power and publicity. With a bunch of impressive performances from Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch and the great Robert Duvall, Network is a special movie with a very bold point of view of the world. It does slow down a bit because this is a movie that's all talk and people constantly yelling at eachother, but Network is a true push in modern ideologies presented through cinema. But what makes this movie really special is how funny it is with all the dark humour it has while staying completely serious. It's a crazy mix of drama, philosophy and comedy, but Network is a truely special movie for its time.\r\n\r\nWhat also makes this movie so interesting is its strange and realistic look into a network studio. We are taken through offices, news rooms, back stage, everywhere that other films don't seem to bother looking at. WE get a sence of how much of a working entity television really is with so many characters working together. The looks of these sets are interesting and well made, and accompanied with great cinematography. It's pretty cool watching these characters through a camera while they're looking at another camera. But we're not JUST taken through a studio, this movie also has great shots outside into the real world that begins to look a lot more \"real\" than real when we're taken through the film's philosophy. The camera also really plays off the actors in a wonderful way, especially Faye Dunaway in her charasmatic role.\r\n\r\nIt's a different kind of drama, one that focuses of different kinds of relationships. Professional relationships. And even when it tries to focus on personal relationships we're only left with a hipocritical view. The only thing that makes sence in the world is television. Network is a different kind of movie, that's for sure, and one that is done with great style and performances.",

William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.\nThe true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message.\nThe cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.\nThis is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970's (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics.
