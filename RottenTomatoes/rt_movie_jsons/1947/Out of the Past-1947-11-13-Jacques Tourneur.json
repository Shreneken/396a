The plot is complicated yet it is very engrossing, with plenty of effective scenes, especially that unforgettable ending. It is gorgeously shot, exceptionally directed, adeptly scripted and atmospherically scored, these are reasons enough to watch this film. But I can't write this review without praising the acting. Robert Mitchum is memorably languid as the ultra-hard-boiled former private detective, while Jane Greer is dangerously beautiful as the cold yet equally beautiful femme-fatale. Kirk Douglas is also brilliant as the soft-spoken yet truly Machiavellian gangster. Overall, Out of The Past is quite simply quintessential film noir. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

When they're up in the Sierra Mountains, Lake Tahoe and in the taverns and streets in Mexico. Kathie was stunningly beautiful. She had this enchanting beauty about her that I found entrancing and mesmerizing to watch. She was almost magical in a way. Robert Mitchum is a really cool chill dude. And Kirk Douglas is always great when he plays these two faced sort of smirking vile type characters. It suits him. Kathie ended up being the deadliest person in the movie and there wasn't really a happy ending, just a resolution. \n\nThe storytelling was good and the movie doesn't really adhere to any cliches or typical 40's movie's stuff. The thing I don't like about noir films is how untrustworthy the characters can be. How quick they are to betray and stab you in the back. And everything's so serious and cynical. There's never any humor. Noir films can be quite bleak. It was a good film but I wouldn't watch it again.",

            "content": "Out of the Past (1947) is a classic, near-perfect film noir so deftly made, beautifully directed, and finely acted, it requires multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.  Though its rapid pace and shifting scenes become confusing toward the end, the plotting is sound and all the pieces fit.  The story rises above its sordid crime drama material to take on the eloquence of Greek tragedy.  Stunning photography and crackling dialogue create a lowlife world of glamour and death, yet there is nostalgia here as well.  \n    One of the many strengths of this excellent film is the perfection of its casting.  Not only have the right actors been found for their parts, they are at the exact place in their careers where they can inhabit their roles completely and bring depth and dimension to each character.  If any of them had been five years older when this film was made, it would not have worked.\n    This was only Kirk Douglas's second film, but his performance here is easily one of the best of his career.  He plays a rich crime lord who is elegant and murderous in equal measures. His soft words and sly smiles only increase his menace.  He is duplicitous on multiple levels and his oily charm conceals the loyalty of a snake.\nWhat makes all this work is the restraint Kirk Douglas brings to his role.  Later in his career, he would sometimes be drawn into excessive histrionics; \"chewing the scenery\" they call it in the theater.  These outpourings, as he gave us in The Detectives and Lust for Life (playing Vincent van Gogh), were never as effective as his more restrained roles, as in Letter to Three Wives and Paths of Glory.  In Out of the Past, Douglas is cool and deadly, and often ironic, a delightful mix of qualities. \n    Robert Mitchum's world-weary cynic defines the isolated, guilt-ridden film noir hero.  Mitchum has never been better than he is in this film.  He plays a laconic drifter with a shady history who has taken refuge as a service station manager in a small town.  But previous sins from \"out of the past\" rise up to draw him back into the sordid world he thought he had escaped.  Mitchum is pitch perfect playing this doomed and tragic character, whose poor choices and bad luck follow him, literally.  He seems achingly close to escaping the moral pit he has dug for himself, but, inevitably, he slips back in and is lost.\n    Jane Greer was also at the pinnacle of her career in this film, playing a femme fatale with such delicate loveliness, vulnerability and sincerity, we are astounded when she is revealed as a vicious murderess with no moral compass.  She can switch her allegiance at the click of a cylinder and her heart-rending pledges of fidelity are mere dust in the air.  That Mitchum can know all this and still be drawn to her exposes the fatal flaw in his character.\n    Of the gallery of film noir femme fatales: Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon, Jane Greer's character is by far the most vulnerable and appealing.  We feel such sympathy for this poor lost waif, unjustly pursued by a sadistic crime lord, accused of crimes she did not commit\u2026until we learn she did commit those crimes and is capable of much worse.  She is, in fact, a sociopath of Grand Guignol proportions.\n    Greer was 22 when she made this film, mature for her years and already hardened by divorce after a foolish May-December marriage to Rudy Vallee that lasted only three months.  The script makes her character sharp enough to verbally thrust and parry with Mitchum in the jaded fashion of people who have seen too much and done things they are not proud of.  These two are damaged goods, compromised early in life by actions taken well outside the code, drawn together less by the physical pull than by an affinity of need, running from themselves into each other's arms.\n    It doesn't hurt that Jane Greer is blindingly beautiful, or is that really a trick of the camera?  Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca has worked wonders with the lighting and director Jacques Tourneur has meticulously set the staging for every shot.  Together they create one stunning image after another.  Great films have always depended on the rapport between director and cinematographer, and Musuraca and Tourneur had together created 1942's Cat People, a landmark film in the horror genre. \n    Considered objectively, Jane Greer's baby face lacks the classic beauty of Elizabeth Taylor or Grace Kelly, but she benefits in this role by also not having their self-assurance.  She is hesitant, frightened, and uncertain, right up until she pulls the trigger.  In that moment, her decisiveness is shocking: she wants a man dead and does what is required.  There is no hesitation, no internal dialogue.  The shift in our perception of her is seismic.  Now we know this woman and the pure evil she embodies.\n    Yet Greer's craft is so canny, we still see the beauty, the vulnerability, the longing to be the simple, pure girl she must have once been.  But time does not run backward, for her or for us.  She knows too much to ever again be simple and pure.\nJane Greer has created the ultimate femme fatale, a woman so enmeshed in her own evil she cannot see moral distinctions, yet she still seems fragile, at the mercy of forces she can't control.  When she makes one of her preposterous pledges of fidelity, Mitchum replies: \"Oh, you're wonderful\" awed by the audacity of the lie.  The chemistry between these two actors still held when they worked together two years later on The Big Steal, but the script was not as strong.\n    The script for Out of the Past was written by Daniel Mainwaring (writing under the name Geoffrey Homes), but there were uncredited contributions from Frank Fenton and James M. Cain.  Fenton was a studio hack who worked with partners to produce screenplays for several major studios, both for films and for television.  Mainwaring's only other hit film was Invasion of The Body Snatchers, a science fiction classic that lacks the clever dialogue and depth of characterization in Out of the Past. \n    James M. Cain was a master writer in the school of hardboiled crime fiction. Along with Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Caine elevated pulp fiction during the 1930s into a new sub-genre that would later be recognized as film noir when the sordid stories were finally able to make it past the censors and get produced as films during the 1940s.  Cain gave us Double Indemnity, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Mildred Pierce.  Though there is no way at this date to identify what his contributions to Out of the Past were, his fingerprints are all over it.\n    The dialogue could have been lifted out of any of Cain's novels.  It is not the snappy banter of Ben Hecht or Herman Mankiewicz, or the cute romantic sparring in a Frank Capra film.  In Cain's stories, and in the films made from them, there is an immediate acknowledgment of the sexual tension between male and female, but this does not lead to flirtatious overtures; rather, lines are drawn in the sand, territory staked out, and the struggle begins.  The issue is trust, not attraction, and in the canon of film noir, once achieved, it is always trust misplaced. \n   Despite endless debate over what constitutes film noir, and whether this or that film is part of this uniquely American genre, the foundational films of the genre have a look, sound, and storyline that are remarkably similar.  For me, they are films made during the \"classic\" noir period, 1942-1958, shot in black and white, with most scenes at night using highly shadowed staging, and with a plotline that includes one or more murders and a series of double crosses and unexpected plot twists.\n    The best films noir are: Double Indemnity, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Maltese Falcon, and Out of the Past.  These four films share essentially the same plot: a fundamentally good man with a shady past gets seduced by an irresistible femme fatale who gets him involved with murder and it ends badly, usually for both of them.  There are always plot twists, double-dealings, betrayals, and death, and usually the action increases toward the end so it becomes harder to follow the plotline.  These are intelligent, stylish crime stories without the Earl Stanley Gardner or Ellery Queen \"who done it\" aspect. \n    Film noir came at a time of great fear in our country, the tension of WW II gave way to the terror of the nuclear age, the Red Scare, another foreign war (Korea), and in Hollywood, the HUAC investigations and the Black List.  \nWere these dark stories perhaps a way of coping with the times, vehicles for believing that good men only fell prey to evil femme fatales if abandoned by their nurturing Betty Furness and Harriet Nelson partners of the affluent \u201850s?  Did film noir somehow give us the assurance we needed to fall into the frivolous contemplation of Rock and Doris having pillow talk while Annette and Frankie shared a blanket on the beach?   \n    It's tempting to think so, but the more likely explanation is simply that the style of film noir fell out of fashion, just as German Expressionism and Italian Neo-Realism did.  Each generation seeks its' own ethos and time moves in only one direction.  But every so often there is a film that catches the moment, that defines the esthetic of a cultural period, and Out of the Past is one such film.\ngregdisneyguy@gmail.com",

            "content": "The problem with a lot of noir film is the one-upsmanship that gradually influenced the genre (and many others, as they experienced booming ticket sales) - there was a need to differentiate new films from those that came before, and that often took place by dialing up the tropes. More archaic dialogue, more backstabbing dames, more lit cigarettes. Out of the Past has all those elements, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to outperform its competition. Instead, Tourneur draws you in with compelling character development, a sharp script, battles of wits, dueling loyalties, fantastic visuals, and a solid mystery narrative that delivers enough to keep you interested but dangles the resolution out of reach. Characters scheme and survive in the shadows, ably depicted by cinematography from Musaraca, who frames narrative developments with an eye for subtlety and nuance. Mitchum makes complete sense as the hard-boiled, jaded former PI contending with a classic femme fatale in Greer's Kathie, who isn't necessarily evil but self-serving, and the two must look out for their own well-being in a web of illicit activity, money, and mobsters while also trying to rectify their feelings for one another. The story isn't necessarily airtight (who really cares about Huston's Ann, the one-note love interest that serves merely to the chilly nature of Kathie?), but it's still a solid and very watchable example of the genre in the modern day. (4/5)",

            "content": "Smoky and sultry storytelling like few films could compare.\n\nJacques Tourneur's film noir Out of the Past (1947) is classic, brisk crime drama storytelling from an innovative French director. Tourneur's direction for Out of the Past draws upon older film noirs like The Maltese Falcon, while paving the way for future film noirs like The Third Man or Chinatown. Tourneur deftly combines hazy romance drama with a seedy crime thriller that blows most crime narratives out of the water. Out of the Past is enthralling thanks to Robert Mitchum's sullen narration, Jacques Tourneur's riveting dreamlike direction, and outstandingly gripping performances.\n\nRobert Mitchum is pleasantly dour and serious as the wise-cracking detective Jeff Markham. Mitchum's imposing height, sad face, wistful candor, dire yearning, and aloof attitude make him an unforgettable lead for Tourneur's film noir Out of the Past. He's like a more likable Humphrey Bogart with more charm and calm than Bogart's stoicism and anger. Mitchum has genuinely intriguing chemistry with Jane Greer's iconic femme fatale Kathie Moffat. She flaunts her natural allure and curious mystique as Mitchum's love interest. She's really convincing as a complex woman with ulterior motives.\n\nKirk Douglas is excellent as the eagerly flexible mob boss Whit Sterling. His natural charm goes a long way here as Douglas feels effortless. Rhonda Fleming's sultry secretary with secret ties Meta Carson is really captivating too when she appears halfway through Out of the Past. I adore Virginia Huston's sweetheart Ann Miller. She's like the perfect gentle girl in a traditional feminine role as Robert Mitchum's new girlfriend. Huston plays the polar opposite of Jane Greer's fiercely independent villainess.\n\nDaniel Mainwaring, James M. Cain, and Frank Fenton's script is impressive with clever wit in every line. Each word feels carefully chosen to create an air of mystery to the narrative with playful flirting, dangerous veiled threats, and sly insults with each neat turn of phrase. Out of the Past's story is really endearing as you root for a morally bankrupt detective desperately trying to get away from his former life of backdoor deals for his new love. Samuel E. Beetley's editing is tight as Out of the Past's brief 97 minutes breezes by when other film noirs feel like slow burns.\n\nNicholas Musuraca's black and white cinematography leans into black shadows, smoky hazes, foreboding silhouettes, dreamy close-ups, and fearsome wide shots in cities that tell the story entirely with atmosphere. Roy Webb's score is nicely accompanied by all the emotional drama and unsettling crime stories going on throughout Out of the Past. I adore all of Edward Stevenson's costumes with stark suits and luxurious dresses for a moody tone visually.\n\nIn conclusion, Out of the Past is an enduring film noir classic with immaculate craftsmanship and involving acting. I must recommend Out of the Past for grim outlooks, star crossed romance, enshrouding hopelessness, and pessimistic wit.",

My recommendation is to just turn off the sound and watch this while listening to some late 1940s jazz, or your favorite music.

Of course, film noir as a genre has been constructed post hoc, so director Jacques Tourneur wasn't exactly working from a formula - but this wasn't the first noir, so something was definitely in the water.  Robert Mitchum plays a detective hired by arrogant rich Kirk Douglas to find his girlfriend (Jane Greer) who shot him and absconded with $40K.   Mitchum does catch up with her in Acapulco where they idle away their days until they decide to doublecross Douglas and hole up in San Francisco as lovers.  Ultimately, though, they are tracked down by Mitchum's ex-partner, now working for Douglas.  All this is shown in flashback a number of years later with a voiceover by Mitchum as he relates his past to new love interest Virginia Huston in the small town where he has escaped to run a gas station.   He's finally told her the sordid details because Douglas has finally found him again and called him to Lake Tahoe for a meeting.  It turns out that Douglas has another job for him, one that he can't refuse, one that might be a frame-up.  And that doesn't begin to detail the complicated plot that ensnares the laid back but fatalistic Mitchum.  Showing the noir protagonist's true disdain for his own welfare, when the femme fatale starts to reveal some of the ensnaring complications, Mitchum utters the classic line, \"Baby, I don't care...\".  But he should have.  A masterpiece of the genre.",

            "content": "Out of the Past is the story of a private eye who's being pursued by the mistakes of his past because of one job he failed to do right. It's probably the ultimate film noir, as it fits every stereotype of the genre. I love the 3 primary cast members of the film, and they are perfect for their roles. Robert Mitchum looks and acts just like a street smart gumshoe who can often be one step ahead of everyone else. He is the essence of cool. Kirk Douglas is the ideal gambler/mobster. He has a charm to his performance, but also gives off an air of strength that helps you see why Mitchum might not want to cross him. However the best casting was Jane Greer. She is absolutely gorgeous and it is simple to see why men fall in love with her and also believe whatever she says. It is one of the most intriguing femme fatale performances because as a viewer I bought everything she was saying as well, so I was in the same boat with the characters, never knowing when she could be trusted. As long as I'm talking about cast, though, I do have to complain about one decision they made. There was another woman who played an accountant or something and she looks way too much like Jane Greer to the point where I was genuinely confused if it was the same person they were calling by another name. For about 5 scenes in a row I didn't know which woman I was watching, and that should not happen in a movie that already has enough plot complexity.\n\nOut of the Past looks great and, as with most noir, the cinematographer did a great job of utilizing darkness and shadows to add intrigue to various scenes. I also have never mentioned this because I'm not a fan of smoking, but the way that cigarette smoke adds a haziness to the atmosphere in these films is extremely appropriate. I did enjoy this story, but it is one where I really got annoyed with the end, so I'll have to warn that spoilers are coming now. One of the troubles with all the movies from this era (at least as I understand it) is that the Production Code that was in place dictated that bad guys couldn't get away with it. This is a particular problem for noir films as most of the characters ride the line between good and bad. However in Out of the Past I was excited because it seemed that Mitchum's character had kept his nose clean enough to survive, and yet they kill him off at the end. It's not a deal-breaker that makes me hate the film, but it is one thing that rubbed me the wrong way and kept this from being something special in my book. Still, Out of the Past is a great entry in the genre, and it is one I would gladly watch again.",

            "content": "A fun film noir with fluid and sometimes haunting cinematography. I don't think it's the best in the genre, though. Even with my complaints I highly recommend the film. If you don't like film noir you'll probably like this one, and really that's my problem with it. It feels too modern. It feels like the kind of noir that came out after film noir became self-aware and it became exploited because the formula was standardized. This feels less like a 1947 film and more like a movie made today trying to imitate a 1947 film noir. That doesn't make the film less enjoyable, but it does prevent it from achieving genuine greatness.\n\nI found the tone and the characterizations were uneven for Jane Greer. If you're the type of person who likes any woman who's attractive than you'll love her, but I didn't like her. An unlikable woman in a film noir? Yeah, the genre that invented the femme fatale. That's not my problem. She's a great actress, but in a film with such an upbeat pace and style I'd like the movie to at least make her sympathetic, or endearing, or feisty, crazy, funny; anything besides just \"two-timing dame.\" She seems like she should be in a grittier movie.\n\nRobert Mitchum is great in this, but he's really not as smart as he thinks he is, or maybe he's aware of it. He talks fast and usually has a witty comeback for everything, but some of his witticisms aren't very clever at all. A lot of it doesn't even make sense, or he'll say something a child would say. Some of it is just cryptic. This isn't a complaint, though. I found it unusual, but I liked him. He's got a classy sense of humor and it's fun to hear him talk no matter what nonsense he says. Unfortunately, because of the huge difference between the two leads I didn't think they have very good chemistry. They seemed like they were both from different movies.\n\nThe story is great. Lots of twists and turns. It gets a little confusing toward the end, but even if you stop paying attention to certain plot points there's more than enough entertainment value to make up for it. This is one of the most funny and good looking film noirs out there. Not perfect, but pretty damn close.",

It is adopted from the novel called 'Build My Gallows High' \r\n\r\nMost of the story is told in New York is told in flashback: Jeff (Robert Mitchum) was formerly a private-eye in New York and then working for a gangster named Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), he is now running a pump-station in small town and spending days with his sweetheart Ann (Virginia Huston) by the lake fishing. In those days, Jeff was hired by Whit to track down a woman named Kathie (Jane Greer) - an irresistible beauty full of sexiness and treachery in her. Kathie had shot Sterling four times and ran away his money $40,000, Whit only wants her back and describes it why is that so in one line to Jeff 'When you see her, you'll understand better.' -  a man surprises Jeff one fine day at station who tells him that Whit wants to see him - Jeff had double-crossed Whit by eloping with Kathie who has by now returned back to Whit. Jeff, is lured into doing one more job for Whit, that of obtaining affidavit from Whit's secretary in San Francisco who has been blackmailing him.\r\n\r\nRobert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas are worth seeing together; you have the chances of experiencing witty remarks passed between the two and fiery but calm exchange of lines. \r\n\r\nWhosoever has seen Tourneur's Cat People should not undermine director Tourneur's capability working around story involving film-noir. Nicholas Musuraca worked as a cinematographer on Out of the Past; he also had collaborated with the director on his previous film Cat People - he used excellent lighting for scenes involving smoke of cigarettes (more cigarettes than in any other film-noir and it really kept the climate of the movie darker).\r\n\r\nExcellent film-noir, everyone knows he/she is being double-crossed and yet go along giving each other, a chance to pass through. Out of the Past comes with brilliant direction as well as superb cinematography - it is debated to be among the best of film-noir.",

Jeff Bailey (Mitchum) makes his living in a small town working at a gas station. He has an honest living and a girl. However, soon his past catches up with him and he must explain it. Once he was a private investigator who got mixed up with a powerful man (Douglas) who wanted some money found. Pretty soon he met a beautiful but deadly woman (Greer) who constantly tested his trust. However, he had tried to forget them and yet they both creep back into his life. With a murder pinned on him, Bailey can do nothing but go along with them. Soon he becomes embroiled in more treachery and backstabbing which all has to do with the woman. With one last entreaty she urges him to flee with her since they both have dark pasts. In the end her fanciful plan is foiled by Bailey and it soon turns fatal. With its dialogue, flashback, voice over, and femme fatale, this is a classic in the film noir genre and simply a good film.",

A great premise, and an even better execution by Robert Mitchum. Mitchum uses his sly, sinister attitude (that was so great in The Night of the Hunter) mixed with the classic noir detective in a terrific way. At first the ending seemed unsatisfying but the more I think about it the better it is. *spoilers* Bailey, in true tragic hero fashion, sacrifices himself to free Meta from himself, and to end Kathie's spree of betrayal. Whether of not he fell for her again is less relevant than it seems. Overall this movie is an excellent film noir that isn't nearly as predictable as others.",

            "content": "\u00e2Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations.\u00e2?  Taken from Wikipedia, this quote describes the film noir genre, a genre that dominated 30s and 40s American cinema and a genre that was dominated by Robert Mitchum.\n\n        Having starred in Undercurrent and Pursued, Mitchum was well acquainted with the film noir genre, he was perfect for the role of Jeff Bailey, who lived a quiet life owning a \u00e2gas station\u00e2?, with girlfriend Ann until a man from his past named Joe Sophranos arrives in town.  He tells Jeff that a man named Whit Sterling wants to see him.\n\n        With much of the film told as a flashback, Jeff tells Ann that his real name was Jeff Markham, the story of how he was a private investigator searching for Whit\u00e2(TM)s girlfriend Kathie Moffet, who had shot Whit and stolen $40,000, and how he fell in love with Kathie.  When he arrives at Whit\u00e2(TM)s mansion, he is forced to retrieve some papers for Whit and, as you can guess, things go awry.   \n\n        Released in 1947, Build My Gallows High was filmed in black and white, which meant I was surely destined to not be a fan, however we shall see in the conclusion.  Robert Mitchum delivers a top-notch performance, as I really believed he was Jeff Markham.  As well as that, there are a few high-octane fistfights and a surprising climax that definitely gets your heat beating very quickly, meaning it undoubtedly lives up to its status as a crime thriller.  On the contrary, the plot consists of twists and turns that all in all just make the film hard to follow.\n\n        Despite Mitchum\u00e2(TM)s believable performance, the climax and fistfights, ultimately, and remember I am not into the whole black and white scene, it is simply a boring film that is rather hard to follow.",

Breathtaking dialogue, well-carved characters and a tense but steady pace, all dovetail beautifully together.  I was constantly surprised how mendacious and underhanded Kathie was - played so brilliantly by Jane Greer - and yet how coolly Jeff (Robert Mitchum) simply adjusts to her devilishness with a measured and charismatic confidence.\n\nThis, from memory, is my first real foray into the genre of so-called Film Noir; it's such a massive area of Cinema that it's always been too big a task for me to know where to really start.  Well, I started here with Out Of The Past and I adored it.",

As it begins to haunt him, everything begins to unravel in a slow, but patient pace, giving you an excellent pay off. This is a must watch for any film junkie!",
