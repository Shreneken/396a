I love Daisy Ridley but her character Rey hasn't earned anything in these past 3 movies.  Her managing advance force powers by accident is ridiculous. Finn was just trying to get Rey's attention through the entire movie. That was his character arc. They wasted Finn again and John Boyega's time! Oh by the end of this movie their is no Skywalker it's just Rey taking the name for herself. This is Star Wars at it's weakest and worse.",

The characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, making it hard to care about what was happening to them.\n\nThe pacing was frenetic and disorienting, with scenes jumping from one location to the next without any clear reason or purpose. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save this poorly written mess of a film.\n\nThe dialogue was cringe-worthy, with cheesy one-liners and forced attempts at humor falling flat. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, leaving me with a feeling of disappointment and regret for having wasted my time watching this train wreck of a movie.\n\n\"The Rise of Skywalker\" was a massive letdown and a disgrace to the beloved Star Wars franchise. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. (Still better than Last Jedi though).",

It is a film that tries to wrap up the Star Wars saga with a bang, while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise. The film also features some impressive visuals, exciting action sequences, and witty dialogue. The film also showcases some great performances from its cast, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. The film also delivers some emotional moments and satisfying resolutions for some of the characters.\n\nHowever, I also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing, such as the plot, the characters, and the music. The film sometimes feels rushed and messy, especially in its pacing and structure. The film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them compelling and consistent. The film also lacks some of the originality and creativity that made Star Wars so captivating. The film also alienates some fans with its controversial choices and changes that undermine or contradict the previous films. The film also fails to answer some of the questions and mysteries that were set up by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Nevertheless, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a decent end to one of the greatest sagas of all time.",

That isn't how lightsabers work at all. They even have the gaul to bot these reviews with the same \"loved Rey and Kylo\" and \"great ending to the franchise\" comments to boost the score. This film was a narrative nightmare with no direction that threw away the plot of the previous films leading to a disjointed mess that just gives the main characters what they need to rush though the story as fast as possible.

There are many plot holes in this movie, with the two major ones being force healing and resurrecting an actual sith after the prophecy of the chosen one was supposedly fulfilled. On top of this it undoes the few good things the last Jedi did right. The last Jedi was not a good movie, but it was at the very least unique. If the ideas it introduced had been properly built upon, this movie could have been good. However, this entire movies' purpose is to retcon every single thing about the previous entry. The last Jedi set up that reys' parents were nobody. That's gone. The last Jedi set up that Kylo ren would be the main villain of this one. Gone. The last movie set up that nobody was willing to help the resistance. Gone. Then the cherry on top, the characters are STILL not interesting, after 3 whole movies. \nSome other issues that I don't care to elaborate on:\n1. Plot contrivances\n2. Minor dialogue issues\n3. Essential things introduced in the last movie\n4. Goonies fetch quest-style story\n5. Power scaling\n6. Rey skywalker",

Acting, is ok it could have been a lot better. CGI, is perfect no doubt about it. Villain, this is another reason why I liked the movie because it brought back Sidious and what's really interesting is why did the villains still exist even when Palpatine died in the explosion in Epi VI and this movie answers that question. Writing, I think that the writing was ok-good it could have been better. Story/Plot, it was ok and interesting. Casting is good-great. Characters, I think that the characters are great mostly because of the voices in Ray's head. Adventure, I think that the adventure was good like most Star Wars projects because we good threw and explore the galaxy and in this episode we traveled to the land of the Sith. Mystery, mystery is good because I always wondered what happens next especially in a movie like this bringing back the best of villains. Ending, in my opinion the ending was good but it does bring me to think No. 1 did Palpatine take over Ray's body? No. 2 did Palpatine die?

La verdad tuve que ver toda la saga antes de ver esta \u00faltima entrega y tuve que descifrar muchas cosas bas\u00e1ndome en lo que se vio en las pel\u00edculas anteriores y as\u00ed entender mucho de lo que parec\u00eda carecer de sentido. Adem\u00e1s, encontr\u00e9 una explicaci\u00f3n sobre porque Rei es una Mary Sue (alerta de Spoiler). La pel\u00edcula revela que ella es nieta de Palpatine y creo que eso justifica porque ella tiene tanto potencial, ya que al ver todas las pel\u00edculas varias veces, empec\u00e9 a notar que al parecer Palpatine era calculador y \u00e9l pudo deducir de cierta manera mucho de lo que iba a suceder en la saga como si \u00e9l hubiera planeado todo desde el principio y claramente el paso todo este tiempo en el planeta de los Sith mientras que el Palpatine de la sexta pel\u00edcula no era nada m\u00e1s que un clon. Todo lo que se vio en la saga fue parte del gran plan de Palpatine y esta pel\u00edcula revela eso de forma impl\u00edcita. Incluso ya predec\u00eda de alg\u00fan modo (en caso de emergencia) que si Rei no iba a tomar el mando, al menos ella terminar\u00eda lo que Palpatine quiso desde un principio y era la paz en la galaxia (como declaro en el episodio 3) y al parecer para conseguirlo, tanto los jedis, como los Sith y hasta el linaje de Skywalker ten\u00edan que morir y al final se cumpli\u00f3 ese objetivo. No por nada, Palpatine era el m\u00e1s grande Lord de los Sith porque su plan era perfecto, \u00e9l era muy poderoso, lo cual lo hizo un Sith perfecto y no ser\u00eda raro que esa perfecci\u00f3n la haya heredado su nieta, ya que en el mundo real los nietos pueden heredar muchas caracter\u00edsticas de sus abuelos, incluyendo la personalidad. En fin, creo que la saga termino bien, aunque quedaron algunas inc\u00f3gnitas que ojal\u00e1 sean respondidas en las pr\u00f3ximas entregas de la saga. Mi calificaci\u00f3n para esta pel\u00edcula es un 9/10.",

While it was a visually stunning and action-packed film, it struggled to balance its many plot threads and deliver a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film was its cast, with Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and John Boyega all delivering strong performances. The chemistry between the actors was also evident, providing an emotional anchor for the film. Additionally, the film's special effects and cinematography were top-notch, providing breathtaking visuals and exciting action sequences.\n\nHowever, the film's plot felt overstuffed and rushed. There were multiple storylines and character arcs to follow, and the film struggled to give each one the attention it deserved. As a result, many plot points felt rushed or underdeveloped, and it was difficult to fully invest in the film's story.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker also relied heavily on nostalgia and fan service, often at the expense of character development and plot logic. While some moments may have been enjoyable for longtime fans, they did little to advance the story or provide a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.\n\nIn terms of direction, J.J. Abrams returned to helm the film after directing The Force Awakens, and while he was able to recapture the excitement of the franchise, the film suffered from a lack of cohesion and a clear vision. It felt like Abrams was trying to please everyone, resulting in a film that tried to do too much and ultimately fell short.\n\nThe film's score, composed by John Williams, was a highlight, as expected. The iconic Star Wars themes and motifs were used effectively, adding to the emotional weight of the film's key moments.\n\nOverall, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker was a flawed but enjoyable film. While it may not have been the satisfying conclusion that fans were hoping for, it was still an exciting and visually stunning adventure in the Star Wars universe.",

TLJ was controversial but at least told a story and got creative. JJ Abrams took a hammer to it.\n\nI just watched it 10 minutes ago and I couldn't even tell you what it's about (except for destroying the Empire [excuse me, \"The Final Order\", because apparently he even had to rename it again to make sure TLJ had no impact on the canon]), again, and some big battle scene that made no sense at the end and was full of bad writing. Even the characters seemed to have trouble getting on board with half the things in Abrams' contribution to the story.\n\nThe only thing that saved it is the Star Wars universe and continuity canon and story. That alone made it entertaining and a movie a Star Wars fan should obviously watch. But, as many diehard fans have, prepare to be outraged with the complete lack of respect to the SW universe and ROTS' predecessor, The Last Jedi, while simultaneously being hands down the worst title out of the 9 movies.\n\nIf you're going to take a hatchet to the last director's work because you don't like what they added to the canon and universe, at least be ready to do better.

Having said that, The Rise of Skywalker is a very, very, very dumb film, overblown in every conceivable way, and chock-full of contrivances that come from absolutely nowhere to allow the plot to progress (at a clip that was likely set solely so nobody in the audience can stop and think about how stupid it all is).  However, considering that EVERY plot thread from The Force Awakens was severed and made irrelevant in The Last Jedi, it's clear that the writers were forced to come up with something to completely rewrite this now completely broken trilogy.  I will also give the movie that it actually does have some good action sequences - something that was, somehow, almost entirely missing from its two predecessors, and both the cinematography and Art Design are better than in the previous entry as well.  The music is solid and the VFX (which I actually helped with -- not as an artist but as someone who actually helped fix a problem with a render farm!  No, seriously!!) are generally very solid as well.  The acting is kinda flat, but at this point it was clear that the morale of those involved with this trilogy had plummeted, so I don't discredit the Actors or the Director.  And in terms of things that this movie genuinely does right, it does allow the three main characters to be together for much of the movie (which is good as they have a unified charisma when together), the movie doesn't have the morally repugnant lessons that its predecessor had, and while I hated the finale from a story perspective, I do appreciate what it actually tried to do; like, serious points for trying.  They also had a moment I genuinely loved where Chewbacca breaks down and cries when Leia dies (her actress passed away before filming, so this isn't a spoiler), as characters grieving the losses of those that they, and the audience, loved was something also sorely missing from this film's predecessor.  The biggest flaw, really, beyond the almost insultingly contrived plot, is that the reintroduction of Palpatine as the main villain only acts to negate (almost entirely) the struggles of the main heroes in the original Trilogy.  It's odd, as simply having this be a different villain would've made this a lot better.  Overall, The Rise of Skywalker has fireworks, has energy, has charisma and has brain-damage - it tries and utterly fails, but I actually felt like the film wanted me to be happy, and so, truthfully, I cannot bring myself to hate it, despite how bad it ultimately is.",

It is completely devoid of soul rehashing character arcs already completed to bring back a long obsolete character that died meaningfully and that we were done with. It is riddled with constant plot holes and half of the films run time is a fetch quest filled with padding and complications that amount to nothing. This film is a complete failure of all imagination. It fails at every opportunity to come up with anything new. I assume children who haven't seen the originals, who are unable  to understand the references will leave this movie confused and unimpressed by how underwhelming the film is. You could have 1000 nostalgic feel good moments but it could never be a good story. Instead of continuing the story that was set up with the last jedi they decided to make a nostalgic omage to star wars. And the worst part is the retconing of luke skywalker who died meaningfully saving the rebellion. Luke's sacrifice was meant to be showing the galaxy the legendary warrior version of luke, the hero, despite the fact that that version of Luke didnt really exist. That didnt matter because he played the part anyway buying time for the rebellion to escape and create a legend that will inspire hope for generations. But what does this film do? It undermines all of that by having Luke catch the lightsaber and saying that all of his previous conclusions were wrong. All because some dipshits who don't understand story telling didnt want good ol Luke skywalker to die this way because I dont know apparently Luke is supposed to be fucking imortal or something. The rise of skywalker is by far the most disgusting, unimaginative and pathetic piece of cinema I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing",

Anyway, I hated The Last Jedi at what I promised would be my LAST midnight screening, and although movies this late are spoiled by the timing of these midnight screening things, this one managed to keep me stoked. Actually finishes the whole saga off very nicely. The handling of the Carrie Fisher difficulty was quite good, considering they just wrote new dialogue around scenes cut from the first film in this trilogy, rather than CGI ing her in. A little forced, but for the most part worked. It's probably something of an 8/10, maybe more. They introduced a rather spectacular dark side aspect that I wish they gave a little more time to breath. Another positive that came out of this one is that it ties on to The Last Jedi quite well. I felt the Last Jedi ended up messing things set up in the first one, in the hands of another writer, but feel differently about that middle chapter now.\n\nA later viewing, one that significantly down graded it\n\nHaving re-watched the originals, the prequels, rolled through the new seasons, the new movies, I reached this again to find it lacking something significant. I realise Carrie Fisher's death doubtless threw this movie out of orbit, however I think they would have done well to have recovered something of what was originally intended by CGI ing her in, while also adding the cut material from the Force Awakens, and writing around it. Her inclusion being limited to that, and the writing to shoe horn her in really undermined it all, seems horribly forced. Secondly, SPOILER, they shouldn't have killed Ben off at the end. They ended his life with a kiss between him and Rey, and, well, I'm just going to fan edit his disappearance out of it, so it seems as though they may have become something more afterwards - something of a troubled love story.\n\nThere's a lot of ideology thrown in here too, which sadly kept taking me out of the movie.

So getting thrown down an engine shaft straight into the core of the death star is a survivable experience - This is not an ability that has ever been discussed, but they pass it off by saying \"The Dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural\" stealing the line out of RoTS but out of context. All this means is that Darth Vader died for nothing, this is a MAJOR PLOT HOLE - the prophecy of the chosen one is that Anakin/Vader would bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith - Before this movie, the prophecy was intact. The Plot is also full of coincidences, Lando just happens to be on the planet to provide assistance just as the gang turn up, without him they would be captured, he just so happens to know the location they need to look for the way finder, they get this dagger by complete luck after falling through some kind of new quicksand that happens to have tunnels underneath, the dagger is inscribed in the language of the Sith, C3PO can translate it but cant tell anyone so this leads them on a stupid side quest to reveal the location of the wayfinder... The whole movie just feels like coincidence after coincidence rather than logical decisions are being made to advance the movie. \nIn terms of characters, Poe doesn't progress in this movie - we get a small look at his back story but I think they added that in as an afterthought too. Fin doesn't progress. Luke is a different person compared to TLJ, and thats a good thing but terrible in terms of continuity. Rey has godlike powers and somehow kills Palpatine (I assume he's dead but you just don't know now) - in the prequels and originals, there is a power level structure - Palpatine is more powerful than Vader, Yoda is more powerful than Luke. The Prequels have it similar with Mace and Yoda the most powerful and Obi-wan and Anakin just below them - The sequels have completely ignored this, Rey is THE most powerful Jedi to ever exist - she must be if she is more powerful than Palpatine - just because theyre related does not mean she should be as powerful - Star Wars has never explicitly said that offspring will have the parents force abilities - the only instance is Vader and Luke but even then, Luke had to train hard to become as powerful as he did in ep6; up until this movie Rey had never trained (I don't count the lightsaber and rock scene as training) so how she has these abilities is ridiculous, at least this movie shows her training, but still not enough to be Palpatines equal, hes been a force user for decades. \nWe are lucky this is only a circa 2.5hr movie because it needs to be longer to fill in all the plot holes ~ 5 hours would suffice.\nSo negatives out the way, this movie is visually impressive. The vastness of the battles doesn't come across quite as well as RoTS' intro but its still very good - its something I always expect from JJ Abrams. \nI blame Disney for this primarily, JJ needs some of the blame but it sounds like he had a few weeks to write this script before they started filming.",

The ending itself is just trash. For a standalone film the ending could work but this is the ending to a nine part saga. And it's a rushed mess that you will probably forget about what happened at points when you finish it. The one word that can describe this movie is Overwhelming and not in a good way.

            "content": "Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.\n\nMy opinions on the previous 'Stars Wars' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren't that bad. Also thought 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but 'The Last Jedi' certainly had a lot wrong with it. 'Solo' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, 'The Rise of Skywalker' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it's not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.\n\nWill start with the good things with 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.\n\nThere are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo's force-based clash.\n\nFor all those good things, 'The Rise of Skywalker' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.\n\nAlthough the action has its moments, too much of it doesn't rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform \"what the heck?\") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy's with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.\n\nOverall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn't work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10",

A movie with wonderful design, great choreography, nice(st) cinematography, stunning costuming, and an amazing score. So where could the film go from such a great opening? Does it go up from there? Or does it fail and falter throughout the rest of the film?\n\nMe being an avid Star Wars fan, the return of the emperor was a great surprise. But it leaves so many questions. One being, why? What purpose did this serve to the new trilogy, could it have been avoided? Couldn't we have brought in a new villain? Once you get past the strange and horrific return of the notorious Emperor Palpatine, the film is really special. There are so many stand out aspects of this film that separate it from the others. Since I'm a sucker for cinematography and colors, I have to say that this is the best cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars film. \n\nThis movie is pure nostalgia. It brings back old characters and memories that we love (or hate, possibly). The first time seeing Lando since the original trilogy is surprising and extremely exciting. I remember seeing this in theaters on release night and man did the audience go WILD! There are many times during TROS where tears will fill your eyes as you're overcome by the emotion and the sheer depth of what's in front of you. \n\nSomething I find super intriguing about this one in specific is how it really dives into Kylo and Rey's \"force relationship\" and how they can see each other, touch each other, feel surroundings, etc. without actually being there. It explores the connection they have, and while it leaves a lot up to speculation, it's still really cool since we haven't seen anything like it in past films. \n\nAnd oh my gosh the lightsaber battle between Rey and Kylo when they're on the Death Star\u2026 the sound design, the animation, the choreography, the timing of everything, it's so well done. I am a sucker for the throne room fight but this is a close second. It's truly amazing to watch and to hear. Like how do you not see Kylo Ren and just gasp at how awesome he is, the way he holds his lightsaber upside down or the way he walks through a wave. He's a really cool villain and this movie did a terrific job actually showing him off in ways the 2 prior to TROS didn't.\n\nThe third act of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is what really made this film so enjoyable. It's non stop action filled with tears, laughter, awestruck staring, and so many different emotions. And how does one not tear up at \"but there's more of us Poe, there's more of us!\" ??? Tears, every single time. \n\nWell in my personal opinion, this movie did not fail as it went on. I do believe that the second act was a little bit boring, but that's almost impossible to avoid when your opening scene is as crazy as this one and the entire third act is entertaining as ever. The story falters a little bit, but why focus on the minor details? Just sit back and enjoy the scale of what's unfolding before your eyes. What's not to like?\n\nI could pick apart every single moment of this film and say what I love and what I hate about it. Like honestly, this review could be longer than the movie script and I would still have more to say. I believe this is one of the most wrongly hated episodes of the Star Wars saga, as this one brings so much to the table. You just have to give it a chance and really try to enjoy it because honestly it's great!",

            "content": "I went into this in the theaters with fairly low expectations but remember it failing to meet even those. A couple of years later, I decided to give it another shot, wondering if maybe I had been too hard on it. Unfortunately, I liked it even less this time. While there are some moments of artistry in Rise of Skywalker, these good bits are so heavily undercut by the film's persistent failings that they lose what allure they might otherwise hold.\n\nThe plot of the film makes no sense. It's a treasure hunt to find the Emperor's hiding place, but the steps are incredibly contrived and leave me with a thousand questions. Everything seems haphazard and poorly thought out. The writers made sure they put in a few set ups for later events, but these set ups feel contrived themselves and only after the pay off did I understand why they were even in the movie. \n\nI also found the decision to bring back Palpatine to be an extremely weak idea. If you're going to crib ideas from the old comics (not necessarily a bad idea: KotOR II did it well), why would you take them from Dark Empire of all things? Surely there must have been less stupid ideas to repurpose. Even worse, [START OF SPOILERS] I really hated their decision to make Rey the granddaughter of Palpatine. It just feels lazy and lacking in creativity. There have been tons of heroes in Star Wars who don't descend from some \"powerful bloodline.\" Having her the daughter of nobodies was a great way to send the message that anyone can be a hero. Making her a Palpatine just felt like a cheap gimmick to introduce a theme of generational conflict into Rey's life, which we didn't need since we already had that with Kylo Ren. \n\nI was also disappointed that they chose to have Ben die. \"Bad guy turns good and sacrifices himself\" isn't a terrible trope, but it's kind of bare minimum for a redemption arc. I'm sure a good writer could have done something more interesting if any effort had been put into the story. It would have been so much more interesting if Ben had to live with his history of mass murder and work to atone for it. Instead he gets off easy. One good act and then oblivion. Boring.  \n\nFinally, I thought it was a very bad look to mostly cut Rose out of the movie. In her final (conscious) scene in the Last Jedi, she declares her love for Finn. Then in Rise of Skywalker, they just write her out of most of the movie and have Finn seemingly end up with some random character they introduce in this movie who has no bearing on the plot. [END OF SPOILERS] What is this supposed to say? That you can't have an interracial relationship in Star Wars? Or that Disney is caving to the backlash by some fans against Rose? Neither is a good look as it makes it seem like Disney is either anti-miscegenation or is siding with the mob that launched racist and sexist attacks against Kelly Marie Tran. \n\nOverall, Rise of Skywalker was just a boring mess. I know the other films have plenty of plot holes and contrivances too, but not on this level. Not even close. And I certainly wasn't so bored while watching them as to have time to analyze how contrived and disjointed everything was. While I didn't think the prequels were good movies, I would be more inclined to watch those again than Rise of Skywalker. What an embarrassing end to the series.",

The Force has left this franchise at light speed and I will not be returning anytime soon.

Pretty much every new studio release from Disney now has a 70%-80% user rating and many of them are well below average. On the surface \u2018The Rise of Skywalker' has a higher User Rating than the prior \u2018The Force Awakens' which is just absurd. Yet the Critics Rating are polar opposites, 52% for \u2018Rise of Skywalker' vs 93% for \u2018Force Awakens' at the time of writing.

The third act of this film tries to deliver a fan servicing climax, however, it does not feel deserved because of the build-up to that moment, and the stakes are not entirely felt. I was not emotionally invested in what happened. Most of all, I thought that the reintroduction of the main antagonist was entirely sudden and out of place with the direction that the trilogy had been moving in. Perhaps, despite the mixed reception of the Last Jedi, this film would have felt like more of a conclusion to a trilogy if it had worked on building on and improving elements from the second film. This being said, I think that out of the three sequel films, this one did the best job of honoring legacy characters, and is sure to satisfy many Star Wars fans.",

It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. \n\nI've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain.\n\nThe first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. \n\nAnd then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! \n\nIt's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.\n\nThis is most certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. My disappointment is immense.",

Lukes one awesome hallway scene in the Mandalorian series is better than any scene in the entire recent trilogy including way better than anything Disney did with luke in the last 2 films. lets use a montage of all the old actors and and cast?, or a montage of old clips?.

JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise. George seems to be more than happy to help, and Dave Filoni is already your employee. Disney, you failed yet again, and yet again you held all the right cards, but chose to play the wrong ones instead.",

It's my third favorite Star Wars film and the only thing stopping it from making it in the top 2 was that at the end they did Finn dirty his journey doesn't have a satisfying end to his story and this was clearly not the plan from the beginning and it felt rushed and quite sudden, had they had teases to build up to this occasion it would have made the movie a lot better.

TLJ and TROS confirmed the sequel trilogy could not top the George Lucas's prequel trilogy. The prequels are a cohesive connected story, existing and respecting the universe of Star Wars. \nIn all fairness, when TLJ ended I said, 'What's left to tell? Do I even care what's to come in Episode 9? Nope.' TROS is not completely JJ's fault. He actually tried, but in end he was not the right choice even in the beginning of TFA. It's on record, a lot of the material in the final cut was made by Disney and Lucasfilm without JJ knowing. IE, the kiss. However, JJ is not great at concluding stories and solving his own mysteries. Let's not forget Chris Terrio. The screenwriter who also brought us messy, over-bloated, poorly written scripts like Batman v. Superman, Justice League, and now TROS. All three films based on weak scripts which have to be extremely long and complex just to make sense. The pacing and editing of TROS is horrendous. Loaded with pissing contest moments between two polar opposite directors (JJ and Rian). Desperate attempts to appear like there was a roadmap in the beginning, when clearly there wasn't.\nA side note, the battle and fight scenes in entire sequel trilogy are awful. How is it possible, Star Wars, which has always been known to have great battle and lightsaber fight sequences, can go three movies without a single good battle? Rogue One not only accomplished this, but it's one of the best in all of Star Wars. Battles in the ST are simply show up and fight. No strategies, no side objectives, extremely short, cutting away to non-stop sequences. The final battle in TROS is easiest the worst in all of Star Wars. Forced, lacking in creative imagination. How often do we get spaceships that can't tell which way is up????\nThe sequel trilogy is copy and paste of the original trilogy and undoing the sacrifice of the key character. Vader's redemption of killing the emperor are undone and handed over to Rey. Consider this. The sequel trilogy made the OT obsolete. Sadly, you could watch the prequels, skip the OT, watch TFA, skip TLJ, and watch TROS. The actions and outcomes from Luke and Anakin in the OT are no longer necessary thanks to perfect Rey. It's all been boiling down to her. The Solos are gone, the Skywalkers are dead, a Palpatine remains and won. Thank you Disney for officially killing Star Wars. What we got was a trilogy of great trailer looking shots.",

Instead, we took a backwards step with an almost comical imitation of a Star Wars movie that crossed the line from nostalgic nod to the past into shameful copy. The storyline didn't make any sense and lacked any real emotional intelligence. It felt like they were \nmaking it up as they went along. The resolution of the relationship between Rey and Ben was anti-climatic and, given many people had guessed (wrongly) that those two characters were at least distantly related, the relationship seemed awkward, a la the kissing scene between Princess Leia and Luke in Empire Strikes Back.\nGood luck getting me to pay to see any more Star Wars movies, Disney.

            "content": "Star Wars: Episode IX is the first movie I learnt of with my senses and knowledge of Star Wars intact. Just before this movie was coming I watched all the previous movies so that I could catch up before this movie came. I wasn't born until The Phantom Menace, I didn't know anything about the other movies since I used to think Star Wars is only a cartoon, then when The Force Awakens came I had my board exams going on. And The Last Jedi was getting so much hate I thought Star Wars is just another franchise being done to death like Jurassic Park or The Matrix. So overall saying, this is the first Star Wars movie that I knew how to react on when it released. And that was definitely not a good reaction.\nSo first of all my problem is with how \"convenient\" the plot twists are. How on earth are the plot twists done so badly that there doesn't seem to be anything at stake! Rey and friends are getting sucked in sand, the animal inside is friendly. C3PO's memory gets formatted, R2D2 restores it. They don't know where to go, Rey just holds her knife and COMPARES IT WITH THE SURROUNDINGS AND FINDS HER WAY!?! And no, I'm not even getting to the dozen things that happened when she had to defeat Palpatine. Nothing matters in this movie for that matter. What happened to Rey becoming evil? What happened to the rebels on the planet where C3PO's memory was formatted? They were never brought up again.\nThe movie completely massacred everything that Star Wars stands for. I think the problem with all the sequel movies is that they are pandering to a much, much younger generation. Anything that could have been a little too mature was probably thrown out of the window by Mickey Mouse, because then how will the little girls from Middle East have Rey dolls if she did something mature like Luke and Anakin? Palpatine came back to life only so that Rey could smash him again and show how strong and smart she is. Ben Solo died only because he was trying to save Rey for some reason, even though he has Jedi powers so he could have just moved her out of the path. No culture, lifestyle, important character, backstory - nothing happened in here. It was just picking up on the disaster that Episode VIII was.\nAnd the worst part in the entire movie was when Rey took, or rather should I say, STOLE the Skywalker surname. What even was that scene? The way Luke and Leia were standing in the sky, they looked like her parents. The second worst for me would be the Rey and Ben kissing scene. I don't know how to say this, but Rey has a very sister-like look to her. Why would Ben ever do that? But of course, not everything is bad about Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Palpatine. Like I said before, it has a really awesome CGI, probably the best in the entire Star Wars franchise. The cinematography was also very good. The background score added to the intensity.\nAnd the best part - it's the last movie of the sequel trilogy. Finally this thing ended. We don't have to watch any more of Rey Palpatine anymore. I'm glad I've watched every single Star Wars movie now, so I have been able to catch up with the trend and now I can talk to anyone about Star Wars whenever the topic comes up.",

The only positive aspects are the impressive visuals, acting and score. \nThe film falters in the writing, with a clumsy attempt at damage control from the previous film, while offering hardly anything of substance to continue and resolve the story. The storyline is filled with plot conveniences, plot holes, clich\u00e9s and tropes from other sci fi films, as well as recycled beats from previous, superior, Star Wars films. The weight of delivering a satisfying ending to decades of storytelling loses Star Wars' trademark magic and is instead a cold, corporate carcass of cinema, that is unlikely to please fans, though may provide enough spectacle to entertain general audiences.\n4/10",

The follow up film to everyone's favorite Star Wars movie, \"The Last Jedi\", has an  incredibly difficult time fixing the mess that Rian Johnson created. This being the case, I think JJ Abrams, as flawed of a directer as he might be, should be commended a lot more for his work here. I think he did a good enough job with what he had, especially with how he integrated Leia after Carrie Fisher's death. You can tell he treated the characters with respect and that's a win in my book. Although the movie falters from some bad jokes every now and then, I think the humor is handled much better here thanks to characters like C-3PO, D-O, and of course, the one and only, Babu Frik. Also, the fight scenes were so much better in this one (the two lightsaber fights were actually really great and creative in they're execution), although nothing compared to the prequels or originals. The new planets that were introduced were also really cool and it was nice to see the Death Star wreckage. Now the scenes that I really loved were Leia's sacrifice, Ben's \"memory\" of Han, Luke's talk with Rey, and  the voices of all the Jedi speaking to Rey (they should've actually been shown as force ghosts but we can't have everything I guess). Some stuff that bothered me were Palpatine's return (barely explained and a bit goofy honestly) and Anakin not showing up at all as a force ghost. In the end, this movie is just ok. I enjoy it but it's definitely far from being a great movie. It presents some truly awesome ideas, but sadly doesn't have enough time to really flesh them out. Another disappointing Star Wars movie... but hey, at least it wasn't all bad.",

Rise Of Skywalker is a decent, but underwhelming end to a trilogy that started off strong with Force Awakens. J.J. Abrams returns to direct the finale, and though he is able to make a way to a resolution after the way The Last Jedi ended, he sadly has to resort to bringing back an old villain in Palpatine. Palpatine is no where to be heard or seen in the previous two films, so his reveal as the mastermind is extremely confusing and underwhelming. Rey and her comrades are fighting for the universe, while Kylo Ren is still hell bent on winning for the dark side. Though, this battle should create a lot of spectacular sequences for the finale, Rise kind of feels a little flat in terms of excitement. The action sequences look cool and are grand, but they're missing something. It almost feels like things just happen for the sake of the story to end. Kylo gets a nice end to his story arc, while the twist with Rey's lineage just feels unwanted. If she ended up being a nobody and still saved the universe, it would have super poignant and meaningful. It would have given the meaning of \"may the force be with you\" a lot more depth. But with the twist, it just didn't sit well. Daisy Ridley does deliver a great performance though, and its cool to see how she delivers in her final performance in that character. As for the films other technical departments, it scores in production and music. John Williams delivers yet another wonderful soundtrack, and it will sad and tough to know that this will be his last Star Wars film. All in all, Rise of Skywalker works but plays it safe a little too much. Hopefully, when the new series starts up, they will opt for a more challenging storyline that doesn't focus on familiarity.",

You know how it goes - the galaxy is brought to life by glorious special effects, pulse-pounding action, a great score, and awesome performances from the cast. But alas, Abrams can't rise to the artistic challenge issued by Episode VIII director Rian Johnson to end the series with daring. Rather, he seeks to simultaneously placate both the rabid devotees of the franchise who can't handle any deviation from their own expectations, and casual film goers who may have no expectations at all, by bringing back previously dead and ever-popular arch villains and undoing some of the twists that made VIII so great. It feels focused-grouped into mild tepidity, offering little more than fan service and nostalgia in an attempt to hurt no ones feelings while getting as many butts in the seats as possible. There are some wonderful character moments, particularly between the Po and Finn, who have found a wavelength that makes there friendship feel like brotherhood, and between Rey and Kylo, who build on their connection from the previous film that ends their characters arcs in a predictable but still pretty satisfying fashion (excepting a final, forced moment between the two that made me throw my hands in disgust). This probably won't be the final Star Wars film, or trilogy. 15 years from now, some young film student who saw these movies in theaters will be the next talent to reintroduce us to a galaxy far, far away.

Looking back at the trilogy these characters are not compelling or interesting. They copied characters we'd already gotten but missed their soul and essence. I could have lived without the annoying Kylo Ren. This movie is supposed to wrap up the trilogy but almost flat out admits the previous two films didn't need to even exist. Go back and watch the originals, or even watch the prequels and tell me I'm wrong here. Star Wars become popular because it had good characters, interesting stories that evoked a larger mythos and felt familiar while also exploring cool ideas.

It was the vehicle through which I made one of my first groups of friends in elementary school, it continued to deliver exciting content through the prequels and spin offs as I grew up, and through the first two \"new\" sequels (Episode VII and VIII), it continued to deliver for me as a fan.  I passed down my love of this to my children too.\n\nI share that because the abject disappointment that Rise of Skywalker gave me was so unsettling.  The underdeveloped story, the lack of character development, the shameless (and childish) [and poorly executed] attempts to retcon themes and plots from The Last Jedi...I had a very hard time following the movie in theatres when I saw it, and in the several times I have attempted to rewatch it since it was released I can't even get through to the end before turning it off.\n\nAs an educator, I see a film like this and cannot help but wonder aloud why this kind of failure is acceptable in the entertainment industry.  Our trio of new heroes - Rey, Finn, and Poe - they instantly vanished into obscurity after this movie flopped so badly.  For decades, characters like Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kanobi, and Darth Vader - they have served as philosophical archetypes that provide meaning and significance in life and storytelling - far beyond just the entertainment on the big screen.  What lessons do our trio of new heroes teach us now?  Through The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, lessons existed and were debated among fans and non-fans alike.  After Rise of Skywalker?  None of it matters because Emperor Palpatine returned oh and Rey's heritage is revealed and oh they defeat the Emperor and the Sith somehow and now Rey is a Skywalker with a yellow lightsaber?  There was no deeply seeded foreshadowing for any of this.  Instead we got an ongoing chain of irrelevant side characters that ultimately ended up being irrelevant - Maz, DJ, Rose, BB-9E, the Knights of Ren, Ochi, Zorii Bliss (I had to actually look up her name because she was such a random insert character), Jannah, not to mention forcing Leia into Rise of Skywalker.\n\nI actually created an account on Rotten Tomatoes solely for the purpose of expressing my dissatisfaction with this movie.  It is not subject to debate that this movie is good or not - it is objectively a poor final product.  Sure, it was visually beautiful in moments, but only visually.  The story and characters were poorly executed and delivered a HUGE disservice to true life long fans of this franchise.  Now all we can do is hope someone will come along and rerelease a different director's cut of this film that actually makes sense.  Rey, Finn, Poe, and others deserve it too.",

Emperor Palpatine is randomly back from the dead for unexplained reasons. This immediately ruins the First Order as villains, turning them from interesting neo-fascists to puppets of the Emperor. It also ruins the arc of Return of the Jedi and Vader's sacrifice.\n\nThe emperor has somehow built himself a fleet of thousands of Star Destroyers on a random planet with no industrial capacity. This continues the sequel trilogy's complete disinterest in creating a vaguely plausible universe (the entire New Republic was in one star system! Space ships do stern chases until they run out of fuel! A fringe political splinter group can build a bigger weapon than a centralized government) but takes it to new levels. Yes, epic requires suspension of disbelief. But it requires its own internal logic and world building. You need to be able to imagine beyond the conflict on the screen.\n\nIt only goes downhill from here. Lando gets a cameo but no characterization. Smoke gets handwaved. Kylo gets redeemed.

I love kylo\u2019s arc over the last 3 films. Rey\u2019s arc could have been done a little better with her being the main protagonist. I felt as if J.J Abrams saw what Rian Johnson did with \u201c The Last Jedi\u201d and tried to fix it but it was already to little to late.

I felt nothing.

She acquired all her Jedi powers and mastering the lightsaber in such a short time with any shortcomings unlike the previous main characters, so Palpatine being defeated so easily is just ridiculous.

And when I saw this in theaters when it came out it was like I was watching the 2013 Oldboy, and It was so unimaginative. Yesterday I watched it again to see the problems and the things it did right. Firstly their are scenes that drag on for way, way to long and It was very annoying. The plot is the EXACT SAME AS EPISODE 6!!!! The score is fine, the editing is ok, and the sound is decent. The good things are the cinematography and the CGI, the film has a lot of nice shots in the film especially the use of color. and the cg well its a star wars film.

The main example of this is Palpatine, that he cloned Snoke, and that he conveniently had a fleet of star destroyers under an ocean of ice which were all equipped with hundreds of red storm-troopers and pilots. All of this completely contradicts everything that the sequels were building up to.

Kylo Ren's struggle with the light is also cool and his reunion with Han is beautiful, Leia was implemented much more than I thought even though Carrie Fisher sadly died and her death scene was really emotional, the hearing of the Jedi voices was incredible and the action sequences are phenomneal, particularly the final battle and lightsaber duel. It's just an entertaining time and I like all the callbacks to previous movies. It truly feels like an emotional finale.\n\nThere's things I didn't like though. Finn is given such little to do, the knights of Ren are sadly wasted, Palpatine coming back is really lazy (but since I love the character it didn't bother me too much) and the story is quite predictable and safe but I don't care what any of the haters say.

But there is one problem! It seems like J.J Abrams wanted to do the reverse of TLJ but went way too overboard in the process. There is no reason why Palpatine should be there as it makes Vader's death pointless, instead of the movie being slow it feels completely rushed, and a lot of the parts do not go together. Let me just say that I was a kid when the prequels came out and watched the original trilogy at an early age and as a kid I could understand why Luke had to find Yoda or why Anakin turned to the dark side. I'm in my 20s now and I don't understand some of the parts in the last two films. Also despite Kylo Ren and Finn being my two favorite characters in the sequel trilogy, they got very little screen time in both this and TLJ and I have no clue why. It's a two stars because it's not the worst movie ever made (keep in mind that The Star Wars Holiday Special exists), it's just a major disappointment for what is advertised as the end of a trilogy.",

Make the emperor be able to blow entire fleets up with his hands. Some people will absolutely love it, because it is a very cool looking.

What the series was trying to do was recreate the magic of the \"Big 3\" from the original series (Luke, Leia, and Han) and also give each of the original Big 3 their own send out. It just landed flat in my eyes. But I do give credit to the actors, they all were incredibly good, but my problem comes with the script.

Jesus, how illogical it is.\nLet's go to the Revenge Of The Sith once again. \nAnakin Skywalker is having nightmares showing his wife, Padme, dying during the childbirth which makes Anakin turn to the dark side.\nWell, with the Rise Of Skywalker's logic, Anakin could simply remain Jedi and be Padme during the childbirth, and, if something goes wrong, he could simply put his hand on her and revive her. \nThat's absolutely not cool. It makes no sense, looking at the prequels.\n\n3. REYLO?\nI know that there are lots of people who are Rey and Kylo Ren shippers.\nBut, it also makes no sense.

LEIA'S DEATH FOR NO REASON?\nYeah, this is one of the worst things in the movie. Why did Leia die? No one even touched her, she was not too old, she wasn't ill?\nSo, when Rey stabbed Kylo in his belly, Leia said 'Beennn' and died. For what? Why?\n\nOf course, Rey calling herself 'Skywalker' and burying Anakin's lightsaber in the sand are also some of the worst things in the movie.",

What made it worse was Palpatine being Rey\u2019s grandfather... like I\u2019m sorry that took me out, I don\u2019t need everyone in the Star Wars universe to relate to each other if it makes no sense to the overall plot. Rey from knowhere is better than Rey Palpatine, you didn\u2019t have to relate her. She had her own arc throughout these movies!! Now the movie does have a lot of great moments but also moments that feel recycled from other movies... I\u2019m sorry but the final battle is literally a copy of the main climax sequence from Avengers: Endgame and it\u2019s rough that the same studio (Disney) just let both Marvel and Star Wars recycle that same emotionally impactful moment but like it didn\u2019t do much to me and Marvel did it better. This movie felt like an obligation after the fan outcry from The Last Jedi, they tried to make up the arc and fix certain things that just didn\u2019t feel cohesive throughout the trilogy. This trilogy was not planned properly, instead of making one cohesive story throughout three movies, it just felt like they created the script for each one based off opinions on Twitter and that kinda sucked. Now the kiss between Kylo and Rey took me out of the movie completely, that was so cringe. Now the movie itself was fun even though a lot of elements took me out of the movie. Is it a bad movie? No it isn\u2019t a bad movie at all but I felt like I could\u2019ve rated this higher if the plot elements were more cohesive. Lea\u2019s death didn\u2019t feel earned or emotionally impactful enough although I do understand they didn\u2019t have much to work with given the death of Carrie :( but it just felt like they tried to undo everything from The Last Jedi and ultimately it just didn\u2019t feel planned out at all. The genuine conclusion was fine though I just didn\u2019t like the pacing and the overall writing in this for the most part. They needed one cohesive story across 3 movies, not adjusting everything based off of fan backlash. The Jedi \u201cbe with me\u201d moment was the best part of the whole movie and it felt like Endgame planted that scene in Disney\u2019s head with the avengers coming out of the portals... something just felt very off about this movie to me, but it isn\u2019t bad (3/5)",

Rey and Kylo Ren exchange life force (calling the force baby that's coming in the sequel!!) and beat up an old man. It's good stuff!!! \n\nSome things to look forward to: lots of ghosts, Rey randomly changes her name, Kylo Ren randomly changes HIS name, they pull a random villain out of a hat so there's someone to kill at the end, and there's plenty of fighting in a variety of locations. Kylo Ren keeps Darth Vader's head on his spaceship, possibly in his bedroom. Rey has magical healing powers. They fight in a cool shipwreck that's still in the ocean.  And of course there is a space battle at the end! 8 stars for constant action and magical spirit bonds, minus 3 stars for not explaining who the old man is or ever bringing him up in the other movies.",

Palpatine returns, but is criminally wasted. To this day, I don't understand what the point of bringing him back was, just to die effortlessly.\n\nThis movie suffers from the same problems as the other movies: there's only the barest of continuity, and very little opportunity for the characters to develop and grow. The entire structure of this movie felt like a fanfiction: from rushed narrative, to having the producer's new, totally original character take down the big bad of a previous story.

            "content": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the most underwhelming Star Wars movie since Attack of the Clones, and just as predictable as Revenge of the Sith. Now before I go into ranting about all of this movie's issues I'll first state the good it has and what I liked about it. //1. Ben Solo is the only character in this movie that has a real arc. Finally turning to the good side and finally excepting who he is. 2. The pacing in this movie is surprisingly good. 3. The visual effects are still on the same level as TFA and TLJ. 4. The movie still manages to be enjoyable (despite all of its flaws) and had some cool scenes in it (like the desert scene with Rey flipping in the air and taking down Ben's ship).\\\\\nNow here is all of the bad, the missed opportunities, and the why?\n//1. First of all... Palpatine. Just why? The Last Jedi gave us some very deep and intriguing stuff to think about. These sequels are about creating something new and letting go of the past, so why did they even need to bring Palpatine back?\n2. Nobody has an arc in this movie other than Ben Solo. Try and remember the arcs in this movie other than his, you can't. Everyone got an arc in The Last Jedi, EVEN ROSE GOT AN ARC IN THAT MOVIE AND EVERYONE HATES HER. But no one, not even Rey, learns anything or grows into a different person. Everyone stays the same. \n3. Leia's death is very rushed and doesn't make any sense. So she could use the force to fly through space in The Last Jedi but has to die in order to say one word to her son?? This is just one example of this movie being inconsistent with the rules that the previous movies set up. \n4. The Knights of Ren seem really cool. They look like real bad asses but we only see them in action in one scene and that's it. Hopefully we see more of them somewhere else but it was a huge opportunity that was sadly missed. \n5. There was just way too much humor in this movie. It seemed like every other line an actor says is trying to be funny or crack a witty joke and it's just too much. I know that in The Last Jedi there was also some unnecessary humor, but it's at least tamed compared to how much is in this movie. \n6. Poe and Finn's chemistry and entire relationship is just so weird in this movie. Poe is literally so caught up in Finn's business everywhere they go. In the other movies it was just a bro friendship that was fine and cool. But in this movie it's portraying them as if they are gay for each other. I know it sounds a little ridiculous but they just seemed off in this movie. It was also really cringe-worthy to see them on screen together. The lines that they say to each other are so cringe-worthy to hear and that actually goes back to the humor part that I thought was bad. \n7. The force rules in this movie are so freaking inconsistent and out of place that I don't even know what the rules are anymore. But it's really not only with this movie, it's with the prequels and in some parts of the sequels too. But anyway, my first question lies with Finn and Rey. In The Last Jedi, it is said that the force can basically be with anyone and everyone since Rey's parents were nobody and she is a pretty powerful jedi. Then they use that for Finn in this movie since he was able to locate Rey AND found out which ship had the signal at the end. But the movie also contradicts this by saying that Rey was a Palpatine, and by saying that Rey is a Palpatine it basically says that only Jedi/Sith can use the force. So which is it movie. Is the force with everyone or is it with Jedi/Sith only? Or do you have to have Midi-chlorians in your cells? My second question then lies with Ben Solo and Leia. First of all, Ben dies by turning into a ghost like a Jedi would... but I thought he was a Sith Lord with good intentions? The movie makes it seem like he was a Jedi all along but with bad intentions, but this is not him. And also why does Leia not turn into a ghost as soon as she dies? Why does she turn into a ghost only when Ben does? This makes absolutely no sense to me and this movie officially made me clueless on what the force is and its rules. \n8. Whatever Finn wanted to say to Rey is never answered and is actually hilarious that it never was answered, but not in a good way. \n9. This movie is basically anti The Last Jedi when it doesn't need to be. This movie could have been such an amazing and solid trilogy if it wasn't for the fear of the creators worrying about criticism from Star Wars fans because of The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi sets this movie up perfectly for whatever it wanted to be and it somehow manages to be underwhelming and unexciting. Apparently they had a completely different movie planned out which honestly looked nothing like this movie. In fact looking at the concept art for that movie, IT LOOKED SO FREAKING COOL AND SO MUCH BETTER. \n10. This is probably my biggest problem with the movie. This movie has no risks at all. Nobody dies and therefore it felt like there were no stakes. They took the Star Wars saying \"nobody is ever really gone\" too literally. It would have been really emotional and heartbreaking to see our old heroes and comic reliefs finally go but nope it's okay they're never gonna die don't worry guys. THIS IS THE FINALE OF THE SKYWALKER SAGA. This is the one movie out of the entire saga that should have taken the MOST risks. This caused the movie to be super underwhelming and overall... disappointing. \\\\\nHonestly, if I had the power to redo any movie ever, I would choose this movie and then tell Lucasfilm to hire Colin Trevorrow to do his thing with HIS own srcipt. Just reading some of the things he had planned makes me so disappointed in what this movie could have been. Also the kiss in the end was so unneeded wtf.",

Kylo Ren (the great Adam Driver), the new Supreme Leader of the First Order and evil son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, has set about looking for Palpatine, all the while also looking to continue his Dark Side seduction of Rey.

The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren is good. It is a competent film regarding dialogue and acting. But story is a very important aspect to me when it comes to Star Wars movies.

Han returned for some closure. Overall this movie had an unnecessarily difficult task and it did a fairly decent job. I would appreciate a fan edit that trims the trilogy together.

            "content": "The Rise of Skywalker is a bloated and convoluted mess of a movie that should have never been released into theaters. JJ is not creative in any way shape or form, and gives us another copy of the OT. TFA was a copy of a new Hope, TLJ gave us something new, but JJ didn't know how to handle Kylo Ren being the main villain and instead he brought back a preexisting character who's deaths meaningful. There is nothing new or creative in this movie. \n\nThis movie will satisfy a few types of people:\n1 If you are a casual viewer who just wants to have fun\n2. If you hate The Last Jedi and want everything set up in it to be undone\nBut if you care about a movie having  good story and character development and whatnot, you will hate it just as much as I did.\n\nI'll only cover a few things because I don't want this to be too long.\n\nI just want to start off by saying that this movie is only meant to satisfy fans who hated The Last Jedi. JJ refused to take on the challenge of making things that people didn't like in TLJ better, but instead he just undid everything and replaced it with something that will satisfy the man children who couldn't handle that TLJ did something they weren't expecting. People wanted Rey to be the descendant of some powerful force user, so now she is a Palatine. people wanted Rey, Finn and Poe to have more time together so the first half of the movie is wasted on them going on a video game adventure quest to find a map. People didn't like Rose, so she is written out. People don't like how a female told a man what to do in TLJ, so no more of that. This entire movie is just a retcon of The Last Jedi. It's a pile of fan service that is tied together through an awful story.\n\nThe editing in this movie is honestly embarrassing, and I'm sorry but the acting isn't great. there are so many moments where the characters react in the completely wrong way. It feels like the actors were reacting to something different, but then the editors didn't have a clip of the actors reacting to what they were supposed to be reacting to and they just through in another clip in which the characters say something vaguely similar to what they should have said and call it done. When they think Chewbacca explodes Finn says \"No\" in a way that you would hay if you had just lost the ball in a football game. He should have emotion because he thinks his friend just blew up and died, but nope.\n\nThe visuals are not creative. It's all stuff we've seen before and nothing new. In TLJ we got Crait where the surface was covered in salt and underneath was red. it was a beautiful and creative visual. This movie has nothing. We get another desert planet, a planet with houses that look like they could be on earth where it snows, a planet with grass and an ocean, and a planet that is just dark. Nothing is creative.\n\nThe first half of the film is fun to watch, but the pacing is horrible, it's wasting time that should have been spent covering the massive amount of ground they had to, and the plot is very generic and has nothing new to offer. The entire first half feels like something you would watch in a Star wars kids TV shows rather than the final movie in a franchise. \n\nFinn does nothing in this movie. In TFA he learns to be a loyal friend. In TLJ he learns to fight for a larger cause. In TROS he yells \"Rey\" a lot. He has no arc whatsoever. At the end he gets force powers as a plot convenience so he can tell them which ship is the main ship. It's ridiculous how he can tell you out of 500 Star Destroyers, which one is the main ship by using the Force, but on Pasano he can't use the force to tell the difference between two transports when somebody he loves is on one.\n\nThe second half of this movie is horrible. It's worse than anybody could imagine. I don't even know where to begin because it was so miserable and exhausting. First, Palpatine is back. JJ just undid Anakin's redemption. Anakin was turned to the dark side by Palpatine, then turned back to the light by Luke. To ensure that he was good again he gave his life to defeat palatine and destroy the dark. \n\nRey being a Palatine is the single worst thing to happen in this movie. Rey being moody is important for a multitude of reasons. One, her counterpart is a Skywalker. He has this massive legacy he has to carry on his shoulders and he feels so much pressure and stress about it. Rey is the opposite. Her weakness is that she has no legacy, she has no lineage. Also, Rey being a nobody is a reminder that anybody can be with the force, you don't need to have a parent with the force because it can manifest in anybody. Then JJ retcons this by making Rey a Palpatine. \n\nI had fun watching the first half even though the pacing was awful and it was riddled with plot conveniences, plot holes, and retcons, but the second half is unforgivably bad. I'm shocked to my core that people actually enjoy this mess.",

            "content": "The expectation must have been too great.\n\nI had seen some negative comments, so I was ready to accept a certain level of disappointment, yet I was still hoping. Enough to go see the film on the very first day it opened, both to satisfy my curiosity, and to prevent seeing some spoilery stuff on the web before seeing the film.\n\nGeorge Lucas' STAR WARS has been part of my genetic makeup as a film lover ever since I saw the original in the theaters in 1977 when I was 12 years old. I liked movies before, but this started a lifelong passion with cinema, first in science-fiction, and then, a much broader spectrum as I grew older. While I loved the first two STAR WARS movies, I was however never a fan of RETURN OF THE JEDI, and positively detested the prequels, which I have never dared to revisit after my initial viewing at the theater. Still I was excited yet cautious in 2015 when a concluding trilogy was brought forth by Disney.\n\nIt is an ambitious and scary endeavor; to find a satisfactory conclusion to a saga started 42 years ago. I can understand why director J.J. Abrams, who had earned a bad reputation with handling endings after his lackluster denouement to his popular series LOST, finds this task challenging. However, he has an undeniable talent with rebooting movie series like he demonstrated with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III (almost strangled out of existence by the excesses of John Woo), STAR TREK, and of course STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS.\n\nWith STAR WARS: EPISODE IX - THE RISE OF SKYWALKER , Abrams creates a film that suffers the same faults that plagued FORCE AWAKENS; a desire to please the status quo that creates a succession of scenes that are strongly reminiscent of fan-favorites moments in the previous series, trying to capture the lightning of the original trilogy. While in THE FORCE AWAKENS, Abrams managed to circumvent that sense of d\u00e9ja vu with a strong cast that married adroitly members of the classic cast with charming new characters and a streamlined script by Lawrence Kasdan and Abrams himself that managed to make the audience care about those characters and their tribulations.\n\nIn RISE, however, we are assaulted with so much action that the characters have little much to do than react, and we are left in the end with the impression that the only ones who have a chance to emote or grow through the story are Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). They are in fact given the chance to stare at each other with intensity and duel many times in the film, in often gorgeous set-pieces. The conclusion of their complex relationship won't be a surprise to many, although the big reveal of Rey's origins may be. Surprising. Not great. Just surprising.\n\nThe score by John Williams is appropriately composed of a string of greatest hits, which is a pleasure to hear, but accentuates the sense of d\u00e9ja vu. The will to offer the fans ''what they want'' creates awkward moments when characters show up or situation occurs just for the sake of fan service. Such scenes end up being maudlin more than anything, with a floundering sense of false sentimentality. There are moments in the film manufactured to elicit an emotional response. And I am the perfect target for such moments. I am a complete crybaby at movies. I will get choked up and tear up extremely easily. Yet here, the only moment I did was at the very beginning of the film,  in anticipation as the lights went out and I felt a surge of excitement in the capacity crowd in the theater.\n\nI am one of those who actually enjoyed the previous chapter, THE LAST JEDI, where I felt that director Rian Johnson took chances and went into very interesting directions, even putting in a bit of a political statement. After having watched Abrams' last effort, I have to confirm that Johnson's film was a much better film, and had stunningly emotional moments (Laura Dern's sacrifice, Mark Hamill's last moments) that finds no equal in this last installment.\n\nProbably the most telling moment from the projection was the complete silence from the crowd as the end credits appeared onscreen (after probably my favorite scene of the film, which beautifully caps the series with a nostalgic twist). No applause, from a crowd that had shown great enthusiasm at the start of the showing. Just stunned silence.\n\nStill, the film moves along briskly, and the special effects are impressive, but as a conclusion to a flawed, yet beloved saga, this final chapter fails sadly to actually ''rise'' to the occasion (pun shamefully and fully intended).\n\nP.S.: is it just me or is the Force way more powerful in the new movies than in the past? Must be all that midichlorian in the water.",

The ships not being able to leave the planet is also lazy writing due to the explanation being they don't know which way is up.  This lazy writing is mostly caused by the director's want for them to have more stakes then Return of the Jedi but he also wants there to be a way for the good guys to win.

Absolutely nonsensical plot from beginning to end, as if the script was a 2nd grade writing project.  Every character was wasted because JJ and Chris Terrio had no interest in taking on the challenge.  At least The Last Jedi dared to be a film with a coherent story.  Characters constantly expositing plot is not a story, and it is unfathomable to me that these guys were allowed to write this screenplay.  Zero craft.",

It was definitely the best theater experience compared to the rest of the trilogy, although when you think about it the plot makes no sense at all. Palpatine returning and getting killed the way he is killed is a terrible idea, not only because undermines the whole OT and Anakin's redemption but also because it makes him look like a dumb idiot who can't stop shooting lightning until half of his face is melted. The protagonists dynamic between each other is decent, although individually the characters are not compelling at all. Rey is not a memorable hero, Poe is the same character as in TFA and Finn is just... there, yelling and playing with space horses. As inclusive as this movies are supposed to be, the writers are too cowards to romantically pair the only two characters that have some sort of chemistry in the whole trilogy, Finn and Poe. Instead, they find a female romantic interest for BOTH of them. Kylo and Rey kissing in the end is as funny as dumb, he was literally Hitler a few hours before that but hey, he is good now! The whole wayfinder search was boring as hell and ultimately pointless as Kylo just smashes the damn thing, the attempt to put Leia in the movie by using unused footage from TFA is passable at best and the whole concept behind the Palpatine's fleet is just awful. The fact that the ships don't know which way is up still irritates me, and I don't understand why did they think that making them all capable of destroying entire planets was a good thing. Even with all these terrible mistakes, there are some aspects of the movie that are decent. The music is good as always, the visuals are stunning, the movie in general is pretty entertaining and the lightsaber duel, even though is nowhere as good as the ones in the prequels, is decent. Oh, and Babu Frik is incredibly cute.",

But of course as I said this film is very rushed and feels overwhelming to process. Kathleen Kennedy and Disney completely screwed over this movie. But it's not just them, I believe this movie was terrible because of Ryan Johnson's the last Jedi. After watching that movie and over again, I also realize that there was things in there that I hated, like, Luke becoming the asshole that gives up, and then in the end he's all OK I'm back now but I'm dying! It's just bullshit. And there's so many other things that I'm not gonna get into right now. I really want the JJ cut to happen. Time will only tell if that will actually happen.

While we're all painfully aware of how Lucas blew it with episodes 1-3, Disney's 6-9 were just as bad, and in some ways worse. This series, and Rise of Skywalker in particular, represent the worst of Star Wars. The characters are flat and uninspiring. The story is a boring convoluted mess of politics and morally ambiguous ideology. And the hero's journey has become a punchline of political correctness. Now that this main story arc has come to an inglorious Death Star like ending, I implore Disney to get back to what made Star Wars the cultural and cinematic phenomenon it once was.

In 4-5 he learns that he has a son, and this almost transforms his mind to thinking that he doesn't need the emporer anymore. In 6 he overcomes his fear and \" kills \" the emprorer, thus completing his massive 6 movie arc and this sees the prophecy of the chosen one fulfilled, he finally brings balance to the force. Now with palpatine back, none of that matters. Another thing was the completely rushed pace of the movie. There is also a lot of lazy editing and plot holes the size of a galaxy. Another thing is the terrible lazy writing and the use of something called a \" maguffin \". A maguffin is an object that solely exist to advance the plot and is something that terrible writers use when they have no other way to advance said plot. In this movie the maguffin is the sith way finder, which serves no other purpose than to advance the plot through the finding of these objects. Another huge thing that annoys me about this movie is how they tried to copy the pivotal moment in Avengers Endgame at the end of this movie. In Endgame Thanos says \" I am inevitable \" and then Iron man says \" and I, am iron man \" and then snaps, Blowing away Thanos and saving the day. In ROS palpatine says \" I am all the sith \" and then Rey says \" and I, am all the Jedi\" blowing him away and saving the day. The main thing about this movie that still absolutely pisses me off is how at the end she calls herself skywalker. How fucking dare you call yourself a name that you have not earned! The entire movie everyone is preaching how you shouldn't be afraid of who you really are, and then Rey decides to hide it all behind a fake name that is respected throughout the galaxy. All in all this is a complete failure as a movie and as a peice in the Star Wars trilogy. I encourage anyone who is reading this to watch the original trilogy and Revenge if the sith in the prequel trilogy if you want to know what compelling stories and plots look like in a Star Wars movie. I would never recommend any true Star Wars fan watch this movie. I'm not actually sure who likes this movie.",

The Last Jedi had done so much damage to the Star Wars franchise that no single movie could undo that mess within only a couple hours.

The death of Carrie Fisher seriously affected the development of this movie and it shows in the storyline which seems nonsensical on many levels.  Upon my second viewing, I started seeing more of this movie start to shine.  Critics scoff at the so-called \"fan service.\"  But there's a difference between mocking \"fan service\" and showing respect on established canon.  I appreciated seeing people like Wedge make this movie.  Ultimately, this third trilogy fails to conclude the Skywalker story arc because The Last Jedi had removed the setup from The Force Awakens, forcing Abrams to rush the trilogy conclusion into 2 hours rather than the summed 7-8 hours for a trilogy.  But even though the third trilogy didn't elevate the franchise, 2 of the 3 movies were enjoyable.  But I do wish there was another movie with Rey at the forefront.  I feel they could've done more with her.  And please bring back more dynamic lightsaber fights.  The sword action of this trilogy was so lumbering.  The last act near the very end began to have that faster dynamic action that was reminiscent of the prequel trilogy.",

(Quick side note, I totally didn't pay to see Uncut Gems and then sneak in to see Star Wars as a protest against Disney and not wanting to give them my hard-earned money). The Marketing itself as the end of a nine-part saga with JJ Abrams himself stated in multiple interviews but more feel like it's the merciful end to this jumbled mess of a Trilogy that lost it stride as soon as The Last Jedi was released and immediately became controversial among the fan base and mainstream Hollywood critics praising the film to no end. When I first saw TLJ in theaters despite the issues I had with it on the spot I had a blast but after a few days critical thinking it made less and less the flaws became more apparent and more kept popping up, and the Humor was not only childish but Inter fears with scenes that could have added great dramatic tension. Now fan backlash for questionable decisions is nothing new in this franchise dating back to the holiday special the sequels and prequels, but the backlash to this film and how it was handled left a fatal rift not just between critics and audiences but in the fan base itself because whenever its brought up it's like bringing up politics in the middle of a holiday dinner \ud83c\udf7d table with some very opinionated in-laws, it almost always boils down to shouting matches, name-calling, animosity between each other, and in the process ruin everyone else's a good time. \nNow for the movie itself as it is every bit as disappointing as the leaks made it out to be and it feels like it was hacked together by constant reshoots, re-edits, test screening, and rushed last-minute ideas that were given no thought or time to develop naturally in the story. For example, it's obvious to any Star Wars fan even if they only watch the theatrically released movies \ud83c\udfa5 that The Emperor's return makes absolutely no sense in the context of this trilogy story as his story clearly ended in 1983 with Return of the Jedi along with Anakin's redemption and the Skywalker saga. With the prequels love em or hate em are there just add some more lore and background to the galaxy \ud83c\udf0c at large and how there was always a much bigger game at play. But with this movie not one of them gives me a hint of what's going on in the galaxy at large, why did the new republics stop pursuing ex imperials, why weren't they prepared for another potential conflict if it arises, why are they so incompetent and why should I root for them defeat the First Order, and now the final Order speaking of which I could get a grasp that they just wanna return the empire to its former glory but these villains are a far cry from the original even the droid army was more intimidating then these guys because at least they didn't fall for some dumb yo mama prank calls. In fact the more I think about the film it could plot holes The Movie \ud83c\udf7f as just thinking \ud83e\udd14 about it makes less and less sense. Writing-wise the only good thing about is that the new main characters are finally all together going in adventures and even have a few decent and well-acted scenes together (when they're not being told to read forced marvel humor). Even then it was still too little too late as their dynamic should have been built upon throughout the Trilogy and had nowhere near the camaraderie of Han, Luke, and Leia.\nOn a technical level it is stunning to look at. The VFX and practical effects are something to be appreciated and kudos to the make and prosthetics department for all the neat looking alien \ud83d\udc7d designs. But for a film \ud83c\udf9e of this magnitude this should be an automatic given with its more than $250million budget back by the biggest film studio in Hollywood and has the best artist-designers and VFX technology in the business at the click of a button or phone \u260e\ufe0f call away. Too bad it couldn't save the dodgy editing poor choice of shots and clumsily choreographed lightsaber duels as its ether Medium close-ups or extreme wide an awkward balance of either to close or too far (yes I'm making the bold statement that these are the worst duels in the history of the franchise). Being an Indie filmmaker watched several small budget projects and been on multiple film sets I've seen experience so much more being done with so much less all because they have an undying passion to tell the story they want to tell without having to abide by mainstream norms. Overall I know I'm gonna have quite the debate with a few friends \ud83d\udc6c who for some reason loves these films, and I do wish I saw this with a bigger group of people to talk to right afterward, I did have a few good conversations with some strangers as I was walking \ud83d\udeb6out and I give Star Wars episode xi the Rise of Skywalker a 3/10",

It requires precise calculations...\"), to the ridiculously stupid and unexplained rescue/resurrection of Palpatine after Return of the Jedi, to the forced kiss between Kylo and Rey, to Kylo's miraculous recovery after being thrown over a seemingly bottomless chasm, to yet another Death Star/Starkiller/planet exploder weapon, to yet another ridiculously simple flaw in said weapon, and so on.\n\nI don't know how a group of adults (using that term loosely here) sat in a reading room for this and did not see the gaping holes in the plots and the complete disregard for suspension of disbelief, which is necessary for any movie to be compelling.

If the characters turned and stared at the camera for laughs it would not have been any less disrupting to my suspension of disbelief than the poor storytelling and flashing and noise at the end.\n\nOn a positive note, this is at least mildly more entertaining than The Last Jedi, due to Abrams' better treatment of humor, and better story pacing. To be fair, a lot of stuff happens during this 2.5 hour film, but it's always better when things happen for a reason, and so much of this movie happens for no real reason, other than to sell toys or compensate for the damage done by TLJ. As visually stunning as it is, the movie is just a horrible example of storytelling, and ultimately I walked away from this trilogy in the Star Wars franchise painfully aware that it IS a franchise, and that none of the new characters are especially likeable, not even Rey, who rightfully earned the title of Mary Sue due to her inexplicable ability to master Jedi skills that took Luke Skywalker years and much effort to develop...all because of her blood line. Rey, Poe, and Finn are all very shallow, forgettable characters who emote, but don't convey real struggle or desire and achieve greatness almost by entitlement. Poe magically maneuvers spaceships impossibly fast around targets and never misses, Rey goes from picking up Luke's light saber to being a saber fighting master over what? A few months? She never changes her outfit once throughout the whole trilogy! And Finn? He occasionally shoots and blows up a TIE fighter and shouts \"whoa!\" when he does, and through luck manages to avoid his own death at least a few times. As I said, completely shallow and forgettable characters.\n\nSo glad this is over, like one feels after watching a loved one suffer a long illness--sad, but relieved.",

A lot of time is spent reversing a lot of the strange decisions made in TLJ too, which could have been a refreshing change for the sequel trilogy-- but the change was pulled off so lazily. The reinsertion of Palpatine was just a bad decision on the writing team's part. It makes little to no sense in the pre-sequel canon.

Anything that followed the storyline of The Last Jedi was going to be garbage anyway, but aside from that, RoS suffers from lack of continuity to the previous trilogies. Like TLJ, there are so many things that happen in RoS where it's like \"Well why didn't this character do that move in \"Episode whatever\" to avoid this problem or defeat that enemy?\" And there are way too many coincidences as well. Getting into specifics would just take too long here. I'm not saying the Original Trilogy doesn't have flaws, and the Prequel Trilogy is loaded with cringey moments (but can largely be fixed with good editing), but at least the PT maintained decent continuity and honored the OT. The entire Sequel Trilogy was a jumbled up mess of rehashes, breaking continuity, and disgracing the original characters that made Star Wars so popular in the first place. And bringing the Emperor back to life? That's just bad, desperate writing. The one good thing about RoS is finally seeing some interaction between Rey, Finn, and Poe all together. But it's far too late for it to mean anything now. That really should have begun in The Force Awakens. TFA started off okay (despite doing the A New Hope storyline rip-off), but as soon as they broke continuity by having Rey go from nothing to a super force goddess in the space of a couple days in TFA, I knew the ST was in serious trouble. And then TLJ was far worse than anything I could have imagined. RoS wasn't as bad as TLJ, but it was pathetic and sad to watch. Nothing against the actors or production crew, but the writing of the entire ST is garbage. I guess they were in a rush to try and make money fast rather than give more polishing to pre-production to create something truly great, make tons more money off of it, and have fans be excited for more. Now Star Wars is nothing to get excited about, well, the new Star Wars anyway. It's the biggest cinematic failure in history. But the old Star Wars is still wonderful after 40 years! But Disney is so rich, they probably don't care.",

            "content": "Wow, frankly I don't know what to say, when I went to the cinema to see The Rise of Skywalker on December 21st I was excited, I had appreciated the first two films of the sequel trilogy and I expected not to be disappointed, but I already had doubts about how they would made to bring Palpatine back into the saga, after he had died by falling into the Death Star reactor which had subsequently exploded, this to emphasize that he had died disintegrated. The film begins with the phrase \u2018the dead speak', and this statement combined with the phrase that says Palpatine \"the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural\" is the only explanation for the return of the emperor. This is the first plot hole, but it's a huge plot hole. In the first 6 minutes the film has already shown us three settings united by an insufficient montage but made with the help of excellent visual effects. The film goes too fast, 2h 20m, of which 8 minutes of credits, are not enough for the Skywalker Saga finale. Going forward we discover that Leia is training Rey, in the meantime the Resistance has the confirmation that Palpatine has returned, now I have a question: why did Palpatine announce his return? Wouldn't a surprise attack with his new fleet have been smarter? Previously Kylo had joined Palpatine who had proposed to give him his fleet in exchange for Rey's death. Another question arises, why does Kylo accept? The First Order already has a very powerful fleet, in that situation he could not have accepted and killed Palpatine. After various events Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO reach Pasaana, here we are introduced to a new jedi power, the ability to heal wounds through the Force, this is another plot hole, where Rey learned to use this power? We don't know. At this point the editing of the film finally becomes acceptable, in the previous chase scene on Pasaana he had hit rock bottom. At this point the movie cannot make a choice: Chewbacca dies, but it turns out that he is not dead; Zorii (a new character) first wants to kill Poe and five minutes later asks him to run away with her and when he refuses she gives him the most important thing that has, a pass for the First Order landing areas; finally the C-3PO memory is erased, but then R2-D2 reinstalls it. At this point Rey meets Kylo Ren who tells her that she is Palpatine's grandson, this is fan service, the writers took a random fan theory and chose it, Rey was made Palpatine's grandson to destroy the work of Rian Johnson who had made her the daughter of anyone important, a choice that I had appreciated. Speaking of destroying Rian Johnson's work, do you know why Palpatine returned? Because Snoke died and therefore Kylo Ren could not be made the main villain. Among other things, at the beginning of the film we discover that Palpatine created Snoke as he did is not explained to us. At this point the film improves, there is a good duel between Kylo and Rey, a father and son scene between Han Solo and Kylo, \u200b\u200band the long-awaited final battle. However before we get to the final confrontation we have a scene between Rey and Luke in which Luke reveals to Rey that he and Leia had always known that she was a Palpatine, why didn't they tell her before? Afterwards we fight on Exegol, here we have to thank John Williams and his always wonderful soundtracks and Visual Effects, as they make the ending more epic than it really is. At this point we find out that Palpatine had no precise plan, first he told Kylo to kill Rey, then when Rey comes to him, Palpatine changes his mind and asks Rey to kill him in order to become the new sith empress, finally when Rey refuses and Ben comes to help her, Palpatine discovers that he can absorb the vital energy from the two and uses it to come back to life and attack the Resistance fleet with lightning (since when can it be done?). In the end Rey manages to kill Palpatine with the help of all the other Jedi and I appreciate this. The film then ends on Tatooine where Rey buries the swords of Luke and Leia and assumes the surname of Skywalker, to many this thing has bothered me not, or at least not particularly, in the final however in addition to the Force ghosts of Luke and Leia I would have liked to have seen those of Anakin and Ben too. The truth is that in this film Palpatine should never have come back, not only because he was dead but also because he would have canceled the sacrifice of Anakin. In this film the main villain should have been Kylo Ren.",

This is kind of an entertaining film, it's a bit rushed but that doesn't bother me too much. The problem here is the writing. Everything that has been done in the first 6 movies is erased. Palpatine's return makes Anakin/Vader's redemption arc pointless. Also Luke Skywalker's efforts to put an end to the empire is now pointless just so some new disney character can get some credit, which pushes me to dislike Rey more and more.. Force healing, Rey and Ben use force healing in some rather major ways, which removes any sense of danger from Star Wars and also pokes quite a few holes in 1-6. Why didn't Obi Wan use healing to save his master? Why didn't Anakin use healing to save Padme? Why didn't Luke use healing to save vader? The list goes on... Now, apart from the major plot holes created, let's talk about characters. Same as the last jedi, Finn is now useless and serves no purpose to the story, he's just there to scream \"RRREEEEEYYYYY!!!!\" Poe does get some development here, but his character is still somewhat forgettable. Rey is still dull and boring, unnecessarily powerful and not relatable. However Kylo Ren/Ben is actually cool in this movie, and is now as powerful as he should have been in the first place. (apart from that force pulling ship and healing, that was dumb). This movie does do a little for Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando. The only reason I would somewhat like this movie is Kylo/Ben and everything else is just bad.",

This film however just feels cheap, and comes across as a last ditch effort to finalize and make sense of the Disney trilogy.  Bringing Palpatine back..  His return to the franchise makes Darth Vader's sacrifice completely worthless, it undermines the entire arc of Anakin Skywalker being the chosen one and bringing balance to the force.  More force powers..  Disney forgets that when they introduce something 'new' that it affects everything past and present, some of the main issues found in the OT and PT could have been easily rectified using these force abilities that they've just made up. Disney had potential with the sequels, however after the huge mishandling of the TLJ which split the fan base, the TROS plays it safe with a bland quest like story and uninspiring ending to franchise.

I am glad they built scenes around footage they had previously filmed of her in character and were able to complete her story that way.  The movie did seem to jump and fly at times too quickly and in a seemingly random way but after having seen it twice the movie did a very good job of tying up lose ends and carrying the observer through the entire saga to its conclusion.  \n\nI did not like \"The last Jedi\" at first but after going back and watching it probably about 3 times my attitude has changed and I do like it.   I love the way Luke shows up towards the end to stand up (even if he was a type of telepathic holographic form) against the 1st Order and allow the Rebel Alliance to escape certain destruction at the hands of the Empire.  I loved the way Yoda showed up and worked  Luke through the problems he had with handling the Force and how his fears were probably the one thing most effective in holding him back from his potential.   The conflict and yet connection between Kylo and Rey was very interesting and I knew it would play a big part in the \"Rise of Skywalker\" as it did.\n\nThis is also what Luke had to convey to Rey as he appeared to her in \"Rise of Skywalker\" that she had to turn lose of her fears.  She had to realize that she was NOT alone.  Every Jedi that ever lived was alive in her now.  She had much more power and capability than she ever imagined.  She WAS up to the challenge.\n\nIf you like Star Wars as I do,   If you liked all of the first three and at least tolerated the prequil trilogy of Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Syth,  and if you had any appreciation at all for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi I believe you will appreciate this film.   It is not perfect but it does a GREAT job of wrapping things up.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this film is that they made a part for one of the greatest musical composer, conductors, and score writers in history John Williams in the movie.  There is a little shot of John Williams as a repair tech working on a set that included an artifact drawn from every film he has scored and that has been nominated for an academy award.  This included Jaws, Star Wars, Schindler's List, Home Alone, The Patriot, Fiddler on the Roof, Memoirs of a Geisha, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Saving Private Ryan,   It was a real treat to see him in the movie now as an Actor even though the above referenced music covers a period of over 60 years and his age is over 90 years old.\n\nThis movie gets two thumbs up from me.

The face-paced nature of the movie has you jumping from one place to the next while using expositional narrative to carry its story.\n\nThe character arcs also created by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are almost completely undone. For example, Finn no longer cares about the rebellion but his concern is again, only on Rey and the possibilities of his story as an ex-stormtrooper are wasted. Similar things can be said for Rey and Po and characters of significant importance, like Rose, are sidelined for the sake of appeasing fans.\n\nThis movie had the potential to be a movie that could have been a groundbreaking conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Instead, J.J. Abrams plays it safe and misses the opportunity. Ultimately, that is why this film will fade from memory and will be overlooked by many in the future.",

This final movie seemed well set up to focus on Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren etc and take the story in a completely new direction. \n\nFor whatever reason (from what I have read it was a reaction to criticism directed from fans towards The Last Jedi) most of the ideas and themes set up in the Last Jedi are jettisoned in The Rise of Skywalker and instead of a progression this film regresses and gives us a Star Wars by numbers movie, rehashing old themes and forcing in old characters who do not really advance the plot and would probably have been better placed in one of the previous instalments (Lando) or not at all (Palpatine). Whilst The Force Awakens did basically follow the same structure as the original Star Wars films it managed to feel fresh;  the inclusion of beloved characters worked as their connection to new characters was well constructed, they advanced the plot, gave the film a huge amount emotional centre AND we had the promise of where the exciting new characters would take us. \n\nFor me The Rise of Skywalker was completely inconsistent with the previous two films, did not conclude the story arcs of any of the new characters to anything like a satisfactory conclusion and rendered the conflict between Rey and Kylo that had been well developed across two previous films a limp side note rather placing it centre stage where (for me) it should have been. The reintroduction of Palpatine was a huge disappointment, made little sense and (again for me) ruined this film as well as tainting the conclusion of the original trilogy in Return of the Jedi. \n\nConcluding a series as big as this is clearly no easy task and this film seems to have suffered hugely as the filmmakers lost their nerve, backtracked on the groundwork set up in the previous instalment and instead produced a Star Wars by numbers film that left me cold.",

I like the visual look of this film. I thought the idea that C-3P0 could not read Sith was dumb. I thought the fact that the Sith language is just Sith rather than another term was unoriginal and not convincing. I thought it was bogus that C-3P0 memory had to be wiped in order to be able to translate Sith. I did like having C-3P0 with a wiped memory but I did not like that that aspect was not played around very much. I was not convinced with the Emperor having a Hidden Imperial fleet with Star Destroyers with planet destroying devices attached onboard. I will admit that I did not feel as upset by this film as I was by Force Awakens or The Last Jedi. I felt like the new characters were cool but they did not have enough to work with to get me invested. I did thing the idea of Hyper space jumping was dumb. I was also not a fan of these new Force powers that are in the film like Ghost Luke Skywalker now able lift up an X-Wing out of the water. Emperor Palpatine able to electrocute a Rebel fleet in the sky by himself. That was bogus and unconvincing. I liked the world building but in some ways it felt smaller rather than bigger. I liked some of the new introduced vehicles in this film. This film did get me going really? A lot. Because they went in directions that are completely unnecessary and bigger does not always mean better. What got me was how many times Ray ditches her friends in this film. Does not even tell her friends where she is going. I thought the Leia scenes were done okay. I wish that we saw more of Ghost Luke and Lando in this film to help with the plot. We saw more of Leia that Lando Calrissian or Luke and that surprised me since the actors Billy Dee Williams & Mark Hamill are still alive so I would have thought that a bigger role would have been give to them. I thought that this film provided a proper resolution to Leia & Han Solo. I was glad that we did get one more scene with Han Solo to give that some resolution. ",

Like this movie together with the other 2 sequels has ruined Star Wars for me and completely spits in the face of the original trilogy and true Star Wars fans. anyone who gave this movie more than 2 stars was A: someone who doesn't care about Star Wars and just likes action. B: Thinks trolls 2 is an epic cinematic masterpiece but thinks The Lord of The Rings was \"boring\". C: paid by Disney to write a good review. I could go on forever about just how bad this film is and I strongly question how this made it to theatres, maybe the test screenings were conducted with a live Pidgeon audience???

Somehow WORSE than The Last Jedi, the movie is filled with plot holes and rushed plot development (I already found 10 huge plot holes within the first 5 minutes). I would not recommend this film to anyone, except for if you want to make fun at a movie. What makes this film even worse is that the original director's script with concept art leaked and it looked amazing; possibly could have even been the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy (which, btw, I am not a fanboy of the originals, but this movie is terrible).",

            "content": "The movie was a good movie but it lacked a few major details in my opinion. At the end of the movie when Rey hears all of the past Jedi voices you hear Anakin Skywalker's voice. I was expecting more of Anakin as he was the first Skywalker to become a Jedi. We did see Luke as a force ghost help Rey, but what about Anakin? If he where to ever show up as a force ghost I think the best time would of been just before Rey defeats Emperor Palpatine. Now because Anakin was once Palpatine's apprentice he knew he enough about Palpatine that he could talk to Rey and tell her to get up and they would defeat him together. All the voices do end up giving Rey enough strength and courage to defeat Palpatine on her own, but if Anakin where there to help her the scene would of been much more powerful and stuck with the audience. Now I can't lie and say that all the past Jedi voices telling her to \u2018Find the light'\u2018Get up' and that she was not alone and they had her back wasn't good because it was. Again Anakin would of made it more powerful because not only was he Palpatine's apprentice he was Luke's father and to mention Luke was Rey's master before he passed away. The Rise of Skywalker really did link these last three movies together, but if Anakin was more than just a voice and was a force ghost I feel it would of linked all nine movies as he was the one to start all this. It wasn't just Anakin either it was also Finn. While Finn and Rey are sinking in the sand Finn says he has something to tell Rey. Now most people would be thinking it was \u2018I love you', because they thought they were about to die but what if it was something different. At the end of the movie Finn can feel Rey dying ,but only people with potential Jedi powers can sense those things right? Because Finn never told Rey his secret it leaves the audience wondering if his secret was that he was a Jedi all along and that's why he couldn't fulfill his duty as a stormtrooper. Beside Anakin and Finn the movie wasn't bad. A few details here and there, but I would recommend this movie to a Star Wars fan and see what they think. These are just some of my opinions and what I thought could of been better. Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker is a good movie it just had a few tweaks here and there that needed to be adjusted.",

But regardless I wanted to see the movie because I am a Star Wars fan and I wanted to give my honest opinion on it. So after renting it on prime video and watching it. To my surprise, I loved the movie. It was entertaining, fast-paced, and action-packed. Most importantly it felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie. It was back to being a space adventure movie about good vs evil. The Last Jedi, while a Star Wars movie, felt more like a miserable nightmare. Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, subverted expectations, didn't answer any questions, and disrespected the saga. JJ Abrams came in and cleaned up the mess after The Last Jedi.\n\nWe get our heroes back working together in Rey, Poe, Finn, C3P0, BB8, and Chewie. We learn about Rey and why she is strong with the force. We finally also get to see her train with Leia. It was also great to see Rey have an internal struggle with figuring out who she is and where she fits in the galaxy. It made her character seem more human. Kylo Ren continues to be the best part of the sequel trilogy. The scenes with him and Rey are the best parts of the movie. We also get more back story with Poe and Finn. C3P0 and Chewie also really get there moments to shine in the movie. Luke Skywalker is back to being the optimistic mentor who respects his father's lightsaber again. I thought they did a great job of handling with Leia after Carrie Fischer passed away. Seeing Lando again was also a nice touch. And the new characters that get introduced (like Zorri Bliss, Babu Frik, Jannah, and General Pryde) are also really good additions to the story. Emperor Palpatine was pretty cool as well. A lot of his senses felt like something out of a Horror movie. The visual effects were outstanding. Especially in the space battle scenes. The lightsaber fight scenes were intense as well. I thought the movie had a nice and fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  \n\nThe only issues I had with the movie was the Nights of Ren were underutilized. I would have like to see more of who they are and a bit of there origin. There were some other minor issues here and there but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. \n\nOverall, I loved Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. It was nice to have JJ Abrams come in a finish what he started with The Force Awakens. As someone who was personally disappointed with The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker really helped patch things up for me. I commend JJ Abrams for doing so. (You could even watch Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker back to back while plucking out The Last Jedi completely.) This movie and The Mandalorian have reinvigorated my faith in Star Wars. I am looking forward to seeing what comes next. \n\nOverall score: 9/10",

With the cringe comedy of The Big Bang Theory and the manufactured drama of a soap opera, I am baffled as to how professional writers were paid any amount of money to write this movie. No memorable dialogue or reveals, no compelling plot points, and nothing of substance. Maybe the back and forth between Rey and Kylo was okay, but that's it.

I would say it's a little strange that Disney would take arguably the greatest sci-fi movie franchise in history, and turn it into a comedy franchise, but few could argue that they're not funny. Also very pretty. The rise of Palpatine is a comedy of epic coincidences, that once again is stunning and brave in the way it has dealt with the franchise cannon, and total disregard and seemingly hatred for any of the origional characters and massive passionate fan base. \nIf I were to walk into my favourite steakhouse, order (and pay for) a steak, only to be told that, no you're  wrong, you're getting the fish, then I would have to leave and never support that business again. Same here, I walked into my favourite sci-fi franchise and paid for some great swashbuckling sci-fi adventure, with gripping plots and characters I cared about. At least twice now I have been sold a comedic turd. Vacant and soulless. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, still shame on you. Disney killed Star Wars. RIP.",

This film was an insult, not just to the fans but to the universe's creator, George Lucas. He entrusted Disney to continue what he sold in a hope that his films will go on, only for his ideas and story to be completely shot down into flames, casting him out of having any say in what was to happen to his own franchise. They spent the majority of the film retconning every tiny mistake Rian Johnson created in The Last Jedi, meaning the film felt more like damage control than an actual story being put in place. The lightsaber battles were bland and had no emotional connection to the characters I felt. The choreography wasn't great, but was definitely an upgrade from The Last Jedi's choreography. One of the only redeeming qualities this film holds is the great score composed by John Williams, shame this was his last one. The film was nice to look at, at certain times. This film manipulated the audience by using nostalgia from the previous films as a walking stick to get from start to the finishing line, and god is it noticeable. It completely derails character arcs such as Finn's and Rey, but most of all, the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker. Watch the film at your own risk. What a terrible way to end the saga, it didn't land nor did it do the character's justice or its predecessor films. This was awful.",

            "content": "WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE\n\nOverall, this movie was disappointing. If it wasn't a Star Wars film, I would have liked it. But this just didn't follow a Star Wars logic. I'm not saying all Star Wars films have to be the same, but this just had so many plot holes that a regular Star Wars movie wouldn't have. The story in general was just stupid and rushed. If you know Star Wars, you know that Palpatine was killed by getting thrown off of the Death Star. And somehow, without explanation, TROS brought Palpatine back. Bringing a dead character back is stupid, and without explanation? Come on! That was the biggest plot hole for me, but there were many others. In the last Star Wars film, The Last Jedi (which was even worse than TROS), our hero Luke Skywalker had passed away. Jedi can come back as force ghosts, and Luke did. But here's the thing: force ghosts cannot interact with the real world. They can talk to certain people, but they cannot use the force on real things in the real world. Anyway, the ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. Let me say that again. The ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. In Star Wars, that cannot be done! It does not apply to Star Wars logic! Another thing I didn't like about TROS was the unoriginality. Kylo Ren was the antagonist, but in the end, he became good. I wouldn't have a problem with that- if it were original. In the original Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader became good! Making Kylo Ren come to the light side was so cliche and unoriginal! For me, you can only do that with one character in this franchise- and that character was Darth Vader. My very last error I would like to talk about is simply the fact that things happened way too fast. It was almost impossible to follow the story. They just jumped right into it without any sort of development. As much as I would like to go over more plot holes, I will now go over what I did enjoy. For all Star Wars movies, the music is great. I could say the same about TROS. John Williams has once again done a good job. Another thing I liked was the action. The one fight where Rey fought Kylo Ren was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole movie. There were plenty more good action scenes as well. My overall review for this movie is 2.5 stars out of 5.",

After all, Disney is a family company. Not only is she related to grampa Palpatine (who actually is a clone of her Grandfather) but she also is related to all the Jedis who have come before her because...the force. It's ridiculous, it's a bit derivative and played out, but it's well-acted, the film looks great, there are a lot of fun action scenes and it's one last time to hear John Williams expand his melodic universe.

Muggufuns are brought in and abandoned. Character's pasts are revealed, but they are either contradictory to the other two films or fail to be given an enough time to develop. Paced in seemingly a breakneck, yet at the same time so boring its slow way. You will either love the movie or hate it, with not much in between.

This film left me with a sense of lost hope for the franchise because everything that we had been building up too ended up being that the only way to defeat the emperor, would be to use two lightsabers instead of one. \"Ah, that's what we were missing this whole time.\" If you are a Star Wars fan you have already made up your mind on it. And if you're a casual audience member you won't end up caring all that much anyway.",

            "content": "A laughably bad finale for the Skywalker sequel trilogy.\n\nJ.J. Abrams directed his space adventure movie Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) like it was his first movie by lifting shots and story beats from other classic movies all to attempt to recreate the magic that was A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Boy, Abrams fails spectacularly alongside curiously incompetant producer Kathleen Kennedy calling the shots from the shadows like Emperor Palpatine. Just going back to Palpatine because they had no new ideas was a warning sign of this colossal waste of 142 minutes. Abrams' uninspired direction leaves much to be desired with the same old Star Wars ideas being tossed around by his unimaginative script. Whereas Rian Johnson disrespected Star Wars lore and concepts with The Last Jedi, J.J. Abrams worships Star Wars too much to try anything new at all.\n\nI will start out with the few positive takeaways I got from The Rise of Skywalker. I like where this saga ends, Palpatine dead, Kylo redeemed, Rey independent with her own agency, Poe redeemed with a love interest, and Finn redeemed with a love interest. It's satisfying and respectful of Star Wars, George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. The Rey and Kylo lightsaber duel is passionate and thrilling, Rey challenging Kylo's fighter in the desert is cool, Finn having faith in The Force is nice, and lastly it's sweet of J.J. Abrams to give Mark Hamill a proper sendoff as Luke Skywalker the Jedi Master instead of his horrendous character assassination from Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Michael Kaplan's costumes are neat. I adore Rey's white Jedi robes and Kylo's black garb for sure. Overall, I liked these aspects at the very least.\n\nThe problem is everything else. The editing is unintelligible as you never know what is happening. The movie starts off with no real establishment of where characters are or what their actual motivations are now after The Last Jedi. A brief opening crawl is not nearly enough to engage you. The cinematography has a few neat camera choices with a striking wide shot of Rey inside the broken Death Star, the seaside lightsaber duel, or the A New Hope homage with Rey in the dual Sunsets. The issue is all the rest of the movie has this cheap CGI glow and overly cluttered mess on screen that you cannot follow anything.\n\nDaisy Ridley is charming and cool as Rey Skywalker giving it her all in these awful films. She makes the whole movie watchable as Daisy is likable and relatable as Rey. She effortlessly fits into this space sci-fi adventure with her impressive combat choreography Ridley painstakingly learned and got fit for all while killing the dramatic acting. Adam Driver is excellent as Ben Solo with endearing dramatic suspense, while also being intimidating as the hulking Sith behemoth Kylo Ren. John Boyega finally gets to act normally as the likable Finn with Naomi Ackie as his new love interest Jannah. Oscar Isaac finally gets to act as the suave and charming Poe Dameron, especially endearing alongside the ravishing and cool Keri Russell as Zorii Bliss. I wish we saw more of Russell!\n\nCarrie Fisher is good as General Leia Organa, but a far cry from her legendary performances as Princess Leia. She lost all her fire and warmth sadly. Rest in paradise, Carrie. We all miss you. Mark Hamill looks like he was relieved to get a nice moment with Rey as the wise and kind Luke Skywalker. Harrison Ford cameos with a tender, not phoned in for once, role alongside Driver. Billy Dee Williams is surprisingly endearing and charismatic still as Lando Calrissian. Ian McDiarmid remains phenomenal as Emperor Palpatine also known as Darth Sidious. Even Anthony Daniels is fun as C-3P0 even though Abrams focused more on the other droids.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson is brushed aside as General Hux for a gag, meanwhile the imposing and talented Richard E. Grant gets little to do as Allegiant General Pryde. Lupita Nyong'o is wasted again as the ugly CGI creature Maz Kanata, who is supposed to be an oracle of sorts. I just wish they put Lupita in Star Wars in space alien make-up instead. Kelly Marie Tran got to redeem herself for her horridly overacted, awkward, and cringe inducing performance from The Last Jedi as she's very natural and likable as Rose Tico in The Rise of Skywalker. I adored seeing Billie Lourd cameo as Lieutenant Connix. I actually wish she got a much larger role. Too much time is wasted on odd subplots, ugly CGI monsters, goofy alien puppets, and ugly space battles instead of developing characters or telling an interesting story. Disney clearly couldn't care less.\n\nEven John Williams' score sounded tired of Star Wars at this point. He gets a cute little cameo though. In all, I'm just glad we are all done with this mediocre franchise that used to capture our imaginations. The original trilogy will always be fun, the prequel trilogy is still embarrassing, and this sequel trilogy is a horrendous cash grab that recreated the previous films with no charm. Rest in peace Star Wars, I had fun with you for a time.",

This and the last felt hastily written and sloppy. It could just be that I grew up with Vader and the original characters, but I had a hard time believing or feeling like Kylo or Rey were so much stronger than their predecessors. The original trilogy had 3 year breaks between movies, both of these last two could have used at least an extra year, especially after the last one had to be rewritten. Snoke felt like a total throw away and why they didnt take that opportunity to insert a more compelling already existing character from the expanded universe or whatever its called now is a missed opportunity. It feels like Snoke was being built for something else and then plans changed quickly so they killed him. Why rush one of the most legendary and beloved stories ever? If it wasnt ready, delay and rewrite, people may be upset, but is that worth ruining Star Wars over? I suppose it is if youre only interested in money and could care less about ruining art. I could go on and on about everything that didnt work, but its easy enough to find those with a simple search. They may as well have ended this by having Jar Jar being the mastermind behind everything, studying the dark side and re-emerging as Darth Jar Jar killing everyone and flipping off the camera.",

It contained the same themes we've come to expect from the original trilogy and I think that's a good thing. I like the fact that it tried to undo the damage done by TLJ. TLJ didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me.  It felt like the moody, emo sister of a Star Wars movie. Apart from a really poor plot, and overt virtue-signaling, that was what was so jarring about TLJ. I see people complaining that this movie ruined the character arcs of TLJ. First, apart from Rey and Kylo, there weren't any left after TLJ. I cared so little for the main characters in TLJ that I thought I'd never want to see TROS. Second, ruining character arcs was TLJ's principal sin and trying to restore some of them was TROS's principal virtue. \n\nPeople can go two, very different ways on the fan service that TROS provides. Some say it's cheap. Others will say it makes for an enjoyable ride. I'm in the latter category. Let's assume there weren't real problems with TFA and TLJ. This sort of all-in, all-present ending movie is just the kind of movie I'd expect to finish off the Skywalker storyline. We all appreciated that about Endgame, probably because that's what we've come to expect from literature and movies that tie-off a big universe of plots and characters.  \n\nWas it the best Star Wars movie? No. Did it contain some just-so stories or a deus ex machina or three? Yes. Still, I enjoyed it. I liked seeing an end to the story of the Skywalker family and its long, arduous battle against the Sith. That's what this movie was. It wasn't a story about Poe, Finn, Rose, and, to some extent, I can also say that it wasn't all about Rey either. That's what I wanted. I wanted a Skywalker movie. I wouldn't expect the final installment of the Harry Potter franchise to be about Ron or Hermione, nor would I want that.",

TFA set up questions that still don\u2019t have answers, TLJ was trash, and this movie is PROOF that they didn\u2019t have a plan going into this. The pacing in this film is awful, the lightsaber fights ? forgettable, and whatever lore and rules were left in the Star Wars universe utterly abandoned. I remember when this universe had rules and I miss those days. SPOILERS from here on out. The plot of this movie was so convoluted and confusing. It seems that the characters only progress because of luck. Too much stuff is in this movie for the 16 hour period of time and half of it is unnecessary. Why is Lando in this movie? Why is Poe\u2019s power ranger girlfriend in this movie? Why is Jannah in this movie? These people are unneeded; they clog up time that could be spent on fixing the pacing and answering questions. So Palpatine has returned in this movie with basically no explanation other than \u201cThe dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some may consider to be unnatural\u201d. Palpatine\u2019s return is a huge slap in the face to everyone who ever cared about Star Wars, prequel fans and OT fans alike. It was Anakin\u2019s/Vader\u2019s destiny to throw Palpatine down that bottomless pit and then the Death Star EXPLODED with Palpatine in it. Bringing him back ruins literally everything in those six movies. Anakin was supposed to be the Chosen One and that was mentioned over and over in the prequels and the Clone Wars. Now it\u2019s all pointless! ... And guess how Palps is defeated? Rey deflects lightning into his face. How are we supposed to believe he\u2019s dead when he survived all the previous things in all the other movies? I was actually fine with this movie in the beginning, even though the Poe and Finn in the Falcon chase was utterly pointless because the movie wanted some action. The point where the movie really went downhill was when Lando showed up for no reason and disappeared. And then the stormtroopers flew and we heard \u201cThey fly now!\u201d ... why are they surprised? C3PO has seen a ton of stuff and Finn used to be a stormtrooper, for crying out loud! They should know that jet packs exist! For some reason our heroes fall into quicksand and fall into a cave beneath. Is that how gravity works now? ...The moment that destroyed all the rules was when Rey force healed the snake/worm. It makes the movie feel like there\u2019s no stakes because the force can magically heal people now (and resurrect them too, as seen later). Heck, in the Phantom Menace Qui-Gon DIED... why didn\u2019t Obi-Wan just force heal him? And I don\u2019t understand why Rey thought it was safe to attempt to heal it... then it makes the way out of the quicksand... For some reason Rey goes into the desert and stands out there. There\u2019s no reason for her to do this. Then Kylo charges at her with his tie fighter/silencer ship. If he wants to kill her, he should use his guns. If he doesn\u2019t want to kill her then he shouldn\u2019t ram his tie fighter into her... what is character motivation? Rey does an impossible flip and DESTROYS his ship. It explodes and tumbled and BOY, THAT\u2019S AN EXPLOSION. But both Kylo Ren AND the ship both survive. You heard me correctly. Kylo doesn\u2019t have a scratch but you could say \u201cthe force\u201d. But the ship was literally blown up on screen... and you see it perfectly together later in the movie. THEY DESTROY IT ON SCREEN AND THEN FORGET. And it\u2019s the same ship, not a similar one because it has the way finder in it! WTH. It looks like Rey kills Chewie but he doesn\u2019t die. Then later the gang gets on Ochi\u2019s ship which still works somehow to see the merchandise and the power ranger. C3PO\u2019s memory gets wiped but then is fine by the end of the movie because R2 had a replacement. It feels like nobody is in danger. There are so many stupid things in this movie. The Death Star was completely annihilated in ROTJ but somehow there are still remains of it. Kylo\u2019s helmet was completely destroyed in TLJ but is easily fixed in this movie. Rey sails across a rough ocean and doesn\u2019t die. Finn says that he has something to tell Rey but he never tells her. Hux is the spy, but the motivation makes no sense. Luke acts like TLJ never happened. Leia\u2019s dialogue feels weird because she\u2019s dead, and then when she dies in this movie it\u2019s so strange. They should have killed her last movie. When Rey and Kylo finally team up against Palpatine, Kylo has a blaster but then it magically disappears because this movie doesn\u2019t have an ounce of consistency. The finale rips off Endgame, and you are left wondering why the bad guys don\u2019t just tilt the ships, and how Lando got so much backup. Palpatine doesn\u2019t say anything cool except quote prequel lines. Rey defeats him easily. Why should we care? She\u2019s way more powerful than everyone. She is literally shown levitating in this movie. When she dies, Kylo revives her, and then... they kiss. Their relationship in these movies is so toxic and awful and everyone groaned. Then he dies. He should\u2019ve lived and Rey should\u2019ve died, and the entire world would\u2019ve been happier with that ending. At the end Rey buries Anakin\u2019s lightsaber in SAND. She calls herself Rey Skywalker, and literally anything else would\u2019ve been better. So in conclusion, what the hell. I suppose this is slightly better than TLJ, but wow, this movie is BAD and a huge insult to fans. ",

This is honestly more like a video game campaign story then a movie. The reveal of Palpatine being alive is so forced and so sudden.

It is still a very enjoyable, very well acted and made film with incredible action sequences and an uplifting ending. However, it is a jumbled mess of a movie trying to please the ones pissed off by its (admittedly better) predecessor, TLJ. The worst of the three sequals just from a lack of wasted potential, trying to damage control and shoehorn in as many cheep nostalgia references as possible to hide the disservice it does to any character that isn't Rey or Kylo.

They died and sacrificed for nothing, \"watch my movie, those were a waste of your time,\" says JJ. If this was anything other than a Star Wars movie, I would have walked out on it about half way through, I really wish I never walked in on it. Special effects were great, it shows how the craft has matured over the years, that's it! Blown opportunities for character development, arc or making a logical movie. Too much fanboy ingratiation, while still leaving loose ends unfinished. What a shame. I've been a Star Wars fan since the 70s and have endured mostly sub-par movies, but I keep coming back because it's a great universe of possibilities, but for some reason no one has been able to get it right since the 80s. This latest trilogy started without originality; then it was blamed for becoming too original by all the fanboys; now it fights to get back to mediocrity and recycling old SW nostalgia but settles on the absurd. This is THE WORST Star Wars movie ever, and I didn't like any of the green screen prequels, but would gladly watch the Phantom Menace over this any day. I might even watch the Holiday Special before watching this again. I feel like I need to apologize to George Lucas for saying anything bad about the prequels because they look like masterpieces compared to what this latest trilogy became. The Force Wakes Up was forgiven for being unoriginal, but we were glad to have SW back. Last Jedi was going in a new direction and that was ok as long as they could pull it all together. There were still major problems with it, but I was willing to go along if they could fit it into the arc of SW, but no, JJ had to try to hit the reset button and work as a customer service rep trying to make the fanboys all happy by addressing every complaint right down to Chewbacca getting his \"long-deserved\" medal which is beyond stupid. Our moans during the movie turned into laughter at the embarrassment of this steaming pile by the end. Why can't we get a good writer/director for this franchise? It will be the first SW movie I won't have in my personal collection.",

When I originally went into this movie, I had very low expectations because of the reviews I saw, but after I had seen it for myself, I was pretty impressed. With that to say, it has now been about three months since I've seen this movie and I've had time to digest it some more and I can confirm that my opinions about it have definitely changed. Sure there were a moments in there that were a nice nod to die-hard fans but in all honesty, those were the only good parts. This movie was rushed and completely meant to retcon the events of The Last Jedi. The character arcs were sloppy (with the acception of Ben Solo), the storyline was not well thought out, a lot of characters and things were just crammed in there and we didn't have any context about them or have time to get any context about them. I really could go on and on with the flaws of this movie but this review would be much longer. I grew up having Star Wars be my #1 most favorite movie franchise, but after this disaster of a trilogy that Disney botched so horribly and ruined for a lot of die-hard fans, it no longer is. I'm going to have to give that honor to the MCU. Considering their worst movie out of 23 of them was one that really wasn't all that bad; Thor: The Dark World. Honestly, if you ask me, I don't think it was that hard to develop a successful trilogy and a good conclusion to the legendary Skywalker saga. Disney has done a tremendous job on movies in the past as everyone obviously knows (they've even created a theme park after their movies) and I feel like with this trilogy they had one job. JUST ONE JOB and they couldn't even get that right. I guess we'll have to wait for the Mandalorian or future Star Wars movies to do the trick. Although it didn't end how I wanted it to, I do have to give credit to this franchise for basically being my entire childhood. So Star Wars, thank you for the memories. We've had a lot of highs and lows but mostly highs and for that, I am very grateful.",

Rey being a descendant of Palpatine was a decent twist, but felt as if the writers just thought of it while writing the script of episode 9 because they didn't know in the last 2 movies. As a Star Wars movie, it is obvious that George Lucas had  nothing to do with this movie. It makes no sense in the Star Wars universe at all. George Lucas' vision for his movies have been thrown in Disney's trash can and I, along with many others, hate to see it. I was optimistic with Episode 7, which gave this disney trilogy a lot of potential, but this movie along with episode 8 made me disregard Disney's Star Wars movies as canon.

As a few reviews probably mention...this would have worked better as two films.  However if you don't think too hard about the logic of the story and sit back to enjoy...it's definitely a fun time.  A lot of people my age who grew up with the original trilogy (I was born in \u201877) give this round of movies a hard time.  It won't ruin your childhood...and yeah it's pretty clear Disney didn't have a set game plan (or one from  Awakens to Jedi), but it comes to a close with some great effects and crowd pleasing battles.  Their are some obvious throw backs to keep viewers of the older films entertained and more than a few plot points you may pick apart.  However if you want to sit back and see the new trilogy come to a decent close...I think it's done in a more than partially entertaining way.

Changing to such a different director for the middle film gave the trilogy an uneven feeling. Rian Johnson's vision was so vastly different from J.J. Abrams', resulting in a hard swing from Force Awakens to Last Jedi to this. This could have been solved at the production level if-\n\nWHAT IN THE BANANA MUFFINS ARE YOU BABBLING ON ABOUT NOW? PRODUCTION SCHEDULES? DIRECTOR VISION? NOBODY CARES ABOUT ALL THAT, THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU LIKED THAT MOVIE.\n\nBut that's the problem, 12-year-old James. There's so much more to film analysis than just saying whether or not you liked the film. With so many films coming out of already-existing franchises, it is necessary to view films in the context of their predecessors.\n\nDUDE. CHILL OUT. IF YOU THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS STUFF, THEN YOUR MIND IS GOING TO BE MADE UP BEFORE YOU EVEN WALK INTO THE THEATRE.\n\nAn excellent point. I know I avoided the Rotten Tomatoes page with constant vigilance in the week leading up to seeing the movie, and even then, I was still really nervous that J.J. wasn't going to be able to pull this off.\n\nAND DID HE?\n\nI guess. He got dealt a pretty raw hand of cards. His villain got killed off, some of his best characters were completely sidelined, and Carrie Fisher passed away. He had a very unenviable job.\n\nFOR SURE. \n\nHe was able to introduce a new villain really quickly, and had a lot of interesting plot threads. I guess my main complaint with both 8 and 9 is the editing; it feels like one planet hop should have been cut out to make the film tighter.\n\nIT DID SEEM A BIT LONG. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE JOURNEY WAS FUN.\n\nIt did work internally, even if it felt a bit \u2018video-gamey.' The references to previous Star Wars films were also great to see, especially in the third act.\n\nOH MAN, THAT FINAL SPACE BATTLE WAS GREAT. THERE WERE STAKES!\n\nThere are always stakes, just not very much in the way of consequences. The only character arc that felt organic was Kylo Ren's.\n\nHONESTLY, HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST-WRITTEN CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE TRILOGY. SHAME HE DIDN'T GET A GOOD ENDING.\n\nIt could have definitely been written better, but he at least got to close out his arc.\n\nWHAT ABOUT YOUR ARC?\n\nSay what now?\n\nHOW ARE YOU GOING TO END THE \u2018ARGUING WITH YOUR 12-YEAR-OLD SELF' BIT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR STAR WARS MOVIES?\n\nEh, who says it has to end here? I'm sure something from my childhood will get remade that I'll want to bring you back for.
