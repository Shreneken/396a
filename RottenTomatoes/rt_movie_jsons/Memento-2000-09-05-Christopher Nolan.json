The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.",

            "content": "I have seen a few Christopher Nolan films before, but never one like this. I am typically not a fan of movies with a nonlinear screenplay, but this one had me hooked from start to finish. Maybe it was the ever changing use of black and white and color, and beginning a scene with how a previous one ended, helping to tie them together, that did it for me. I am not entirely sure to be honest, but all I know for sure is that this film is brilliant. \n\tThis movie revolves around the main character, Leonard Shelby and his hunt to find the killer and rapist of his wife. In contrast to this, he has a disability with his memory, known to be anterograde amnesia, which keeps him from forming any new memories prior to his wife's death. He must now use his skills through notes and tattoos to help him solve his case. Throughout this story he meets several people, such as Teddy, Natalie and more, and it is his job to determine if they can be trusted. \n\tI believe it is the cinematography of this film that caused it to carry itself so strongly. This is a film that could easily become confusing, but the use of the black and white for a chronological order of events and color for events happening in reverse order. Personally, I found this to be clever and interesting, seeing as even though these opposing scenes do not happen in the same order as one another, they line up perfectly and prompt the progression of the story. I do believe the use of these scenes align perfectly with the main issue the characters in the movie face: Leonard's memory loss. \n\tNot only was the plot phenomenal, but everything else that went into the film was seemingly on point to me. The acting was amazing in every aspect, leaving the audience hooked. Every piece of clothing was extremely helpful in the development of the story, from scene to scene, leaving viewers such as myself wondering what the reasoning for this was from the beginning. I also found repetition in music based on certain scenes, which helped me to put things in order. \n\tFrom this film, I took the idea that not everything is as it seems and the mind can be deceiving. This sounds vague, but you would have to watch the movie to see what I mean. I do believe that after viewing, you will look at things more clearly\u2026 just hopefully not in the form of notes as tattoos. \n\tI would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good brain stump or mind twist essentially. Or, if you are looking for a movie that will simply keep you on your toes, I can guarantee you have found it. Christopher Nolan did a beautiful job in the portrayal of Momento, and now I will forever wish I could just watch it for the first time again. \n\nOverall rating: 9.5/10 stars!",

Of course you have to slog through the beginning (which is also the end of the passage of events, but not the climax...) to get to this point.\nI didn't find any humour in it, whereas other reviewers did.

The plot unfolds like a puzzle in reverse. Leonard cruises L.A. in search of the supposed rapist and murderer, but suffers from anterograde amnesia \u2014 he quickly forgets experiences that just happened to him. This leads him to constantly take notes, pictures, and even tattoo himself to configure his leads into a cohesive search. Unsurprisingly, many of the people he meets take advantage of him, in one way or another. I'd viewed the film a couple of times in the past 15 years or so, but this was my first with a critical eye. It's a $9 million budget movie that blows away Tenet (52) which had a budget of $200 mill\u2026 The narration works really well, with my favorite example coming when Leonard is chasing an assailant, only to realize after turning a corner that it was the assailant who is actually chasing him. Of all Nolan's \"Time\"-centric movies, Memento gives the viewer the most bang for their buck. It's a must-watch.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.\n\nAs always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.\n\nNolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.\n\nIt is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.\n\nGuy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.\n\nOverall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Demostrando que no se necesita una super inversi\u00f3n para contar una excelente historia. La forma en la que Christopher Nolan deconstruye la historia y a los personajes, es simplemente espectacular, mesclando y entrelazando, los acontecimientos de la trama, haciendo que el espectador este alerta con cada escena de la pel\u00edcula, en lo que la misma suelta peque\u00f1as pistas, conforme avanza la historia. Uno de los mayores aciertos de esta pel\u00edcula, esta en situarnos desde la perspectiva de Leonard Shelby, haciendo tanto a la trama como a los personajes, confusos, y el como mediante a las fotos, tenemos el desarrollo de los mismos, haciendo que cada acci\u00f3n u objeto cobre un gran protagonismo. La construcci\u00f3n de la trama es impecable, cuidando cada detalle, y d\u00e1ndole un simbolismo a todo, no dejando ning\u00fan hueco, ya sea a peque\u00f1as acciones o a simples objetos, que cobran mayor importancia en el avance de la pel\u00edcula. Sin duda esta pel\u00edcula ya se volvi\u00f3 un cl\u00e1sico y una pel\u00edcula de culto, con grandes giros de trama, con grandes actuaciones y una historia que te atrapa desde el primer minuto.

It's very hard to talk about this film without spoiling it but it's way better if you watch the film without knowing anything about it. So therefore this review will be short and a \"spoiler-free review\".\n\nI loved how in the film we see and feel things the way Leonard does. When we have a question about what exactly is happening or who this person is, we are actually left the same as Leonard, WE GET CONFUSED because his condition is like that, he doesn't remember who the person is or how he ended up to where he is now and here comes the reverse way that the story was being told by because when a certain scene comes we ask ourselves the same questions as Leonard. So in the end, THE AUDIENCE IS LEONARD. \n\nThe directing was absolutely incredible, now it's obviously not like \"Inception\" or \"The Prestige\" because first, it was made in \"2000\", second is that the film's budget proved that you don't need to have a huge budget to make a good film. But, all you need are a talented cast & crew and most importantly, A \"GOOD\" SCRIPT. And that's what makes Memento a must-watch. \n\nGuy Pearce was amazing in this film. In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated performances ever. Carrie-Anne Moss was amazing as well and really surprised me because I never thought she would impress me like that especially in this film and with her complex character.\n\nIn the end, Memento doesn't have that great set design or cinematography or a music score or the other \"filmmaking elements\" that would make it perfect. But, it has a very great screenplay and a creative/talented cast & crew that made this film a must-watch. If you haven't seen Memento you are missing so much. It's a classic and \"Highly recommended\". \n\nMy rating is 9/10",

            "content": "After stretching his legs in the arthouse scene with 1998's Following, Christopher Nolan gets a little more mainstream in this swervy, concept-rich tale of amnestic vengeance. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss, constantly overwriting the VHS tape of his near-past as he tracks a nameless, faceless killer. He employs some blunt methods for retaining important information - hand-written notes and Polaroids for loose facts, tattoos for solid truths - but when you're operating on such a short timer (the dreaded memory wipe seems to occur every ten minutes), I suppose you've got to take what you can get, even if it makes you a target for manipulation.\n\nThe whole fable unfolds in a sort of stuttered reverse, immediately revealing the plot's ending before slowly walking back to its beginning, which leaves the viewer feeling almost as handicapped as Pearce. It's an early example of Nolan's experimental nature, his interest in tinkering with traditional storytelling formats to bend viewers' perceptions, and it works just as well here as we might expect from his later works. At each intersection, we're forced to second-guess everything we thought we knew, which continually changes the context of that first ten minute chunk. Our trust is earned, betrayed, diverted and rehabilitated.\n\nSure, sometimes it feels like this is more about the experiment than the plot (for all its ambition, the actual story is very small-scale), but conceptual risks carry a lot of weight with me and Memento is a verifiable playground for such things. It's as effective a \"walk a mile in my shoes\" experience as any I've seen on the big screen, and a large part of that can be credited to the Nolan brothers' peculiar knack for outside-the-box cinematic creativity.",

            "content": "The movie \"Memento\" is, without any doubt, a great movie. I would not call it a masterpiece, or the best movie Christopher Nolan has ever made, but there is something in it that makes the viewer hold his breath until the rest of the movie. Although the operator's job is standard and has nothing spectacular about it, the chronology of the film itself and the way actors play out in it is amazing. \n\t\"Memento\", in the beginning, is like a broken puzzle, which you must solve to get the full piece completed. Every single episode of the film I asked myself several questions: \"What is going on? Why am I here?\". But in the end, once you solve the puzzle, you are filled with joy. The main character, who is played by Guy Pierce also makes you feel like if you have lost your memory yourself. The slightest details like tattoos and pictures are the clues to help you out and solve the puzzle, as from the very beginning you imagine thousands of different ways of how the story might end.\n\tThe real hero of the movie, on the other hand, is not Guy Pierce. It is Nolan himself. After watching Nolan's recent films and revisiting his past as a director it is so fascinating to feel the same style. Some even say that Nolan does not make movies, but instead, makes attractions for your brain. And I am amongst the people who feels this way, as if the movie was shot in a chronological order or if it was taken on by a different director, it would have been just an average normal 1 night movie, but instead, this is something that can be rewatched later to fully understand it. And people are a great evidence of my words, as while only having a 9-million-dollar budget, the movie's box office was around 40, which is an outstanding achievement!\n\tAlthough beneath all the benefits are some cons of the movie. One of which is the lack of good music, as in some moment, where the situation got emotional, I didn't really feel the way character did, and music is one of the key things to get to know character and understand his emotions better. As well as that, the operator work looks average, as there are no astounding shots that were made, which can really be justified by the low budget.\n\tSome of the other small details that the movie nails perfect are the tone and montage of the movie, as you feel how serious everything is. The idea to make flashbacks in black and white is genius, as it makes some people determine past from present and make the \"puzzle solving\" a little easier. Guy Pierce is always serious in the scenes, as well as people surrounding him, who convince him of different things and make it look either obvious that they are lying, either not at all, which leads the viewer to start guessing himself again. \n\tTo conclude, I would like to say that after watching Christopher Nolan's \"TENET\" recently, I can say that these movies are both similar and tough to understand. I would really call them the hardest movies that Nolan has ever made, which to understand you would go on internet forums or make up your own theories, as well as rewatch the movie countless times, which is amazing! This is the true cinema magic! Although, besides it's amazing script and spectacular director and actors, the movie feels like it gasps for something more to be added, not for more people to understand it, but for more people to feel emotional at some points and make it even more thrilling than it is. \"Tenet\" is a great mistake correction of \"Memento\", but the \"original\" was definitely something new in the year 2000, when no one knew who Nolan is and certainly nobody got used to such thrillers, thrillers that blew people's minds.",

Anyway, Memento is only Nolan's second movie, but it's one of his top three, if not his best. I've seen a ridiculous amount of films, and I can't think of a single one that was made like Memento. Jonathan Nolan rarely makes a film with Christopher, but he should be credited on this since it is based on his short story. I'd love to find it and read it. Memento is dark and emotional and dives deep into what a person would do for vengeance, even if they're not fully sure that they have the right culprit. Memento is better to watch without knowing anything about it. It's truly fantastic. It's a perfect movie, a word I use in about 1 out of 100 films.",

No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this knack of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.\n\nOverall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute must watch!",

If I could forget this movie and again go through the journey of 'what, it is backwards!! Rewind rewind'\n\nThis movie is in my Top 10.Rewatching for 2nd time, after every transition I reconnect the dots and set the movie chronologically in my brain. I love this types of movies were they made me interact.\n\nChristopher Nolan brilliantly incorporates the audience POV to the amnesia of the protagonist. This is perfectly done and I can't think of any other way to pull this kind of backwards gimmick. Thats why I love Nolan, weird concept with a masterpiece execution.\n\nThe is also filled with memorable lines like 'Am I chasing him? Nope he is chasing me.' And Nolan also snuggles a twist with the female charcater and my mind is even more blow.\n\nAt its core the movie the movie is about a guy finding his wife's murderer(we have seen that done hundreds of times) but the layers of other artists merit makes this movie perfect is my eyes.",

            "content": "A mind numbing crime story told in an innovative reverse style.\n\nChristopher Nolan's groundbreaking psychological crime mystery Memento (2000) changed cinema and had every audience member looking for hidden meanings and mind blowing twists like after everyone saw The Sixth Sense. Nolan directs his brother Jonathan Nolan's short story with a surreal sense of purpose as Memento is 113 minutes of pure confusion that constantly transforms into these massive epiphanies. Nolan gifts you an original story told in reverse so as to give the audience clues to figure out what is happening along with the main character suffering from short term memory loss. Dody Dorn lays down some of cinema's most iconic editing as she cuts from memory to memory with peerless inventive decisions. Memento is clever, unique, shocking, and unforgettable leaving you stunned with a jaw dropping twist to cap off his crazy thriller.\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction is really interesting as he shoves the audience into the perspective of the protagonist with memory loss, so we are constantly repeating scenes like Groundhog's Day, but with a new perspective as you slowly realize you are seeing the events preceding the last scene. Christopher Nolan's writing is heartbreaking and intriguing with new revelations every scene and a hurtful ending that keeps you thinking long after you've left the theater. His writing is easily darker and more mature than any of his other films too. Memento is one of Nolan's greatest films precisely because he creates an intimate atmosphere every scene as you witness striking drama every minute. Wally Pfister's cinematography is gorgeous for all the black and white scenes, especially in the final building, as well as lighting everything like a modern noir piece. I truly love every close-up of someone's face as they are so breathtaking and cool to look at during Memento.\n\nGuy Pearce is phenomenal in one of his best roles as Leonard Shelby. His tragic hero is plagued by short term memory loss and Pearce conveys this beautifully with a perpetual look of confusion on his face. His strong convictions to continue hunting for his wife's killer are apparent on Pearce's steadfast and determined face. Pearce is such a strong actor as he uses his fit body language to demonstrate how torn Leonard is over what facts mean and how he must proceed. Joe Pantoliano delivers a fun supporting actor role as Leonard's friend and informant Teddy. His final monologue of truth to Pearce is shocking, entertaining, and haunting in more ways than one. Pantoliano may have given his career best acting full of subtle cues in Memento.\n\nI must mention the gorgeous and dreamy Carrie-Anne Moss giving a fierce and funny performance as Leonard's love interest and informative friend Natalie. She is really engaging with her inquisitive attitude and hurt persona. She kills it as her character shifts from friend to rogue out for herself. Moss is ridiculously talented and Memento is an amazing dramatic vehicle for her and Pearce to act out brilliant confrontation and painful memories.\n\nI like Jorja Fox's cameos as Guy Pearce's wife Catherine Shelby. Mark Boone Junior has a fun cameo as the amiable motel concierge Burt. Stephen Tobolowsky has a moving cameo as the memory impaired Sammy Jankis. Harriet Sansom Harris' devastating supporting actress role as Tobolowsky's dejected wife is astounding. Can you believe Thomas Lennon has a cameo as the doctor? In all, Memento's stellar cast delivers excellent character acting with each special sequence.\n\nPatti Podesta's production design makes Memento always look dirty and grungy like the whole world has failed these characters in a cesspool of drug deals, theft, rape, and murder. David Julyan's score is curious and filthy to match Memento's dark tone. He takes his previous concepts from his score to Nolan's debut Following and takes out the fun synths opting for harder sounds and mysterious noises. Julyan keeps the viewer unnerved with haunting music for Nolan's mind blower Memento. Cindy Evans came up with some killer costumes for Memento. Guy Pearce's sharp suit and the make-up for Pearce's interesting tattoos. Evans' best outfit is certainly Carrie-Anne Moss' sexy black half shirt and mini skirt combo with her hair up for a leftover 1990's cool girl look.\n\nIn all, Memento is a classic movie that has entertained audiences for two decades now. I think it still holds up as a well written and well made film of daring authenticity and ambition. Sure some may find its style dated in the early 2000's grit and grime, but I think that adds to its charm in a way.",

            "content": "Memento is a film directed by Christopher Nolan and is considered to be Nolan's breakthrough masterpiece. The movie's protagonist is Lenard, a man who has short term memory loss, a rare condition, after he damaged his brain during an attempt to save his wife. Because his wife died during the incident, Lenard's goal in the movie is to find and kill the murderer of his wife. He forgets everything after the incident in just a span of a few minutes. Due to his condition, Lenard uses Polaroids and tattoos to help him remember key information. He does not recognize the face of the murderer but knows that his first name is John and last name starts with letter G. This movie is mind boggling since you can't really trust anyone because they can trick you for personal gains. Adding on top of that, the movie is split into 41 different scenes. 20 out of these 41 scenes are black and white playing in chronological order and 21 are colored scenes playing in reverse chronological order. The scenes are then organized by playing back and forth between colored and black and white scenes and ends in the middle of the story where the movies switches from black and white to colored. The purpose of this is to withhold information from the audience in order to give us a feel for Lenard's condition. In the movie, the audience needs to scramble for key information and clues in order to understand what is going on. My suggestion if you're watching the movie for the first time is to remember how the scene begins and ends. If you do so, you can get a clearer picture of what's going on. But I promise you that you will need to watch the movie a bunch of times to understand all the key information and their functions to the story.",

And he does it by raising a simple question. How far should you go as a storyteller to express yourself and communicate coherently to your viewers? In this case, it is evidently reported for 8 years to put all this puzzled work in one big crime scene. Leanord (Guy Pearce) is suffering from short term memory loss and for a guy who can barely survive going through his own routine, he has embarked himself to cross a big revengeful mountain.\n\nTo be honest, the film does most of its magic on paper. What's to wonder about is, Nolan who used props and elements for the style in Following, has now cornered himself into being obliged to use those same props. But this is Nolan, he doesn't bow down to such limitations in the script. He has simply jumbled up the events for some levity and uses it to give you enough reason to hang on to this trippy ride. Once again, the editing gets a shout out, But I'd also like to mention Nolan's choice of picturization of those abstract yet contextual repetitive part of the act. He hides the facts by acknowledging the fact that he is hiding it. Nolan has confessed that he loved using the similar picturization of both the flashbacks and real time screenplay that he learned from Terrence Malick's style, especially from The Thin Red Line.\n\nLet's follow the lead character Leonard and Pearce embodying a tattooed (scarred) personality as such. The bluff of Nolan is how to make him sympathetic that goes unnoticed in the film. His handicapped part of the personality is abused over and over by the other characters that actually mirrors their own figure, and as a result you are worried sick and exhausted by this experience. And Pearce plays it simply as Nolan reveals it in the \"guilty\" section of the storytelling, later in the film. The assumption is what leads us into this misunderstanding. Not the props, not the Memento.",

The way that Nolan chooses to portray the story is fascinating. The very in lined and parallel story lines, while one is striving back to the past and the other moving forward to the future. The film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s use of nonlinear storytelling is very impressive and unique to me especially when considering the time the movie was released in 2000.Leonard is cast by Guy Pearce, in a very astounding performance that is very emotional and very stunning performance. He experienced the rape and death of his wife and is very determined to avenge it however, he struggles due to his short-term memory loss  ever since the incident and needs to take precautions and reminders including the memos tattooed on his body as reminders. The way that the story digs into you and makes you understand and sympathize for Leonard, understanding his confusion and his struggles against his syndrome. With this, I find that Memento's use of audience's attention and storytelling techniques really captivates the audience and pulls them into the movie making the connection between character and audience very apparent, making memento so effective. The movie explores some deep aspects of the nature of humankind and raises a few questions. Was Natalie's action The movie explores some deep aspects of the nature of humankind and raises a few questions. Was Natalie's action morally comprehensible, including other characters Teddy, Lenny,'s actions are also questionable but they are still understandable to an extent. They use each other for their own profit like how Natalie uses Lenny for her own safety and seems to later show signs of guilt from her actions and sympathetic towards Lenny, exploring an aspect of human nature that hits close to home. Whenever Leonard keeps forgetting what he has recently encountered, it leaves viewers in a different condition, we start at the end of the incident and work our way backwards, putting the pieces together back in place. Throughout the movie, there are also individual scvens that includes flashbacks that will confuse the audience and the issue at hand, making us really feel what Leonard is experiencing and sympathizing with him. Another element in the movie that I really found intriguing and uncomfortable at the same time, is how the characters seems to get happier and happier as the plot progresses however, the audience can see what misery awaits and how the plot will go, keeping us on the edges of our seats. The first time watching this movie, I couldn't comprehend all the different techniques and couldn't quite understand some decisions made by the characters and had to do further online research. However, after finding the meaning behind some of the actions, I was mind blown by how the pieces fall in places and the great planning and execution of this film. All in all, I really did enjoy this movie and I think it deserves more spotlight.",

            "content": "A non-linear story masterpiece, Memento is most definitely one of the most mainstream and best works of film in this new (at the time) versatile way of storytelling. Director Christopher Nolan expertly tells the story put of order on purpose and precisely to confuse the audience but what separates this movie from others is when seen in order this movie is masterfully woven and cinematography tight to keep the audience on the edge with a neat and tidy, albeit confusing movie, editing wise. Nolan uses everything in his ability from actor positioning to lighting in sound to tell the story and give it an ambiance of noir as well as suspense. The scene I specifically chose to analyze is about an hour in, when Sammy Jenkin\u00e2(TM)s wife meets Leonard in his office. This scene had some rather interesting shots, edit cuts and mis-en-scene. It gave the viewer more insight on Sammy Jenkin\u00e2(TM)s and his dilemma. In this film, particularly, Mise-en-Scene is very important. Nolan created every shot, every sound frequency and color pallet for a reason.\n\tThe shots in this scene are short and focus on the conversation between Leonard and Mrs. Jenkins. The opening shot in this scene is a medium close-up which in return establishes the characters, setting, and location I relationship with each other. The shot gives us insight on Leonard\u00e2(TM)s job and office, he has his own office, so he could have been important, but then again Leonard isn\u00e2(TM)t the most reliable narrator. The shot establishes a notion of power since it\u00e2(TM)s shot from behind Leonard and showing his desk and objects on it, notifying the viewer that it\u00e2(TM)s \u00e2his desk\u00e2?, establishing power with Leonard. A clue if looked carefully on Leonard\u00e2(TM)s computer is seen. A note which suggests that even his memory then was not perfectly reliable and that foreshadows his use of notes after the accident to keep track of his life. Leonard\u00e2(TM)s power cannot be more stressed in this shot, the camera wraps around his desk which also shows his diploma on the wall, suggesting he has a professional degree, which in this case is not specified as the shot is too far. \n\tAfter these initial shots, the following shots are shallow-focused close-ups. The objects are no longer in view suggesting they aren\u00e2(TM)t relevant as well as leading back to an idea that, \u00e2memory can change the look of a room\u00e2?, as Leonard informed the audience in the film. When cut to Mrs. Jenkins the shots look a little off-centered, with a heavy amount of blurry object son the table behind her, clueing the viewer in on her unbalanced mental state. In contrast, Leonard\u00e2(TM)s shots are well balanced and clear. If what Teddy said is true, this part of Leonard must be fabricated or blended in with some other memory because Mrs. Jenkins would really be a stand in for Leonard\u00e2(TM)s dead wife. If you look closely she even looks like an older version of his wife. The mis-en-scene is so nondescript that it could easily be fabricated.\n\tIn conclusion this scene leaves so much subtle detail, but it\u00e2(TM)s up to the viewer to pick it up. Leonard was in complete contrast of his usual, tattooed, unkempt hair, dirty clothed self throughout the movie. Teddy seems to be right; Leonard doesn\u00e2(TM)t know who he is anymore.",

The script is good and the acting from Guy Pierce is very fitting into the theme and approach. The inverse mode of showing things is unique and although now, used umpteenth of times it seems stale, it was revolutionary when the film came out. This is a great example of an independent film.

Two men raped and murdered his wife and caused the injury that gave him his amnesia, and he's out for revenge.\n\nPearce, Moss, and Pantoliano all give performances that feel naturalistic and at times, awkward, although I believe it was done on purpose.\n\nHowever, the film does not start with the journey, but rather the end. Within the first scene, Leonard has shot a man in the face.

Memento's order and disorder immerses the audience into the damaged mind of central protagonist Leonard, which increases empathy for him. The performances in Memento are first class. Guy Pearce as brain-damaged Leonard is disturbingly on-point. Moss & Pantoliano are excellent. Memento is perplexing and thrills audiences while keeping them in the dark.

Well when Christopher Nolan sat down to write and direct his first big hit, if he was ever in any doubt about where to start, it certainly doesn't show in the final product. Yes this brilliant early feature from who is now arguably the greatest director working today broadcasts his confident ability and bold brilliance in all its shining glory, and in a way there it hints at much of what we might see from his future filmography whilst it also stands out as something radically different and more playful or experimental than much of his later work.\nThat's no mean feat, but thanks to the way Nolan establishes such a snappy and gritty tone whilst developing a wildly ambitious and occasionally thematic narrative means it is most definitely the case. But what's even more impressive than Memento's long reach is it's impressive grasp, and that largely lies in the hands of the film's human characterisation and tense energy that capture and engage to deliver a truly immersive experience that somehow keeps you right in the thick of things despite the wild ambition.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: That crazy narrative structure can get confusing at times...\nVERDICT: Such a madly ambitious and madly successful film so early in a director's career is rare, but 'Memento' shows Christopher Nolan taking huge risks and delivering brilliance like very few ever manage.",

It's greatest strength is the creative editing and sequencing of the film; the majority of the story is told in reverse order in short scenes, putting us in the confused mindset of Leonard. Each scene, we are unaware of what happened before, just like Leonard. It's a brilliant idea and makes this one thrilling to watch. The editing does compensate for a somewhat lackluster feeling plot once you unravel it all. Several questions are left unanswered that would help fill a lot of the plot gaps. Despite the plot issues, Memento is definitely worth a watch.",

Would Recommend.\n\nThis movie is incredibly interesting and keeps you hooked all the way through. That said, I think that the movie's primary strength is its great gimmick. It's a gimmick movie, no doubt about that, but it does actually have enough substance to back it up.\n\nTechnically speaking, this movie is excellent. The editing in this movie is phenomenal and the way that Nolan uses it to tell the story backwards is really just brilliant.\n\nThey say that Guy Pearce is never the answer and I would usually agree with the exception of this movie. He plays a genuinely troubled man and I bought him in every scene he was in. You could really feel how his character arc reverses throughout the movie and the movie wouldn't be as good as it is without his amazing performance. Carrie Anne-Mosse was also pretty good as Natalie but I do think that most people could have played her and don't think that Anne-Mosse actually added anything special to the role. Joey Pantolino was actually great as Teddy and really convinced me of his character. All the acting was great in this movie and really helps drive this movie. All the characters in the movie are also great and work as the main force of this movie.\n\nI adore the story for this movie. It's intriguing. It's intense. It's a mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} if there ever was one. Add that to Nolan's spectacular non-linear storytelling and you have a phenomenal story. I do actually think that the way Nolan presented this story was the primary driving force of it. In what's become typical Nolan fashion, the ending is mysterious and only furthers the genius of this film's script.\n\nMemento is a movie that is told in reverse. There is no real way to explain how awesome that is and how well that works other than to write this review in the same way. The driving force of this movie is the gimmick of it and that is okay because Nolan also provided us enough substance and meat to keep the potatoes edible. Guy Pearce gives one of his best performances as Leonard Shelby. The other supporting cast are also pretty good and the help drive this movie. It's mainly down to Nolan's unique script and insane mind that make this movie shine. I can't pick out my obvious flaws other than I can see many people not being satisfied with the ending of this movie. That is understandable because it took my a few hours to compile my thoughts on it. If you can take the mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} of Nolan's ingenious writing, you'll probably enjoy this movie.\n\n'MEMENTO' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne-Mossee and Joey Pantolino. It's the story of Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), a man with short term memory loss, who attempts to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and gave him his condition.",

Com uma narrativa n\u00e3o t\u00e3o caracter\u00edstica e absurdamente confusa, afinal, estamos falando de duas linhas do tempo se apresentando ao mesmo tempo e n\u00e3o separadas em cap\u00edtulos como \u00e9 ocasionalmente usado por diretores como Quentin Tarantino, Memento traz uma hist\u00f3ria simples, de car\u00e1ter comum, isto \u00e9, algo normal usado por contadores de hist\u00f3rias de todo o mundo, e transforma em algo intensamente mais grandioso. Guy Pearce, o meu xar\u00e1, vive o papel de Leonard Shelby, um ex-BAGULHETE de Seguros - que nem o Senhor Incr\u00edvel dOs Incr\u00edveis - que sofre de uma doen\u00e7a rara e incur\u00e1vel de amn\u00e9sia anter\u00f3grada - ou perda de mem\u00f3ria recente pra quem assistiu Procurando Nemo - desde que teve a casa invadida por um MELIANTE chamado John G., que tamb\u00e9m estuprou e matou a sua esposa. A \u00faltima lembran\u00e7a que Shelby consegue manter em sua caixola \u00e9 a de sua mulher morrendo bem diante de seus olhos, e sempre que passa alguns minutos \u00e9 como se ele acordasse de novo e n\u00e3o lembrasse de mais nada desde aquele dia, o qu\u00ea o faz ser alvo de bullyings constantes e preconceitos di\u00e1rios ao longo de todo o filme, afinal, ele n\u00e3o vai se lembrar mesmo n\u00e9? J\u00e1 no come\u00e7o do filme, podemos notar que come\u00e7a a se desenvolve duas narrativas distintas, uma notavelmente em P&B (preto e branco) e uma colorida, como o normal. Acontece que Nolan e o outro Nolan optaram pra usar essa t\u00e1tica, caracterizando ent\u00e3o as diferen\u00e7as de Enredo e Hist\u00f3ria. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 nas cores, outra diferen\u00e7a entre as duas narrativas \u00e9 o fato de que a sequ\u00eancia em P&B \u00e9 apresentada de forma cronol\u00f3gica, ou seja, acontecendo na ordem normal que costumamos a contar uma est\u00f3ria, com os eventos se desenrolando atrav\u00e9s dos cortes. Por\u00e9m, o qu\u00ea fez o filme ficar mais genial e confuso para o p\u00fablico mainstream \u00e9 o fato de que a sequ\u00eancia em cores, que no caso representaria o \"presente do filme\" levando em conta que a sequ\u00eancia P&B fala sobre o passado (ou no caso o in\u00edcio cronol\u00f3gico da hist\u00f3ria do filme) e os flashbacks que Shelby tem ao contar sobre Sammy Jankis, se desenrola em ordem reversa, ou seja, ainda no in\u00edcio do filmes vemos o final da hist\u00f3ria que ele sugere contar. Confuso a explica\u00e7\u00e3o? Espera at\u00e9 voc\u00ea ver o filme. \u00c9 como se os Nolans jogassem na nossa cara o final, e desde ent\u00e3o sabemos quem \u00e9 John G. e como a est\u00f3ria termina, mas o mais impactante de toda a est\u00f3ria seria o seu meio, o seu cl\u00edmax. \u00c9 algo extremamente raro e dif\u00edcil projetos deste tipo conseguirem ser feitos pela dif\u00edcil interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o que ir\u00e3o gerar nos seus espectadores, mas Nolan, como tudo o qu\u00ea toca (sou fanboy sim) consegue transformar o filme em um grande cl\u00e1ssico obrigat\u00f3rio pra qualquer pessoa, QUALQUER MESMO. Vencedor dos Oscars melhor roteiro original para o irm\u00e3o Nolinho e melhor edi\u00e7\u00e3o para o editor do filme, Amn\u00e9sia \u00e9 uma explos\u00e3o gostosa e saborosa de seus neur\u00f4nios como um copo de Coca Cola ap\u00f3s 7 dias no deserto.",

Plagued by his last memory of the rape and murder of his wife he is determined to seek out clues in order to find the man responsible and avenge her. An essential element with the cinematography is the lighting. When a scene is first shown it is in color but fades to black and white when it is a flashback sequence or something that is not actively happening. Whether Leonard is going to his hotel room, or an abandoned warehouse he fades in and out of clarity. The only hope he has to remember people is to take pictures of them and write ancillary facts about them on the back of the photographs which he carries with him everywhere. A more sadistic element of the plot unfolds when he strips down and the viewer sees his tattoos that he self-inflicted on himself backwards. This is so every morning when he forgets where he is he can look in the mirror and remember what his mission is. He is so obsessive of not forgetting anything that he places sticky notes on his body to shave and of the location of his gun and other articles such as his car. One thing that is clear throughout is that someone named John G is responsible for the murder and he is determined to find him. The conflict in understanding the narrative is that it is nonlinear and it shifts around many events. When he is remembering his past his memory is clear and he continually harps on this story of Sam Jenkins who when he worked as an insurance investigator was suspected of being a conman but he eventually believes actually suffered from short-term memory loss following a car accident. However, Leonard feels guilty because he determined that it was a mental block and not a physical ailment which made Sam and his wife ineligible to collect. As he talks on the movie throughout the film we keep getting this foreshadowing from the mysterious person he is on the phone with that Leonard is hiding something. One of the foreshadows comes through a quote when Leonard says, \"memories are unreliable, some things you remember from instinct.\" The film is in the archetype of Good vs evil because I argue that Leonard is fighting with two sides of himself the one side that wants to do the right thing and the other that is manipulating himself. Even in the last scene when he kills Jimmy who had nothing to do with the murder he can not come to terms that the rapist is dead and Sammy didn't have a wife. The film does not really offer Leonard a resolution because he doesn't want one it is \"man's descent into hell.\" The social commentary in the film seems to be that we as humans can manipulate ourselves into believing something even if it's not true. Our belief can become reality. One scene I noticed was when Sam's face morphed into Leonards in the scene of him sitting in the nursing home. Leonard killed his own wife with diabetes insulin and uses the story of Sam to cope. I thoroughly enjoyed the film but I was left wondering if his condition is mental or physiological.",

However, the advantage of waiting this long is I forgot most of what happens in the film (yes, I do see the irony in that sentence.) Watching it now made me realize just how brilliant this film is, and why I was so intrigued by it years ago. I simply adore the way Nolan structures the movie, essentially telling the narrative backwards, in order to give the audience the same uneasy feel that the main character has because of his condition. If played in a more traditional beginning-to-end style I imagine that this movie would be kind of straightforward and lack the gut-punch that it is designed to deliver. Nolan perfectly scripted the film to constantly pull the rug out from under us so we could never trust what was happening and had to think twice about the meaning of every scene. Guy Pearce has never been better than he is in Memento, and he perfectly plays Leonard as both dangerous and yet tragic. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also very good, but really everything in this movie kind of hinges on the amazing script. I genuinely don't want to spoil even one scene for someone who hasn't seen it, because the experience of watching it all unfold before your eyes is remarkable. I genuinely love this film, and it is easily one of my favorite movie-going experiences of all time. Seeing it again just reinforced my feelings and now I want to own it so I can watch it repeatedly and see all the little clues and hints that Nolan brilliantly sprinkles throughout.

            "content": "Memento is Chris Nolan's first pretty big budget film and a reminder to everyone that the word used in the title is not actually pronounced \"momento\".  I really can't tell you much about this movie without ruining it, but I'll do what I can.  First off, it's got Cypher and Trinity from the Matrix in it, which is kind of weird.  The main character is Guy Pierce, who can't remember shit, so he tattoos stuff on his body and takes polaroids (they're like instagrams without like buttons and an antiquated share system).  Unfortunately, he makes it really fucking cryptic so both he and the movie going audience are confused until the plot resolves itself. \n\nThe movie has that 90's grungy neo-noir grit in the same sort of way that The Mechanic or Se7en do, and does the non-linear storytelling thing kind of like a couple of other 90's movies.  Like a lot of Nolan movies, this one can be confusing if you're mentally deficient, so you can either find charts, graphs and youtube clips online to help you out, or you can just watch something more tailored to your mental capacity like Spider-Man 2.  \n\nTL;DR - 8/10\nThis is a great flick.  It's pretty dark, but if you're not a baby child then you should be able to get wrapped up in the twisty-turny nuance provided by a young Nolan who really shows off his directorial chops.",

The way this is shot is not just a gimmick; it excellently portrays the mindset of the lead character who suffers from this condition. As such we only ever know what he knows and scenes often feel like they are disparate in time with seemingly no connection to what we have just seen. The secondary timeline- shot in black and white- provides a further level of confusion till the two timelines meet in a satisfying- if melancholic- ending.\n\nOne slight issue is that I did not feel much of an emotional connection with Guy Pearce's character but because of the nature of the story arc, this might well be inevitable. With the use of a unreliable narrator, there are plenty of twists for the viewer and is certainly one of the very best in the psychological thriller genre.",

Some will adore this complexity, others may dislike it and stick to movies with a straightforward plot structure. However there's no denying, the Nolan brothers have produced an incredibly unique story. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what qualifies as a spoiler, since the movie is told backwards, so I'll somewhat describe the general structure and themes that are explored, all of which are generally implemented and executed impeccably. Nolan has essentially taken an already complex plot, cut it into twenty pieces, ordered the second half of the pieces into a backwards order, added one of the first half's pieces in between each of the other half's pieces and had them told in a straightforward order. So when we reach the ending, the two halves come together.\n\nGuy Pearce does an excellent job in the lead role. His character, Leonard, obtains a short-term memory loss condition after an attack on him and his wife. This prevents him from being able to remember things for longer than several minutes before forgetting them, all he can do to inform himself of past events is to write notes or tattoo his body with messages. Our protagonist always appears in a fairly neutral mood, since he barely has time to develop immense anger or happiness before forgetting everything up until the attack. The angriest we see him is when he receives messages that he doesn't understand, or doesn't receive them at all and is left with a situation to deal with that he can't figure out.\n\nThis is the film that truly gained Christopher Nolan the recognition that he deserves. If this doesn't blow your mind the first time, or even intrigue you to a degree of vast confusion, then rewatch it, and it will.",

The man is a genius and raised the bar high as far as quality entertainment with his realistic entertaining directing style as well as the original ideas he comes up with. I mean its flat out remarkable his achievements. Despite Interstellar not holding up as high as inception, The prestige and the dark knight trilogy it still one hell of a ride. In this case interstellar is a loot better than Memento in my opinion. Memento is a tough to follow flick that looks at a unique kind of amnesia. The kind where you can't make new memories and you forget meeting people. Despite the cast keeping you glued to the tv this is a clear sign that Nolan back then had a long way to go in his story telling skills.\n\tMemento focuses on Leonard Shelby a detective who suffers from a unique kind of amnesia, Anterograde Amnesia. Leonard is unable to store recent memories thanks to an attack that involved his wife being killed. Shelby tries to put the pieces together and meets several key people including a bartender named Natalie and a mysterious contact named Teddy. The entire film goes back and forth between color and black and white and is edited slightly out of sequences. \nFirst and foremost I never knew this kind of memory issue existed. Acting was pretty good here. Guy pearce is so convincing with his portrayal and it's such a dark role for him. Carrie ann moss and joe pantiolano were also pretty decent but only to an extent. Decent lighting  and cinematography can tell it's wally phister\nHowever this movie is only Ok it's really oddly structured. I couldn't tell when or where the story was progressing it was really strange and confusing. I felt like I was watching several different complete personality changes in certain scenes that made my head hurt. Even by the end I was still very confused. The direction wasn't to great. \nOne can definitely tell by this film that Nolan was just getting started in his career. Glad to know he improved later. I honestly gotta say you will be having a major headache trying to figure out this film its so confusing!!",

            "content": "\"Memento\" is brilliant and expertly pieced together. It's more than a movie, it's an experience. How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes:\n\n\nOur protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible. \n\n\nNow that you have the premise of the film, there is another vital piece of information that you must know in order to understand what this movie is like. The movie is told in reverse, with the scene that would normally be at the very end of this story being shown at the beginning, and so on. This means that just like the protagonist, you don't know what causes actions or how Leonard go to a spot as its happening. This is where the brilliance of the film comes in. Just like \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", where the drug trip the characters go on, and the experience of watching the movie feel like the same, the condition that Leonard suffers and the experience you will get from watching the movie are the same. It's hard to wrap your brain around this, but even if you're dubious about it working (trust me, it works incredibly well), have you ever seen a movie that tries to pull a trick like this? It's a breath of fresh air.\n\n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it's not just a gimmicky story; it would still be just as interesting to watch if it was told in the \"normal\" order. It's a story about revenge like no other because it exposes the biggest flaw about going on a quest to get even in a way that no other movie about the subject can. If you were out on the path of vengeance, you might get satisfaction from killing the person that murdered your wife, but that isn't going to get her back. The purpose of revenge then, is revenge itself. You seek retribution in order to give yourself the satisfaction that you have done something. But what happens when you don't even have that? What happens when you find the guy and you take gleeful pleasure in making him suffer so intensely that he prays for death, but once the deed is done you can't even remember it happening? I'm a huge fan of films about payback because there's something primal about them that is satisfying, but they also lend themselves very well to complicated ideas and paradoxes. This is one of the smartest and most original stories of revenge that I've seen.\n\n\nThere's even more going on with this movie because it plays wonderfully with the condition that Leonard suffers from (the technical term is anterograde amnesia). As the story unfolds you see that many people sympathize with the man's condition, while others use it to their advantage and ultimately it becomes impossible to know who he can really trust. The further you get into the movie, the more twisted it gets and everything that you think you know gets turned upside down. Once again, it makes you as disoriented as the character in the movie and that's a wonderful, original and confusing feeling. All of a sudden, sequences of mundane exposition become huge plot twists!\n\n\nI found \"Memento\" to be an extremely satisfying experience. It's so twisty, so intelligently written, so well acted and so well directed that it's the kind of movie that you can never forget once you've seen. I absolutely loved it and I'm very curious to see how it plays out a second time around, or if there is a way to view it in the \"correct\" order with some special edition blu-ray or Dvd out there. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're interested in movies even a little bit, you should treat yourself by experiencing \"Memento\". (On Blu-ray, June 14, 2012)",

But it wasn't as messy and convoluted as Insomnia and his TDK trilogy, or as intellectually pretentious as The Prestige and Inception. Like all his subsequent movies, it was cluttered with unnecessary garbage (the interspersed black and white filler scenes of the protagonist going stir-crazy in the motel room).\nIt wasn't a gratuitous gimmick. The reverse sequencing left the viewer as memory-challenged as the protagonist. Afterwards, it prompts us to question the reliability of our own memories. And to wonder. Who are we without our memories? The fragmented, backsliding narrative was a perfectly suitable technique for the story and characters at hand. Nolan was a young, prodigious filmmaker with a great future ahead of him (or was it behind him?).\nNow, looking back after watching everything else this overpraised and overvalued director has made, I believe the reverse sequencing in Memento came as an afterthought. An idea devised in the editing room after it was shot. A decision made after a disappointing first cut, as a way to inject more mystery and confusion into an unexceptional crime thriller.

Not only is it an immensely enthralling watch, containing strong pacing, impressive cinematography from Wally Pfister and understated but undeniably moving performances, but it is also an intelligent film, composed of themes and ideas that have rare placement in modern Hollywood and cinema. Unlike so many a director in today's money-hungry film industry, Nolan doesn't feel obligated to abide by story-telling conventions, nor does he feel an impulse to carefully guide his viewer through the experience he is allowing us to endure. Sure, Nolan allows voice-overs to provide inner monologue for the main protagonist, these giving us an insight into not only his thought process, but the plot in its entirety, yet still, these voice-overs don't necessarily seek to provide a web of safety for the viewer. One can not simply sit back and rely on inner dialogue to provide the answers that one may desire. Nolan seems to demand complete and utter concentration from the viewer, and due to his immediately creative and shocking style and use of imagery, we happily oblige.\n\nMemento centres around the character of Leonard (Guy Pearce), a man who received short term memory loss when he was hit over the head by an unknown assailant whilst this man's partner in crime was raping and killing Leonard's wife. Ever since, Leonard's entire goal in life is to track down and kill the man who took his wife and his ability to form memories from him. Using various clues that he leaves himself before his memory resets, Leonard is able to navigate the world and figure out just who to trust, and who may very well be leading him astray. The question is though; is Leonard reliable enough to inform his future self of the supposed 'facts', or is his own advice misdirected instead?\n\nIn many ways, Memento asks the same questions as Inception; should we blame ourselves for the problems that occur around us, though it poses this thematic concept with a far more literal context than Nolan's dream-based blockbuster. Nolan, utilizing a non-chronological sequence of events, keeps us in the dark not only as to what may occur at the end of the film, but in regards to Leonard's own directions. The film encompasses two different set of sequences, one being set in black and white, the other being in colour. The black and white sequences occur at what many would consider, if this were any other film, to be the beginning of the story. It moves forwards. The coloured set of sequences begin at the end of the chronological story and move backwards (not physically reversing, but moving a scene back every switch between black and white and coloured, and then connecting back up to the prior scene at the end of the sequence). These two sets of sequences arrive at the middle at the end of the film, and we get to discover something far more interesting than the end results of Leonard's eventual actions. We get to discover his reasoning and character for doing such.\n\nThis is what makes Memento one of the most original and thoroughly unique films of the modern era. Instead of making the viewer's primary goal that of finding out Leonard's end results, Nolan implores us to find out the character behind the actions instead. To show the story in the chronological sequence instead of this intelligent way of sequencing actually used within the film would have been a fatal mistake, as Leonard would have become a far less interesting character; after all, his memory does reset at the end of each scene, so at first glance, it becomes almost entirely impossible to connect with him. But Nolan tackles this brisk challenge by looking at the character in a completely different form than what any other writer would have. Take any other screenwriter, and they would have focused on Leonard's system of telling himself what he has forgotten, this including using tattoos, notes and photos to inform his future self of the danger or trustworthiness of each; they would have focused on exploring this system with great depth. They would have focused on the end result of Leonard's deceptions and tribulations. Nolan sees this system and the chronological conclusion as irrelevant, for he instead sees it appropriate to judge and focus upon the conscious of a troubled individual; a man who strives to find a purpose in life. The film asks whether or not someone is willing to fabricate a fake life and problem, just so they may have a purpose in their actions. Ultimately, its answer is relatively inconclusive, so the viewer is left to ponder on this thematic concept.\n\nThe character at the centre of all this is played wonderfully by Guy Pearce, who gives the character a number of perhaps falsified traits and reactions, and determines Leonard's likability, as that is perhaps the most defining factor about the individual. For the majority of the film, we, along with Leonard, rely on his own information to help us understand exactly what is going on, and we respect and believe his hints not just because he is our protagonist, but also because he is a thoroughly likable person. He is relatable, sympathetic and understanding, and we immediately cling to his being, despite him doing a number of questionable and morally ambiguous things towards the beginning of the running time. Pearce is the perfect primary character, and handles the character with precision and a practiced ease. Honestly, after watching his performance, I can imagine few others fitting into the role so well. Acting alongside him are Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, a woman who takes advantage of Leonard's disability and uses it to advance her own position, as well as Joe Pantoliano, who plays Teddy, a shady undercover cop, who may or may not be willing to help Leonard. All of the ensemble give subtle performances, alluding to whether or not they may be hiding something from not only Leonard, but the viewer. Never have I been so unsure of who is trustworthy, and who is an enemy, and that is a credit to the actors and to Nolan.\n\nPerhaps the only negative with the film is that of the score, from David Julyan, whose synthetic approach lacks much substance or story. It does the basics and nothing more; it allows a certain mood but doesn't provide a story or semblance of anything more. This is a very minor gripe though, as Nolan's sound mixer, William Fiege, managed to utilize both silence and Julyan's score to maximum effect, delivering a strong effort. The editing is also worthy of commendation, initializing a strong pace that helps to carry the film forward and keep it from slowing down. Nolan's editor, Dody Dorn, is also responsible for the coherence felt throughout the entire picture that allows the film to remain accessible, even whilst it traverses certain ideas and events which may become confusing for the viewer.\n\nAs a technical piece, Memento is perfection. But ultimately, it's the story-telling component that renders this picture one of Nolan's finest. Some may declare plot holes all over the shop; one of late prolific film reviewer Roger Ebert's readers posed the question in regards to Memento that reads, \"If the last thing the main character remembers is his wife dying, then how does he remember that he has short-term memory loss?\" One can make up excuses for the film (perhaps Leonard looks at a note that states his condition every day, but Nolan felt it unnecessary to dwell on it?), but I don't believe it's all that necessary, considering how completely flawless the rest of the film is. Despite the complex ideas and events occurring within the picture, Nolan establishes his characters and ordeals with tight story-telling prowess, allowing the story to unravel in an unnatural but highly innovative way, and one that keeps us guessing about motivations and thought processes until the very final few seconds. In my opinion, modern cinema has lost the ability to provide fulfillment for its viewer; this issue plagues most of my friends, who don't watch films too often. They view films which don't ask questions or pose problems that beg to be solved. They're simply as they appear; there are no underlying themes or concepts that keep them thinking after the running time concludes. What makes a film like Under the Skin an insta-classic is its ability to garner the imagination of the viewer. And when you finally develop a conclusion or idea for how or what something represents, or how the story really concludes, you feel like you've triumphed in something. It's the same feeling as conquering a race or acing a test; it provides a thrill and joy that is unmatched, at least in my experiences. Memento is sure to provide that exciting fulfillment when I finally understand its many ideas and plot points, and that in and of itself is deserving of high praise. Nolan may just very well be my favourite director of all time now.\n\n\"Now... where was I?\"",

            "content": "Rating Memento is challenging for me. As a huge Nolan fan and a lover of nuanced cinema, the twisting and intelligent nature of the movie really begs me to love it. What Nolan crafts with Memento has been termed gimmicky but unlike recent gimmicks (i.e. Boyhood), Nolan manages to wrap up all of the loose ends while sacrificing none of the intelligence. Unfortunately, the film can only be appreciated (or ultimately connected to) with a detailed internet research session at the conclusion and although I'm not opposed to augmenting a film with some dedicated commentary, I can't help but think of films like Fight Club and Cloud Atlas, which are arguably more complex philosophically but manage to weave a narrative just cohesive enough to engage the viewer during the first watch, even if a second watch and analysis is required to fully understand all of the nuances. To some degree, I think this may be less on Nolan, and more on the actors themselves. While I have nothing against Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss (and Joe Pantoliano for that matter) will always have a special place in my heart for what they accomplished in The Matrix, none of these thespians are top of the line. Unlike Leonardo DiCaprio's Inception performance, a film which falters in ways Memento never does but is carried by its lead, Pearce never manages to really own his role, while Carrie-Anne Moss hovers on the edge of bad for the whole film. The result is a mixed bag, with a cast that is never really likable (or particularly engaging) and a structure that is just a bit too confusing for my taste. I will say that after connecting the dots via the web, Memento paints an impressive picture of a tortured soul struggling to find an identity. It's a shame Nolan didn't look to Bale or DiCaprio just a few years sooner.",

            "content": "Memento tells the story of a widower-Leonard (played by Guy Pierce) on a mission to find the (second) man responsible for raping and killing his wife. During the attack Leonard was brutally beaten which resulted in anterograde amnesia, a rare condition which prevents his brain from storing recent memories (short term memory loss). Leonard is able to piece together the details of his attack and journey by snapping polaroid's, writing himself notes, and tattooing important facts on his body, the most significant being \"John G. raped and murdered my wife.\" As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses.\n\nThe sequence of this film is backwards. The opening scene is the climatic ending. Somehow Nolan was able to pull this off without spoiling or revealing one pertinent detail. Then it proceeds in two convergent narrative lines one from the present (backwards) and the other from the past (forward), untangling itself in brief snippets mirroring the forgetful condition of the tortured lead character. The audience, like Leonard, learns in fragments what's going on. Perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who's doing what and why.\n\nMemento is a unique mystery thriller. The climax of the movie takes you off guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly thorough storyline. If you like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires you to follow along, participate and fit puzzle pieces together. Memento doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. A must see if you are looking for something clever and original.",

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted. \n\nGuy Pearce as Leonard - Guy Pearce is fantastic a man trying to find out who killed his wife even with memory loss. \n\nEveryone else is great this was a well shot movie like Every Nolan Film is \n\nVery Original movie started at the End of the Movie leading you up to The Beginning of the Movie to find out Why He Killed Teddy.\n\nThe Ending (Beginning) of the Movie is awesome very unexpected, but not really if you pay attention to the Black and White Segements.\n\nOverall: One of my favorite Nolan Films its Fantastic and one of the best Films today.\n\nOverall: A+",

Written by Nolan himself and his brother Jonathan,  \"Memento\" has one unique gimmick :its narrative is told backwards. Each scene plays out as if one was rewinding to the previous scene. The exposition then helps to fill in the story. The viewer learns about the main character Leonard Shelby played by Guy Pearce (LA Confidential), a former insurance investigator who is obsessed with finding and killing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is Leonard has a \"condition\" preventing him from making new memories. Leonard makes sticky notes and tattoos as reminders all over his body, he also takes Polaroid pictures of everyone he meets as an attempt to piece together the mystery.  The first thing I thought was how would he know if he ever succeeded?  Also how easy it would be for people to use and manipulate someone like \"Lenny\".  Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix) both show up as pieces to Lenny's puzzle that are using him for their own gain.\n\nMemento's California setting reminded me of the far superior film \"Chinatown\".One can see that visually Christopher Nolan is a strong director. His next few films have proven him one of the strongest directors of his generation .\"Insomnia\", \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\", \"Inception\" are all strong and ambitious films.  \nMemento is gripping but if you strip away how the narrative is executed, the story is not very compelling.  If you were to watch the film in chronological order it's plot is predictable and pretty boring. Pantoliano being killed in the opening scene is the films climax, interesting yes, but it also makes his behavior throughout the film pretty obvious resulting in a flat character.

            "content": "While there are many things to appreciate about the films made by Christopher Nolan, the directors continues ambition towards the methods of storytelling would have to be his most profounding achievement. From tightly constructed avant-grade thrillers to cerebral blockbusters, Nolan creativity has undeniably contributed to his idealization. And while now the auteur is reaching many heights, his second feature, \"Memento,\" is still one of the directors most brilliant films. And after viewing it for the third time, it still feels just as fresh. \r\n\r\nThe narrative follows Leonard (Guy Pearce), a man who suffers from short-term memory loss and uses pictures and tattoos in an attempt to uncover the murder of his wife. In terms of genre, \"Memento\" reflects characteristics of the revenge thriller and neo-noir, however (and just like \"Following\") Nolan's execution of the narrative structure elevates these genre archetypes into a cerebral challenge. Fundamentally, the narrative develops through a juxtaposition of two separate time periods. For differentiation, one of these timelines is reflected through normal colour imagery and begins at the conclusion of the film and directs the narrative in a backward manner through short segments (reflecting the internal position of the protagonist inability to create new memories). The other time period is reflected through black and white imagery and moves in a chronological order until both narratives (one moving back and one moving forward) eventually meet. As previously mentioned, it is Nolan's execution of this extremely difficult narrative that makes \"Memento\" extremely riveting because the director demands the audience attention (you literally can't look away for one second). Moreover, the narrative style - arguably -  represents one of the heights of modern films in terms of creativity and innovation.\r\n\r\nLike his other films, it is quite evident that the director focuses on making an experience that demands repeated viewings. And after recently finishing \"The Prestige,\" it seems by the end of each Nolan film (including \"Memento\") previous information is always subverted. For \"Memento,\" it seems by the end of the film that the morality of the protagonist is jeopardized. Initially, the story of Leonard and his slow reveal to be a man who is being exploited by his disability and his final memory being the death of his wife (his lasting connection to the past) suggests that the protagonist is a compelling tragic figure. However, once we reach the conclusion of the film, the motivations of the 'hero' are destabilized. A distinct trait of Nolan's films is misdirection -  and \"Memento\" could possibly epitomize one of directors favourite techniques. Although this indulgence of misinformation could be annoying for some viewers, it is undeniably one of fundamental reason for revisiting Nolan's films.\r\n\r\nBeing adopted from a short story created by his brother Jonathan Nolan, \"Memento\" contains many literary ideas to chew on - in fact, the movie very much reflects many of characteristics associated with the postmodern condition: existential crisis, an unreliable narrator (a device the director would turn to time and time again), skepticism towards facts and memories or the past (which of course applies to the historical discipline and is metaphorically represented with the opening shot of the fading Polaroid image) and of the course the concept of fragmentation being overtly represented through the narrative structure. And while these ideas will not necessarily excite the casual viewer, the layers of themes simply reflect Nolan's ability at balancing a refreshing thriller that many in the public domain can enjoy while still containing an extremely interesting subtext for critics, film scholars and devoted cinephiles.\r\n\r\nWhile the director is now reaching extravagant heights, \"Memento\" is still quite possibly his most innovative film - and for Nolan, that's saying something.",

Making his name bringing to life The Dark Knight and making a shed tonne of intellectually challenging films in between that trilogy that kept us in awe of the mans talent. Although Following was a great start to a career, it was Memento that really made people stand up and go, Chris Nolan? Guys a genius. So much so, merely a few years later, Al Pacino and Robin Williams were queing at his office, screaming to be part of his next film. The reason? Memento. A wonderfully crafted, intense, cinematic and thrillingly mind bending piece of cinema, that firmly grasped the early millenium and tore it a new arse hole. Lenny is a torn man, an insurance officer, set tio differentiate the frauds from the truth. After a monsterous attck on him and his wife, Lenny comes down with a condition that renders all short term memory useless. While searching for his wives killer, he must trust his instinct, his friends and his writings in order to catch the rapist and killer of his wife. Its deep stuff and Nolan plays it so out of the box, the film continues to be fresh, every single time you watch it. The cast are terrific, Guy Pearce, has a career defining moment as Lenny, Carrie Anne Moss, plays the almost femme fetale pitch perfectly and Joe Pantolino almost show steals with his depiction of Teddie, Lennys \"Only friend.\" The film mixes Arronofsky with Tarintino, slamming between obscure and paranoia induced scenes, with comedic and full of witty dialogue moments, that will stay with you forever. The film would work as a straight running film, owever, Nolans decision to show the film in reverse adds and even more intense layer of dread. You become intrigued as a viewer into Lennys world.

Human body, our brain is complicate and functional. But just like computers, needs input to have output. It is why Lenny needs to note everything down. The note creates a memory for him. No matter the note is right or not, he need it to shape who he is. Teddy said \"it is what you were not what you are.\" when Lenny answered who he is. I feel confused. Is what we were not what we are? The memory Lenny has experienced but lost can changes him? How about Sammy? Sammy is just an inexistent person for Lenny to flat his guilty. It a lie told by our brain to protect us (a natural white lie.) Going further to science fiction, if some one put my memory to another body, is it still me? The answer for me is YES. We can live without past but need memory, no matter the memory is right or not.\nAnd do we need anticipated future to identify ourselves? For Lenny, John.G is the only chasing of his life and he must keep it because he can't create new one. It's right that you can't heal if you can't feel the time. Lenny's life stays in the moment his wife dying. For other people have long term memory, I think we keep create new goals of life even the smallest one. Sometimes maybe is death (for people have cancer).\nLenny's memory likes sausage slices, every piece are independent. But he still has the whole memory before injured. If without it, I think every slices of his memory can seem as a separated identity. They have no connect with each other. Lenny only concludes himself from the thing he senses in the slice he lives. He only lives in one slice one time.",

The non-linear structure and the constant character motivations is a classic trait by Nolan. Memento is no exception. The first time I saw this movie I didn't really understand all of it. I only gave this movie a 5/10. But after watching it again and experienced the grasp of Memento am I totally convinced that this really is a blockbuster. The movie is so refreshing with its unique structure and excellent actors. The plot is very solid and because we're talking about a man that can't make new memories is this movie even greater. Because of the unique structure; the audience is forgetting what they just saw. It's the same with the main character. That tight connection between the audience and the movie makes this movie wonderful. But you really need to pay attention. If you miss something you risk missing the greater importance. And if you do; watch it again! \n\nMemento really is a fabulous movie. The cinematography is very smooth and the acting is phenomenal. There's really nothing bad about it. It's one interesting, deep and flawless movie. It even got the classic Nolan-ending, the part of the movie that has the most plot-twists. \n\nPeople may say Interstellar is too ambitious; but Memento isn't? Memento is one refreshing, awesome and non-linear thriller that's highly enjoyable. But not as great as his newer creations. \n\n8/10",

Well, for the most part, Nolan has done the best he can with this complex-yet-simple, twisty-and-turny, flash-forward-flashback screenplay of his. The repetition and the way the story unfolds is pretty neat, and the cinematography is great thanks to Team Nolan's good ol' Wally Pfister. It's the type of Inception-ish movie where you have to be 100% focused on it at all times, and you have to be ready to think for a second.

            "content": "Ever go to see a movie and suddenly find yourself watching the film backwards? Seems like a weird question, but that in fact was the case for Christopher Nolan's second film MEMENTO, based off the short story Memento Mori (which is actually written by the former's brother, Jonathan Nolan). The special case with Memento is that it is built on TWO timelines: a COLOR sequence, in which all scenes are placed in reverse order, and a BLACK & WHITE sequence, in which all scenes are placed in regular order. The sequences alternate throughout the film (meaning we have Color, then B/W, then Color again), starting off with the Color Sequence showing a reverse murder. Memento revolves around a man, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), suffering from anterograde amnesia while searching for the man who raped and murdered his wife. Anterograde amnesia is a form of memory loss in which the patient CANNOT recreate new memories, therefore in the film Leonard uses a series of Polaroids and tattoos to give himself clues and remind him of the search. All he remembers is everything preceding the incident that caused the memory loss. Nolan amazingly directed this extremely engaging neo-noir story about a man trying to kill someone, even though the man forgets half the time that's he's trying to do just that in the first place. Also, for those who might think that using those two timelines would be confusing, they actually aren't and rather add an extra layer of mystery toward the characters-at \"Point A\" you believe in certain facts that the film has set up for you; by \"Point Z\" your whole perception of Memento has completely changed, the film having done some kind of backflip on you. Which leads me to talk about the ending... Oh I really wish. That gets into SPOILER territory, but it is an astounding conclusion. \n\nAll performances are great especially from Pearce, this is one of the best of his career (can't forget L.A. Confidential though). However the standout, in my opinion, is actually Carrie Anne Moss. That might come across as a surprise to some people, but her portrayal of Natalie is quite possibly the best performance of her career (as of now it's tied with Trinity from The Matrix for me). Joe Pantoliano also stars and is awesome as well, but a fun fact about him and Memento: in the opening scene, Nolan had actually re-recorded one of Pantoliano's lines because he thought it had originally sounded weird and wanted to take it out of the film. \n\nMy only negative about Memento would have to be that most of the B&W scenes are mainly exposition, although it can be ignored for the most part since a particular story told in that timeline ties in with the ending later on. All in all I believe Memento is a fantastic psychological thriller, and while only being Nolan's second film he once again increased the scope and set out again with high ambitions. This is my second favorite film of Nolan's career, and I contend that it's also one of the best psychological thrillers of the 2000's - 9.9/10",

            "content": "The DVD menu for Memento captured me. Literally not a second into the movie, and I was already quite interested. The menu has a long list of single words, surely each with their own meaning. I eventually had \"Watch\" selected, and instinctively, I chose that. There weren't that many clues, but given what I know about DVD menus, it felt right. The movie Memento is like that too, only Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), our protagonist, is dependent on what he knows to make these instinctive choices. Shelby has a memory loss condition, which started from when he was knocked out by a man, John G, who was accomplice to or simply was the person who raped and murdered his wife. By the time he regained consciousness, he can only remember happenings of the past five minutes or so before his clock resets. That is ripe for confusing trite, right? Well, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, director and screenwriter respectively, somehow tell the story in a comprehensive and fascinating way by playing it backwards. By backwards, I mean that we see the chronological ending of the tale at the very beginning, where Shelby kills John G/Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), thanks to the help of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), someone who, \"has also lost someone.\" Scenes are divided by memory blocks. Whenever Shelby is suddenly clueless about what is happening, that's when a scene begins. That means, as the movie moves forward, we see how one scene led to the one we previously saw. If you're looking for a genre to call this movie, I would use \"psychological mystery.\" I think it's cool to watch scenes like this, as it helped me in relating to Shelby's mental condition.\n\nBetween these memory blocks are B&W scenes that are chronologically earlier than the coloured memory block scenes, and are played in normal, forward fashion. Shelby is on the phone with someone about a man named Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a con man who faked the same condition that Shelby now has. Sammy's type 1-diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris) was not totally convinced, and hoping to snap Sammy out of this mindset, she asked Sammy for several insulin shots in the span of a few minutes. She went into a coma and died. It's a depressing story that only becomes sadder by the end of the movie. Watching the wife overdose was traumatic enough as it is, but with all context into consideration, Memento came damn close to bringing me to tiny tears.\n\nWith Shelby's condition, how does he ever know what he is doing? Sometimes, he has to use context clues, such as, when a tall man is shooting a gun at you, you are running away, not towards, from said man. Starting scenes like that feels like we are entering the middle of the scene, with much credit to cinematographer Wally Pfister. For the important facts, however, he takes a photograph, and writes the name of what he photographed and facts that he could easily forget by the next block. He also gets tattoos for the especially important notes. By watching the story in a choppy, backwards fashion, I initially trusted whatever Shelby wrote. Scene by scene, note by note, his memory loss continuously proves him to be a very unreliable narrator. He is adamant about his distinction between memories and facts, yet his notes are skewed by what he supposedly remembers. Guy Pearce's stubborn action star attitude is perfect for the character, and since Memento is not primarily an action movie, that attitude is more pitiful than honourable.\n\nTL;DR: It's a Christopher Nolan movie. Your mind will be blown, at some stage. This may very well be his best, due to an offbeat narrative structure and how that narrative allows a great gut-blow payoff by the ending.",

Interesting editing work, colored scenes display the plot backwards and monochromatic scenes in normal chronology, in the end we see the middle of the story... I can't see what's so special about this, it wasn't particularly difficult for me to make sense of the story with just 1 view and I didn't find that it added anything appreciable to the cinematic experience... it merely entertained while it lasted... The story itself is nothing of the other world and is not very believable. A man who with anterograde amnesia is wrongly convinced that some guy raped and murdered his wife and spends most of his time hunting for that man, but due to his condition he mostly wanders in the dark and will do some erratic killing here and there and forget about it. The truth is that he killed his wife himself and can't remember it. Now, how exactly has the amnesiac able to survive in such an hostile environment? How exactly did he arrive at the point he was in the beginning of the story? There are several characters in the plot whose intentions or motivations lack clarification, not saying it doesn't make any sense but it's easy to see how it was all forced and manipulated to suit the far-fetched story. If this was supposed to be a satirical comedy I could have another appreciation and maybe rate it higher. Not being the case I wonder if 6,5 is not too high for what I experienced, I would gladly rate this lower, only reason I don't is because at a purely technical level, particularly the editing work, this is a good... cheating its way up among the dumb critics I'd say. If a movie can get so much love and kiss simply due to some unconventional narrative structure or some other purely technical aspect while neglecting real depth of story, meaning or cinematography then something is awfully wrong. Guy Pearce acting is another good point as well, the only thing that I found remotely interesting he managed to actually make his unlikely character believable. As soon as plot is chronologically ordered and the amnesiac condition is understood, it's apparent how basic and shallow this movie really is. Pathetically overrated, forgettable experiment.\r\n\r\nThis movie has an educational value about anterograde amnesia, it's worth for that.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has made a name for himself in 21st century cinema, and his growing popularity was due to a film he made at the turn of the century, that film was Memento. It was a film that showed just how intelligent and unique Nolan is.\n\nMemento's screenplay was written by Christopher Nolan, and it was based off a short story written by, Christopher's brother, Jonathan Nolan entitled \"Memento Mori\". The film's story is essentially a revenge drama, which I felt was very simplistic. Though it makes it easier for us if the film had a simple story in order to not cause any confusion, but it would have been nice if there was more depth as we go along. Nolan seems to have put everything in his climax, which I cannot deny was fantastic, but everything else leading up to it doesn't seems as interesting when going through it in subsequent viewings. The film requires itself to be small in order to create less plot holes and to ensure we don't get distracted from following Lenny's story, but this doesn't mean the other players of the story have to be less interesting. I understood that Nolan wanted this to be subjective and completely in the perspective of our protagonist but I felt there was very little insight from him about the supporting characters, Lenny may not remember the feelings that he had during a particular point in time but we are going scene by scene in his perspective therefore there must be some sort of judgement being created towards the people he meets. What Lenny writes down in his Polaroid photographs, is the only thing we do know about these people. Luckily though, Nolan gives the audience a lot of insight for our protagonist, uncovering layers and layers about him that kept me interested all the way through. This complexity of our protagonist would be something of a trademark in Nolan's future films allowing the audience to be invested in them, having us interested in coming back to his films, finding things that we didn't pick up during the previous viewing. As I have said, Nolan has a flair of creating a gripping climax and what he has created for this film, was gripping. The film's explanation at the end may come off as a bit forced but the content takes a huge turn that nobody expected coming. This is an ability that not many can do effectively, but Nolan does it like there wasn't any effort put in on it. Nolan doesn't provide us with any clear answer at the end, and it is truly up to us whether we buy the story that was being told or not. Nolan tackles a pretty daring concept, as to put this on film and making it subjective is not an easy task. He explores the difficulty of having this condition and how easy it is to be deceived by others because of it. Dialogue in this film is spot on, with lines constantly giving us more and more about the characters and allowing us to piece the puzzle ourselves. The film also uses narration from the perspective of the protagonist in order to gain that subjective experience that Nolan really wanted and I think without it, it would have made the film dull and prevented the audience from understanding Lenny's intentions.\n\nThe film was directed by Christopher Nolan, who is now a favorite by the mainstream public due to his ability to make entertaining films and bring a layer of complexity and originality to them. Memento's main strength isn't found in it's plot but rather on the way he shows it. Nolan has taken a simple story and combined it with the fractured storytelling that was found on notable films in the 90s. But then Nolan also inserted this layer of complexity by having with our main protagonist be equipped with a memory condition. The non-linear approach allows the audience to gain that feeling of confusion that our protagonist also has, but as the film moves forward both the audience and the protagonist start to get closer and closer to an ending, leaving both surprised. The director gives us a break with the \"main\" story, by giving us these black and white scenes that explores our protagonist's physical and psychological functioning but done in a way that still maintains it's relevance to the \"main\" story. The way Nolan handled the film's narrative was definitely ambitious, but was risky. Luckily, it payed off as he was able to hold my interest up until the credits rolled. So I commend both Nolan and his editor in creating this complex storytelling, and definitely deserving of the Oscar nod. The film has elements of noir as it has this hard-boiled feeling to it. It follows a protagonist who narrates the story and is seen as this isolated man trying to find the person that caused the death of his wife. It may not be as obvious as the other notable neo-noir films like Blade Runner, Se7en and Tarantino's first three films but if one pays high attention to the little details of this film then it would be more clearer. During this time, the film has already established itself as a classic and a favorite by many, but after seeing the bulk of his later films, I definitely see this as a much lesser films when in comparison to them.\n\nWally Pfister is a common collaborator with Nolan, and Memento is the start of this wonderful collaboration. Pfister has created this tight photography that maintains it's focus on the protagonist. Memento isn't a film that boasts beautiful photography and it's intentions are to capture the faces of the actors as the film mainly consists of conversations, allowing us to gain a bit of insight into some of the characters, particularly Lenny. So the film contains mainly of medium-close up shots as the actors drive the film forward and they are the catalyst of the film's narrative. The non-chronological scenes are shot in color and the linear scenes are shot in black and white. This was Nolan and Pfister's way of distinguishing between the two and avoid confusion from the audience but the black and white sequences were also a throwback to it's noir influences with these scenes mostly confined within the hotel room and using low key lighting to illuminate the scene. Pfister was also able to create that sense of subjectivity that was needed in order to have the audience follow the protagonist and develop a connection. There isn't a lot to praise about Pfister's work in Memento, but one can see him improving as he collaborates with Nolan.\n\nThe film's score was composed by David Julyan and he created this low-key, slightly dark orchestral score that doesn't really makes a presence. I only notice it on specific moments where the scenes \"try\" to make an impact on the audience, and it does prove effective but it would have been better if it showed a bit more ambition to it. It came off as a bit simplistic, and a little complexity would have matched it up with Nolan's ambition. Maybe I just didn't completely understand what he was trying to do with it. Juylan is also a common collaborator with Nolan, but that was halted after The Prestige, with Hans Zimmer taking over Nolan's future work.\n\nThe film has a small cast, this was because the film never strays away from our protagonist and it stays within this small setting. Guy Pearce as Leonard carries the film, giving a performance that feels authentic and accessible. Pearce completely understands the condition that he has, and he shows this knowledge through the small details in his performance, like the confusion in his facial expressions or the lack of confidence in his direction. He never gains a clear idea of what to do and where to go, with only following his \"instincts\". Though his performance was great, it isn't worthy of any major awards, mostly due to the lack of ambition in the role. This unique character is put in a situation that doesn't call for anything important. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie was pretty average. I wasn't wowed by her performance, it just felt a little too safe. Then again, the film has a minor focus on her and is reluctant to give her character any major back story. Though the same cannot be said for Joe Pantoliano as Teddy. He was great, really giving this character this personality that makes his intentions ambiguous. Even at the film's climax, one cannot be truly sure of what his purpose was. Stephen Tobolowsky and Harriet Sansom Harris played minor roles but they were great to watch. Both selling their dramas effectively, as I truly did feel sympathetic to the suffering that the couple experiences.\n\nMemento is a great film as it has the ambition and it gave the audience a rare experience but as years went by, this film feels less and less powerful when being compared to the excellent films that Nolan has put out in recent years. Nevertheless, the film still deserves a watch.",

This complexity of our protagonist would be something of a trademark in Nolan's future films allowing the audience to be invested in them, having us interested in coming back to his films, finding things that we didn't pick up during the previous viewing. As I have said, Nolan has a flair of creating a gripping climax and what he has created for this film, was gripping. The film's explanation at the end may come off as a bit forced but the content takes a huge turn that nobody expected coming. This is an ability that not many can do effectively, but Nolan does it like there wasn't any effort put in on it. Nolan doesn't provide us with any clear answer at the end, and it is truly up to us whether we buy the story that was being told or not. Nolan tackles a pretty daring concept, as to put this on film and making it subjective is not an easy task. He explores the difficulty of having this condition and how easy it is to be deceived by others because of it. Dialogue in this film is spot on, with lines constantly giving us more and more about the characters and allowing us to piece the puzzle ourselves. The film also uses narration from the perspective of the protagonist in order to gain that subjective experience that Nolan really wanted and I think without it, it would have made the film dull and prevented the audience from understanding Lenny's intentions.\n\nThe film was directed by Christopher Nolan, who is now a favorite by the mainstream public due to his ability to make entertaining films and bring a layer of complexity and originality to them. Memento's main strength isn't found in it's plot but rather on the way he shows it. Nolan has taken a simple story and combined it with the fractured storytelling that was found on notable films in the 90s. But then Nolan also inserted this layer of complexity by having with our main protagonist be equipped with a memory condition. The non-linear approach allows the audience to gain that feeling of confusion that our protagonist also has, but as the film moves forward both the audience and the protagonist start to get closer and closer to an ending, leaving both surprised. The director gives us a break with the \"main\" story, by giving us these black and white scenes that explores our protagonist's physical and psychological functioning but done in a way that still maintains it's relevance to the \"main\" story. The way Nolan handled the film's narrative was definitely ambitious, but was risky. Luckily, it payed off as he was able to hold my interest up until the credits rolled. So I commend both Nolan and his editor in creating this complex storytelling, and definitely deserving of the Oscar nod. The film has elements of noir as it has this hard-boiled feeling to it. It follows a protagonist who narrates the story and is seen as this isolated man trying to find the person that caused the death of his wife. It may not be as obvious as the other notable neo-noir films like Blade Runner, Se7en and Tarantino's first three films but if one pays high attention to the little details of this film then it would be more clearer. During this time, the film has already established itself as a classic and a favorite by many, but after seeing the bulk of his later films, I definitely see this as a much lesser films when in comparison to them.\n\nWally Pfister is a common collaborator with Nolan, and Memento is the start of this wonderful collaboration. Pfister has created this tight photography that maintains it's focus on the protagonist. Memento isn't a film that boasts beautiful photography and it's intentions are to capture the faces of the actors as the film mainly consists of conversations, allowing us to gain a bit of insight into some of the characters, particularly Lenny. So the film contains mainly of medium-close up shots as the actors drive the film forward and they are the catalyst of the film's narrative. The non-chronological scenes are shot in color and the linear scenes are shot in black and white. This was Nolan and Pfister's way of distinguishing between the two and avoid confusion from the audience but the black and white sequences were also a throwback to it's noir influences with these scenes mostly confined within the hotel room and using low key lighting to illuminate the scene. Pfister was also able to create that sense of subjectivity that was needed in order to have the audience follow the protagonist and develop a connection. There isn't a lot to praise about Pfister's work in Memento, but one can see him improving as he collaborates with Nolan.\n\nThe film's score was composed by David Julyan and he created this low-key, slightly dark orchestral score that doesn't really makes a presence. I only notice it on specific moments where the scenes \"try\" to make an impact on the audience, and it does prove effective but it would have been better if it showed a bit more ambition to it. It came off as a bit simplistic, and a little complexity would have matched it up with Nolan's ambition. Maybe I just didn't completely understand what he was trying to do with it. Juylan is also a common collaborator with Nolan, but that was halted after The Prestige, with Hans Zimmer taking over Nolan's future work.\n\nThe film has a small cast, this was because the film never strays away from our protagonist and it stays within this small setting. Guy Pearce as Leonard carries the film, giving a performance that feels authentic and accessible. Pearce completely understands the condition that he has, and he shows this knowledge through the small details in his performance, like the confusion in his facial expressions or the lack of confidence in his direction. He never gains a clear idea of what to do and where to go, with only following his \"instincts\". Though his performance was great, it isn't worthy of any major awards, mostly due to the lack of ambition in the role. This unique character is put in a situation that doesn't call for anything important. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie was pretty average. I wasn't wowed by her performance, it just felt a little too safe. Then again, the film has a minor focus on her and is reluctant to give her character any major back story. Though the same cannot be said for Joe Pantoliano as Teddy. He was great, really giving this character this personality that makes his intentions ambiguous. Even at the film's climax, one cannot be truly sure of what his purpose was. Stephen Tobolowsky and Harriet Sansom Harris played minor roles but they were great to watch. Both selling their dramas effectively, as I truly did feel sympathetic to the suffering that the couple experiences.\n\nMemento is a great film as it has the ambition and it gave the audience a rare experience but as years went by, this film feels less and less powerful when being compared to the excellent films that Nolan has put out in recent years. Nevertheless, the film still deserves a watch.",

            "content": "\"SOME MEMORIES ARE BEST FORGOTTEN\"  \n\n- 'Memento' is a 2000 psychological mystery thriller directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy). This movie is divided into two segments: a black-and-white part that is shown in chronological order and a color part that is reversed. This way of telling a story is a bit confusing at first, so as a viewer you need to pay close attention because every part is a piece of the puzzle. In the very end everything falls into place. I like the complicity of the film that has memory and revenge as its foundation. The usage of Polaroid pictures and tattoo's to help the main character remember his quest is brilliant. In the cast we see Guy Pearce (Prometheus), Carrie-Ann Moss (The Matrix Trilogy), Joe Pantoliano (The Goonies) and Mark Boone Junior (Sons of Anarchy).  \n\nLeonard Shelby (Pearce) has a rare form of amnesia and is unable to store recent memories. He wakes up in a motel room. On his body he has tattoo's that indicate that his wife was raped and murdered, and that he has to find and kill the culprit. He also has some Polaroid pictures with notes on to help him remember the people around him: there's Natalie (Moss) who helps him and also lost someone dear to her and there's Teddy (Pantoliano), a guy he shouldn't trust and his number one suspect. Bit by bit the puzzle comes together...",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan did very well with his short film Doodlebug, and did even better with The Following, but Memento marks his true breakthrough and also marks his edgy skill in films about narrative and complexity, and with mind. At this point, more than decade later, it's no surprise the film's fractured narrative, which goes both backwards and straight, resulting in a story that resolves on the very middle of it all, but for us, it's the very end after a long journey. It also features some actual actors and actresses, like Guy Pierce (whom in years later would piss me off in Iron Man 3) and Carrie-Anne Moss (who actual shows emotions here unlike her Trinity character in The Matrix trilogy).\r\n\r\nAs it can be expected with a Nolan film (back there being a surprise), the film is mind-blowing, brilliant, constantly thrilling, self-fulfilling, smart, entertaining and dark, not because it's a mad world, but because it feels realistic. Dark is not how much you tone down the colors, is in how smart it is, and thus, how realistic it is. As for what I heard, the film is mostly accurate in showing the experience of having anterograde amnesia, which forms part of the film's fractured narrative. The story is told in a very challenging way, in which you need to take these fragments and put them together by yourself while watching a new part of the story that chronologically already happened, but you didn't know. It's hard, but that makes it great. It's genius. Sure it's not the first film that does this, but it is one done with effort and skill.\r\n\r\nThe sole fact of the fractured narrative gives this movie a twist on how you normally watch a film. It goes away from the three act structure and goes for having the first act as the finale. On the way, seeing all that happens (and that the characters forgets, unfortunately for him) gives a certain complexity, very Nolan-ish. Even the poster itself has the Droste effect, which consist of a picture appearing within itself. Perfect depiction of the movie. Memento is widely regarded as one of the best films in the 2000-2010 decade, and I can see why. People still talk about this film, and surely will do for many other years.

Would Memento be as effective if told forward instead of backward? Of course not. The brilliance of Memento is not in its story but in how it tells the story. When a scene begins, we are as disoriented as Leonard; sometimes he ends up talking to someone we haven't seen before, and he doesn't ever remember meeting, yet they act as if they've known him for a while. The scene then ends -- please try to stay with me here -- with the beginning of the previous scene. This is nowhere near as frustrating for the viewer as it sounds; instead, it's transfixing and does an ingenious job of putting us inside Leonard's fractured perception. Sometimes you get so involved in a scene that you forget you've already seen how it's going to end. Writer-director Christopher Nolan, whose first film was a black-and-white noir (1998's Following) little seen in America, turns up the volume of the usual noir paranoia to 11: not only can't you trust anyone, you can't remember why you can't trust anyone. Yet the film is cool, contemplative, a puzzle movie in which you see the finished puzzle right up front and then watch as it disassembles itself. I could tell you who the killer of Leonard's wife is, or seems to be, since the movie opens with Leonard getting his revenge, or seeming to; yet treachery complicates Leonard's mission (as if it weren't complicated enough), so when we hear a revelation at the end of the film (the movie's chronological beginning) -- a revelation that Leonard, at the movie's beginning/story's end, has long forgotten -- we don't know if it's on the level or not. All I'll say is that it's been a while since I've seen a twist ending like this that works on about 17 different levels aside from turning the plot on its head. The newly blonde, slightly stubbly Guy Pearce, looking like a more precisely chiselled Brad Pitt, underplays Leonard throughout; he's a hero in a daze, often unconsciously funny, as when he tells the same story over and over, to the bemusement of acquaintances who've heard it over and over. Given the challenge of embodying a man who forgets whatever happened ten minutes ago, Pearce has to begin anew in every scene, a blank slate with vague impressions of quiet anguish. His best moment here comes when Leonard hires a prostitute for an experiment baffling to her but, to us, funny at first and then undeniably saddening. The only other two major roles in Memento are filled by Carrie-Anne Moss, as a mysterious bartender named Natalie, and Joe Pantoliano, as a mysterious figure (criminal? cop?) named Teddy. The Matrix connection is probably no coincidence: Leonard is living in a sort of matrix himself, a shadow world in which everything is a shadow. Not long after it opened, Memento had risen to #44 on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 Movies list, voted on by registered users, making it the youngest film in the top 50. There's a reason for that. The movie will almost surely madden some and fascinate others (some may feel both ways); if given a proper push, this could become the most talked-about cinematic Rubik's Cube since The Usual Suspects.

He has sworn revenge and obsessively searches anonymous motels and abandoned warehouses around Los Angeles in search of the killer. Shelby believes he has solved the murder at the beginning of the film and kills his suspect because he doesn't \"believe his lies.\" We spend the next 110 minutes mostly going backwards to see how our narrator has solved the mystery and to see if he got the right man. (Though it may sound difficult to believe, I assure you that I haven't given away too much here)\nThere are actually some black and white snippets that objectively carry the plot forward if you watch specifically for them. There are other mysteries to resolve along the way, like who is the battered guy in the closet with the duct tape over his mouth?\nMemento weaves a mesmerizing puzzle that comes across like a hybrid of Tarrantino's Pulp fiction. We discover the missing pieces along with our unreliable narrator since he can only recall recent events by taking Polaroid photos, labeling them, and by tattooing key messages on his body. Like unfolding news events broadcast by clueless reporters, how accurate can those cryptic messages and pictures be?\nTraveling backwards in time with Shelby, we become privy to his disoriented existence, only most of us have functional short-term memories. Indeed, during one sequence Shelby has to sort out whether he is chasing a gunman or is being chased by him. While the scene gives a chuckle, it also helps us realize Shelby's vulnerable condition. Each waking moment requires going through his photos and examining his tattoos anew, as he attempts to piece together where he is and what his latest task is.\nIf this sounds confusing, just check out the film. It makes a lot more sense visually than anything I could describe verbally. Similarly, detailed people are sure to find a plot hole somewhere due to the complexities of crossing time and sequence, but that's irrelevant. It can make for some interesting discussion afterwards, and I've found that people who have seen the film will often disagree over some plot ambiguities associated with the unfolding revelations near the end.\nMemento works, and actually invites re-watching.",

That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent. Every scene is positively dripping with mystery and suspense, and I can't remember the last time I was so riveted to the screen. This is probably Nolan's best film to date, and I strongly suggest you seek it out.",

Unlike most of the repetitive dribble churning out of Hollywood these days, Memento defies traditional concepts of film making. The entire movie, shown in reverse order, is essentially a giant middle finger to all other so-called psychological dramas and surprise endings. From it's confusing start to it's surprising ending, you will be left with hundreds of questions and the desire to watch again and again. The film launches us into the world of Leonard Shelby, an amnesiac looking to bring justice to his wife's murderers. Throughout the movie, we learn about the tragic circumstances behind his ailment and the daily struggles of an individual who's unable to form new memories. Mr. Nolan does a fantastic job, offering a smorgasbord of emotions in this thriller. Action packed without being overindulgent, humorous without being corny, and depressing without drowning viewers in melancholy, Memento hits all the right notes. Endlessly entertaining and endlessly debatable, Memento is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is the best film in Chris Nolan's incredible filmography. If you haven't seen it, WATCH IT. If you already have, WATCH IT AGAIN!",

I really cannot think of a single bad thing about the movie the script, the acting, the direction are all expertly done. What I love about this movie is that you never get a straight answer on the motivations of the characters are they helping the protagonist or are they taking advantage of him by making him do to their dirty work.

I thought this was a fantastic movie, because the story was unique, however the story alone was not spectacular enough to warrant the fifth star. I added the fifth star because of the way this story was told. There are many movies out there that use the flashback sequence to tell their story. You have movies like \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) which starts with a scene and then spends half the movie leading up to the opening scene. This movie starts with the end. We learn about Leonard who has short term memory loss. He knows who he is, it's not amnesia--he just cannot create any new memories. We learn that Leonard is plotting revenge against the man responsible for putting him in this condition. The story is then told in layers, however the layers are interrupted at times with scenes shown in black and white. . It's as though you were to take a DVD, and begin by watching track 20. When you're done with 20, you go back and watch track 19 until you hit 20; then go back and watch track 18 and so forth. Every once in awhile you stop to watch a DVD extra shot in black and white. As you watch each scene the questions to the scene you just saw get answered, all the way up to the end where you get hit with the surprise ending, but it all still makes sense. Grab a cup of coffee before you watch this one--it's going to take some concentration to follow.",

As\u00ed funciona 'Memento', con una estructura no lineal que hace que podamos identificarnos con el protagonista, pues no s\u00f3lo es un efectivo thriller, sino tambi\u00e9n un ejercicio de atenci\u00f3n que tomando como base una simulaci\u00f3n de p\u00e9rdida de memoria funciona. No es el trabajo de mayor nivel audiovisual del director (menci\u00f3nese que es uno de sus primeros trabajos), pero su bien cuidada narraci\u00f3n y sus logradas actuaciones son dignas de un buen trabajo. No puedo negar, sin embargo, que el desenlace pueda llegar a ser enga\u00f1oso. A\u00fan as\u00ed, el filme no pierde su capacidad de fascinaci\u00f3n y hace de Nolan una entonces promesa (ahora uno de los mejores realizadores) de buen cine contempor\u00e1neo.

            "content": "Nolan didn't impress me much with his movies. Insomia, Inception and the rest of Batman Trilogy were disappointments.\n\nWell...that was yesterday. I kept saying to myself, Batman Begins and The Prestige are not enough. I need one more good noir movie from Nolan. Man of Steel didn't count coz he's just a producer and it had a good writer.\n\nBut guess what, after watching Memento, man I gotta tell ya, he's right next to Tarantino in my list. I'm now officially a Nolan Fan!\n\nPerhaps Memento could be the Pulp Fiction of the decade. Non-linear storytelling as the breading filled with psychological twists, really do make a supreme film sandwich. Tarantino and Nolan are right on the money with that gig. Putting science into art is really remarkable. I gotta write that down.\n\nThere are several things that makes Memento so unique. First it's played backwards with another storyline playing over the backwards scene. It's quite confusing but as Nolan put it, This helps the audiences know the condition of Lenny. Having an emotional effect like that to connect the character to your audience is amazing. \n\nSecond, for handicap characters it's always been a tragedy or drama, yet Nolan was smart enough to make it into a noir film. Full of lies and deceit. Everyone's a suspect even Lenny himself. You don't see that everyday.\n\nThird is the plot that he lies to himself in the end, is amusing. But it goes deeper than that. Again it connects again to us, the audiences. We do lie to ourselves to make things better. And along the movie, we ourselves more and more in Lenny's character. He speaks of undeniable truths about lies and memories. Whether tragedy or great happiness, sometimes we just don't appreciate it. The irony of this is Lenny literally don't remember anything because of this condition.\n\nAnd last but not the least, what makes memento a classic is it leaves audiences with questions about the story that were never answered. Even if you watch it several times, there's some bits of ambiguity to some scenes. Too much subtlety can confuse the audience but in this movie, the amount is just right. And that in effect creates a wanting for the movie. It leaves a dry taste in your mouth.",

            "content": "The key strength in Memento, the thing that makes it superior to many other psychological thrillers is the iconic story structure which makes it a compelling and unforgettable thriller.\n\nChristopher Nolan displays some if his finest work on Memento, because the story, adapted from his brother's own short story and featuring an excellently compelling, clever and insightful screenplay, probes to be a truly clever one which stirs the audience up and has them questioning so many things, and the theme of whodunit, laid out in the atmosphere to engage the audience into feeling a sense of Neo-Noir excellence proves astoundingly effective and highly entertaining for the viewers and so it exceeds whatever already great expectations the viewer has been set up with. \nThe story is told so excellently in an iconic fashion which sets the story into play with scenes acting in reverse order at no expense, and it's a fresh idea to behold. Memento is like no other film because of its plot, the way it's told and the excellent way that Christopher Nolan handles himself with his duties. Memento is a solid film with a look into an alternative form of filmmaking, a great one.\nBut the thing that is most satisfying is the fact that Memento is better than it could have been, but didn't try to be want better than it was so it never became too complicated and burdened with extraneous plotlines and pointless extra characters. It maintained an immaculate line between simple and complicated, a line harder to find than the Loch Ness monster. The achievement of that in Memento is incredible.\nAnd the entire screen is lit up by the charisma of Guy Pearce who lead the story excellently and controls himself as the film jumps from scene to scene, and his character cannot keep up with it as the audience can, and to see not how he develops as a character, but rather how he has developed as the story unravels, and witnessing it proves to be exhilarating and entertaining much in part thanks to Guy Pearce and his great performance. What's interesting is how his character develops alternatively to Joe Pantoliano.\nJoe Pantoliano also gives a great performance and he is never one audience can be sure about in their predictions of which influences the whodunit atmosphere very finely, and his performance is a charming one, rich with fine line delivery and a generally friendly charm which keeps Memento from ever sinking into complete and utter darkness.\nCarrie-Anne Moss was also great, because I've never seen her in anything outside of The Matrix, and in Memento her character is sinfully manipulative without losing any sophistication or character charm along the way, and there is never a certainty as to who her character is, and that supplies a valid mysterious sense to the atmosphere and proves entertaining.\n\nSo Memento is a stylish and provocative Neo-Noir Psychological Thriller which makes use of some of Christopher Nolan's finest work as a director and as a screenwriter which scores him a well deserved Academy Award nomination.",

Oh do you want to know what the twist is? It turns out that he had already killed the real John G. a year ago which he forgot. At the end of the movie, he kills another man accusing him of John G. as well and the film ends with Leonard killing a third John G. played by Joe Pantoliano as his real name is John Edward Gammell, he goes off forgetting everything and is on the hunt to kill a fourth John G..

The good news is, the film doesn't jump around at random; you get an idea of how it's moving temporally about halfway through the movie. As a result, rather than the climax building towards the end of the investigation, the climax occurs in the 'middle' of the movie.\n\nThe intriguing concept is held together with some good acting. Pearce plays our protagonist well, showing his memory issues as well as his somewhat impassive face. Carrie-Ann2 Moss gives her best performance I've ever seen here, showing a wide range of emotion. I also enjoyed Joe Pantoliano, whose acting I am growing to respect quite a bit.\n\nThis is not a film for casual viewing. As with many Nolan films, it requires concentration and a brain that is very much turned on. If you enjoy that sort of thing, definitely give Memento a watch.

            "content": "The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, it took me a bit of time to fully grasp its nonlinear storytelling by trying to figure out when each event occurred to be able to know the occurrence of events chronologically. Now having watched Memento, I have come to realize that despite Pulp Fiction's unique narrative, Tarantino made a story that is still easy to grasp.\n\nAt first I didn't get the memo that Memento presents its story in reverse chronological order, and having figured that out in a few scenes in, it felt like I was falling behind in a race, struggling to catch up. And not only that, but the flashbacks scenes are shown in regular chronological order to make the pace even more insanely hectic for me. I think it is safe to say that everyone can benefit from watching this movie more than once to piece everything together, if one loses track the first time watching it. My first viewing, to say the least, was mindboggling, but thanks to subtitles and having a bit of patience with my second viewing, I managed to tie up a lot of loose ends that were beginning to drive me crazy.\n\nAnd that's one of the things that makes Nolan such a talented director. When you watch Memento, you have to literally change the way you watch movies to grasp it. It is not a stylistic choice just for the sake of being innovative. Nolan utilizes this reverse storytelling technique to execute the drama in a very unique way, having the same effect as putting a puzzle together to know what the full picture looks like. As we go back into the past, that is when we discover the answer to the mysteries of what is really going on underneath it all, as opposed to a conventional movie where we get the bigger picture of the situation as the story progresses in regular chronological order, followed by a conclusion. Whereas the ending of Pulp Fiction occurs during the middle of all the chaos, we get our true conclusion to Memento at the beginning where everything started. Whereas we know the destiny of every character with Pulp Fiction, there is a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen next for the protagonist.\n\nWhat I love about Memento is that it perfectly encapsulates the strange feeling of deja vu. While the protagonist is unaware of everything that happens to him, we the viewer begin to see the full picture in the last scene in the movie and we come to a shocking revelation of the events we just witnessed. I don't want to elaborate more and run the risk of potentially spoiling anything, but all I can say is that this is one of the most innovative mystery thrillers concocted by Nolan, and the subtle film noir influences gives it an extra charm. Watching this movie, you wouldn't predict he would he even direct the batman movies and that shows not only Nolan's diversity but also his versatility as a director.",

Each scene seems to unveil another surprise helping you solve the crime of Leonard's wife and also helps you figure out who Leonard really is. The movie plays back so many times that you forget that this is all happening in the span of one day. \nThis movie impressed me from the first day I saw it. It is one of those mind-benders that real you in every time. You can watch it from many different perspectives: The man who is determined to avenge his wife no matter the cost, a heartbroken man missing his wife, trying to remind himself to forget her, the man who is being taken advantage of by everyone he encounters, the badass who killed a known drug dealer and is riding around in his clothes and his car with tons of money in the trunk. When you watch the movie from that angle then you start to pay attention to the other characters and what they may or may not know. Another perspective is watching Leonard as an assassin. This was the feeling I got from the last time I saw it. He is being used to kill people and score money and drugs. \nThis film made me a long time fan of Guy Pierce and justified Nolan as one of the top Directors in Hollywood. \n\n5/5",

Every time Leonard gets information about this man, he tattoos it in any section his body.   \nEvery now and then, an ambitious movie with an impressive and memorable twist ending arrives like \"The Usual Suspects\", \"Fight Club\" and \"The Sixth Sense\", but Memento managed to become the first of these films from the new millennium. Nolan\u00b4s breakthrough counts with phenomenal performances, a little dose of actually funny jokes, memorable visuals, well written and deep characters, gorgeous cinematography, topnotch directing focused on the little details that enhance the experience, expertly executed themes and a well written and clever story filled with ambiguity in order to let the audience decide its ending. But \"Memento\" greatest element, and the one that makes the entire film, is the way Nolan tells his brother\u00b4s story which is both chronological and backwards; it's so creative and effective in making you feel like you are suffering Leonard's condition. Since the first five minutes, \"Memento\" hooks you; it makes you pay attention to every single detail on screen and keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out the reasons and consequences of Leonard's actions. On top of all that, \"Memento\" counts with a phenomenal and unpredictable but logical ending which is left to interpretation (like most of Nolan\u00b4s films).\nNolan\u00b4s breakthrough is undeniably a new classic and one of the best thrillers I\u00b4ve ever seen, thanks to its clever storytelling technique, well written story and jaw dropping direction. Arguably Nolan\u00b4s best film, \"Memento\" is a must see for any cinema lover and requires multiple viewings in order to fully appreciate its beauty.",

Writer/director Christopher Nolan?s yarn noir tells the tale of a man with no short-term memory, searching for the man who killed his wife. It?s an intriguing premise made all the more engrossing by the unusual mode of presentation: The story is told backwards, with each scene only as long as the protagonist can hold in his head before he forgets all that came before it. Confused? Don?t worry, it?ll all make sense when you see it.

Simple as that. You do not need to know more.\nThe film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put on the skin of Leonard Shelby, wonderfully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives a performance equally mysterious and complex.\nThis movie is well done all the way around - the direction, the editing, and especially that the original story is superb, everything is different from what we have seen.

Now that I have seen it again, I feel that I didn't understand it at all the first time.\n    \n                  I always had this intuition that I would like Memento even before I saw it. That was because many people told me that this is a great film ( I did not watch it because it was critically acclaimed), and above all I had one strong reason for my intuition, this is a Nolan film. So I definitely wanted to try this on. But the problem was that along with my intuition I also developed an over-expectation. I expected a film that I could give a 100% rating. That is where things didn't work as planned for me.  \n                                           I liked Memento because of Nolan's innovative narrative style, some amount of complexity ( I expected more of that from a Nolan film), sharp acting from Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss. I also liked Stephen Toblowsky and Joe Pantoliano in this. I felt that this film didn't have that much suspense. Nolan shouldn't have shown us the real c;li9max at first( wait, Who am I to criticize Nolan?).  Joe(Teddy) is an ctor that I have liked very much on Bad Boys(1995), there he did comedy, now he is the villain here. As for the suspense part, even my favourite Nolan film Inception didn't have much of it, only Nolan's Prestige(2006) had it. Then again I liked films such as Inception for it's complexity and even if Nolan told you what they would do in the climax (of Inception), he didn't show it, that is where I find Memento troubling.\n           \n                            The way in which Teddy cheats the police and all in drawing a conclusion that John G. or the second man did not exist and it is the just the imagination of a mentally ill Leonard is actually a rip off from another one of Nolan's films, Following( 1998). Following is currently the only Nolan film that I did not like. How ever Memento is a great film. But how can a person with short term memory loss drive a car so frequently?",

            "content": "Everyone generally has a morning routine; wake up, shower, get dressed, and go to work or class. Imagine this regular happening being disrupted by seeing yourself in the mirror 20 years older than you remember. It would freak most people out. This can be exactly what happens to people who suffer from anterograde amnesia-damage to parts of the brain related to memory. This disorder can cause people to lose the capability of forming new memories; most whom have anterograde amnesia don't know it. In Memento, directed by Christopher Nolan, Leonard contracts anterograde amnesia from a tragic accident. The film has phenomenal acting; it has a format similar to a Tarantino movie, but creates a plot with a main character whose originality has never been seen before. If you can follow the movie's disorienting plot, it is a worthwhile to see. However, if you lack an attention span, stay away.\nLeonard is characterized by three things: he speaks on the phone with an anonymous stranger, his old memories, and his new \"system\" for living with anterograde amnesia. It would be nearly impossible (if not impossible) to live without forming new memories. Leonard has a system of leaving notes for himself and he keeps pictures of people he meets. There are tattoos all over his body so he can remember why he is still carrying on: to kill the low-life drug dealer that raped and murdered his wife before injuring him, causing his anterograde amnesia. His last, and unfortunate, memory is seeing his wife murdered. Natalie is a woman whom Leonard helped with an issue of her own. Natalie is now helping him search for the one he's after, John Gammel. Leonard is constantly around this man; the problem is he thinks John's name is Teddy. Teddy is trying to \"help\" Leonard claiming he is a cop.\nIt appears Teddy manipulates Leonard, which would be pretty easy to do to someone who won't remember anything. This movie created a scientifically accurate character of someone who has anterograde amnesia. Leonard doesn't remember the same people over and over again, he is in a confused state pretty much all of the time, and he forgets simple things like what he was doing ten minutes ago. It's a hard role to play, but Guy Pearce smashes it. Natalie and Teddy (John G.) are both dynamic characters. Their roles change dramatically through the story. It is hard to follow, but the phenomenal acting aids in the ingenious plot.\nThe movie starts with the end and the beginning. It uses a double sequence to meet in the middle; one sequence is in black and white and the other is in color. The black and white sequence is chronological. The color scenes are not ordered forward in time; they start with the end scene and move backwards scene by scene. The technique almost shouts \"Quinton Tarantino!\" I kept thinking about the movie Reservoir Dogs (ironically Netflix recommended it after). Tarantino's twists on time create better clarity than Nolan's. The sequence wasn't very original, and it was rather confusing. I watched the movie twice; it didn't make complete sense the first time. The double sequence is confusing; you have to separate what happened in the past and the future in your head. Tarantino makes it blatantly obvious where scenes are in time when they're out of chronological order. It isn't always clear who's who when the characters talk about Teddy and John G. (when in actuality they are the same person). This is not a movie to lie down and veg out to. If you want to sit down and have your mind blown by a psychological thriller, then this is for you. Just make sure to have lots of caffeine and zero distractions or else you'll waste your time.\nIf you do watch the movie and give it your full attention, it will be worth your while. The acting is great and the plot is superb. It feels kind of like a pull off of a Tarantino flick, but that's no reason not to see it. The character Leonardo intrigues the viewer; he's a character that's never been seen before. Memento is confusing and hard to follow, but it truly is a work of art.",

Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano are great, but it is definitely the story - and the inimitable Mr. Nolan - who's the star of the show.

To carry out his plan, Shelby snaps Polaroids of people and places, jotting down contextual notes on the backs of photos to aid in his search and jog his memory. He even tattoos his own body in a desperate bid to remember.\n\nDirectors seem to have a tendency to use similar themes in their various works,  Spielberg is concerned with childhood innocence, Fincher's forte seems to be rooted in the neferious \"underground\", and Alexander Payne is simply interested in regular joe schmoes.  Christopher Nolan appears to have a very big interest in the mind.  Momento is the first of three Christopher Nolan flicks to dwelve into the human psyche, the others being Insomnia, and of course the recent blockbuster Inception.\n\nMomento is presented in two distinct sequences, both of which involve our hero.  One, consists of Pearce's character on the phone in a hotel room, this segment is filmed in black and white and appears to be unfolding in chronological order.  The other large chunk of the picture actually unravels in reverse chronological order. Mimicking our hero, this sequence of scenes captures Pearce's character's confusion and alienation of not knowing what has happened just a short time before, since the sequence unfolds in reverse, we have no possible clue as to what came before each scene.  This wonderful effect gives us a vacarious look into the actual condition of short-term memory loss, and how a person inflicted with such a condition perceives his life and the world around him.  Along with 2001's A beautiful Mind, Momento captures a psychological condition better than any other film i've yet seen, and may be the pictures most important contribution.\n\nOn the downside, the film's radical and unusual non-linear narrative may well be an attempt to just make the picture more interesting as much as to infiltrate another's mind.  Repeat viewings don't stand a chance of being even remotely as interesting because if you were to place the scenes in chronological order, the film's deceptiveness is stricken away and simplicity is all that remains.   I feel the picture could have benefitted from a warmer touch or perhaps a more philosophical script  to serve as an intellectual foil to the film's intelligent voyeuristic filmmaking.\n\nThough cold and deceptively simple, the film is incredibly unique and seemingly creates an incredibly accurate portrait of the mind of the sick.",

Pierce's character is such a creepy cypher that we generate absolutely no sympathy for him; Nolan's attempts at modern noir are misguided and moronic, to say the least.  Arguably one of the most pathetic attempts at originality with atrocious editing and ugly cinematography; only massive boredom is generated.  Some have said the second viewing is better than the first; the second viewing only made me want to destroy the DVD and throw it in the garbage can where it belongs.  Seriously, this movie pissed me off and every single 5-star review out there isn't enough for me to give it a chance a third time.  Since so many people seem to love this movie, I know I'm going to get ridiculous backlash: I've seen thousands movies and this one is one of the most unmemorable I've ever fucking seen.  Ever!

The movie is never slow and keeps its focus all the way through. Terrific performance by Guy Pierce too. His pulls off portraying a character who is driven by the murder of his wife yet he is always unaware of what to do next.

The screenplay is masterful as you are watching the movie from back to front; you get to feel like Leonard himself.\n\nMemento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who adapted it from his younger brother Jonathan Nolan's (Person of Interest creator, writer and executive producer) short story \"Memento Mori\".\n\nThe brothers started work on the film in 1996 when Jonathan pitched the story to Christopher on a road trip, the two then started to send story and script back and forth as Christopher developed his film from a short story about a man named Earl who is a patient of a mental institution.  Earl's wife like Leonard was killed by an anonymous man, and during the attack Earl lost his ability to create new long-term memories and convinces himself through written notes to himself to escape the mental institution and track down and kill his wife murder.\n\nThe movie starts at the end and runs till we get to see what led to the end. The movie is told in two different parallel series of scenes, one of which is in black and white and it is shown chronologically, and the other is in colored and shown in a reverse order sequence. The two stories meet at the end of the film, and it shows us what led to the beginning of the film.\n\nThe movie plot is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has anterograde amnesia, which makes it difficult for him to retain new explicit memories. To be able to keep tab on his life Leonard developed a system where he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid photos to be able to track where he is and who he knows and what he is doing or about to do.\n\nLeonard's problem started when he got hit in the head when he witnessed his wife being raped and murdered; now Leonard has only one goal in life to track down a certain John G who he believes killed his wife.\n\nRated as one of the best movies in the 2000s, Memento is featured in notable lists of top films. Memento was very successful at the box office making almost 10 times its production cost and placing Nolan's name in the lips of many production studios, inclusive of Warner Bros where Christopher Nolan made The Batman Trilogy and will be working with them for the making of the new Superman film named Man of Steel in 2013. \n\nMemento received numerous accolades and got two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. There is nothing better than for you to take the time to see this classic.\n\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
