            "content": "This movie was incredibly annoying. This might be the worst Steven Spielberg film I've ever watched (even though he's not even the director). All the characters act absolutely filthy and braindead (which is sad because these actors went on to do much better things in their lives). The script (yes, there is a script) is just so awful I'm starting to either wonder if the MPAA was dumb or if the script-writers just didn't even care what the age for this film is. In fact, the actual age is so confusing that when I look up Corey Feldman on this site, his bio lies to me about the films he starred in (the site claims that \"Gremlins\" and this film are \"kid-friendly\" even though when you watch them, you'll realize that they're actually not). Anyway, back to this. The story is cliche. The Goonies themselves are so annoying and are just constantly fighting over each other. They yell, swear, fight, and start literally doing not kid-friendly stuff (such as looking up people's skirts and making jokes about a statue's penis). The most annoying character of all, Chunk, gets kidnapped by the villains and literally just cries and whines his ass off for like five minutes in front of them. Literally right in front of them. While the villains threaten to chop his fingers off. What was Spielberg even thinking? You are such a legend and you think that will entertain the kids?! Then he feeds the deformed guy I can't even remember the name of Baby Ruth (wow.) Then the other brats find the ship, Chunk reunites with the kids, then the ship just sails off and eventually sinks. I just don't really care anymore. I know all of you guys like this film, but throughout the movie, I was hoping for all the kids to fall to their deaths or something like that. All I will say is, if you want a good Spielberg film, just watch Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, and all other stuff. This did not deserve my time at all. Even Gremlins is better compared to this. And the fact that my mom likes this film makes this whole thing worse. Just avoid this. Anyone who says this is good is an idiot.",

I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

A love interest was obvious at the ages of Brand & Andy, and is a sidebar comedy situation in itself. The way the entire story is neatly sewn together to allow the kids to reign supreme in the end, as well as a parallel of One-Eyed Willy's booby traps that are similar to Mikey's gate-opening design sequence multi-stage mechanisms, show how they both think on the same page on many levels.",

I practically grew up with this film.\n\n \nThe story is about a gang of criminals on the run while an innocent group of kids get caught up in an adventure. Four of them are a group of boys determined to save their house from being demolished. Another one is the older brother to the boy Mikey (who gets the idea of saving the house) and two girls, one called Andi who is in love with the older brother Brand and another girl tagging along with Andi. Eventually all the kids are caught in a wildcat adventure of getting money to save their house by finding some treasure while along the way they come across the bandits who want the treasure too. \n\nThe film is similar to an Indiana Jones film. It even has the same kid actor from Temple Of Doom. However it's more kid friendly but has the same structure of an Indiana Jones story. Lots of comedy and adventure and thrills. Most of the comedy stems from the fish out of water aspects of where the characters are. As stated, these kids have reasons why they have gone on this adventure. Mikey is the one who gets the idea of saving the house, while his friends, Mouth (the blabbermouth) Chunk (the big eater) and Data (the tech whiz) come along as their homes are in danger of being demolished too. As you can tell by the names, Mikey's friends are pretty eccentric yet have potential talents. Mouth, despite barely shutting up, uses his mouth to his advantage with his gift for Spanish. Chunk may be obsessed with food but he ends up saving his friends after coming in contact with one of the less mean criminals. And Data's inventions prove to be pretty useful along the adventure as silly as they can be.\n Holding this group together is Mikey. The most normal of the group and the guide for the audience. He's pretty much the most relatable low key member of  the group. He's fearless and the most determined out of all his friends despite being the least eccentric.\n Then there's Mikey's brother Brand. He doesn't mind too much about moving and comes along reluctantly as he's trying to protect his brother. It's only when Andi comes along that Brand decides to come along. In turn, Andi comes along because as long as she's with Brand, Andi doesn't mind going on the adventure. While she does overcome her naivety along the journey, learning about the dangers she has put herself in, its not all for the bad. Andi uses her piano skills to help during a perilous part of the adventure. Like Andi, Steff doesn't have any idea of the perils of the journey either but comes along as she shares close ties with Andi. However, unlike Andi, Steff is more cynical and sarcastic and not as na\u00efve as Andi\n\nThe Goonies is a great adventure flick. Even as an adult I still like it. I would recommend it to a friend who would likes fun adventure films.",

It's the movie I compare other 80s movies to when I want to judge just how much of an 80s vibe the other movie gives off. I will say that rewatching it as an adult took some of the magic away as some of the booby traps they navigate through felt redundant and some of the banter didn't really land, but as a result Chunk was even greater comedic relief to me this time than he had been before. The romance subplots felt a little tacked on too, but otherwise the villains were excellent and the child actors acquitted themselves well. The production design was solid, though I have an issue where I noticed that 1982's Poltergeist and 1993's Jurassic Park had practically the exact same prop tree in it and realized that Spielberg has an ultra-distinct style of prop/background design that has made other movies he's involved in look less realistic to me. The score really follows the action well and crescendos at all the appropriate moments. I'll surely rewatch this again in a few years.",

The final fight with the bad guys on the pirate ship is overlong and repetitive. The Goonies is a fun adventure for boys of a certain age (<12), but wouldn't appeal to many adults who don't feel some childhood connection to it.",

            "content": "This one gives me the warmest sense of nostalgia. It's the ultimate '80s kid adventure, as a crew of young pals seek lost pirate treasure beneath their sleepy coastal Oregon suburb. When compared to the stiffer, more highly-orchestrated kids' movies of today, The Goonies is refreshingly grounded. The stakes may be relatively small, but they feel insurmountable from a pre-teen's perspective, and that's what really counts. Led by a sharp-tongued Corey Feldman, the young actors do a great job of conveying that blend of quick wit and fading innocence. They might occasionally trip over words and step on lines, but that makes the production feel more alive, more real. Because, let's be honest, in a room full of actual grade-schoolers, there aren't a whole lot of quiet moments.\n\nThe opening act, in particular, is a masterpiece of off-the-cuff jokes and effective scene-setting, as we get to know the gang and prepare the stage for their bicycle-powered expedition. Later chapters can get a bit cute, and pacing is sometimes a problem, but those shortcomings are generally smoothed out by the film's convincing practical effects, sweet character and overwhelming sense of childhood discovery. A veritable time capsule of the personalities, and production styles, of the period. And now I've got Cyndi Lauper running through my head again.",

Sloth is meant to be funny, but just comes across as making fun of the mentally handicapped, and the pirate captain's name is a dick joke but always said without a hint of humor. We never even find out anything about the Goonies: what \u2018Goonies' means, which characters are Goonies, or why it seems to matter so much to them. The adventure parts are decently executed for the most part, but the rest of the movie is just mildly irritating.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like The Sandlot (1993) by way of Hudson Hawk.\n\nSetting: Kids On Bikes\nPlot: Adventure\nTone: Action Drama / Screwball Comedy",

I didn't go in with the highest of hopes despite it's classic status but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a sweet adventure about misfits, morals, honesty and childhood whimsy. Albeit a little cringey and saccharine at times you can't help but get swept away by the sense of fun it exudes and the genuine want for them to all succeed and save their town from the typically corrupt evil businessman guy.  Having recently seen and loved Jordan Peele's \"Us\" I remembered during the film that The Goonies was a bit of inspiration for \"Us\" so a few lines gave me that satisfied feeling a movie fan gets when they link two completely different films together. It certainly has a sense of Spielbergian magic and it's a joy to watch all of the heart felt child performances and they're clearly all having a blast doing it. A fun adventure film with simple story morals but big heart.",

The film stars Sean Astin as Mikey and Josh Brolin as Brand.\n\nThe acting for the most part was very strong especially for a mostly kid cast. Personally I don't very much like most children actors luckily for the Goonies the kids really feel like kids.\n\nThe film also has some of the best and most memorable characters in cinema history. The villains were also portrayed really well and were fun and enjoyable to watch on screen.\n\nThe characters from the Goonies to the Fratelli's all had really good chemistry with each other especially with the two Fratelli brothers Jake and Francis.\n\nThe cinematography was steady with some very good shots of the scenery and the characters.\n\nThe set design in my opinion is really strong all the way down to the smallest detail.\n\nThe props were good for the most part, but some times you could tell that they were fake.\n\nThe costume and makeup design fits the characters very well especially Sloth.\n\nThe film also has a very sound style from the colour scheme to the characters.\n\nThe practical effects are done very well especially for the time and budget of only $19,000,000.\n\nThe film also has some good special effects especially for the time even though you can kind of tell their fake.\n\nThe film also has a really great score and a really strong soundtrack. The soundtrack is also memorable and something that I could whistle off the top of my head.\n\nThe story follows a bunch of kids The Goonies who are trying to find a way to stay in their town after their parents are being forced out of their houses because of money problems. The Goonies then find a map that leads them to a restaurant in which a group of criminals are hanging out. The search is on to find one eyed Willies treasure. \n\nThe comedy is really strong and had me laughing out loud throughout the runtime of the film. One of the funniest scenes involves the Fratelli's trying to make Chunk talk.\n\nThe atmosphere in the film is also very good at points especially toward the end with one eyed Willie and his treasure.\n\nThe film did have a couple things wrong, but for the most part it doesn't really take away.\n\nThe film is also really enjoyable and over all a feel good film.\n\nOver all I give it a 8/10 - one of the classics",

The ultra fast pace will hold your attention, the jokes will still make you genuinely laugh, and the adventure will still thrill you. I can easily imagine parents sitting down passing their love of The Goonies to a new generation with their kids. The Goonies remains a sweet coming of age story that brings you on a fantastic adventure  on screen. You feel like you are one of their friends. It is absolutely charming.\n\nDirector Richard Donner, of The Omen and Superman fame, crafts the childhood of kids everywhere with his delightful film The Goonies. The wondrous close up shots and inspired panning shots still look gorgeous. The entire attic scene is so well filmed it looks like it could have been directed by Steven Spielberg who came up with the story for The Goonies. \n\nDonner adapts Spielberg's vision with stunning results. From the fun sequences of the kids hanging around the house or discovering a pirate ship, every scene is a blast. Donner directed The Goonies so well, it has solidified its status as a cinema classic! Richard Donner deserves to be remembered fondly for all the first-rate films he directed.\n\nChris Columbus's script is a real treat as the cast of children and teenagers actually talk like how real kids speak. They swear, goof around, taunt, and come up with endless one liners. The story itself is such a pleasant mystery that is elevated by the verisimilitude of the language. Columbus's screenplay is truly one of Hollywood's best ever with his clever wit and neat characterization.\n\nThe Goonies boasts a powerful score from Dave Grusin who captures the magic of childhood and the exhilarating feeling of going on an adventure with your friends. The music is iconic as The Goonies' iconography, writing, and cinematography. Grusin composed a lovely score that still sounds beautiful to me.\n\nLastly, but certainly not least, The Goonies has a splendid cast of child actors that carry the movie to new heights. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Ke Huy Quan, Kerri Green, and Martha Plimpton were excellent child actors. You believe them the entire time. They each represent a type and they play their part perfectly. Anyone watching The Goonies today can still relate to these kids. The Goonies has an enchanting ensemble here.\n\nIn short, buy The Goonies. You will want to watch and revisit this movie often. For adults and children of all ages. I cannot recommend The Goonies enough!",

            "content": "When I was growing up, my grandpa used to record movies for us off the T.V. Yeah, it was very much illegal, but that's how I learned about some great movies from the 80s and 90s.\n\nI can specifically remember turning the dial on an old-school tube T.V. to watch \"The Goonies\" one weekend. Now that there's a bunch of movies on Blu-Ray, I think it's kinda of taken away some of the experience of watching a film on a crappy T.V., but that's just my opinion.\n\n\"The Goonies\" was written by Steven Speilberg and Christoper Columbus, those names should be familiar to you. It was also directed by Richard Donner, primarily known for directing the \"Lethal Weapon\" films. \n\nFor those who are completely new to \"The Goonies.\" The plot follows a group of adolescent kids, known as The Goonies. They all reside in Astoria, Oregon and soon their entire neighbor is going to be demolished to make way for newer houses. \n\nMikey (Sean Astin), Brand (Josh Brolin) Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Jonathon Ke Quan) stumble upon a map that may lead to buried treasure, and they decide to go after it.\n\nWhat they don't realize is that a band of criminals, the Fratellis (Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantolliano, and Robert Davi) are hiding out in the exact spot that the map points them to!\n\nMikey and the rest of the Goonies, along with Andy and Stef (Keri Green and Martha Plimpton) must follow the map through caves full of deadly booby traps, and not mention the Fratellis who are right on their tails.\n\nCan The Goonies find the buried treasure--and as a result pay off the foreclosure on their homes? Will the Fratellis catch up with them, and put a permanent end to their adventure? You'll have to find out!\n\nSo let's review \"The Goonies\"\n\nIt's not difficult to see the appeal of this film, and it's even better to watch it as an adult.\n\n\"The Goonies\" is an adventure film at its core, but it infuses elements of other genres to compliment the main storyline.\n\nEach character and the way they interact with each other make them feel relatable and familiar. Christopher Columbus' script is superb, and it really keeps the audience's attention.\n\nThe biggest element, in my opinion, is the comedy. By often using adult oriented jokes, the film makes a connection to the older crowd while allowing the audience to feel close to the main characters.\n\nSecondly, \"The Goonies\" has an element of suspense and danger to it. The Fraterllis are armed and dangerous, and willing to go to extremes to get rid of anyone on their trail.\n\nLastly, there are scary scenes thrown in, and that also crosses another barrier into the horror genre of film. Thus, bringing in an even larger audience.\n\nThe scary scenes include: Andy and Stef running into the fish on a stick--which is both funny and scary, I like it! Meeting Sloth (John Matuszak) at the gross restaurant, finding Chester Copperpot in the tunnel, and escaping the octopus--which was cut from the theatrical version.\n\n\"The Goonies\" features a fantastic cast, and great performances all around. There's plenty of adventure and action, and the humor is priceless! \n\nIf you haven't seen this movie yet--do yourself a favor--and SEE IT!",

Plenty of emotional moments, an often over-egged score, everything working out fine in the end and the power of dreams triumphing over everything. The dialogue is largely inaudible throughout, as it's either spoken while music is playing or because all of the children have an irritating habit of speaking at the same time, usually in loud, frantic voices. It has plenty of flaws, but it isn't ever trying to be a masterpiece. It simply aims to tell a story about the frustrations of childhood, and the fantasies that kids involve themselves in to make their lives more magical. This is an area Spielberg is clearly enamoured with and it resonates strongly as a result. It's not an entirely easy-going movie, as it has it's fair share of frustrations, but the parts that work are enough to elevate it. It's a perennial classic, and while I couldn't watch it frequently, I'm glad I got to see it at least once.",

Donner does a decent job directing the film, but it's really Spielberg who dictates the action and story here.  The story is impossibly hokey and lacks credibility, but if you can suspend disbelief for a couple hours, the characters are fun, the kids are energetic, the sets are exciting and very much like a less serious Raiders.  Spielberg must really love coming up with booby traps and elaborate obstacles and sets.  The bad guys are bumbling and not really very threatening as much as comical (like bad guys in John Hughes' movies like Home Alone).  Sean Astin and a young Josh Brolin are fine, and Anne Ramsey as the evil matriarch is memorable.  Overall, it's a fun comic book/theme park thrill ride which was probably alot of fun to make, and it shows in the result.  It's silly, it's a kids' movie, but who doesn't remember The Goonies from their past?  It's a part of pop culture, and that speaks volumes about what this movie meant and still means to people.  It's fun and a nice escape and excuse to eat popcorn in front of your TV.",

            "content": "As someone who did not grow up watching Goonies I have the unique position of being a child of the eighties with zero nostalgia for this movie. And let me tell you, watching it for the first time as an adult is an ideal situation to realize it is a horrible film. I don't even know where to start with this movie. Many defenders of Goonies will say that this is one of the more accurate representations of what children are like, if that's the case I'm glad I don't have any! Every single kid in this thing is extraordinarily annoying. They all either whine, mumble, or screech their dialogue in such a fashion that I want to tell them to just shut up. But it's not just the sound of their voices that annoys, these kids are horrible to each other. They mock their friends, call each other names, and only seem to care about other people when death is on the line.\n\nNow if I'm really going to accurately criticize this film, I've got to delve into the plot. This is one of the worst contrivances of plot I can imagine. So a pirate steals a ton of gold and then harbors his ship in a cavern somewhere in Oregon. Already stupid, but we'll move on. Then he sets up a number of complex death traps in the caves which lead to his ship's cavern. Then he sends out a map into the world with directions to the cavern along with a couple clues written in Spanish (which translate into perfect rhyming English) on how to reach the cavern. Then he returns to his ship to die counting his money, but not before setting more traps on his ship. Fast forward hundreds of years and somehow this map ends up in the attic of a crazy family, and is found by a group of kids who are about to lose their homes because some corporation is foreclosing on their parents. So these kids (who appear to not even know the word \"treasure\") decide to seek out the ship in hopes that the \"rich stuff\" will help their parents magically be able to avoid moving, and all this mere days before they were set to leave. And the crazy part is, despite being pursued by a family of bumbling criminals, this stupid plot actually works.\n\nI do have the ability to suspend my disbelief, but this movie pushes it to the utter limits. Perhaps if the setting and tone of some of the scenes wasn't so shockingly serious I'd give the movie a pass as silly kids' movie nonsense. But there's some dark stuff in here, including some traps that could have come from The Temple of Doom, and the kids are cursing up a storm so it's not exactly wholesome for the whole family either (that's not even mentioning the psychotic torture stuff that Mouth tells the housekeeper in Spanish.) It's the juxtaposition of this dark life-threatening stuff against the cartoony silliness of a boy being saved by plastic teeth on a slinky that bothers me so much. It's kids mocking a fat clumsy neighbor and then letting him into the house using an unexplained Rube Goldberg machine. I could continue, but needless to say there is literally nothing I like in The Goonies. It is one movie that I cannot imagine anyone enjoying unless they have the emotional, nostalgic connection.",

When you are a child, watching an all child leading cast, who are transported into their world and actually go on this adventure with these kids. By the way, this proves you can cast child actors who really cab act. I am now 36 years old and watched this again the other night, and loved every minute. This is one of those movie classics that just takes you back to a special place. I love \"the Goonies\" and I believe this movie holds up today with it's terrific action sequences and is really great fun for the whole family.",

            "content": "I have only one possible answer for why so many people like this film: Nostalgia.\n\nWell, take the nostalgia glasses off. This film sucks.\n\nFor the longest time, I couldn't even articulate why I hated this film even as a kid.\n\nThere were a million odd plotholes and wacky plot elements that kept distracting me and bugging me, from the villainous family's prison escape to that stinking piano of bones to the moving pipes. I know it's an adventure, but those things still bugged me all the same. The characters were unlikable and obnoxious, at least to me. The fat boy was there to be an obnoxious fat boy, like in every family movie at that time. The hero boy played by Sean Astin was about as bland as you get. The Asian kid... makes gadgets. The fourth kid is a jerk to the Hispanic maid, which has elements of racial/ethnic insensitivity. Speaking of racial/ethnic insensitivity, the villains have to remind you via stereotype practically every scene they're in that, yes, they are, in fact, Italian.\n\nBut the biggest problem with the movie? The thing that made me cringe every time I watched it?\n\nI. Hate. Sloth.\n\nI don't care how many memes get made of him, how many T-shirts get sold with his face on it along with the quote \"HEEEY YOUUU GUUUUYS!\" I hate Sloth. Why? Because I am autistic, I was placed in a special ed class with other mentally challenged kids in the third grade, and for years had to tolerate a lot of crap from other kids and even a teacher calling me a \"retard\". Yet here is this walking, talking caricature of a mentally handicapped and physically deformed person being the butt of jokes in this family film. My sister tried telling me, \"But he's sympathetic. They portray him as one of the good characters, and his treatment at the hands of his family is shown in a negative light.\" I would accept that argument, if not for the fact that they make him the butt of a lot of the movie's jokes just as often. I mean, the mother tries to calm him by singing \"Rock-a-bye, Baby\", but when she gets to the lyric about the cradle falling, Sloth freaks out and his mother says, \"I only dropped you once! .... Or maybe twice.\" Yes, the old baby-dropped-on-its-head-becomes-a-fucking-retard joke I've heard a million friggin' times before, most recently on an episode of Game of Thrones. It's not funny, and the joke really just needs to die a quick death. On top of that, at the end of the movie, the fat kid outright tells Sloth that he's going to come live with him now. It's played up to be heartwarming. I find it condescending. \"Awww, Mom, I got a new puppy!\"\n\nI'm sorry, everyone, but to me, Sloth is the blackface of mentally handicapped depictions on film.",

            "content": "The children who constitute the Goonies only really exist in the mind of Steven Spielberg, who produced and created the story. He sees boy children as fast-talking, fun-loving, dream-chasing rascals. Girl children older than, say, Drew Barrymore in \"E.T.\" are valuable as targets and instigators of boys' sexual precociousness, but are mostly just taggers-along on boys' adventures. How much you like \"The Goonies\" depends in part on whether your perceptions of childhood are as simple and limited as Spielberg's, or whether you see with the jaded eyes of an adult who wants something more from a movie than a middle-aged producer's wish fulfillment.\n\nThe plot of \"The Goonies,\" a quest for buried pirate treasure on the northern Pacific coast, owes a lot to Mark Twain's tale of Tom, Huck, and Becky in Injun Joe's cave. Twain's kids were wise beyond their years and rough around the edges, a bit like Sean Astin's \"Mikey\" and Corey Feldman's \"Mouth.\" But they were also complex figures with rich inner lives, not comic stereotypes like Ke Huy Quan's \"Data,\" who does gadgets, Jeff Cohen's \"Chunk,\" who loves food, and Kerri Green's \"Andy,\" a girl who shrieks and likes jewelry and kissing. Twain's dialogue was characterized by colorful turns of phrase and carefully-observed dialect, but Chris Columbus's screenplay is all shouted exposition, easy barbs, and convenient moments of wisdom.\n\nThe shouting is the hardest to tolerate as an adult, and unfortunately it is ceaseless. The movie's head baddie, having bundled the Goonies out of the room, exhales a line we're probably supposed to disagree with: \"Kids suck.\" During the brief respite from the noise, it's hard not to share her sentiment. The Goonies are pretty obnoxious, but the movie doesn't know it.\n\nWhatever their flaws in the character department, Spielberg, Columbus, and director Richard Donner are no slouches when it comes to cinematic spectacle. \"The Goonies\" is longer than it should be, but it moves so fast that it seldom lags. The dungeon and pirate ship sets look great, and for buffs there are plenty of winking homages to great adventure films like \"Captain Blood,\" \"Tarzan,\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" As if to compensate for the underwritten child roles, Dave Grusin's musical score does a great deal of emotional lifting and at times obscures the ubiquitous screaming.\n\nEven if you find the Goonies less than lovable, the filmmakers' fondness for them is apparent and a little infectious. A final scene on the beach gives each child a neat resolution and some parting words (several of which are painfully unearned) before capping things off with a moment of hushed, magical awe. However uneven the underlying content, it is hard to resist the appeal of a totally un-cynical moment of Spielbergian wonder.",

I can't quite bring myself to say that I do hate it, because it's just so happy all the time and well-meaning, but I didn't really enjoy watching it.\n\nThere's so many things to dislike about it. The visual effects were so bad, and all the sets literally looked like a theme park. The dialogue was pretty awful most of the time, to the point where I was laughing a lot at unintentionally funny parts. The badly written lines were delivered really poorly in most cases, and the characters were mostly unlikable; Mikey was a boring unfunny leader, Chunk was the token fat kid (who did occasionally make some funny expressions), Data was used for some of the most annoying slapstick ever (I'm thinking of when the fist jumped out of his shirt and hit the bad guy), and Mouth was just a prick, honestly.\n\nThere were a few scattered bright spots. Near the beginning of the movie, Brandon and Mikey shared a hug, and it was pretty nice. I liked the line said by Mikey's mom, \"Let her mother worry about her,\" when Brandon was making out with Andy. \"You were my greatest invention\" was a sweet line by Data's father. Having Martha Plimpton is always a plus, and it was cool to see her in a young role; she was also one of the only likable characters. But for the most part, this was kind of the cheesiest movie I've ever seen; it was incredibly over-sentimental, cliche, unfunny, and just bad.",

My son is now 10 and hopefully has been sucked into the Goonie-ness that pervades this flick.  A must for the 80s Nostalgic.  It has the girl, the comedy, the kids, the spookieness, the baddies and one of them is still fanciable and makes you drool, a group of heros all so lovable they could be any one of us in everyday life, and a happy ending, and pizza and gemstones and a pirate ship.

A little saucy, but hey... 80's\nLots of swearing for a PG 13 movie, but hey... 80's.\nData's character was almost as racially profiled as when he played Short Round.\nAll that having been said, it was way fun!

The exposition sets up all the boys' distinct personalities, only to squander the rest of the movie with unmotivated action and bland yet frantic adventure.  None of the boys' traits really play into the solving of the puzzles except the stereotypical techie Asian's.  Mikey's dweeby hamartia of asthma doesn't even provide an obstacle or suspense.   Stuff happens to the boys, and nothing is too dangerous or scary to warrant any real emotional investment in their journey.  \n\nAlso disappointing, much like with \"Nobody puts Baby in the corner\" and \"You're killing me, Smalls,\" quotable gems like \"Goonies never say die\" and \"Sloth loves Chunk\" are completely lackluster in context.  As for the former, I expected it to be a real club philosophy, a rallying battle cry born of a previous adventure during which they almost died but didn't, therefore cementing their stalwart courage in the face of certain death!  \"Goonies never say die\" is only said once as a throwaway line without set-up or follow-up.  As for the latter, could Sloth BE more disturbing as a child's nightmare come to life?  He's the monster with soul, but the love is just played for laughs instead of true pathos.",

I really love this movie and would recommend on seeing it. Especially kids will enjoy it. In 'The Goonies' we follow a group of friends who are about to be kicked out of their homes and have one last adventure together: to find the treasure of a pirate named One-Eyed Willy. This movie has it all: good humor meets thrilling suspense, where  loveable heroes meet  clumsy bad guys. Starring Sean Astin (the Lord of the Rings Trilogy), Corey Feldman (the Lost Boys, Friday the 13th part 4), Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men, Oldboy), Joe Pantoliano (Memento, The Matrix), Robert Davi (License to Kill, Showgirls) and Anne Ramsay (Throw Mama From the Train). \n\nMikey (Astin), Mouth (Feldman), Chunk and Data (Quan) live in the Goon Docks and call themselves 'The Goonies'. Because they will be thrown out of their homes to make room for a Country Club, the boys are spending their last weekend together. Mikey's older brother Brand (Brolin) who failed to get his driver's license, has to keep an eye on them. When the friends go to the attic where Mikey's father has stored museum items, they find a long lost treasure map. They believe it belongs to the notorious pirate One-Eyed Willy. The four boys tie up Brand and run off in search of the treasure.\n\nThe Goonies head down to the coast, where the entry to a secret cave is located underneath a abandoned restaurant. Little do the boys know that the restaurant is the hideout of the Fratellis, a gangster family consisting of the brothers Jake (Davi) and Francis (Pantoliano) and their mother (Ramsay). Just as things are about to get dangerous, a furious Brand shows up with his girlfriend Andy and her friend Stef. Unwillingly they join 'The Goonies' in the biggest adventure of their lives...",

No es un desastre absoluto y tiene ciertos momentos muy graciosos e ingeniosos, y ver a Sean Astin y a Josh Brolin en sus primeros papeles es genial. Supongo que les encantar\u00e1 a ni\u00f1os y adultos que la vieron en su tiempo y les pareci\u00f3 una obra maestra, pero al verla ya en 2013, es cansada y tediosa.

The movie is about a group of kids that live in the Goon Docks of Astoria, Oregon, therefore known as Goonies, who set out on an adventure. All of their homes are being bought out by a rich country club, but a chance encounter in Mikey's (Sean Astin) attic has the gang uncovering an old map. The movie is directed by Richard Donner and produced by Spielberg. It just reeks of that awesome 80's wonder and excitement that is shown in films like E.T. and Encounters of the Third Kind. It really captures such a random event such as the gang going through a huge underground maze to finally find what they're looking for. It's a great movie and mixes action, adventure and comedy. I really enjoy this and if you've never seen it get out there and do it movies just aren't made like this anymore. It features a great cast with Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman (what 80's movie was he not in?), Kerri Green and so on. One of my favorites as a kid, although it has it's creepy moments its a classic!",

            "content": "In true Spielberg fashion, movie genre perception is altered in outstanding effect with the child based adventure film 'The Goonies'. Serving this film as both screenwriter and producer, his influence can be felt throughout - and his willingness to change public acceptance on his genre shift. That genre shift being the disposal of the boundary between films aimed at children and adults - fusing into something that works for both with different elements. This has carried forward into his other movies since, but can be rooted back to this film as the real starter to this change. Therefore, 'The Goonies' should be really seen as a industry changer, as well as the good film that is. With a simple narrative yet interesting characters and a child orientated plot, the film is easily accessible to all ages. \n\nIn an attempt to stop the demolition of their neighborhood, a group of pre-teens - The Goonies - set out to find a buried treasure belonging to the pirate captain One-Eyed Willie. Through an ancient Spanish treasure map that the children find in a lost attic article, the children begin to hunt for the lost loot - however, when they interrupt a jail break involving the Fratellis, a crime family on the run, the children are pursued deep into the caverns and traps that they must overcome during their adventure. \n\nFeaturing a cast comprising mainly of child actors that have come on to be big names in the industry, 'The Goonies' is a film that feels more like a family than a cast present. With stand out names including Sean Astin and Josh Brolin, the film seems to have sought out some of the best child actors of the time. However, with the film being slightly dated, the look and feel of the characters can at times feel old fashioned. This does not take anything from the performances but may deter in a world comprising of ultra modern child actors. When taken into the approach of original released, the film holds well and the narrative is carried to its close without many obstacles or distractions. \n\nIn a simple manner, 'The Goonies' is a film that feels magical and adventurous throughout. A throwback to audience youth, the film is easily relatable to all those that have had similar adventures - imaginative or not - during their childhood. It is a story about friends, a buddy movie comprising of multiple people and with enough chemistry to allow it to work. Featuring a screenplay written by a future 'Harry Potter' director, Chris Columbus, the film showcases many of the elements that have been carried over through the decades in hopes of showcasing similar relationships between young people in different productions. \n\nWith a feeling of immaturity throughout, the film does in places feel stupid. However, when taken into the entire context of the film it does not deter much from the overall opinion generated on the production. For those who dislike childlike mannerisms and unbelievability in some sequences, this film is to be missed for fear of disliking its content. For everyone else 'The Goonies' holds enough to find the likable quality it holds. A true cult classic, that will last the test of time. A fantasy filmthat redefined a genre. B",

            "content": "The 1980s was the definitive decade for the coming-of-age film. Stand by Me, The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and The Karate Kid were all released within the span of the ten year period. Another sort of coming-of-age movie released in the 80s was the Steven Spielberg produced The Goonies, directed by Richard Donner. After releasing his successful Superman movie, Donner had a quick series of commercial flops before returning with the very successful The Goonies. The Goonies isn't nearly as serious as the other coming-of-age movies of the decade, but it creates a whimsical adventure full of likeable characters and themes.\n\nThe Goonies tells the story of a group of coastal Oregon boys who are known as, well, \"the Goonies.\" These Goonies consist of Mikey Walsh, the leader of the group, Mouth, a smart mouthed rebel of sorts, Data, the genius who has all sorts of inventions under his coat, and Chunk, the loveable chubby sidekick. Living in the \"Goon Docks\" of Astoria, Oregon, these young boys and their families face the imminent foreclosure of their homes due to construction of a new country club. As they celebrate their last \"Goonies weekend,\" the boys stumble across a map and artifact that lead them on a hunt for the treasure of pirate One-Eyed Willie. \n\nAlso tagging along on the adventure is Brand Walsh, Mikey's older brother, Andy Carmichael, Brand's love interest, and Stef Steinbrenner, Andy's friend. The hunt for One-Eyed Willie's treasure isn't just a simple \"X marks the spot\" adventure, however. The first hint leads the Goonies to an old seaside restaurant that doubles as the hideout of a gang known as the Fratellis. The encounter with this criminal group leads to an adventure with more conflict than the Goonies had expected.\n\nThe story of The Goonies is undeniably engaging and fun to follow. The hunt for One-Eyed Willie's treasure is quite whimsical and fun, with a very Spielberg-esque vibe to it all. The film manages to be kid-friendly, but also covers some rather intense themes. Occasionally, the group comes across skeletons of past explorers, the aforementioned criminals with handguns, and a disgustingly charming, deformed \"Sloth.\" The Goonies is surprisingly enjoyable for viewers of all ages, even if it's coming-of-age themes are buried under the whimsy and adventure of the story. \n\nThe cast is well-rounded and awesome all across the board. Sean Astin is a great lead character, who plays Mikey with great passion. Corey Feldman of fellow coming-of-age flick Stand by Me is a hilarious Mouth, who spits one-liners and quips regularly. Ke Huy Quan is a fun Data, who always has something up his sleeve for the situation at hand. Jeff Cohen is a very funny and adorable Chunk, who is undeniably hilarious. Rounding out the cast is John Brolin as Brand, Keri Green as Andy, and John Matuszak as Sloth, all of whom are fantastic.\n\nThe Goonies is one of the classic movies to come out of the 1980s. Remembered for it's whimsical story and cute cast of characters, the film stands in the hearts of many as a film of nostalgia and memories. It's not quite perfect in the fact that the coming-of-age elements could have been stronger, but The Goonies is a fun adventure for everyone.",

            "content": "I first watched this seminal 80's classic in 1988, when it first appeared on TV and I was blown away by it. I was 10, roughly the same age as the lads and here was a film with a raucous sense of humour, strong child characters and large-scale plot which has made this film a multi-generational classic, with our parents, us as parents and our children all investing in the spirit of adventure of The Goonies.\n\nNamed after the Goon Docks of which they inhabit, a group of kids, after finding a treasure map, decide that this is their last chance to save the town, which is to knocked down in  favour of a Country Club. This leads them on an adventure through the booby-trapped underground catacombs of the town, as they follow the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure.\n\nThey get mixed up with the Fratelli's, a matriarchal crime family who get wind of the treasure and follows them into the caves.\n\nThe first ting that struck me about this, is after all these years what that it was still fun, enjoyable and even though I might not bother watching by myself, I would defiantly enjoy seeing again with the right audience. The raucous nature of a group of children together in a room is captured so expertly here, with a young Sean Austin, now famous for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, holding the pack together; but the chaos is portrayed perfectly.\n\nThe language is good here too, with casual swearing amongst the kids, meaning that this  must be one of the rare family films to truly capture the interplay between tweenage and teenage kids. Overall, this is a classic for all the right reasons, with the story by Steven Spielberg with only goes to further reinforce his status as one of Hollywood's greatest visionaries and a sharp, tight screenplay by Chris Columbus, who penned Gremlins the previous year and went on to direct the first two, but the weakest two Harry Potter movies.\n\nThere is also the questionable issue of the way that the Fratelli's treat Chunk. When you think about it he is threatened with torture after being kidnaped and spending time with the murdered corpse of two 'Feds' who have been shot in the head, murdered in cold blood.\n\nI love this, treating the horror in a mature way, allowing it to used as humour but in a way to playfully scare kids, which it does. It is fun, but I do wonder where the PC brigade would let some of these plot points go in to a child friendly romp in 2011? I hope so, as it is the combination of elements that made this film what it is today.",

            "content": "The 1985 adventure cult classic, The Goonies, must be one of the purest whole family adventure films  I have come across so far. Overall the 80's was a golden age for adventure films with productions like Indiana Jones trilogy, Star Wars movies, James Bonds and many others, and The Goonies fits right in amongst the classics. \n\nThe story of Goonies is dead simple; a group of pre-teens set on a wild treasure hunt in order to save their homes from demolition. As dated as the story might sound, it is the perfect excuse for the \"Goonies\" squad to depart on a spectacular adventure. From there on, the film is constant hassle and contains every imaginable adventure film/funhouse \"must be included\" elements imaginable: Silly bad guys, a long lost pirate treasure, bats, skeletons, scary \"monster\", infatuation and the list goes on and on. All this might sound awfully clicheish, and honestly most of it does not make much sense, but it works quite well and I would expect no less from a 80's adventure film.\n\nAs nostalgic and fun as The Goonies is, there are some factors in the film which kept rubbing me the wrong way through the film. The main gripe being the constant yelling and shrieking characters which I  found beyond annoying. Other factors were mostly story related and how absurd most of the film was, but that is what you get if you try to assess a film like this rationally. In any case, The Goonies was rather nice and entertaining adventure flick overall, but obviously I am already outside the target audience. Had I seen the film 20 years ago, I am sure it would have been the best film ever.",

When you really look at it, The Goonies is basically a noisy family adventure flick, but it's not without its quaint, 80's charm. The characters are actually quite good, but they seem to follow the usual stereotypes. For instance, Data is a stereotypical Asian gadget wizard, right down to his accent. The story allows plenty of room for energetic, matinee-style action, but there isn't a lot of new ground being broken, as if the whole film follows a safe formula. I suppose there is some humour to be found in the first part of the film, but that's mainly because I quickly noticed that the kids were swearing more than in most PG-rated films I've seen. Perhaps it's good that the Goonies all grew up and moved on, because there's barely anything that makes this film really unique and genuinely artistic. However, that doesn't mean that this film is completely hollow. It's still enjoyable for kids, and it's not bad as a guilty pleasure for adults.",

Another 80's movie, The Neverending Story, is in my top 2 most hated films. But The Goonies has a good reputation, and it seems that a whole lot of people like it, so I gave it a try.\n\nI am happy to report that this is the best, \"nostalgic,\" 1980's movies I've seen. It is genuinely funny, has a brisk pace, and a very Spielbergian feel. Plus a boat load of great young actors, some of which have continued in Hollywood to this day.\n\nThe story is of a group of kids, lead by Mikey Walsh and his big brother Brand. Their group is about to be disbanded because Mikey and Brand's house is going to be foreclosed on. But the group of kids hears about One-Eyed Willy's Treasure. If they can find the treasure, then the Walshs wont have to move. They wind up in a subterranean cavern searching for the treasure. There they encounter traps, natural waterslides, and a underground pirate ship.\n\nA very young Sean Astin stars as Mikey Walsh. This movie is just a foreshadowing of better things to come from him, but you can see his talent here, even at such a young age. Josh Brolin plays Brand, Mikey's brother. If you didn't know it was him, there is a good chance you wouldn't recognize him. All the others that play the kids are fantastic. Who doesn't love Chunk? And Jonathan Ke Quan, aka Short Round, as Data is amazing.\n\nOverall, I was ready to find this movie depressingly stupid. But after seeing it, I can understand the cult status that it has. I enjoyed it.\n\n\"Brand, God put that rock there for a reason...\" 7.5/10",

Well made during it's time but quite tame when watching it as an adult after a second viewing.  It's better than \"Super 8\" though.\r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4",

He then exits the building and with the help of his mother and friend, pour gasoline all over the outside of the entrance, and then once the cops show up, one gunshot causes the gasoline to ignite. The characters are also annoying as hell. If you ever needed a reason to never want to have kids ever, then just watch this movie. Every single child character (aka most of the main cast) are either annoying or bland stereotypes. It's done to give a sense of \"realism\" but it never jibes with the movie's completely nonsensical  plot and events. Plus, if everyone who's seeing this movie has been a kid at some point, why do we need to see what we've seen in real life replicated on screen only more annoying!? I could probably forgive all of this if the movie was actually funny, but well.....it just isn't.

But inexplicably, this movie is charming and enjoyable. Though the movie gets a bit loud in some places, with all of the characters constantly arguing and speaking incoherently, there is a sort of base sense of glee that comes about when the Chunk and Sloth save the day, or when Data narrowly avoids death thanks to his inventions, not to mention the very satisfying end of the film. The Goonies is one of those rare films that truly harkens back to childhood, and it does it with unabashed energy and glee.",

The story is maybe best described as quaint and watching it in 2012 there's a very nostalgic feel to it.  Teenage romance does't require almost near nudity and its almost 'cute' when a 12 year old actor swears.  The movies have come along ways but maybe they've lost a sense of sedulity.  The Goonies is definitely a movie from a different era.  Having said this its important to compare the Goonies against some of it contemporaries.  For example Romancing the Stone or Indiana Jones on this level the Goonies really isn't quite as good.  The story is a little bit disjointed and even a little strange at times.  While it might be a nice jaunt down memory lane ultimately the Goonies is a fairly average movie.",

And before the Pirates of the Caribbean, there were -- the GOONIES!\n\n\"Heeeeey yooouuuuu guuu-uuys!\"\n\nWhy is this my most favorite movie of all?  Perhaps because it was my first favorite.  Perhaps because it makes me think of my brothers.  Perhaps because it's one of the most quotable movies I know of.  Perhaps because I can watch it over and over and over again and never get tired of it.  Perhaps because if I'm having a bad day, I can turn to this movie, and it never fails in making me feel better.  Whatever the reason, this is a great, classic movie. \n\nWhat draws me to this movie is the adventure, and the friendship.  I've always been a fan of adventure stories, and stories of friendship.  The bond between this group of friends is unbeatable; the chemistry between them is fantastic -- realistic and funny.  Each character is entirely unique.  And absolutely nothing beats Mikey's admiration for One-Eyed Willy.  \n\nThe storyline is simple and believable.  I've always loved the fact that Mikey has a bunch of old pirate junk in his attic -- including the treasure map!  There's a crazy surprise around every corner!  The script is flawless and hillarious, and the characters are superbly crafted.  I'm a huge fan of strong characters in a story, and these guys are excellent.\n\nIt's a movie about dreams coming true, the unimaginable happening, good winning over evil, and the true strength of friendship.   It's a good laugh, and just can't be  missed!",

This time around I still noticed the sexual innuendo, but I was surprised at how much less of it there was than what I had remembered from my college days.  There are alot of ridiculous holes in terms of plot plausibility, etc, but if one is able to ignore them and concentrate on the fun, then this is a pretty entertaining film.  It's the kind of adventure picture that will mark one forever if they saw it as a child.  I plays to so many of a kids fantasies that it's essentially impossible to resist.

The ensemble is terrific with great turns from youn actors like Sean Astin and Josh Brolin before they became prominent actors. It also had characters that all kids alike can relate from th pretty cheerleader to the chunky friend.

            "content": "Is there anyone in the world that doesn't like The Goonies?  Only a minor hit on it's initial release this seems to have grown in reputation over the years as a perfect piece of 80s nostalgia.  The plot 's pretty perfunctory - a bunch of kids set off to seek buried treasure in the hope of paying off the developers who are threatening to tear down their town.  Cue various boys own scenes of underground caverns, deadly traps and not only a treasure chest but a whole pirate ship full of the stuff as the gang are chased by a bunch of small time crooks intent on getting their hands on the booty as well.\n\nWhat seems to set this film apart from others of it's ilk are the characters - which manage to be both clich\u00e9d and well rounded at the same time.  There's the intense kid who's the brains of the outfit, his hunky 'older' brother, the wacky kid with his inventions, the  smart ass, the female love interest and the one everyone loves: Chunk - the fat kid who is a tour-de-force performance culminating in the scene when the crooks force him to tell them what he's been up to and he spends an hour recounting very naughty deed he's ever done.\n\nAfter a slow start the whole thing romps along at a breakneck pace with a great sense of fun, the peril is always over the top adventure comic stuff and anyway, there's always a comedy moment from one of the gang around the corner.\n\nAs someone more inclined towards intense and sleazy horror films I should be going nowhere near this but you just can't help but love it.  Maybe we all just want to be Goonies at heart.",

Adding a few stray female companions and some criminals and this movie is the perfect mix.  Finding a secret map the kids go on the search for a local legend, get up to mischief, dodge booby traps and outrun criminals hot on their heels.

In order to get to it, they must go through a bleak, mysterious, cannibalistic restaurant and deformed creature known as Sloth.\r\n\r\nScooby-Doo + Indiana Jones = The Goonies\r\n\r\nThat is exactly what I think the formula that went into making The Goonies was like. Its got an adventurous plot like an Indiana Jones flick and the spookiness and silliness of a Scooby-Doo episode. Its also cheesy like one. The Goonies is considered a coming-of-age film to many and I agree. The film contains morals of friendship and teamwork. Plus, facing your fears, first crushes, and independence.\r\n\r\nThis film is fun and cute. I didn't find it awesome like many people claimed. I found the writing to be smart and witty and the cave and restaurant scenes have a good spooky tone. Nicely done, Ricard Donner. This is definetly the type of film Spielberg would like to contribute to.\r\n\r\nAs for performances, they were great. But no matter how good the production design, visuals, and performances are, 80s films would always have a touch of cheesiness. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, and Corey Feldman (R.I.P.) are fine young actors. I just wonder why young boys aren't very good actors today. Its all about the girls these days. Abigail Breslin, Chloe Mortez, Hailee Steinfeld, etc. Also, the little kid who played Short Round in Temple of Doom is so enjoyable in this one as the kid with wacky little inventions up his sleeve. I so wanna see him come back to cinema. If they can bring back Marion for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they should bring back Shorty for the 5th and Dr. Jones, Sr. for the 6th. Don't die just yet, Sean! Whoever played Sloth was good. Plus, you gotta love Chunk!\r\n\r\nThe Goonies is a fun little adventure movie with many memorable bits. The cast is fun and the story is good. What you expect from an adventurous kids film is delivered. A sequel is in development and I think with today's visual effects and production design, it would look great. Nothing has been confirmed yet, but a musical adaptation is in the early stages. Tell me what you think of this in the comments, folks. Would you like a sequel or a stage musical? A fun film The Goonies is. In the words of the great Stan Lee, \"Nuff' said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the truffle shuffle.\"\r\n\r\nWhy don't we all do the Truffle Shuffle? Cue the music!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIOOwhmkoLo",

It's like an Indiana Jones movie, except starring kids instead of Harrison Ford, and even though the kids are all quirky, they never get on your nerves.  You can see why it's beloved by people who watched it when they were kids, because the character of Mikey is so easy for them to transpose themselves onto.

After all this teen Indiana Jones featuring the pre-pubescent Breakfast Club holds a similar place for as many 30 somethings as Stand By Me does, and like Stand By Me this film holds up remarkably well.\r\n\r\nIf you were going to make a movie that appeals to teenage boys what do you think you might put in it?\r\n\r\n - Bikes, inventions, skeletons, nutshots, potty humour.\r\n - Adventure, near misses and close escapes? Booby traps, codes and challenges.\r\n - Criminals? Monsters??\r\n - TREASURE MAPS & PIRATES???\r\n\r\nHow about all of the above? The Goonies are four pre-teen buddies with clever nicknames that also serve to explain more about them than 15 minutes of exposition would:\r\n\r\n    Mouth - The loud talkative one.\r\n    Data - The nerdy inventor one.\r\n    Chunk - The fat obnoxious and clumsy one.\r\n    Mike - The ummm... one named Mike? He is asthmatic if that helps.\r\n\r\nThe first prison escape and ensuing car chase neatly intros every principal character that will appear in the film within an entertaining 5 minutes. Clever stuff really.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple more rambunctious pre-teen conversations - and a plot device that finds them with the desperate need to find big cash quick or their house will be foreclosed to make way for a golf course - the boys unexpectedly come across what appears to be a pirate's treasure map from 1632, made by the renowned local pirate One Eyed Willie (aren't they all?).\r\n\r\nSo the four Goonies, along with Mike's older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin... Yep No Country for Old Men himself) and his cheerleader target of (PG13) conquest Andie and her buddy Steph unwittingly along for the ride; off everyone goes for an adventure.\r\n\r\nTo ramp up the action a notch further the local crime family the Fratellis are injected into proceedings so that they might pose a threat by staying one step behind the kids at all times. Don't worry kids, the Fratellis are an old Mum and her two boneheaded sons, no-one gets hurt and there is never any serious peril or danger.\r\n\r\nWith all the major players identified and in play the hunt leads all and sundry into a vast underground series of caves and tunnels, with booby traps and dangerous terrain all around, the traps were lain by the late Mr Willie who it was alleged would rather die wealthy than spread his booty around... unlike Jessica Simpson - who will only die wealthy...\r\n\r\nEach Goonie gets their respective chance to shine as they come across each new obstacle or elaborate puzzle, the girls are their to provide love and lust interests and to shriek when the situation demands - and if all that isn't enough a fourth \"forgotten\" Fratelli, the hideously disfigured ogre-ish Sloth pops his magnificently unique lump head into the fray... Again don't worry he's not a bad hideously disfigured, massively muscled ogre, he's a good guy (great 80s makeup job though!).\r\n\r\nEveryone learns something from the experience, there is some immensely entertaining action sequences and the whole thing is as light and realistic as a Miss Universe contestant, thankfully it makes more sense though.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Goonies apart is the little touches, despite the large number of characters in the group everyone is distinctly different, but aside from just the broad strokes mentioned above there are little touches that lend further human qualities to the boys that go beyond mere caricature - the asthma inhaler, the inventions, the clumsiness and strange stories - they all help.\r\n\r\nThe plot is necessarily preposterous at all times, everything is skewed towards fun and escapism, and as mentioned previously this has been purpose built to entertain, amuse and inspire young boys - just like Britney Spears. That's three pop-culture potshots at obvious targets in one review - my parents must be so proud!\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 7.5 / 10. As with many things The Goonies all appears effortless and straightforward, but as we should know it takes a lot of effort and planning to make things look this easy, even then this has the added bonus of being consistently fun and engaging. There's a reason this has an audience 25 years on when Due Date will be forgotten in 25 days.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 500 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

From the way she went on about it, I was expecting it to be really good, but in fact on the contrary I was fairly disappointed. The film is about a group of kids who go on an adventure to look for treasure, but they are faced with various obstacles and danger on their quest.\r\n\r\nChildren and people who grew up with this film can more or less identify with it and enjoy it, but for me it didn't really do much. I found it quite boring to sit through and just really wanted for it to be over. However it's not all bad; the fat kid Chunk (Jeff Cohen) made me laugh and I just thought that Sloth (John Matuszak) was adorable. The film had nice morals and everything, but it just want really for me.\r\n\r\nDespite some nice moments this film didnt really appeal to me, its not for everyone. If you're a big kid at heart you'll like this, but if action and adventure doesnt do it for you then this wont be for you. \r\n\r\n\r\nGrade: C",

Yeah it has the right messages like friendship bla bla, but I just couldn't really get into the film. I didn't really think it was anything special. It wasn't all bad, it had some good moments, the fat kid made me laugh, Sloth was adorable and the kids were fairly cute. Children and big kids will like this film, but if you're not really one for action and adventure this film wont leave you fulfilled. It's decent enough, but its not for everyone.\r\n\r\nGrade: C",

With their homes at stake of being foreclosed and their neighborhood becoming a future golf course, A group of misfit kids band together one afternoon and accidentally discover a pirate map. Thus they begin a search for the missing treasure of One Eyed Willy. Watching The Goonies brings back fun memories of my childhood. The film is one of those gems that doesn't seem dated and you can watch over and over again and still find amusing. The story is exciting, funny and thrilling.  Director Richard Donner directs a great cast of actors. Including a very young Josh Brolin and Sean Avery. Honestly, I couldn't believe it was Brolin and Avery.  The Goonies is a wonderfully crafted adventure film. The young cast may seem familiar to many as you have Corey Feldman (Friday The 13th part 4, The Burebs, The Lost Boys) and Jonathan Que Quan (Short Round, Indiana Jones and The Temple Doom) The story is fairly simple, but it's a very entertaining one at that. I grew up watching The Goonies, for me it's one of those timless childhood favorites such as The Sandlot, The Secret Garden, Casper and Toy Story. All those films bring back memories. But The Goonies, unlike any other film that I saw when I was a kid, made a pretty big impact on me. When I first saw it, I was astounded with it. I had so much fun, the characters, the humour, the pirate themed adventure. The Goonies is a film that should be watched and cherished by families everywhere.",

            "content": "Before I begin, let me confess that I'm very biased towards this movie because it has a great nostalgia value for me, and besides it's my favorite movie ever so... let's begin.\r\n\r\nThe Goonies may just be the quintessential 80s family movie. It has everything that made the decade great: kids swearing, a delightful soundtrack, physical special fx and the oh-so-typical 80's haircuts, but lets just get into a little bit of detail here.\r\n\r\nThe movie centers on a group of kids who call themselves the \"goonies\", who are trying to spend their last days together before their neighborhood gets demolished by an unscrupulous golf club. The group is formed by the leader, the big brother, the smartass, the inventor and the comic relief. What's great about these characters is that they feel like the friends that one could've actually had in their childhood.\r\n\r\nThings get all messed up when the kids embark on an adventure to find a pirate treasure, and when we add the bad guys to the mix (a playfully played trio of italian criminals) everything just starts to come together to form a great family adventure film.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the characters are a big part of what makes this movie great. It's just a delight to see these characters on screen, both heroes and villains. They have the perfect chemistry together and all the actors seem to have a lot of fun in their roles, specially Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi, who play the italian bad guys.\r\n\r\nAs every pirate adventure movie, this one is also full of special effects. They may seem campy at some points, but they serve their purpose very well, wich is to excite. And talking about audio-visual specs, let's get a little bit into Dave Grusin's score. He composed some very beautiful pieces for this movie, wich convey the perfect feelings for every scene. From adventurous \"cave\" music to mysterious \"pirate ship\" compositions. The score just have it all. \r\n\r\nOf course the movie has some faults, mainly in the campy style of it all ('cause yes, the movie feels very campy and even corny at times), but if you watch it in the right mood there's no stopping you in enjoying this. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Donner, Spielberg and Grusin managed to make this the perfect family- adventure film, and if you are a fan of the 80's such as myself, you'll just love it.",

            "content": "The Goonies is an all-time-favourite to a lot of people, so I'm treading carefully here. How to put it? It's good, not great.\r\n\r\nThe story of a bunch of kids on a treasure hunt, it contains many exciting moments borrowed from other movies like Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Ostensibly they're trying to raise the necessary cash to save their homes from destruction, but really this is a tale of clinging to your childhood for one more summer. It's endearing in that way, even if by definition it lacks the edge of a coming-of-age story. The Goonies is no Stand By Me.\r\n\r\nAnother area where the film, if not fails, then fails to launch, is in the wobbly tone. The presence of three gangsters, a wicked momma gangster and her two sons, would be dodgy enough without the deformed, mentally challenged third son. The endearingly enormous Sloth means well and is a hero in the end, but a scene where he hurls his mean old mother off a precipice, mirroring the unfortunate childhood incident that left him the way he is, seems far more disturbing than fun.\r\n\r\nCharacterisation is in short supply, but the young actors are all very entertaining, if at times rather hard to understand thanks to pre-pubescently shrieking their dialogue. There's a nice reversal of cliche in the relationship between Mikey (Sean Astin) and his older brother (Josh Brolin) - you expect big brother to bully and mock him, but they're pretty affectionate. The others are mostly one-note - Mouth is talkative, Data invents things, Chunk likes food and is clumsy - but they're funny in a hit-and-miss way. The various perils and gadgets that fill out their journey are fun and often funny, and although most of Mikey's character arc is worthy and a bit sappy, he gives the movie heart.\r\n\r\nThe Goonies features a couple of astounding sights, but it's still somehow unspectacular. The thrills feel a little borrowed, and the story seems like a perfunctory list of reasons to get our heroes on an underground treasure hunt. It feels like a distillation of other movies, like there's another even better version of this somewhere.",
