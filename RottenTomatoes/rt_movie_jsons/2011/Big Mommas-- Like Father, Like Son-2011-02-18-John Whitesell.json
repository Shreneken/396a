    "summary": "After stepson Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) witnesses a murder, FBI agent Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) brings back Big Momma, his plus-size alter ego, to help solve the crime. Big Momma goes deep under cover at a girls school of the performing arts, but this time he has Trent and Trent's female alter ego Charmaine as backup. The duo must try to find the killer before the killer finds them, but complicating matters is Trent's crush on a student (Jessica Lucas).",

How come good films and underrated films such as Hulk, Daredevil, Spy Kids, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, Stuart Little, Stuart Little 2, Harriet the Spy, and Charlie's Angels (2003) all have lower audience scores than this atrocity?! I swear, the Rotten Tomatoes audience is just a bunch of countless idiots with shitty taste in movies! \n\nThis is one of the worst, unfunniest, and stupidest movies I've ever watched. It was so painful to watch this dumpster fire. I have lost all fondness and respect for Martin Lawrence. It was so unfunny, predictable, forgettable, boring, cliched, and poorly acted.\n\nRating. 0.5/10",

This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, it sucks in every angle. The jokes are terrible, there's only like two or three jokes that Lawrence and Brandon fire off once in a while, but aside from that, the jokes are forced, terrible and unfunny, let me give you an example, this movie's bad guy is named Chirkoff... Sow, don't watch this movie in any circumstance, it showed me that people can do anything to get money, but I didn't know they could go this far, it also showed me that Lawrence's talent is being wasted by low-budget movies where he plays a cop that we wish that we'd never see again. Don't forget that this is also one of the most cliched movies of all time. Overall, I hated it, the first was enough, but they didn't see the boundry, cause come on, this is already the fourth movie of the series, and it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I'm sure they recieved some money, but this movie is a waste of talent and a waste of dignity, I would do anything to go back in time and don't watch this movie. But, come on, seriously, even if you had fun with some of the previous movies or even if you didn't but you just want to get the whole series watched, just don't do that, cause only no one would like this movie.\n\n1/10",

Just by watching the trailer you can see that this isn't going to be a good movie.  However, because I knew exactly what I was getting into, I actually kind of enjoyed it.  In fact, it's my favorite out of the \"Big Momma's House\" series.\n\nMartin Lawrence is back in the role of FBI agent Malcolm Turner, aka Big Momma.  This time, his stepson Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) is in on the adventure after he witnesses a murder.  To solve the case behind the killing that he saw, the two must go undercover at an all-girls school.  Malcolm once again poses as Big Momma, while Trent is disguised as his overweight niece Charmaine.\n\nAs dumb as this plot sounds, I actually found myself laughing out loud multiple times.  Martin Lawrence is one of my favorite comedic actors, and I can find humor in just about anything he participates in.  He is once again hilarious in the role of Big Momma.  I was concerned that I would find Brandon T. Jackson annoying as the co-star, but I actually thought he worked surprisingly well.  The supporting cast is solid (and also easy on the eyes), including Portia Doubleday, Michelle Ang, and the gorgeous Jessica Lucas.  \n\nI'll admit, this is definitely a stupid comedy with a variety of stupid moments.  If you go into this expecting some sort of ground-breaking film, then obviously you will be very disappointed.  However, if you watch this with low expectations (like I did), then you might be pleasantly surprised.  I had a good time with Big Mommas:  Like Father, Like Son.  3 and a half stars.",

Sow, don't watch this movie in any circumstance, it showed me that people can do anything to get money, but I didn't know they could go this far, it also showed me that Lawrence's talent is being wasted by low-budget movies where he plays a cop that we wish that we'd never see again.

I didn't even know it was being made and yet again, there is a reason why Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son exists, it's that five-letter word that is always the only reason why pointless sequels such as this one are made. Although it is pointless, at least it is a little funnier than the dreadful Big Momma's House 2. Malcolm yet again wears the fat suit and turns pointlessly into Big Momma, this time he has to protect his son Trent, who also has to dress into a woman, after he witnesses a murder by hiding him in an all-girls' art school. Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son is nowhere near better than the original but it is a lot funnier than Big Momma's House 2 which, let's admit it, isn't at all hard to do. Even Seltzer and Friedburg could manage to make a funnier movie...well...maybe not but still, you get the idea. The reason why we didn't like Big Momma's House 2 is also evident in Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son; it's not really funny, it's not original and it's not wanted. Granted that it has taken a step up from the unfunny Big Momma's House 2, everything about the movie is more or less lazy and yet again, insulting the audience that we'd like such tripe. The script wasn't anywhere near good and was just bad in several places and the characters were one-dimensional with as much personality as a kitchen utensil. Martin Lawrence pointlessly wears the fat suit to become Big Momma yet again without reason. As stated in the review of Big Momma's House 2, he could be absolutely anybody he wanted. However, just like in Big Momma's House 2, he wouldn't be convincing as Big Momma but he would be convincing as a man in a fat suit wearing a dress.\r\n\r\nJust like Big Momma's House 2, the cast looked a little lazy but with such a dodgy script and badly-written characters, is it really any wonder? Brandon T. Jackson plays Trent (or Charmaine) and he does a decent job playing as his character and delivers a couple of laughs and manages to outshine Martin Lawrence at the same time. With hardly any plot and an unoriginal story, Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son (as expected) falls flat on it's backside and doesn't even bother to try and get back up to better itself. Hopefully, Hollywood will leave Big Momma alone and let her rest in peace, however it's unlikely this will happen as we'll probably see Charmaine as the main character next time. Let's just hope and pray that there will not be another Big Momma movie.\r\n\r\nWhile it's funnier than Big Momma's House 2, Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son is quite dreadful but on the bright side, it does have a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, which is more than what the previous movie had. It's criminal that cinemas charge the prices they charge to see this movie, this one is something you should definitely wait to rent on DVD if you want to see it. It's not worth the price of a cinema ticket!",

The movie was not really original, all the jokes were pretty much done already in the first two and the script was equally bad. This really didn't have much to offer.",

Jackson) got into Duke University, which he has. Malcolm goes home and tells Trent the good news, but Trent's not there. He goes to get Trent who is performing at a rap concert. When they go home, Trent tells his stepfather that he doesn't want to be a college student - he wants to be a rapper and needs Malcolm to sign a recording contract. When he witnesses a crime, Trent is forced to disguise as a girl, taking the name Charmaine Daisy Pierce in order to avoid getting killed. Malcolm disguises as his alter-ego, Big Momma, and hides Trent at an all-girls performing arts school to get a flash drive hidden in the school. Big Momma takes a job as house mother for the school. One of the girls, Jasmine, gives a warning to Big Momma: This is her school, and Big Momma better stay out of her way. Meanwhile Trent develops a crush on a student named Haley.\n \nLater, Big Momma and Trent are having dinner with the other girls. Jasmine tells Trent that all the new girls have to do something to prove that they belong in the school and eat at least one time. It's rather: Sing, dance or act. Trent chooses singing and breaks into a rap with Haley's help on the piano. Big Momma gets on the table and starts dancing, breaking the table. The headmistress announces that a music box has been stolen and Malcolm figures that this must be where the flash drive was hidden.\n \nLater that night, Malcolm as Big Momma runs into the security guard Kurtis, who hits on him. Malcolm gets Kurtis to take him on a tour and realizes that Kurtis was his FBI informant's friend and thus may know where the flash drive is. Malcolm learns from Kurtis that the girls may have stolen the flash drive and finds a necklace on the ground. Meanwhile, Trent attends a get-together with the girls where Haley gets a necklace as a member of the \"Divas\"; Jasmine isn't wearing one despite being a member. Malcolm and Trent surmise that Jasmine is likely the thief and strike a deal; if Trent helps Malcolm recover the flash drive, Malcolm will sign the contract.\n \nThe next day, Big Momma has to be naked for art class. But Malcolm asks for a towel. So at first the students draw Big Momma with a towel, then the Art Class teacher asks him to take the towel off. So Trent gets up and presses the school alarm. Everyone goes outside, and they find out that it was a lie. For a free period, Trent and Hailey go shopping. But Trent almost passes out when he and Hailey have to share a room together to change. When Hailey starts taking her clothes off, he gets out of the room. Meanwhile, Malcolm is grateful Trent pressed the Alarm. Trent hooks Haley up with himself. At first Haley says she hates Trent. But when Trent and Haley have a first date, they connect a bit. While Kurtis begins to fall in love with Big Momma. Big Momma searches for any clues to help him with the mission. But after an attempt to check the music box out, he runs when Kurtis comes into the library.",

It's a washed up comedy with cliché dumbness and characters that will piss off the average film viewer. If you enjoy stupid simple-minded stories with Pop culture references of the ass, then Big Momma 3 offers entertainment. For those that know a good film when you see one, then your going to hate this. It is really stupid and for a comedy it isn't all that funny. There was about 3 times I laughed and even then it was a mild chuckle. The film doesn't have those things you like in Movies like characters, plot twists, great music and all that other cinematographic stuff that makes films great. It's just a simple minded dumb comedy made by a bunch of immature film makers.\r\n\r\nFull Review:\r\nhttp://filmmasterjournal.blogspot.com/2011/07/big-mommas-like-father-like-son-2011.html",

How many more fat jokes can Martin Lawrence (Big Momma's House 1 & 2, Bad Boys 1 & 2) get out of this set of films?  The older, more mature Momma jokes must have began to run dry to the writers because they decided to add Big Momma's son into the story so he, too, can run around in a fatsuit while in drag -- as nothing says father/son bonding quite like wearing dresses over 200-pound fatsuits.  If you are either gagging or rolling-your-eyes, it is fitting.  This absurd addition to the trilogy finds the pair relocating to an all girls' school (how original, no?  Let's try to channel Some Like It Hot, shall we?) as they search for a missing flash-drive that a low-level goon was killed over (Big Momma's son [played by Percy Jackson's Brandon T. Jackson] witnessed the shooting).  Yes, of course, naturally ... it was hidden away somewhere at the girls' school ... as the fat jokes have worn thin the writers decided to go more-heavy on the awkward teenager boy/girl uncomfortable situations route (see ... the movie even encourages the use of horrible, lame puns).  While there is a catchy duet sang in the film (nice melody) the film is also hindered with some terrible music of Jackson's own -- hearing \"I'm a Lyrical Miracle ...\" was too much (and it does NOT happen only once).  If you are in the mood for a girl's school film -- see the much superior Cracks that is playing in very limited release (starring Eva Green); if you want to see a fatsuit film I will recommend re-watching the old standby, Mrs. Doubtfire.  This one is lame and as tragic as morbid obesity.",

Is not a new story and mixing it with an almost FAME scene, is not even new....it has it's flaws defenetly.\r\n\r\nPlot: FBI agent Malcolm has a new mission...the problem? He need's his son Trent to get inside the job for a music box as Charmaine. How this will end? Check the film, is still enjoyable, no matter what. One star for the effort made by the crew and the one behind the story-telling too.\r\n\r\nActing: Brandon as Trent was like some other roles he has done. But as Charmaine was another story. I never saw him in a girl role, and this was the first and was a great job. Same Martin as Turner and Grandma. The rest of the cast was ok, some skills were needed, but it was still ok to watch and learn what to do and what not to do in acting (or any job really). One star for the effort here too.\r\n\r\nMusic: It was needed in most of the times, no matter what. Is not the best part either, but it needs ONE star for the effort of the musicians behind the score, and those who tried to make the rap sound good and pop-ish...I don't like rap by the way.\r\n\r\nTo end this review, 3 stars of 5. Enjoy and HASTA LA PROXIMA AMIGOS/AS! CHAO! BLESS YOU ALL ALWAYS!",

I like the part where the father tells his son your name will be now known as 'Charmaine Daisy Pears'. The son, played by Brandon can rap and sing. He's good. There was a duet featured for a few moments. Brandon acted both the big momma's son and a rapper that dates this girl from school. He cant control his excitement as he enters a girl's school and live in a girls dorm. He is dressed in a girl's suit and has to speak and think the way a girl should. He gave himself during the performance on stage with the girl doing a duet. But the further truth was revealed when it was realised that big momma's undercover as ladies were to investigate the stolen information that would expose some crime. Watch it and have a good laugh. 4/5",

Jackson, Jessica Lucas, Henri Lubatti, Lorenzo Pisoni, Tony Curran, Marc John Jefferies, Brandon Gill, Zack Mines, Trey Lindsey, Ken Jeong, Max Casella, Susan Walters, Sherri Shepherd, Susan Griffiths, Brianne Gould, Dawntavia Bullard, Mari Morrow, Susie Spear, Lily Chambers, Jasmine Burke, Juliet Kim, Brian Lafontaine, Ramsey Luke, Jazmia Battle, Christiani Pitts, Faizon Love, Ana Ortiz, Michelle Ang, Emily Rios, Portia Doubleday.\r\nClasificación: B-13\r\nDuración: 1 hr. 47 min. \r\nDirector: John Whitesell \r\n\r\nFecha de estreno: 18 de febrero del 2011 \r\n\r\nEl equivalente opuesto de la saga de \"Miss simpatía\" está de vuelta solo que menos gracioso y sobre todo menos \"agradable a la vista\" por así decirlo. Y yo tuve a mal verla ¿Por qué? ¿Por qué vi esto en lugar de \"El cisne negro\" o \"Rango\" o \"Soy el numero cuatro\" que fueron las primeras opciones que tenía en mente cuando fui al cine, solo diré que cosas pasaron y yo por mera resignación tuve al final que aventarme casi dos horas de esta... película, dios debo amar demasiado el cine para escribir una reseña advertencia de esta...(Suspiro) película, aunque me cueste admitirlo le digo así por mero formalismo, pues aquí entre nosotros la película tiene la calidad de un infomercial barato. Pero que se podía esperar si no había material suficiente de las dos anteriores para rescatarla, si sinceramente no han sido de lo mejor que he visto en cuanto a comedias se refiere, pero no estoy molesto si este tipo de cintas son lo que uno se espera, comedia de pastelazo e historia y llena de recursos narrativos baratos, y para ejemplo el retiro espiritual al que enviaron a su esposa Sherry a fin de justificar su ausencia en la historia, pero se les olvidó un detalle: ¿Dónde quedó su hijo sanguíneo? Hasta dónde puedo recordar no mencionaron que su madre se lo hubiera llevado, en fin de la historia ya no hablemos mas o cometeré el descaro de revelar más inconsistencias en esta, entre las pocas sorpresas que tiene aunque haciendo uso de las pocas neuronas que me quedan después de verla pienso que no hay. Véanla si ya se han visto toda la cartelera y no tengan nada mejor que hacer.\r\nY ya para concluir se nota el gran trabajo para transformar a Martin otra vez en una señora gorda y a su coestelar en una jovencita muy robusta, seguramente un trabajo de horas de maquillaje que en la película lo hacen parecer como si solo se cambiaran de ropa y ya. Además temí que esa cancioncita pegajosa que pusieron en esta película la tendría en la cabeza todo el día pero afortunadamente se me olvido a los 15 minutos de haber salido de la sala como seguramente se me va a olvidar esta película en un lapso de tres días cuando mucho.\r\n\r\nCalificación: 2 estrellas y media",

Martin is an actor that has refuse to develop, same style, same lame style. The movie gets crappier as the time rolls by then Faizon Love comes in and outclasses everyone, in the whole movie, he was the only person in the movie that actually acted while the others ran around.",

            "content": "Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son is the third in the Big Momma's House series. I love the first two Big Momma's House movies and when I heard a third one was announced I was excited. The film is about FBI agent Malcolm Turner who needs to get into a Performing Arts school to retrieve a flash drive containing evidence of crimes a group had committed. At the same time his step-son Trent witnessed a murder committed by this group so Malcolm has to dress up as Big Momma & Trent also has to dress up as a girl and they go under-cover inside the school trying to retrieve this flash drive. The film was very disappointing. The film was given 6% here on Rotten Tomatoes but my friends said it was good. The film was very different to the previous two which is why it is just called Big Mommas not Big Momma's House. The film stretches out a small story into a big film just like Tron Legacy did. The gags were only funny to little kids which is such a shame to see the series stoop down to family movies. The film started to become really boring and I didn't care for any of the characters. I think Martin Lawrence gave a good performance like in the previous two but Brandon T. Jackson gave a very unreal performance. I hope if they make a fourth film it will be nowhere near as shit as this film was I give it a 1/10",
