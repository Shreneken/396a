            "content": "This movie was certainly meant to be light, silly and fun, it's obvious just watching the film, and in a way the movie does fulfill its purpose, but it's still, to me, just an average film at best.  The movie focuses on three sisters and their respective love lives and because of that, there really isn't a lot of time to develop each relationship to where it feels fully developed or, really, all that interesting.  I think the one that is the highlight is Lily's segment, because at least she had an obstacle that she needed to overcome to achieve real happiness.  The other two, I don't really understand what they were trying to achieve.  Not that any of it was bad, it's decent at best and it's got an energetic cast but its characters aren't as well developed as they would've been if each sister had their own movie.  Not that I think three separate movies would've been any better, I think it would've stretched things out to an unimaginable degree, so perhaps it's for the best that the movie ended up this way.  I'm sure its intended audience will certainly enjoy it.  And I did too, to a certain point.  It ended up being better than a lot of Asian romantic comedies I've seen, since it doesn't become a melodrama at any point, so it gets points for that.  But the rest of it is average and stuff you've seen elsewhere, and I can't think of anything that this movie does better than others.  It is satisfied with not re-inventing the wheel, and I don't have much of a problem with that even if the film isn't good.",

            "content": "Three not related love stories of three sisters form the backbone of this star-studded movie from Hong Kong. Many actors/actress would be immediately recognized by movie-goers with an interest in Asian pop culture. The stories were rather ordinary. The one where a movie star fell in love with a young watermelon seller was very sappy yet romantic. The one where two astronauts with a history was interesting but due to needing to jump around the stories, has a very interupted pace. The one where a rubbish collector dated a painter-want-to-be with OCD was quite old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nI just can't see myself brining this movie into the \"not-rotten\" category.",
