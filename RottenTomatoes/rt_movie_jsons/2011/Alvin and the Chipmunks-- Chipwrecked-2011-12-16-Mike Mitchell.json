    "summary": "Dave Seville (Jason Lee), the Chipmunks (Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney) and the Chipettes are taking a luxury cruise to the International Music Awards. Of course, Alvin cannot resist the urge to create havoc, and the singing rodents soon find themselves marooned on a seemingly deserted island. While Dave and an unlikely ally launch a search, Alvin and company discover that they are not alone on the island, as they first thought.",

            "content": "Honestly this entire franchise is so underrated like the tomato meter for this movie isn't deserved. When I watch these movies I'm never bored and the plot has something to do with each character's personality like Alvin wants his family to be respected even he doesn't show that very much, Simon is in love with Jannette and really wants to fit in but he's  easy to be picked on, and Theodore is DEATHLY AFRAID OF EAGLES! He shows this fear due to Toby telling him his family would die if an eagle picked up the chipmunks accidentally scaring him. Theodore becomes obsessed with meerkats and thinks that he should live with meerkats due to him being body shamed and thinks he doesn't fit in. Brittany is a great character because she shows she cares about her sisters and believes no one should be a lead but all of them are lead singers but Ian doesn't approve and influences her to be a leader practically forcing her to be a lead singer. Overall this movie didn't deserve the ratings it got. Alvin the Chipmunks: the Squeakquel was not a hidden gem but a hidden diamond. I think that since this movie was made for kids critics didn't really pay attention to the movie and gave it a bad rating because it's Alvin and the Chipmunks. You can really see how hard people worked on this movie just for people to say it's bad and walk away.",

I never saw these movies in a long time, like other people, i either seemed to like or hate this movie along with other Chipmunks flicks. I'm not saying i like nor hate any of these movies, but i feel like i should move on from Alvin And The Chipmunks. Not their Christmas song, i like it, but the films i should possibly move on from.

It was also brilliantly written by Glenn Berger & Jonathan Aibel. \nAs with all the previous movies, the performances really need to improve. I also hate when Jason Lee (Dave) yells. It sounds really cheesy. I don't think this sequel was as good as the first movie (Mainly because it was a bit boring), but it was ok. After all, it did end with a pretty catchy song!\nSo overall, this was an ok movie with some unique messages to offer. :)",

The 1st one should be the best, the 2nd is not that great, but the third redeems itself. Truly, this movie failed that idea of trilogy's. \n\nWhen I first watched this, I was surprised to see how quickly the movie got. I understand that the ship was important, but I felt like their was no true dynamic as to why out of all things it needed to be a ship. I understand that the movie was built for kids, but there's many other kid movies out there like \"Despicable Me\" and \"The Lego Movie\" that were great for all ages. The plot became so week as soon as they got on the island that I fast-forward until the end, seeing that was truly nothing special and very predictable. The chipmunks although are always a pleasure to see, but when the story is predictable, then the movie just fails. \n\nKnowing that Chris Miller from \"The Lego Movie\" will be working on the next installment of the series makes me feel really confident that the movies will be back on track as to how good the first movie was. \n\nF",

The soundtrack is entertaining, with mash ups combining songs you would've never imagined would go together. Who would've ever thought in 2011, Gloria Estefan's Conga would be remixed with a remixed version of an old Italian song? In this movie we watch the Chipmunks stranded on an island. Granted the things they construct out of bamboo and coconuts make Gilligan's Island seem realistic--but then again, this is a movie about a man who is raising six talking chipmunks as children. They even pay homage to \"Cast Away\" (2000). Simon's transformation into \"Simone\" is entertaining, but was this perhaps an attempt at competing with \"Puss 'n boots\" (2011)? Interesting nonetheless. This movie is fun to watch.",

            "content": "My name is Anthony Aranda from Kids First!  and I am reviewing a really funny movie called \u00e2Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.\u00e2? This was awesome because there is a lot of action in the movie and everything the chipmunks and Chipettes do is so funny.\nThis movie is all about Dave, the chipmunks, and the Chipettes who go on vacation and have a really big adventure. They go on a cruise ship and Alvin keeps causing lots of trouble on the ship (like always). Alvin comes up with a really great idea to fly on top of a kite. All of the chipmunks and Chipettes are holding the kite while Alvin is flying but the wind picks up too hard. They start to fly away and Simon tries to help by tying the kite to Dave\u00e2(TM)s chair (while he is sleeping). This still doesn\u00e2(TM)t work and the chair and the chipmunks start to move down the deck of the ship. Eventually, the kite slips off the chair and the chair flips over. Dave wakes up to see the chipmunks and the Chipettes fly away on the kite.\nSome of the main characters in the movie are Dave, the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon, and Theodore), the Chipettes (Eleanor, Jeanette, and Brittany), Zoe, and Ian. My favorite character is Alvin because he is always having fun and causing lots of trouble. I also like him because in the end he learns that he can still have fun while being responsible.\nMy favorite part in the movie is when the chipmunks and Chipettes meet Zoe on the stranded island. She invites them to meet her friends and when they get there they see that her friends are a bunch of sports balls.  It\u00e2(TM)s really funny because it seems like she is a little crazy since she has been on the island for so long. We figure out later that there are spiders on the island that change a person\u00e2(TM)s personality and make them act differently. Later in the movie Simon gets bit by one of the spiders and then he starts acting like someone else. It is really funny. \nI would recommend this movie for all ages because it is super funny and there was no violence or parts that would scare anyone. It also shows how much family means and that most families would do anything for each other.",

When Alvin's fun turns into fail, he and the other five menaces to society end up on a desert island and their adoptive father Dave (Jason Lee) and arch nemesis Ian Hawke (David Cross) looking for them, for opposite reasons, obviously.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering through the first two \"munkin'\" annoying pictures, I cringed at the first feeling of renting this one, but I did and I want my money back. Honestly, how could any human being actually LIKE this franchise. It boggles the munkin' mind.\r\n\r\nI admit that at first Alvin, Simon and Theodore were cute in the first movie, but they went from cute, to tolerable, to completely annoying. I'd like to see a fourth movie... when they get rabies and die.\r\n\r\nBut I commend the series for being consistent... consistently sucking! The actors suck, the visuals suck, all but two jokes in the entire franchise (two of which are in the third movie) suck and of course kids everywhere will think that this movie sucks.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about this movie was... it ended.\r\n\r\n1/2 out of ****\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 5%",

There are moments of chuckles but they are few and far between but this movie is for kids, not sure how gambling is suppose to go down with kids though. These movies need to be taken with the kids in mind but I don't know how many times you can sit through the songs with the high pitched voices, I would aim for something from Pixar if you are trying to please the kids and keep your sanity.",

I admit that I wasn't watching the clock to see how much longer it was going to last, but the sets were pathetic while the Zoe character had perfect clothes and hair, even though we were supposed to believe she had been alone on an uninhabited island for ten years. In fact, Chipwrecked regularly and repeatedly insulted my intelligence, and that's my biggest beef with it.  Nevertheless, my nine-year-old loved it.  My twelve-year-old also found it entertaining, but I suspect her real interest was in making me watch it and proving (which she did) that it's actually better than the first one.\r\n\r\nThat's true, but that's not saying much.",
