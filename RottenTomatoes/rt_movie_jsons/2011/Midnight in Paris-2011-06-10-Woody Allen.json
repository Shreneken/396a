    "summary": "Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter and aspiring novelist. Vacationing in Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams), he has taken to touring the city alone. On one such late-night excursion, Gil encounters a group of strange -- yet familiar -- revelers, who sweep him along, apparently back in time, for a night with some of the Jazz Age's icons of art and literature. The more time Gil spends with these cultural heroes of the past, the more dissatisfied he becomes with the present.",

            "content": "It's easy to catalogue an Allen's movie trivial or too easy. Many critics, year after year, continue to underline this aspect in what he creates. But, in my small opinon, I believe that his films look similar because they have the same magic, the same love for cinema, music and art. Every Allen movie is a joy for our heart due to his ability to explore every possible human relation and relationship in a thoughtless, comic and romantic way. Moreover, he adds to the plot thoughts about dead, religion and sense of life and these elements make his films unique. And Midnight in Paris follows this track through a time travel in the Paris of 1920; the main character, Gil Pender (Clive Owen), is a screenwriter who is trying to find the inspiration for a novel; he is there with his rich girlfriend, Inez (Rachel Mc Adams), and her parents; while he is walking alone through the streets, midnight arrives and with it a Peugeout directly from the Twenties stops in front of him in a little square. It will be the beginning of a journey that explores the Paris of the past and all the artists of the \"lost generation\" who were his source of inspiration: Picasso, Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dali, Cole Porter and many others. Amid them he will meet Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Suspended between present and past, he will understand a little more about himself and his ambitions. \nAbsolute must-see.",

            "content": "Much like Woody Allen's Manhattan, an affectionate nod to New York, Midnight in Paris is a love letter to Paris, even opening with a Manhattan-like montage of the City of Lights.  Budding American novelist Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) finds himself in love with and inspired by the city, having more in common with the cityscape than with his bride-to-be (Rachel McAdams).  Longing with nostalgia for the Jazz Age of the 1920s, he soon finds himself transported nightly to the world of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein.  It's an inventive and inspiring film about love, inspiration, art, and the fact that, despite the charm of nostalgia, the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Late in his career, Allen again proves that he is able to make movies that resonate emotionally.",

Blue Jasmine (2013) bagged Cate Blanchett a fully deserving Oscar for her performance, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) was a European hopping flight of fancy which I really enjoyed, and Match Point (2005) was Allen nearing his darkly comedic best. Midnight In Paris is my favourite Allen film. It's easy to identify with Owen Wilson's Gil, a writer whose love of nostalgia and the past is as affecting as it is understandable, whilst his fianc\u00e9 Inez (Rachel McAdams) is left frequently exasperated and baffled by his want to walk through Paris in the rain, or more importantly, his mysterious midnight walks through the city. These walks become the story itself, Gil somehow finds himself in 1920's Paris each night, drinking and dancing among his literary idles; Hemingway and Fitzgerald to name but a couple. Midnight in Paris is light, warm hearted, frequently funny and beautifully judged, leaving anyone who indulges in nostalgia yearning to be Gil's position, whether it be real or not.",

I really feel like Paris was captured with the cinematography and color wash (though the montage at the beginning of all the grandiose set pieces was a little too long for my impatient American taste). In that respect, this was a gorgeous film... the long, lingering, uninterrupted shots tell me that Woody Allen intended to create a work of art with this film. And visually, yes, absolutely. The acting was pretty good-Rachel McAdams and Kurt Fuller especially are both just so likable, and the 1920s historical figures were each interesting interpretations of how history has led us to believe.\n\nThe story, however, was a mess. I'm not going to try to nitpick the confusing logic of the time travel-clearly, the intent was that Paris as an entity is magical in and of itself-but my chief issue with the story is that I could not sympathize with Owen Wilson in this film and that really did make the whole thing so difficult to get on board with, since he's the protagonist. I think the issue here is that the characters weren't developed enough, I didn't find the real reason to get on board with Wilson's desire to drop his lucrative career in Hollywood to live in Paris. It's a shame, really, because this film is so gorgeous and deliberate. I wish the script had been up to the standard set by the rest of the film.",

Owen Wilson plays plays soul-searching Gilbert (possibly a surrogate for Woody Allen). He's a successful Hollywood hack who is aspiring to become a novelist with plenty of self-doubt.  He's in Paris with his bossy fianc\u00e9e Inez (played well by Rachel McAdams). But he loves Paris and she doesn't.\n\nGil's love for Paris has him wishing he lived in the Golden Age of Paris (1920s). He decides to walk back from the restaurant and at midnight. Resting on stone steps, he mysteriously jumps back in time 100 year.  Here he meets many Artistic characters from the turn of the 19th century (1920s and 1890s) including Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Cocteau, Dali, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Man Ray, Luis Bunuel, and more. And here he meets his enchantress Adriana (played by Marion Cotillard) and they wove together a tale of inspiration, love, and meaning. \n\nIt's hard to tell if this is a comedy, romance, historical, or science fiction, and the blend makes for an intriguing tale.

Breathtaking visuals and wonderful writing work in tandem in order to generate this effect. Certainly, the view of Paris stands a bit whitewashed and faultily romanticised, with only one upper-class, naive perspective of the city ever offered. Although Midnight in Paris succeeds based off of feeding into this natural wave of sentiment, the idea of trotting across historical eras and witnessing nonstop beauty in France scene after scene with waves of beautiful, friendly French women and a plethora of celebrities requires no small amount of blissful ignorance. Owen Wilson's delivery failed to completely win me over, but the talented supporters in Cotillard and Hiddleston among other do well. McAdams was also quite good in a limited, antagonistical role. The attempt to weave a message into the film's conclusion falls a bit short from the journey of the protagonist, but it is wisdom that everywhere is more beautiful in the rain.",

Although, even the star cast doesn't save the movie from being one of the most boring rom-coms I have seen. I adore Woody Allen and have seen many of his films, but this one does not have his humor. Jokes and situations are way to silly and, to that, they are not funny and also unrelatable. It felt like I was watching a domestic drama with people trying to act like idiots, although I was not. The film is very forgettable, which I feel ashamed for, as I had a lot of people who told me that the film is hilarious and is a feel-good one. I can agree on the last argument, as it actually finishes off with you only having positive emotions, but there is no suspense or climax in the picture. There is no conflict to entertain enough, which doesn't add up to a good film structure. As well as that, the ending is very rushed, illogical and boring, as you could see it coming from like the first 10 minutes of the movie. It would be a 6/10 from me, as I understand some people might find some jokes fun, there are amazing actors and there are some great shots, but as a rom com it fails to entertain, which is what a rom com should do.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is one of the most respected individuals in the world of movie making.  And that's with good reason.  But in his new movie, Midnight in Paris, one can't help but wonder if Allen has perhaps lost some of his credibility.  While not a terrible movie, the whole thing comes across as little more than a niche film that would appeal only to a certain audience.  This leads it to be one of the more forgettable movies from 2011.\n\nThe story does a good job setting the scene as it begins.  The combined use of music and picturesque scenes of Paris let audiences know the general feel of the story will be laid back.  The problems start not long after, though.  While the story does a good job setting the feel and scene, it does little to nothing to grab the average viewer's attention, and pull him/her in.  The problems continue from then on.  As Gill (Owen Wilson) goes back and forth in time, the movie loses its identity, and becomes little more than a literary ripoff of Night at The Museum, and perhaps Serendipity, or even My Life in Ruins.  The comparisons rise from Gill meeting his literary heroes in his travels back to the \"better days\" of expatriats and psuedo-intellectuals.\n\nAs uninteresting as Midnight in Paris turns out to be in the long run, it has one saving grace.  That single positive lies in the acting of Owen Wilson.  Wilson is no stranger to romantic comedies, with roles in the likes of Meet The Fockers, Little Fockers, Wedding Crashers, and You, Me and Dupree.  So playing Gill was obviously old hat for him.  At the same time, though, playing Gill allowed Wilson to branch out a little bit, too.  It was a different role than those he played in his previous rom-coms and screwball comedies (alongside buddy Ben Stiller).  If not for Wilson's acting, Midnight in Paris would have been completely in the dark.  And yes, that bad pun was intended.  One can't help but wonder if [Woody] Allen intentionally made Gill something of a mirror image of himself.  That's because Gill definitely seemed to come across as the stereotyped caricature of Allen.\n\nWilson's acting is the one major positive to Midnight in Paris.  Sure there's beautiful scenery and classic music that creates the intended feeling of nostalgia.  But at the same time that they get the job done, what they also do is create a sense of snobbery.  In layman's terms, it makes the story feel above the heads of average audiences.  What that does is create the urge to hit the fast forward button on their remotes.  And as with so many other movies, those who actually follow through can't be blamed. \n\nThe dvd's bonus features do little to help save the overall viewing experience.  Whether on the dvd or blu-ray, the bonus features included on both formats are identical.  Both offer a short feature titled, \"Midnight in Cannes\".  The blu-ray includes the standard photo gallery that nearly every dvd and blu-ray carries.  It simply is no motivation to buy the movie.  The bonus features and semi-elitist vibe presented in Midnight in Paris makes it anything but accessible to general audiences.  It does boast a relatively simple story, though.  Considering that, and Owen Wilson's acting, it is a movie that's worth at least one watch, even though it will likely fade into the twilight of movie history.",

It's one of the most enjoyable and lighthearted movies of that year or even of the decade and I really loved it. You can tell this comes from Allen's heart and he is, most likely, infatuated with Paris as well. After this movie I must say I felt it too. One can only be amazed as the camera drools over the streets, landmarks and Paris' livelihood. At an hour and 30 minutes the runtime apsolutely flies by due to fantastic pacing and engaging dialogue. Owen Wilson is one of the most likable guys working right now and he portrayed his character perfectly. Of all the famous actors playing famous people I'd say the standout here is Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway whose personality really comes through in the performance. I'd say the historical figures lack a bit of subltety and are a bit on the nose with how we might now imagine them but I think some of it actually added to the film's charm. The ending I also liked, it's a bit cliched but not so much that I wouldn't enjoy it and it's still brings the story to a nice close. It's a great story about sentimentality and nostalgia and I found it to be extremely watchable. It's a 4.5 for me.",

            "content": "I was rather surprised when going into this at the fact that this was considered one of Woody Allen's best films, or at least one of his best of the 21st century. I found that like most lesser Allen films there were most that were funny and genuinely inspired littered in amongst moments that didn't quite work and character beats that seemed off. I mostly enjoyed watching the film but the amount of praise it received seemed over the top and I would hardly call it one of the best written films of 2011 when Young Adult (2011) and Margaret (2011) were released in the same year.\n\nGil Pender, Owen Wilson, travels with his fianc\u00e9e Ines, Rachel McAdams, to Paris in modern day as Pender attempts to find some inspiration in order to write a new screenplay or book. He is annoyed by the falseness around him as he daydreams about being able to travel back in time to the 1920s and being able to meet famed artists. One night, after fighting with Ines he is able to time travel by entering a mysterious car at midnight. He meets F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom Hiddleston, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Adrien Brody, Gertrude Stein, Kathy Bates, Ernest Hemingway, Corey Stoll, in addition to falling for professional muse Adriana, Marion Cotillard. He encounters many problems as he tries to stay in the 1920s and feels conflicted over his own artistic ideas but Adriana reveals her own similar desires he recognizes how shallow his own are and returns to the present to try to sort out his life as it is.\n\nI appreciate the final message of the film as we have all been frustrated by the holier than thou hipster who feels like they would fit in better in another era because they have fetishistic worship of the art produced back then. The revelation is also revealed sweetly as we see a man who has been blaming the world and others for his problems realize that others, even if they are beautiful, have the same foolish hopes and desires that will never be fulfilled. The ending of the film puts the kibosh on me really being satisfied with the message of the film as we see Pender \u2018rewarded' for growing up only slightly by an overly eager Lea Seydoux who could surely do better than a middle aged Wilson. Allen is often very good at dropping in an intellectual message towards the end of his films but this film doesn't fold it into a delightful comedy in the way that Annie Hall (1977) or Zelig (1983) do.\n\nA lot of fun can also be extracted out of the cameos of super famous actors as famed historical figures. Much like The Aviator (2004) this can often feel jarring but you can see some of the actors really chewing the scenery as Brody in particular goes for broke as a hammed up Dal\u00ed. Beyond the moments at which we meet all of these people however it can feel tiresome going through scenes of light jokes being passed around as Allen makes self aware references to The Exterminating Angel (1962). The humor isn't as pointed or undeniably funny as it is in Allen's best and while you have a pleasant time during these periods in the film, they fill up a significant amount of screen time, you don't walk away thinking about them and they can make the film feel rather aimless. The humor also felt very pleased with itself as there wasn't the seamless transition between near surrealism and observational comedy that Allen is usually able to achieve and it sometimes felt like he was scraping the bottom of the barrel with the material that made it to the final draft of the screenplay.\n\nContrary to the opinion of some critics this is not one of the better Allen films nor is it even his best of the 2010s as I believe that Blue Jasmine (2013) is markedly superior. If you want to see truly great Allen watch Annie Hall, Interiors (1978), Manhattan (1979), Love and Death (1975), September (1987), Husbands and Wives (1992) or any of the array of other superior films that Allen has written and directed over the last 53 years.",

The storytelling is very creative and fantastical and yet it very much still feels real and relatable, as if we too  could meet Fitzgerald and Hemingway at midnight! After all that great stuff though, I was really put off by that quarrel scene and when Gil walks off with Lea Seydoux, both of which felt really lazy.

While Owen Wilson doesn't stretch much as an actor, he plays \"Owen Wilson\" perfectly and, thus, is the perfect cast as Gil, a screenwriter who makes the leap to novels, yet doesn't have the self-confidence to fulfill his potential. Through a series of midnight, time-traveling trists, Gil meets his artistic idols, from literary giants Hemingway and Fitzgerald, to painters Matisse and Salvador Dali, who all, through almost dream-like inspiration, allow him to clarify his own reality. \"Paris\" is so perfectly-written that it is almost unfair to others nominated for screenplays this year. At this writing, \"Hugo\" is the only Best Pic nominee I've not seen and, so far, \"Paris\" only slightly surpasses \"My Week with Marilyn,\" even though the latter has stronger individual performances.

Although overstated, the movie's opinion on nostalgia and accepting the past, but living in the present for the future, is a good theme. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is better and although they are similar, Midnight In Paris is unique enough. 3/5 on my first review \nUpon a rewatch, it's themes are very instrumental when observing other artwork and literature.

As a writer, Gil (Owen Wilson) sees Paris in the 1920s as the best era for him. Somehow, he travels back in that time and encounters famous poets, artist and writers that he admires and ponders about his existence with them. The best part of the movie was how he keeps traveling back and forth into the past and present and create some conflicts that occur between his present life and his past life. Woody Allen likes to create romantic bonds between characters that don't seem to fit each other externally. But usually, he points out some romantic connection with characters internally. It is the same in this movie. But instead of looking at it from an age difference or culture difference, it is seen through time difference. I like how the pace in dialogue changes when Gil is in the present time versus how he is in the past. Even in color the president puts out more of a bland light touch compared to a soft yellow in the past. The third act got bland and most of the themes become clich\u00e9 and it wasn't insightful as to the first and second act. Overall good film to watch if your a fan of the surrealist era.",

Owen is our stupefied, dumbstruck, hero who we get to live vicariously through. The wonderment and astounding discoveries he makes give  this film a classic classy feel. Where do dreamers go when they get lost in Paris at midnight? Turns out it's even better than anyone could have imagined, and dammit I wish I could go there myself.

A literal nostalgia trip, set in a city famed for its past glories, Owen Wilson finds himself slipping into the world of yesteryear, discovering what it's like to live your dreams, and how their reality can often be just as disillusioning as living in a mundane present. Allen not-so-subtly employs Wilson as a vicarious vessel, allowing him to act out all the typical Allen traits: Social awkwardness, constant worrying, inexplicably gorgeous love interest, rambling dialogue. The writing displays his usual strengths and weaknesses. It's sharp, funny and well observed, but is frequently excessive and directionless. The time-travel conceit is used brilliantly, and it's great to see icons from the past interacting with our modern-day hero. Hemingway is especially good, acting exactly how you'd imagine him: Macho, highly competitive but self-loathing and likely very insecure. I've never been a big Owen Wilson fan but he's easily likable here, at least when's he not blabbing on and on about his own shortcomings, especially when he whispers them when nobody is in a position to overhear him. The support cast are fun too, especially Marion Cottilard, who is so vibrant and graceful, illuminating the screen whenever she's on camera. It has its flaws, but it takes an interesting premise and instils it with warmth, humour and heart. As a wannabe writer myself, I understand the need to have others read your work but the reluctance to do so for fear of criticism and outright rejection. Midnight In Paris is a trip down memory lane that you'll be glad you've taken.",

The story conveys tenderness, humor, and love at all times, and the handling and complexity of the dialogues ensure that the story is directed to those who already have previous knowledge of outstanding writers of the early twentieth century. Full of purity and magic, the film is intent on capturing a series of dreams, which carry us and make us pursue with more force what is desired. It is not perfect, however, it is already one of my favorites. Allen knows what he does, in his dialogues, in his personal projections and perspectives, and all of this is achieved through a graceful, ingenious and enlightening plot that, although it can or not be of the style of everybody, it must be observed with attention and must be felt with the mere face of a young, dreamy and passionate thought for the arts and for the desires we long for. 94/100",

It simply gives too much away and throwing in engagement guarantees infidelity. Why could it not have been a single man, a writer, who gets lost in the soul of Paris and finds love? Why not? Tell me! The stakes can be just as high. His character is a romantic, Paris is Paris, and the fantastical elements in the movie are winning to say the least. Travelling back to meet the giants of literature and art along with their less famous secrets and flings is a brilliant journey for a soul-searching writer. Add the talents of Woody Allen and a delightful cast and the movie is quite charming and easily scoops you up into a fantasy that makes you yearn for richer and simpler times yet reminds you that the present is a gift and should never be wasted. We can use the gift of the time we have to leave our mark on the world in ways that serve others.",

Free candy!  I grabbed a handful and looked through the computer to see if there were any movies I wanted to rent (also to validate my coming up there and taking candy).  I had nothing in mind, but the librarian was right there and very friendly as always.  I had been feeling pretty down in the dumps, and so I asked for an uplifting, feel-good movie, and this is the one he brought out.  It did not disappoint, Midnight In Paris was wonderful, thoughtful, funny; a feel-good movie for sure!",

What also makes this film great is the cast. Wilson is Allen in this film. The wit, charm, and neurosis of Allen in Annie Hall is re-embodied in Wilson during this film. While the film could have easily been transformed into a drama, which is probably what most directors would do with this film, it isn't.

Then stars like Kathy Bates, Marion Cottilard, Adrien Brody, Tom Hiddleston, steal the show when they showup as classic legend painters, writers, etc. And like most Allen films, ''Midnight in Paris'' is yet again clearly inspired by Allen himself and his beliefs, dreams and hopes.\n\n''Midnight in Paris''  is a movie i could rewatch a hundred times and still feel delighted with a big smile on my face after seeing it.",

            "content": "Filming Midnight in Paris was probably the most fun Woody Allen's ever had. His joy is evident from the moment the film begins to the moment it ends, and the film is so quintessentially him that I can't believe it took this long for him to make it. He's clearly been inspired by the City of Lights, and it's not hard to see why. Just as Manhattan was a love letter to the titular New York borough, Midnight in Paris is as picturesque as a postcard, and every line of dialogue drips with enthusiasm toward the beautiful French city. But what of the story? Well, it's more fun than anything this year, but best left a mystery. Allen detractors might find something to dismiss, but his fans-like me-will rejoice, for Woody is back, and honestly, he's as good as ever.\n\nGil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood writer who's sick of churning out hack screenplays, so he tries his hand at a novel. Struggling to find inspiration, he travels with his fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and her family to Paris. There, his worst nightmare comes true. He's forced to spend the trip in the company of Paul (Michael Sheen), a \"pedantic psuedo-intellectual\" who seems to have an opinion about anything and everything. Gil is in hell. He can't take these people and their nonsense. He just wants to escape and enjoy the quaint Paris of old, where his favorite artists, such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein, Picasso, and Bunuel, dwelled and created some of mankind's most treasured works of art. So one night, he jaunts off on his own, only to find himself lost. But it ends up being the best night of his life, and it's during these now nightly adventures that he finds the inspiration he was searching for, only its from some very surprising and unusual sources.\n\nNo further synopsis is necessary; The trailers were purposefully opaque because the film's chief pleasure is discovering the weird and wild world that is Paris after midnight. All I'm going to say is that the film takes a positively delightful turn every time the clock strikes midnight. Part of that fun is seeing the joy on Gil's face as he uncovers some of the city's stranger secrets. Another part relates to Adrianna (Marion Cotillard), an aspiring fashion designer who captures Gil's heart, as well as the hearts of some of Paris' most eligible-and brilliant-bachelors. The subtle romance between Gil and Adrianna is lovely and very reminiscent of some of Allen's best movie couples.\n\nOwen Wilson plays Gil (who would have been played by Allen himself had the film been made 20 years ago) excellently. He's got all the characteristics of a typical Allen male lead-neurotic and pessimistic, yet incredibly idealistic and a romantic at heart. He's a character we've seen before, but some combination of Wilson and Paris has led to a rejuvination of the archetype. Cotillard gives the film's other great performance, though that shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone. She's been so good in recent years-from her Oscar-winning work in La Vie en Rose to her brilliant supporting turn in last year's Inception-and she's exceptional once again. The role of Adrianna isn't her most challenging, but when it comes to pure charm and acting alluring, Cotillard can't be beat.\n\nIf I had one small complaint about the film it's that Inez, as well as her parents and friends, are one-dimensional and total shrews. It's something that's common among Allen's most recent films, and though I rarely condone sacrificing character to advance plot, I think it's somewhat acceptable here. The film is pure fantasy, so you never really take it too seriously. And had we felt bad for a scorned Inez, some of the film's fun would have been missing. Still, I wish there had been another way than to just make her seem insufferable, and because Allen doesn't take that route, the film loses a couple points.\n\nBut make no mistake, this is top-tier Woody Allen. Personally, none of his films will ever top Crimes and Misdemeanors, but as far as his comedic efforts go, this up is right up there with Annie Hall and Zelig, among others. In many ways, I think Midnight in Paris is actually a perfect summer movie. Sure, it doesn't have huge stars or superheroes, but it's light and breezy, and it manages to strike the perfect balance between whimsical comedy and tender romance-not to mention that it's shot and scored with magnificent care and attention to detail. Even if you don't care for Allen and his pictures, I implore you to give this one a shot. It's beautiful on so many levels, it's a ton of fun, and it represents a master on top of his game once again. How could you ask for anything more?\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/midnight-in-paris-review/",

Perhaps if I was a little more well-verse in the classic works, I might have been able to laugh a little more.

            "content": "So often we hear that Woody Allen is \"back to his best\" and that he is producing work that maybe even matches that of his critically acclaimed works decades ago, this movie I feel though does not match those claims. Take nothing away from this film, it is a good one and it is pretty fun with some well created characters and a witty script, it isn't however a great movie and that I feel is the least it has to be if it is to be considered one of Allen's best. The story is a fantasy basically and how a Hollywood screenwriter visiting Paris (although with hopes to live there one day) is whisked back and forth at the stroke of midnight into the 1920's, full of famous faces. \n\nThe film feels like it's Woody Allen not just from the pretty quirky story but just the music that is used, if you walked in on this film and had no idea what it was, the music I feel would show you it is one of Allen's. The film explores the Paris of the past that inspired the very best of writers, painters and entertainers and really brings at least a fresh story with it, one that is fairly un-generic as well. I don't think the movie excels massively in the comedy area but does have the odd good laugh and when most jokes are done they are smartly done, but not always though that laughable.\n\nOwen Wilson is Gil Pender the man who is travelling back, Wilson is pretty nice in the role and is extremely calm, I swear this is one of the most laid back acting performances ever. The cast is full of names like Michael Sheen, Kurt Fuller, Kathy Bates, and Marion Cotillard and also features Rachel McAdams who as Wilson's extremely annoying fianc\u00e9e is really hard to like, but acted well though. Allen brings together a cast that can seem randomly placed, new people arrive around every corner and some are just never seen again, Allen paces this pretty fast but does manage to slow it down when it needs to be at least.\n\nYou know Woody Allen doesn't do a bad job at all of directing and writing this but also at the same time doesn't make this fantastic, even with the nice fantasy element he fails to make this completely charming. There is no doubt Allen is considered one of the masters of the romantic comedy genre but here is no mastery, it is good work but is far from the level most expect of Allen, some may find this excellent but for me this is just straight good and no more. I don't think Allen makes mistakes but this I just feel is not made at a great enough quality as all.\n\nSo Midnight in Paris is a Woody Allen work that probably won't rank highly in his catalogue but is easily a welcome addition and is recommendable, and not only to the fans of the man in the directors chair. I think it's the kind of thing that all can enjoy and it doesn't focus so much on the romantic element that it becomes bogged down in it, it mixes the fantasy into it very well too so that the story becomes nicely balanced, oh and add a little comedy to that balancing act too.",

            "content": "\u00e2??\u00e2??Out Of The Past' was the name of the store, and its products consisted of memories: what was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp.\u00e2??\n \nAnd in a nutshell, nostalgia is made palpable as a sensation worth seeking for. Gil Pender, the author of whose first novel these lines reside, is a big-buck Hollywood screenwriter who yearns to prove himself as a talented author, and in trying to do so finds inspiration from the great writers of the past, a time in which he also wants to return to due to his love of the 1920s. And hold your horses because this wish has come true for Gil, as he becomes intertwined in a fantasy love story that can only come to fruition on some steps at midnight. A return to the 1920s is something Back To The Future could accomplish, or Hot Tub Time Machine, but not Midnight In Paris surely you must be thinking, but director Woody Allen\u00e2??s decision to never explain this fantasy elevates the film because its return to the past is nostalgic entertainment that, as Pender puts it, is enjoyable for our generation, and that satisfaction doesn\u00e2??t need to be explained. Yes, Gil might be insane, but if the surrealists of the 1920s believe he is a time traveller, there must be nothing strange right? And of that period of excessive hedonism and debauchery typified by the great artists of the early 20th century, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\u00c3\u00ad, Luis Bu\u00c3\u00b1uel, Man Ray, Gertrude Stein and more are revived. So why Paris? Well, there was a time when these artistic innovators all inhabited the streets of Paris, and by the look of the opening shots of seemingly every street and plaza in Paris, Allen is trying to get us in on the allure of such a timeless city that attracted such significant artists and inspire us like they were. I\u00e2??ve got to say I was enthused, for these performances and the script that crafted them for the big screen are just too unique to not relish and become nostalgically swayed. Comedic actor Owen Wilson\u00e2??s light-heartedness brings believability to the situation he\u00e2??s in, never overdoing the fantasy, but making it feel real. He embraces each moment with a performance so natural and everyday, the factual history of the film is given a righteous restoration. And of his colleagues, rude Rachel McAdams recaptures her Mean Girls form, Corey Stoll is simply a poetic loose canon as Hemingway, Marion Cotillard graciously drops into history and Adrien Brody is unassumingly barmy as surrealist Salvador Dal\u00c3\u00ad. In the end, seeing as Pender loves the 1920s, McAdams\u00e2?? Inez the materialistic modern day, and Cotillard\u00e2??s Adriana the 1890s, the revelation that the artists of La Belle \u00c3?poque choose the Renaissance to be the greatest period shows that you can\u00e2??t be stuck in the past, living in the present is the way to enjoy life and thrive. That\u00e2??s the message of Midnight In Paris, and it is a pretty weak one to be holding such a rich film together, but it is undeniably lovely. With Midnight In Paris, you either love it or completely not understand it, but never hate it because you can see the levels of uniqueness it delves into as well as the sweet bliss of its execution. It is a rare film that should be given the time of day by everyone, but so few shall, and those few are lucky enough to sample Woody Allen at his storytelling best.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nAbsolutely beautifully written and elevated by some fine work from Owen Wilson, Midnight In Paris\u00e2?? harking back to the past for inspiration raises nostalgia levels to the roof and finds Woody Allen doing what he does best.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??   10/10",

Not only their outlook but characters are well portrayed and enjoyable.\nRachel McAdams, who played cute and admirable wives in 'Time Traveller's Wife' and 'About Time', performs as a rich and disgusting wife. Instead, French actresses like Marion and L\u00e9a Seydoux play decent roles. Carla Bruni, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy's wife also takes part in as a museum guide.\nLike other Woody Allen's works, the screen writer of the main character is his shadow as well as his philosophy is reflected in advises by Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway.

Starting with short scenes of Paris streets, coffee shops and various landmarks. I was still loving it when the story starts to actually unfold with 'Gil' (Owen Wilson) a golden age idealist is transported to his favoured 20s and is in awe meeting - 'Fitzgerald', 'Hemingway' and Picaso' (Hiddleston, Stoll and Marcial Di Fonzo respectively). But then my interested started to waver.\n\nFor all the beautiful Paris settings and nicely crafted dialogue and the simply wonderful idea behind the film, there's no doubt it starts to falter. And this isn't because the film gradually becomes bad per se but it starts of (and quite far into the film too) so strongly that only 'Allen' of old would have kept this going. It's a strange view, granted but I got the nagging feeling that it was missing something and that the mystique and great idea was starting to wear thin.\n\nIt's in the present story It started to lose me and I think it's down to the two leads.  It's a weird one because I don't think either are bad but they don't across as believable as a couple. They don't fit in with the rest of the film - the choices for Hemingway, Picaso, Dali and Adrianna and pretty much everyone else all seem right yet 'Wilson' and 'McAdams' seem out of place. It's no secret Wilson's love of Allen it's their in his acting mannerisms but his delivery of rambling dialogue isn't nearly as effective - and unfortunately what this is crying out for isn't possible given the directors age.\n\nIt's very much Paris' film not only does it take 'Wilson' back to his preferred era it goes further once with 'Adrianna' who sees the 1890s in the same light and for a joke even further back with the lost detective. It's in a way a showcase for the era and something that Allen has drawn from.\n\nThere's no doubt 'Midnight In Paris' is good but that's as far as I'd go. It has the trademark 'Allen' dialogue - a mixture of bumbling and wit. The idea is simply fantastic but the inclusion of others into feels awkward and its end with Gil's sudden realisation and Adrianna's decision seem out of place for the rest of the film. It's a visual treat it's a shame it isn't quite there.",

There's nothing wrong in their act, it's just that, the two don't work in romantic themes of the movie.  McAdams was good here by playing semi-antagonist Inez. I think should blame the story and their characterization since their characters seems to be north and south pole type. But if you love Paris, then this movie is for you! Director, Woody Allen made sure that you won't just see, feel and live in Paris for this movie but love Paris in this movie. Every scene and places, the setting was made sure capture best places of interests of the city. Even the raining scenes was beautifully captured that you want to hop on the plane going to Paris. Aside from the beautiful shot of Paris, the film shows us a story of a man's love of living in a different era and thinking that is better to live in those era than the present to which his sanity is being questioned. But I think the movie is trying to show us the writer's side of Woody Allen and his adoration for the great writers like Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald.",

Following Gil and Inez -- he's an artistically unsatisfied Hollywood screenwriter and she's his incompatible fiance -- during their Paris vacation, Woody Allen blends his classic wit with some seductive fantasy to weave this delectable time-traveling tale. By some fantastical means, Gil (a wonderful Owen Wilson) finds himself transported to Paris in the 20's to meet some of his artistic heroes, including Ernest Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein, and an excessive Adrien Brody as Salvadore Dali. Eventually Gil comes to enjoy the fantasy more than his mundane reality, but when he meets a kindred spirit in the 20's who is also dissatisfied with her place in history, the problem becomes apparent. Deeply witty and undeniably charming, Midnight in Paris is easy viewing about the unfulfilling nature of perpetually looking back, and its an excursion I'll be sure to make again.",

However the film itself reminded me of an actual book in the way that its told with a strong plot and I really enjoyed the message. I think ppl like to romanticize things when they arent happy with the present about how great an old time was or if they just did this different with their life or if somehow theyd been born somewhere else....etc. In reality tho reality could probably be better esp if you are in a crappy relationship or bad job...but its never going to be perfect bc its life. I also liked with this movie how you never knew where it was going and I enjoyed the dark humor. One thing i didnt care for was so much name dropping of people from long ago-eventually it got old and took away from the film.

What I mean is that while we jump with Gil from scene to scene, frame to frame and soiree to soiree, we are also exposed to artistic integrity, being misunderstood, individual stories and intangible obsession.

While Owen Wilson doesn't stretch much as an actor, he plays \"Owen Wilson\" perfectly and, thus, is the perfect cast as Gil, a screenwriter who makes the leap to novels, yet doesn't have the self-confidence to fulfill his potential.  Through a series of midnight, time-traveling trists, Gil meets his artistic idols, from literary giants Hemingway and Fitzgerald, to painters Matisse and Salvador Dali, who all, through almost dream-like inspiration, allow him to clarify his own reality.  \"Paris\" is so perfectly-written that it is almost unfair to others nominated for screenplays this year.  At this writing, \"Hugo\" is the only Best Pic nominee I've not seen and, so far, \"Paris\" only slightly surpasses \"My Week with Marilyn,\" even though the latter has stronger individual performances.

Midnight in Paris is a pretty little confection, and what's truly weird, given the subject matter, is that Allen has managed to get Owen Wilson to channel Allen himself, and his female actors to channel Diane Keaton.

Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein and Salvador Dali. In the meantime, in true Allen style, he learns more about himself and his relationships and can eventually move forward with his own life.\n\nThe cast is impressive, with Wilson and McAdams joined by Marion Cotillard, Kurt Fuller, Michael Sheen, Tom Hiddleston, Kathy Bates, Lea Seydoux and Adrien Brody. It almost reads like a Wes Anderson cast, and if truth be told, at times, you felt this movie did belong to Anderson's filmography, showing the similarities between the two filmmakers' current style.\n\nIt's a very shallow film, though, while fun, engaging and gorgeous to look at, none of the revelations are too philosophical or unexpected. Still, there are plenty or worse ways to spend an evening than with this gem of a Woody Allen film.\n\n9.5/10",

The scenes set in the present day don't work as well for me, I think the characters are a little bit over the top. But the older scenes more than make up for it. Woody Allen does a great job of lighting and staging Paris in a way that you can't help but love it (even if you've been there like I have and don't love it). It also has a good underlying message about living in the present and appreciating what you have that really hits home once they go back to the 1800s.",

It is a charming and funny film, that works on it's simplicity.\n\nIt is wittily written, and perfectly paced.\n\nIt doesn't ever feel the need to go into unnecessary details over the science of the time travel, except that it's Paris. And it doesn't surprise them.\n\nThere is a romance to the film, even though there is not always a romance on the screen. The presence of Paris is enough, coupled with the orange ambience that fills every night scene. It oozes love and romance.\n\nThe performances are enjoyable to watch also. Owen Wilson reminded me that he can actually act, after watching one of his worst performances in 'The Internship'. There are also some fun cameos and supporting characters, such as Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali.\n\nThere is nothing that wrong with the film, except that it just didn't blow me away. But it didn't need to.\n\nIt is a brilliant piece of escapism. Woody Allen meets Back to the Future.\n\nAnd it works.",

This time, he grabs Paris, a city that has been used so many times in celluloid that it already sounds clich\u00e9... unless it is given the Woody Allen treatment.\n\nThe feature is an immediate charmer and has the capacity of attracting a wider audience than his regular target market. Even if the viewer requires a very basic knowledge on literature, architecture, cinema and painting to catch the numerous nods to the art forms of the first half of the 19th Century (cheers for the inclusion of Gauguin and Matisse), Midnight in Paris, unlike most of the previous cases, does not demand a prior familiarization with the director's character trademarks and nostalgic love letters to breathing and living cities and to the great minds of the past era that intellectually shaped contemporary society, even if those are patterns still seen here. On the contrary, the simplicity of the usage of fantasy mirrors Almod\u00f3var's Volver (2006): elegant and funny, but subtle.\n\nThe opening sequence could mean two things: the farewell of a great director, or a promise of even greater things to come during the following 90 minutes. Both assumptions turned out to be wrong. The force of the introduction had the same charisma that the one in Manhattan (1979), but it was more peaceful and had less energy. So, we were led to think that the intentions of the film were simpler then, but still with a scope large enough to capture a city and its important artistic figures.\n\nWell, in this case, not quite...\n\nAnalyzing the final product and comparing it with Woody Allen's entire trajectory, the film plays it safe, with a horrible miscast in the leading role, but with a very simple story easy to fall in love with, even if it is not, like stated in the beginning of this review, something revolutionary. Nevertheless, knowing that Woody is still capable of applying the same heart he has done before without losing his film signature is something that us, fans, find valuable.\n\n71/100",

            "content": "Woody Allen films have been rather hit and miss for me, but a friend of mine said that Midnight in Paris was excellent, and it won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay so it sounded good enough.\n\nMidnight in Paris was a little but slow and didn't have as much laughs as it could have, but Woody Allen's undeniable charm as a writer and director makes it an unforgettable treat. \nIt has such a fresh and original concept which explores themes of nostalgia and materialism, and even though there isn't a logical explanation behind the time travel premise it doesn't even matter because it's such a fun and comedic one which reveals information about the various generation gaps and how it is to have various figures from all of them in the same room at once.\nMidnight in Paris also covers its romantic comedy element very well since is about a man questioning his love and then falling for a woman from another time which really causes question to the male psyche within viewers. \nBut really, it's Woody Allen's screenplay that makes it intelligent. See, amid a high concept plot handled in a basic and character driven manner in Woody Allen's signature style are a lot of characters who instead of hiding behind the facade of a false human image decide to always say what is on their mind, and it provides audiences with an understanding of the real human mind of its adult figures. They're all open and it never makes the atmosphere feel awkward because that's what Woody Allen is about. But he doesn't stop there. I mean, the conclusion of the film is one of the most insightfully intelligent ones I've ever seen in such a quirky cinematic piece, and it causes us all to reflect on what the golden age really is and how instead of being unhappy that we missed it, to instead try to make today the golden age. For the right viewer, Midnight in Paris could be enlightening enough for the viewer to completely change their outlook on certain aspects of life. That's why Woody Allen deserves such immense praise for his spirited direction and insightful screenplay.\nThe musical score is also great because it's atmospherically setting to Paris itself and has a certain sense of serenity, life, love and mystery all at once, and it matches the excellent scenery shot by the beautiful cinematography which gives audiences a true experience of what it is to be in Paris, and it ensures that the gentle pace is matched with some beautiful sights.\nAnd of course, the cast is just perfect.\nOwen Wilson is faced with a very exceptional challenge in Midnight in Paris, because his character Gil Pender is written for a young Woody Allen, and he needs to be able to capture that charisma to succeed. Without skipping a heartbeat he does. Although his sort of social awkwardness is different to Woody Allen's, it's still strongly convincing since he maintains a more sophisticated stature than in his usual comedy films where he portrays a similarly awkward character. Owen Wilson is a great lead in Midnight in Paris, and in what feels like a routine effort he pulls off one of the best performances of his career.\nRachel McAdams gives a great supporting performance because at the same time as being incredibly attractive she manages to capture the stuck up and materialistic attitude that is ideal to the characterisation of Inez. Her attractiveness gives us an understanding of why Gil Pender can not walk away from a woman as beautiful as her, yet her obsession with possessions is what drives him into the fantastical world of Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald. She gives one of her best performance in Midnight in Paris.\nMarion Cotillard shows off the type of French charm that won her the Academy Award for Best Actress for La Vie en Rose in Midnight in Paris, and considering that she is one of the finest actresses that France has to offer it is ideal that she be working in a French fantasy like Midnight in Paris, especially one this good.\nTom Hiddleston was incredibly convincing as Scott Fitzgerald since he captured all the swift and intelligent charm of the 1920's novelist without missing a heartbeat.\nAdrien Brody also gave one of his most charming performances in years by thoroughly perfecting his accent and line delivery, as well as a sophisticated physicality.\nKathy Bates was perfect as Gertrude Stein since she nailed a convincing visualisation of her and a strong performance as usual, so she's a real great actress to have in the cast.\n\nSo Midnight in Paris is so fresh and charming that it exceeds Play it Again, Sam as my favourite Woody Allen film.",

I loved this movie albeit the end was too abrupt for me. Thank you Woody Allen for lending a spotlight to us authors. I have just made my own novel recently (still working on editing though) and I felt empowered by the dialogue and the advice each author gave to Owen Wilson's character. The best part was that they portrayed authors as dreamers and that nobody (not even the girl you are about to marry) will ever understand that, but it's best kept that way.

Although people around almost demanded me to watch it (as the movie geek I'm known as). \nThese last ten years, Woody has gotten a bit hackneyed as a director. You notice how hard he tries to make movies on the same high level that he used to, ages ago. Making some unorthodox plots, and put some spark in it.\n\nWell, this time Woody, you did hit bull's-eye with Midnight In Paris. It contains the same philosophical, existentional reasons, and is beautiful and magic. Enchanting, I would even say!\n\nI was a bit sceptical at first with Owen Wilson playing the main character. In my eyes he is under average when comparing to his assisting actors.\n But my worries flew away when I noticed that Woody directed him into a young Woody Allen himself. With the same facial expressions and body language as Woody has, I did  enjoy Owen's performance. \n\nFun note; Carla Bruni (the president's wife) plays a small role as a museum guide!\nPOSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!\n\nOwen plays what you can say, the usual Woody Allen character.\nGil; a man who do things just because he is expected to, and without really knowing it, his emotions are in chaos. \nEngaged with a woman who is his complete opposite in personality, Inez (Rachel MacAdams) he takes a trip to his favorite place in the world, along with his soon becoming parents in law. They don't like Paris at all, and their future son-in-law even less. Instead of following his fianc\u00e9 with her friends and parents, Gil strolls around on the street on his own on the evenings. Soaking the parisian air and trying to find some more inspiration for the book he's currently working on. He had earlier told Inez about his love for the city and how he wishes he could experience Paris in the 1920s. \n\nOne evening when he gets lost in the allys, and the clock strikes twelve, a really fancy 1920s car, with chauffeur and lots of people on their way to a party stops, and picks up Gil. Like a dream come true he gets into the 1920s and meets his idols; Scott F Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. He also meets an astonishing woman, Adriana (Marion Cotillard)  who appears to be mistress to several painters like Picasso and Dal\u00ed (Adrien Brody).\nOverwhelmed with delight of the roaring 20's atmosphere, he falls a bit in love with Adriana. \n\nThe next morning he wakes up in the hotel room, with everything in order and Inez by his side in the bed. But every night he gets the chance to, he sits at the same spot and awaits the clock to strike twelve, when the car picks him up again and brings him to the 1920s. When he tells Adriana that he is a time traveler, she tells him he's crazy for choosing Paris in the 1920s. She has always dreamed of being present at La Belle Epoque. Together they later travels to La Belle Epoque, and visits of course Moulin Rouge and encounters Henri Toulouse De Lautrec. Adriana is extatic, and when Gil discusses the matter of \"when the golden time was\" , the gentlemen immediately starts talking about the renaissance. That's when Gil realizes that there is no golden age, it's only something you dream of when you lack something important in your life. \nHe tries to explain it to Adriana, who refuses to listen and decides to stay in La Belle Epoque for good. \nGil however travels back to 2011 and starts to scrutinize his mind, of what is wrong with his life, which he very soon figures out.",

I actually liked this better than the Squeakal. It compares to the first film in quality, only this one doesn't have that holiday motif. A goo fun film for the whole family. The soundtrack is entertaining, with mash ups combining songs you would've never imagined would go together. Who would've ever thought in 2011, Gloria Estefan's Conga would be remixed with a remixed version of an old Italian song? In this movie we watch the Chipmunks stranded on an island. Granted the things they construct out of bamboo and coconuts make Gilligan's Island seem realistic--but then again, this is a movie about a man who is raising six talking chipmunks as children. They even pay homage to \"Cast Away\" (2000). Simon's transformation into \"Simone\" is entertaining, but was this perhaps an attempt at competing with \"Puss 'n boots\" (2011)? Interesting nonetheless. This movie is fun to watch.",

With beautiful shots of Paris, with some great cinematography, Allen manages to illustrate why Gil loves Paris so much. Asides that, technically, the film is rather well done, with some great production design. The acting is also very good, with a surprisingly precise Owen Wilson, usually engaging Cotillard, and surprisingly entertaining Kathy Bates. The film, in many ways, is a critique of nostalgia and the power it has over people. Allen makes that rather clear, and it is always entertaining to see how this film has been looked at (and criticised) by both critics and fans as \"not quite as good\" as Woody's films at his peak... Could have been an intentional commentary of the director - or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Nonetheless, highly entertaining and charming film, definitely worth seeing!",

On the plus: Woody Allen's love for the city and culture of Paris runs throughout, and the premise of the story is cute (I won't spill the beans). Also the string of cameos is entertaining (...at least the first few). On the minus: the story never ventures far from the premise, the characters/cameos lack a third dimension, and the arc of the main character is more of a blip.",

Allen's film is also a wonderful tribute to the city of Paris, showing it in all its glory and celebrating it as a muse for a lot of the greatest creative work ever made.

The beautiful imagery of the Parisian streets, lights, bridges, markets, monuments, cafes, bars and even the muddy Seine itself seem to explode with vibrancy and colour (especially in the rain).  Owen Wilson plays Gil, a troubled and insecure writer trying to escape from the grind of rolling out formulaic Hollywood scripts so that he can use his writing talents in a more edifying way.  His fianc\u00e9e, Inez (played by Rachel McAdams), is not particularly supportive of his desired career change (nor of him in general it seems) and her 'one-dimensional' parents are openly dismissive of Gil and are generally the kind of people that Woody Allen despises and is not subtle in the least about showing it!.\n\nGil and Inez end up in Paris, tagging along with Inez's parents  and  Gil falls totally in  love with Paris.  The more enamoured he becomes, the more apparent  the differences between him and Inez become.  This movie very cleverly (but rather blatantly) exposes the great rift between 'romantics' and 'materialists' ; 'dreamers' and 'realists'.  Gil's obsession with Paris in the 20s leads him to question his modern life and drift back to the nostalgia of an age long past.  One questions whether Gil is deluded by his romanticism and is just 'trying to be happy' - seeking the things he loves, the era he loves, the authors, painters and literary figures he loves but it really doesn't matter because this movie is touching, sumptuous in its portrayal of Paris, and Owen Wilson so perfectly captures the Woody Allen-esque character of a slightly troubled man who is not always in his comfort zone around his peers.  In fact Wilson's portrayal of Gil and his acting out of many of Allen's gestures and foibles  is subtly and brilliantly done yet all the while he manages to maintain his unmistakable 'Wilson-ness'.",

One of the only real faults to me was the over-usage of the primary guitar music cue, which got a bit tiresome after about 15 or 16 times.\n\nSpecial mention needs to be made of Owen Wilson, who delivers perhaps the best writer-surrogate performance since Jason Alexander perfectly channeled Larry David in TV's \"Seinfeld\" (And in fact, there was a decent amount of Woody infused into that role too). Allen has found a perfect vessel for his voice, and I look forward to future collaborations between these two.",

The fact that he is trampled by his controlling wife, played by Rachel McAdams, adds to his likability. His strange encounters are put together in a very simple manner with very little fanfare. The result is that we are transported without us breaking our suspension of disbelief. The fact that Paris is almost timeless also helps.\n\nThe sets, costumes, score, and editing are just right. The well chosen cast also gives us a solid performance.\n\nOverall, there's very little negative to say, except maybe that the conclusion lacks a little bit of substance. It's simply that the transition when he finally understand is dropped on us very suddenly and he cuts off his ties quickly. It's very mature and realistic, in a way, but slightly unsatisfying. More over, the beginning of the film is a bit rough, but you get in to the beat quite rapidly.\n\nIt's good, see it if you like low-key productions.",

This film was getting rave reviews and Oscar buzz when it came out so I was excited for it, but at the same time, I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen so that counter-acted my excitement a little bit. I had to watch this twice to actually critique this film and give it a rating, but I'll get into that at the end of my review =P\r\nThis movie is very whimsical without ever being cheesy or derivative and is very \"easy to watch\" compared to many other Woody Allen films of recent years. This film barely missed out on being in my top 20 films of 2011 and it would probably be at #21 if i had made a top 25.\r\nMidnight in Paris is definitely top tier Woody Allen and his best film in many many years. Everyone gives good performances and the film is directed very sensitively by Woody Allen. If this movie came out when Woody Allen was in his prime, Owen Wilson's character would have definitely been  played by Woody Allen himself. Owen Wilson is easily the best Woody Allen double ever. There isn't anything bad about this movie really, and at times it's very thought-provoking, but the movie as a whole doesn't really pack enough punch to be considered a great movie. \r\nThe thing I like the most about Midnight in Paris is that it deals with time travel, but it never explains how or why Owen Wilson is going back through time and encountering Salvador Dali and Ernest Hemingway. If the movie tried to explain why this is happening, I could guarantee you it would lose all of it's charm and become convoluted. Woody Allen was definitely smart not to include scenes where they try and explain the rules of time travel or how Owen Wilson is able to do this. \r\nAt the beginning of my review, I mentioned how I had to watch it twice, so I will explain what I mean. I watched this film About 2 years ago, when the movie came out on DVD, I watched it with my girlfriend but we got distracted half-way through the movie and ended up fooling around. The reason why I couldn't critique it the first time around was because I lost my virginity while watching the movie so I obviously couldn't have a clear judgement of the film. I watched it again a week after that ordeal and was able to critique it properly. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart because of that.",

Owen Wilson is perfectly cast in the Woody Allen role. (He doesn't impersonate Woody but makes the character his own without the usual mannerisms or shtick.) He's a screenwriter, in the process of writing a novel, visiting Paris with his wife (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. After midnight, wandering the streets alone, he is transported back to 1920s Paris where he interacts with various writers and artists like Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein. This is Allen's best movie in at least 15 years and it may be his most lyrical. It has more wit, grace, and romantic spirit than his recent pictures, and calls to mind his earlier comedy \"The Purple Rose of Cairo.\" The opening montage with postcard views of Paris is unnecessarily long. A reference made suggesting to Luis Bunuel an idea for a movie that becomes \"The Exterminating Angel\" is a nice touch. Allen won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Gorgeous cinematography is by Darius Khondji; music is by Stephane Wrembel. With Marion Cotillard, Michael Sheen as a pompous professor, Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Leya Seydoux, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald, Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway, Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, and Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali.",

Other than that I think the film is overrated and I think many of those who laud this films merits enjoy it far much for its concept than the finished product. I don't think it did an outstanding job of embodying its elements. I thought much of it was pretentious, artificial, I was annoyed by some of the acting and some of the simply bogus dialogue.",

            "content": "There's no question that \"Midnight in Paris\" was a success in certain areas. It not only made a lot of money relative to almost every other Woody Allen film, but it was also in the running for many prestigious, mainstream accolades. Indeed, I can only imagine that for many people, this was their first Woody Allen film. This is unfortunate, however, because it is quite a disappointment and, overall, one of Woody Allen's worst films.\r\n\r\nFirst off, a lot of the writing falls flat. I'll admit that there are some good scenes that recall Woody Allen of the 70s and 80s, but, frankly, these are few and far between. Most are forced and don't really contribute to the storyline or the development of characters. That said, this flat writing isn't unique to this Allen film. Throughout his career, there certainly have been a few 'misses' where the writing just doesn't come through and his characters sound like they are reading lines. On that list are films like \"Alice,\" \"September,\" and, now, \"Midnight in Paris.\" \r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the writing really stunts the film and the characters within it. Almost all of them are very one dimensional, unrealistic people. A successful screen-writer may want to try his hand at writing something with more depth, but would he really act and look like Owen Wilson? Wilson's character's lines and demeanor just don't fit that sort of person and half of that is due to Wilson himself. It is not at all believable that Gil has any more depth than John Beckwith in \"Wedding Crashers\" or Randolph in \"You, Me, and Dupree.\" Perhaps Woody Allen was fine with that because he was trying to make a lighter, more approachable film, but certainly the result is disappointing. Indeed, as far as the quality of the film goes, Wilson was a very poor choice. \r\n\r\nAll that is not to even mention the depiction of the literary figures. Admittedly, Allen trying to keep it lighthearted and funny, but the idea that Gertrude Stein would read some x-screenwriter's novel and really like it is utterly ridiculous. Certainly these extreme caricatures contribute to the overall superficiality of the film, but at the same time they are in contrast with Gil's more realistic outlook and experiences. Overall, Allen seems to have just carelessly threw these characters together without thinking about how they would actually interact. In the end, though, we just don't care about them, and I find this very disappointing because I know that Allen can write characters like Annie Hall and Hannah.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the film itself seems sloppily put together. Instead of creating a convincing, developed scene, Allen decided to have Gil miraculously find Adriana's diary at a bookstall on the street in 2010. This is such an extremely unrealistic copout. It was as if Allen just decided he didn't have the time to figure out a better way for Gil to find out about Adriana's love, so he just threw that in. In addition, every time Gil and/or Adriana travel back, they just happen to be right next to all the major literary figures of the era. While this frivolity may seem to some viewers as funny and entertaining, it's really just poor film making. Instead of creating a credible, developed story, Allen just skips to the action.\r\n\r\nAdding to this, the last fourth of the film is significantly worse than anything that came before it. It's as if Allen was running out of time so he just quickly stapled together the ending. The result is mishmash of scenes that very hurriedly try to get the film's meaning across, get the relationship between Gil and Adriana resolved, get Gil's novel figured out, and get Gil to break up with Inez. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like it should take more than five minutes for Adriana to decide to forgo her entire other life and stay in the 1890s. \r\n\r\nI must say, however, that there was one positive attribute of the film, and that was the cinematography of Paris. I really enjoyed seeing, instead of a set, the actual streets, buildings, and bridges of Paris. If only Allen had gotten rid of the characters, the storyline, and the script and just showed us more shots of Paris. Then I probably would have given the film half a star more.",

This film will be appreciated more by artists of all kinds as Gil's Bohemian dreams won't universally resonate with the general public. The relationship between Gil and his fianc\u00e9e (played by McAdams) was so figuratively destructive that it became an added element of the film's subtle humour and I selfishly hoped they would stay together.",

I sure wasn't surprised by it's Oscar nomination for Best Motion Picture of the Year, cause this is a masterpiece, it's smart, it's engaging, it's funny and I had a great time watching it. Sow, Midnight in Paris is a genius movie and everybody who loves films will defenitly like it, I love movies and I consider this movie to be one of the greatest movies ever created. Let me tell you something, want to see it or not, you have to watch this fantastic movie, it's a fantastic experience that mixes up lots of fantastic elementes of movies, I loved this movie and I sure wouldn't mind to watch it again. Fantastic movie.\n\nWoody Allen directs this movie really well, his direction of this movie deserved the Oscar nomination, from all of his movies that I've seen, this is defenitly the best of all of them, this is just simply a genius work. Owen Wilson takes the lead role, he was just fantastic and continues to let me comfortable considering him one of my favorite actors, he was really fantastic at his role, one of his best perfomances or probably his best, Owen is known from Cars, Cars 2, Wedding Crashers, The Darjeeling Limited, Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers, Little Fockers and some other movies. Rachel McAdams takes a role that would obviously not be fantastic, she was just okay, Rachel is known from The Notebook, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shaddows, Morning Glory and some other movies. Katy Bathes just has an okay role, nothing memorable, Kathy is known from Titanic, About Schmidt, Misery and some other movies. Marion Cotillard has a fine role and a good character, Marion is known from one of my favorite movies, wich is Inception, she is also known from Contagion, La vie en Rose, Big Fish and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a great cast, there's also another great cameos along the movie and I enjoyed them, Best perfomance of the cast: Owen Wilson, but the rest of the cast was also okay and there was some other good perfomances and characters. Great cast.\n\nGil (Owen Wilson) is Hollywood script writer and Inez (Rachel McAdams) is his fianc\u00e9, they are an American couple who come to Paris for Inez' parents' business trip. Gil loves Paris and wishes that after his upcoming wedding he could actually live there with Inez, even though she wants to go to Malibu and make Gil continue his Hollywood script writer career even though he doesn't like that and is now in the middle of finishing a novel. Inez goes dancing with some friends at midnight and Gil decides to go for a walk, with that walk he wasn't just inspired for his novel, he also entered the heart of Paris. Gil now goes for a walk every day and while he keeps getting more interested in Paris, he also keeps losing interest on his wife.(What I though about the plot) I loved the plot, it has fantastic things in it, it was amazingly well written by Woody Allen who actually won an Oscar for it, but as always, he wasn't there for recieve it, but whathever, I think that this is a genius plot and it worked really well in this fantastic movie, trust me. Great plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, I loved this movie's soundtrack, I think there was just two themes, but two fantastic themes that I did not got tired of hearing, this movie really had a great soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, before I watched it, I really wanted to see it and after reading several positive reviews for this movie, I had no doubts that I was going to like it. I just loved this movie, it's diferent from all of the movies that Woody has direct before, this movie has a certain fantasy as an atmosphere of life and love, this is a genius work. This movie is ment to be watched during the entire minutes, you can't even blink your eyes, cause if you're not used to the characters, you're experinece will be diferent. Sow, what can I say, I loved the movie, it's about Paris, love and life, it's about everything and I just loved it, trust me, it's no chick flick, there's no stupid romance or cliche, it's really just ment for all movie lovers, man or woman, this has to be watched by everyone. Overall, this is a fantastic movie, it has a great cast, a great plot, a great soundtrack and it's very entertaining. Defenitly one of my favorite movies, this movie goes much beyond than just a Woody Allen rom-com. Fantastic.\n\nFantastic movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: A.",

While Gil is seduced by the city's charms, she falls under the charms of Paul(Michael Sheen, playing a different kind of vampire this time around), a former professor.  Wanting to see more of the city, Gil decides to walk back to his hotel after dinner one night.  And then gets so lost that he runs into Zelda(Alison Pill) and Scott(Tom Hiddleston) who take him barhopping.  Along the way, he chats with Ernest Hemingway(Corey Stoll) who offers to pass along his unpublished novel to Gertrude Stein(Kathy Bates) to read the next time he sees her.\r\n\r\nAs rough a recent track record as he has, the one consistency of Woody Allen's career is how well he has always fared with fantasy(I haven't seen \"Scoop\" and no intention to) and \"Midnight in Paris\" is no different, as it is an engaging and bittersweet love letter to a city, with a tip of the hat to Mark Twain's 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'  It is also a neat history lesson with some superb references, including one very cool cinematic one, where great figures of art and literature interact with each other, with Adrien Brody making for a very strange Salvador Dali.(Although maybe that's the point.)  Just remember that while the past may be a great place to visit, you would not want to live there; just as Woody Allen points out how the present looks back to the past as a golden age, not realizing we may live in one as I write this which we can do much to confirm with our actions.",

It doesn't work, its just annoying! \nOkay.. phew..\n\nThis along with a host of other things is wrong with midnight in paris. So much is wrong, in fact, that i was flabber-ghasted upon checking RT halfway through my viewing (to get some catharsis for my frustrations by reading the other scathing reviews i expected to find) when instead of such reviews i found this stinking pile of a film has merited 93%!?\n\nNow, perhaps its an egging thing. By an egging thing i mean, fans of Woody Allen egging on the film, whisping off all its faults like Gil may have flapped his way through the thick hanging cigar and opium clouds of his cartoon, romantic, 1920's Paris. I must admit, as a fan i am liable to do the same for directors and actors i desperately want to see succeed. \n\nBut really, lets step out of the magic time car for a second, lets step back to reality. \n\nThe characters were cartoonish and Gil was boring. The film was put together like it was made for the tourist board of Paris (who would have LOVED it) imagine every american sit-coms obligatory 'London calling' UK trip montage and you'll get the gist.  I didn't care what happened to anyone involved. The only interesting plot point, the idea of stepping into a number of mysterious time cars and travelling to a number of ages we all have romanticisms about, was not used! And now will never be! It is the worst artistic crime to take a good idea, and just smush it into the dust just so. Potential ruined. \n\nWe were asked politely to let the main conceit go and accept Gils situation (no problem Mr Allen, fair enough) the problem with this film came with its indulgent tendency to just pass things over to the audience for their immediate acceptance, it seems, in all cases. \n\nWe were never given a reason why Gil was with his horrible fiance in the first place, okay so.. you just are then?; We were never given a history of Inez and the pedant, sorry.. how do you know each other again? Oh yeah, collage.. yeah.. .. okay; a few minutes with Gil and beautiful fantasy Parisienne ladies were falling at his feet. Im sorry.. HUH?!\n\nI understand the point Allen was trying to get across, the grass is always greener blah blah blah. I really don't care.",

            "content": "Highly praised by the critics and awarded the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Woody Allen; I really couldn\u00e2(TM)t pass this one up when it premiered on TV this week. I was a little sceptical having seen a couple of Allen\u00e2(TM)s more recent works and being a tad less than impressed, but I needn\u00e2(TM)t have worried. It seems those critics do get it right now and then and I have to say I really enjoyed this one. Here\u00e2(TM)s a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nGil (Owen Wilson) is a writer; he has been to Paris in the past and loves the place; his fianc\u00c3 (C)e, Inez (Rachel McAdams), hasn\u00e2(TM)t. She doesn\u00e2(TM)t share his love of the city and in particular doesn\u00e2(TM)t get his fixation with Paris in the 1920\u00e2(TM)s. Her parents, John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy) are also there, partly on business and partly to help with wedding plans. They meet some friends of Inez, Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda), who insist on taking them out so Paul can show off his extensive knowledge of the city. Gil finds it all terribly dull and decides to walk back to their hotel one night. He gets lost as pauses at the side of a particular street as the church clock chimes midnight. An old car comes up the road and a group of revellers persuade him to come with them. He find himself in a bar talking to the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill) and even Ernest Hemmingway (Corey Stoll). Oh, and there\u00e2(TM)s a girl (there\u00e2(TM)s always a girl), Adriana (Marion Cotillard). He is in the 1920\u00e2(TM)s Paris he always dreamed of, but how? And what lies around the corner?... Guess I\u00e2(TM)d better leave it there.\n\nWe begin with shots of Paris (yes, some of them in the rain) and I think I\u00e2(TM)m looking at a travelogue; but I\u00e2(TM)m wrong. Once it gets going this film is very witty and even whimsical at times, and I really enjoyed it. Woody Allen\u00e2(TM)s writing is spot on here with some great dialogue and some marvellous characters. The plot has just the right amount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important points about living your life in the past. All the performances were excellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from me. Over all I found it very entertaining, amusing and even a little profound in places\u00e2\u00a6 Well worth a look!\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.5/10",

But Owen Wilson is woefully miscast as a wannabe novelist obsessed with the Lost Generation era, and the gifted Rachel McAdams is utterly wasted in a one-note role as his shrill, unlikable fiancee.

Enough said.\nLiterally saw this movie but several minutes ago, and I have to say I've already found a new addition to my list of favorite movies. As I've seen lately, great movies using Paris as a backdrop or setting at some point have become a commodity for directors once again. Case in point: Ratatouille, Inception, Les Intouchables and this movie. This one is probably the most important of all because of its depiction of a writer falling quickly in love with the city and its people, despite his company's cynicism and ignorance. \"If I'm not mistaken...\" Woody Allen did make a film set in Paris in 1996, and his love for the city (played vicariously through Owen Wilson, I am sure) shows throughout the film. Speaking of Owen Wilson, and declaring myself a non-fan, I actually found that he fit the role perfectly. All other casting was perfect as well, and I feel that Rachel McAdams fits a role such as this one better than, say, Irene Adler in Sherlock Holmes. I am also convinced that Woody Allen must have based the characters of Inez, her parents, Carol and Paul (the \"pedantic one\") off of real-life character. The scenes featuring them at Paris during the daytime are perfectly acted/scripted. Well done, Woody Allen; certainly your best work in years.",
