            "content": "Vou começar a falar do unico ponto negativo que eu dou para este filme, que seria a forma em que o vilão perde no filme, acho que poderia ser mais épico.\nO filme inteiro em si é épico, para quem é fã e acompanhou a franquia, é muito marcante a forma que tudo acabou, diferente se for uma pessoa que caiu de paraquedas neste filme, ai sim será um filme bem genérico. Mas em si foi um final muito bom, com cenas maravilhosas. Só mesmo o como o vilão foi derrotado que me deixou 0,5% insatisfeito",

In this movie, there is three lead actors, Daniel Radcliffe ( Harry ), Emma Watson ( Hermione ) and Rupert Grint ( Ron ). This movie was published in 2009. \n\nThe movie talk about the three main characters in a magical World who want to stop the bad wizard « Voldemort ». To do this, they try to search the Deathly Hallows to weaken him. The plot is very absorbing because there is all the time action and movement! The special effects are stunning for old movie and the photography is breathtaking moreover the quality of the acting is spectacular. \nThe script of the movie is good but they could have done better for the first part. \n\nI recommend really this movie because it is the end of a big saga and it is a good end! This film was fascinating that why I give 5 stars.",

This final instalment neatly wraps up many of the seeming contradictions in the storyline that were in the earlier parts of the story. Not the best movie in the series in my opinion, but nonetheless extremely enjoyable. There are a few parts that still raise more questions than answers, but these do not spoil the overall storyline, and the sequence of events around the Elder wand is not particularly convincing - more a Scooby Doo explanation than Hercule Poirot. The final ending is quite funny as the actors have not been made to look old enough for the roles in the very final scenes.  Unlike many multi part stories that have an unsatisfactory ending, this is a must watch once you have seen the rest.",

After that, so many flawless movie scenes (when astounding plot-twisting truths are revealed, when Harry and Dumbledore are in Limbo, when Neville gives his speech and kills the snake, when Harry finally kills Voldemort, when they're at King's Cross Station in the epilogue to wrap it all up perfectly with even the little detail of the chocolate frog as a call back to the first movie), just brilliant stuff! This was even better than Avengers Endgame imo! All of the Harry Potter movies are good/great/awesome, and it ended as epically well-done as it could!",

Truly epic in every sense of the word, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part 2\" is a stunning and powerful achievement!  I don't think a better conclusion to such a beloved and magical series could have been obtained by changing anything in this film!  From start to finish the film is relentless, much like Lord Voldemort and the film's 2+ running time flies by in the blink of an eye.  We finally learn and accept the fates of all our characters and what their legacy is.  My favorite character throughout (Alan Rickman as Professor Snape) is finally justified and his childhood examined, giving tremendous insight and emotional pull to his actions.  During his final moments I was literally in tears knowing how hard his life was and the darkness he had to endure and yet in the end he was always a wonderful person at his core!  Not only was I emotionally devastated throughout the film but I was so thoroughly engaged that I could not take my eyes away for even the slightest moment.  The film brings together everything that made this wonderful franchise such a huge hit and brings it to the ultimate climax, deciding the fate of everyone good and bad in the process.  The impeccable special effects, wonderfully developed characters, stunning sets of the various settings, and all around general epic feel that I desired was given to me.  I could not be more happy with how it all turned out, however I shed many tears along the way especially when it came to Professor Snape and his sacrifices.  I cannot recommend this enough, although most have already seen most if not all the films, if you haven't you owe it to yourself.  You will not be disappointed!",

            "content": "Here it is, a cinematic event to rival them all, the epic conclusion to one of the greatest franchises of the cinema. And what a grand finale it is. The end of Harry Potter's adventure is not just one of the very best entries in the saga, it's also one of the very best films of the summer. Thrilling, tragic, funny, touching, and--most importantly--magical, it's a film that ties up loose ends, reveals some surprises, and delivers a ride that takes you across the emotional spectrum. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves by now have a firm hand on the material and deftly move us from the solemn opening to a teary-eyed finale. The pace here is unlike most any Potter film, probably since this is the most action-packed one yet. Spirited chases, an episode with a dragon, and rousing one-on-one battles are enough to get your blood pumping, and the dazzling visuals (often brought to life by the 3D) put you in the middle of the action. But what has given this series its juice is the cast of actors, young and old, who have brought these beloved characters to vivid life. Almost all get their moment to shine, although that crammed roster (dead characters also make appearances) can trip up the momentum the film has going for itself. But sensing the end, everyone commits to their parts with a heartfelt flourish. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are the heart and soul of the series, and have grown up with it. Seeing them wholly inhabit Harry, Ron, and Hermione's last stage in their emotional journey is one of the great movie going pleasures of recent memory. The other young men and women deliver the goods as well. Not to mention the elder thespians, who are superb, one and all. Michael Gambon, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman (especially terrific), Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt, Gary Oldman, Jason Issacs, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Warwick Davis, and best of all, my personal favorite, the regal Maggie Smith. The two new additions to cast are Ciaran Hinds and the great Kelly McDonald, and they leave sharp impressions. Everything comes together in such a satisfying way it's really hard to see where the story could go from here, despite what potential the \"next generation\" epilogue offers. Over the course of seven books, eight films, and ten years, we've gone on a magical adventure with a great hero to a world both wonderfully enchanting and humanly recognizable, and we've been happy to go along and lose ourselves to the magic of it all",

There are a couple plot holes, lines of dialogue that reference book related material that was never placed in the movies, and an ending twist that kind of soured some of this movie's good will towards the end. But, still, those mean next to nothing to just how fantastic this movie is!\nThe characters are great, the music is a surprising high point of the film, the pacing quick while never feeling rushed, the action is awesome, the stakes are high, and the emotional moments hit hard.  \nIt's a flawed but marvelous finale to one of the best and most famous franchises in history, and (arguably) pulls off the biggest accomplishment of any ending: it tops everything that came before it.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.\n\nWhat stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all.\n\nOnce again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama.\n\nThe script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted.\n\nThe acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

It's all a bit too long and overblown, but the skill of the world-building is palpable - it's always a place people will want to return to, a set of characters we'll want to spend time with.",

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with.

I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. \n\nThe ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious. \n\nOverall, a magnificent way to end the franchise.

The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional.\nThe final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Whether it be the emotional end of Snape (Alan Rickman), the long awaited relationship between Hermione and Ron, or the death of Voldemort this is an extremely satisfying film.\n\nThe scene that gives me goosebumps whenever I watch it is when McGonagall (Maggie Smith) activates the guards. The combination of music and cinematography makes for one of my favourite scenes in the entire franchise. \n\nThe action in this film is extremely well handled and we get to see a lot of these characters get their moment to shine. In particular Neville's (Matthew Lewis) moment when he gives a heartwarming speech at then proceeds to kill Nagini is one of the greatest character moments in the series.\n\nThere are some confusing points in this film that I think definitely could've been polished up and there are a few to many things that happen off camera but it doesn't take to much away from the masterpiece that this film is.\n\n9.5/10",

Un altro problema di questi quattro film è che non riescano a far funzionare correttamente il titolo al loro interno. \nLa battaglia di Hogwarts in questo film è senza dubbio emozionante, ma poteva anche non ricoprire un ruolo così vasto da dimenticare il resto.\nAnche questo non lo giudico un film terribile, ma indiscutibilmente non un capolavoro.",

There is no shortage of character moments, bringing back classic fan favorites as well as introducing some characters that are \"new\" to the audience but feel like they have been a part of this universe all along. The performances are wonderful across the board, practically all of the actors we have known from Sorcerer's Stone turn in their best performance in this film. Rickman, Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, and many more bring their A-game for this finale. The visuals are at their best, with some truly epic and kinetic moments of CGI-enhanced magical action. Many threads are picked up on, well connected, with a tidy bow on top and it's filled to the brim with fan-pleasing moments. Unless you genuinely don't care for the Harry Potter series, you should be truly impressed with this conclusion.",

After such a long series, you're hoping that the end does the rest of the series justice and thIS movie doesn't disappoint in the slightest. It's the harrowing conclusion to Harry Potter's journey as he tries to put a stop to the evil Voldemort once and for all.\n\nActing: 10\nIt's not surprise that the acting is so stellar as these wonderful actors/actresses have had years to grow comfortable in the skin of their characters. Daniel Radcliffe continues to be sensational in his role as Harry Potter as he embraces Potter's ascension into manhood. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) shine yet again playing his dedicated friends and sidekicks. You can tell that the three of them have formed such a strong bond over the eight movies as their synergy is extremely on point.\n\nBeginning: 4\n\nCharacters: 10\nThis final film pulls out all the stops as it's an all-out good vs. evil war. Teeming with amazing characters, I was hardpressed trying to uncover who exactly my favorite was. Potter is wonderful, yes, but so are dozens of others literally. I was really impressed with the maturation of Ron's character. It can be hard at times developing a sidekick but in some ways, Ron's journey to completion is just as satisfying as Harry's.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\n\nConflict: 10\nThis one is for all the marbles so they hold nothing back when it comes to amazing action sequences. The battles sprawl all across Hogwarts filled with dope magic and wonder. Sparks fly in abundance of blacks, greens and reds across a dark backdrop, a spectacular display. Sometimes you have no idea who's even winning, but it looks damn cool.\n\nEntertainment Value: 10\nPotter vs. Voldemort alone is worth the price of admission. The battle definitely lives up to the hype. Even moreso to see closure happen on every level is a welcome treat. Outside of a slow(ish) start, the movie is enjoyable from beginning to end.\n\nMemorability: 10\n\nPace: 10\nThe beauty of the final book being done in two parts for the movie is they definitely saved the best for last. All the best battles and memorable scenes are jam-packed into Part 2, causing things to fly by at a breakneck pace. Just over two hours, the final installment just flies by.\n\nPlot: 10\nJK Rowling wraps up this beautiful adventure quite nicely. The thing I keep going back to and have an immense amount of respect for: No loose ends. The stakes are higher than ever in this story that succeeds with a few cool twists along the way.\n\nResolution: 10\n\nOverall: 94\nThe magical battles alone are enough to make Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 worth a watch. With the combination of rich characters who each get a proper sendoff, a speedy pace, and a chunk of memorable moments, this is a movie to remember.",

There's just so much going on, and it's all so excessively dim...\n\nOver-reliance upon book lore has been a long-term problem for this franchise, and that issue has only grown more pronounced as the film adaptations enter their final stretch. I have no idea how anyone could make sense of Deathly Hallows 2 without keeping a store of such information, fresh and reliable, somewhere in their noggin. Maybe a Cliff's Notes handbook and a hair-trigger pause button would suffice. Casually tossing about complicated concepts like wand allegiance, multiplying spells, hallows and horcruxes, the film skims along at a high speed, in breathless pursuit of flashier material. Of that, fortunately, there's plenty, and those bits are loaded with well-constructed callbacks to the previous films. The action scenes are constant highlights, excellent in concept and in execution; a fitting farewell, in their own way, for the series at large.\n\nQuieter character moments are more of a mixed bag. Snape gets his big spotlight scene, after being completely ignored in the previous chapter, but most of the younger cast members are swept up in the desperate search for a soul mate. Everybody just wants to pair off, to hit that convenient epilogue with a litter of kids tugging at their shoestrings. Despite simmering for years and years, in many cases, such romances play more like a series of checked boxes than natural, heartfelt outpourings of emotion. Ron and Hermione are a prime example. The moment of their long-germinating embrace was evidently a difficult scene for the actors, who literally grew up together on-set, and their discomfort is clear on the screen. The kiss feels like an awkward, instantly-regretted smooch between friends, not a grand culmination, and that robs power from these beloved characters' storybook ending. They probably should've got that out of the way several movies earlier anyway. Here, in the midst of a hectic chase and a frenzied battle, even an effective payoff would've been lost in the mix.\n\nWhich is another recurring issue that this film never really settles. There's enough material for three movies in here (or a seven-hundred page book, as it were) and in trying to please everyone, to fit it all in, the whole package fades into a fleeting, dizzying wash. Nothing gets a chance to breathe, lest a different scene meet the cutting room floor. Crucial time is cut from meaningful points in the main narrative, dampening their impact, to cram in a few smaller, crowd-pleasing tidbits. But those, too, are over and done with so quickly that they hardly seem worth the effort.\n\nIn the end, we get (nearly) everything, without necessitating another weird mid-stream cutaway, but nothing is half as rewarding as I'd expected. A stumble over the finish line, in other words; a film that hits the novel's plot points but completely misses its spirit. Could've been worse, I guess, but it also could've been so much better.",

With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!\n\nThe whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.\n\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.\n\nWe all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011.

David Yates closed this series with a deeply moving conclusion to these film adaptations and I am amazed how well this two-part finale worked out, you can totally see how this last book warranted being split in two and it was honestly for the best. I am very pleased with how they wrapped up all of the plotlines and made them feel like a satisfying conclusion that we've been building up to for the past 10 years, the journey that these characters all went on was well worth the reward considering how many hours we put into supporting their development and it absolutely works for me, this was a great heart-wrenching finale with some really good action sprinkled throughout, it is pretty fast-paced and it never fails to entertain on every level including emotionally. The flashback with Snape and Lilly was so heartbreaking and well done, I felt for Snape so much and loved him even more as a character and Alan Rickman played him to perfection, scenes like that test how emotionally invested we got in the characters and for me, my heartstrings tugged every single time. This movie makes the weaker movies Half-Blood Prince and the Columbus films totally worth watching, not that they were bad, but they didn't stand on their own as movies nearly as well as the other ones, this pays off all of the time you invested in this series and it feels cohesive and complete. Another amazing thing in this film is that the stakes have never been higher and they feel so real, it feels like there will be consequences and it makes this even more intense, with the deaths of Lupin, Tonks, and Fred, it made everyone feel vulnerable and human in a world filled with magic, it got us to worry about everyone we know and made us feel justice when Harry achieves victory. I greatly appreciated that David Yates didn't milk this last movie by making it long and drawn out for no reason, it does its job quickly, it takes more time with the character development when it needs to, it isn't boring and it feels complete and satisfying, I only wish that there was more time given to Malfoy and actually having him going through with siding with Harry, his character arc feels incomplete and just hanging there with no resolution. This is the shortest film in the series and it works very well as a conclusion, it feels earned, the stakes are real, it consistently entertains and I get emotional every time. This is my favorite film in the series and it caps off this franchise very nicely.",

He crafted so many gorgeous shots, with a couple new creative tricks, while Mark Day's editing was absolutely seamless, really knitting the scenes together beautifully.\n\nDavid Yates let Part 1 take all the set up hits, and completely focused on making this a high octane, blast of fun! Yates does an amazing job of bringing all of the former events and foreshadowing together, to create countless amazing moments! There were so many twists and turns, keeping the narrative fresh, while moving at such a brisk pace with great momentum. Yates does a fantastic job of setting up this really dark and dreary tone, backed up by the amazing cinematography, and a great score, while really balancing the emotional keys well with the dark tone.\n\nIt has been a great honor and pleasure to have seen all of these characters grow and mature, over the seventeen years of the saga - it's truly sad to say that it's over. Yates does an amazing job of bringing in all of the characters from the past films, and balancing them super well within the narrative. There were just countless great character moments, displaying their true talents in their own way. After all this time, you can really feel and understand the characters motives and feelings, because everyone is fleshed out so nicely, having great chemisty across the board.\n\nAs a finale should be, the magic and action sequences were off the charts! It was by far the best showing of their magical abilities, having so many intriguing sequences! The amount of stakes that were set was amazing, having constant tention throughout the entire narrative.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, is phenomenal! It is by far the most entertaining film of the saga, and arguably the best; I just can't put it over The Prisoner of Azkaban!",

In primis, non c'è sufficiente spazio narrativo per le morti dei vari personaggi, che cadono senza motivazione senza che gli venga data meritata giustizia. Inoltre, nella seconda parte della pellicola lo scontro finale risulta parzialmente frettoloso e non convincente al cento per cento. Stupende invece alcune piccole scelte registiche e narrative che inglobano tutto il percorso dei personaggi iniziato con il primissimo film.

The way that the story unfolds is like nothing ever seen. In my mind, it doesn't follow the status quo of Disney or Paramount (love stories, buddy stories, road trips and such).\n\nThe characters are stellar. They play their parts phenomenally. The casting of Ian Hart, Helena Bonham Carter, and of course, Daniel Radcliffe was an amazing choice. The performances really dazzle audiences to this day. You can feel the warmth of the greeting when Harry comes to Hogwarts for the final battle. It gives off the impression that there really is such a thing as Hogwarts.\n\nThe setting feels so real and authentic that you sometimes wonder if it all was CGI and a blue screen.

Rowling's iconic children's series: Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part II (2011) is not only far superior to the dull Part I, but a tight picture that ties up all the loose ends, answering questions audiences have held onto for a decade, giving satisfying conclusions for all its characters. Yates directs The Deathly Hallows Part II with a focused perspective, swift pace, and attention to detail for explaining various mysteries left unanswered by previous films in the series. \n\nJ. K. Rowling's writing is precise and interesting as she connects the dots between Snape's deeds by shifting his crimes into sacrifices in a devastating final performance from Alan Rickman. Yates' direction makes Snape's backstory appear ambiguous like Snape could have even been Harry's father despite book implications. Rowling revealing that Snape had been protecting Harry due to his love of Harry's mother Lily Potter is endearing, devastating, and shocking all at once. Finding out Harry was a horcrux too, who needs to die is sad, but gets resolved in a neat way. I don't particularly care for the train station waypoint to Heaven as it's a very on the nose metaphor beneath the series, but it gets the point across I suppose.\n\nAlexandre Desplat's score is epic and sweeping with grandeur worthy of Harry Potter's finale. It's too bad it's not as magical and memorable as John Williams' original score, but Desplat brings fiery composition to his music. I'm quite happy Harry and Ginny end up together, while I guess it was fate for Hermione and Ron as their relationship was developed from the beginning. Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all bring their best for this emotional final film in the Harry Potter series.\n\nRalph Fiennes is fearsome and scary with his Shakespearean take on Lord Voldemort. Jason Isaac is great as the cowardly Lucius Malfoy, meanwhile Helen McCrory and Tom Felton are excellent as the redeemed villains Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter is excellent fun in a more playful role for Bellatrix in all her insane antics.\n\nOverall, it's a fun last movie that is emotionally poignant and enthralling narratively.",

You shouldn't have to be an expert in the Potter Canon (yes, I know many 12 year olds would qualify).

Snape was definitely one of the most less understood characters in HP.... and to see his story arc get a powerful conclusion is amazing. The visuals is at its best throughout the film, the acting from everyone is on top form. The whole Harry realising he is a Horcux in the \"dream\" with Dumbledore, adds a good pace to the story and a better understanding of their relationship. When you realise the hero of this film is actually Neville Longbottom, just brings warmth to my heart to see his character actually being taken seriously. It's got emotional, thrilling, and powerful moments to make this a fantastic movie conclusion... however the very small nick picks(very small nick picks) that I have with this film is the battle of hogwarts wasn't as epic as it was in the book, and maybe couldn't have been a tad longer.... but this will easily go down as my favourite Harry Potter movie ever...........

The visual effects were spectacular especially the Gringott's dragon, when Voldemort blasted the barrier on Hogwarts, the Fire animals, Nagini the snake, and when Harry and Voldemort have their final battle. The direction that David Yates took this film was terrific. The makeup and hair was outstanding especially Griphook, Voldemort, Bogrod, and all of the Goblins at Gringotts.
