    "summary": "Thanksgiving is usually a happy time, but ad executive Jack (Adam Sandler) dreads the holiday because his twin sister, Jill (also Sandler), makes her annual visit. When Jack and his sister get off on the wrong foot, the only way to make it right is to invite her to stay through Hanukkah. But, when actor Al Pacino (Al Pacino), whom Jack desperately needs to star in a commercial, takes a shine to Jill, Jack may be forced to extend his sister's visit even longer.",

You can't even focus on the screen half the time because of Jill's ear grating dialogue. The jokes are TERRIBLE. Adam Sandler basically has no character at all and is forgetful and one dimensional he somehow disappears throughout this even though he's the main focus. Al Pacino's performance is just...bizarre, there is no other way to say it. It's so out of place committed its incredible but it should say a lot that it's still not worth sitting through everything else to get to that. You want this to end honestly after 8 minutes in....Burn this.",
