Basically, just everything about this film is just straight up bad, with absolutely zero redeeming factors and is just a film that is so bad it becomes unbearable to watch throughout.

In theory, the concept of juveniles being able to opt-in with government operations and succeed, especially doing much better than the adults WHO ARE ALSO SPIES do. But this franchise, really failed at that. If it didn't, there would be a universe where hearing \"Spy Kids\" rings as much of a bell as \"The Matrix\"; this is not that universe. The concept is well done but the execution and logistics to support it are beyond impure. Nothing seems to make sense here, almost as though the screenplays that were chosen by Robert were objectively the worst ones. Time is incredibly inconsistent, as well as making no sense. They practically didn't care for how it would work, even though time travel is a well-known complex of ideas that people haven't quite solved yet, like the unified field theory. The franchise went on for 8 years without a fourth film, exactly the same mediocrity as the previous installations, despite the concept. Hey, the film even acknowledges that adults overthink, and that's certainly true or humans wouldn't be in such a sociological mess that it can't even recognise, even if it's right in front of them.",

The movie is a kids movie and many  people just didn't take this right. They evolved, but the series didn't. Maybe they wanted a more teenage aimed movie, or a continuation of the original Spy Kids adventures, this is not. The movie it's a good sequel, I have to say not good enough to sparkle a new trilogy. The new kids are not as interesting as the original were, but the themes the movie touches and how they are implemented in a kids movie is great, important themes such as forgiveness, working together and appreciating each moment, each time. Also when people say there are not strong women in movies, show them this. A spy woman who kicks ass while pregnant and while protecting her baby. Progressive stuff such as inverting the stereotype colors of pink and blue. Rodriguez ability to make movies with a low budget, but with heart and creativity is to be admire.\n\nWe need more gimmick movies, I heard this one had a scratch and smell thing going on.

Time travel is way too deep a concept to do properly in children's entertainment, but, that said, they did a decent job of dumbing it down so maybe some of the kids could grasp it.\n\nAgain, it weird to see big celebrities come in when I don't think kids would appreciate it, especially Jeremy Piven, who I know is hard to get signed onto a movie.\n\nAgain, they spent a lot of time on weird effects or yada-yadaing through a sequence instead of concentrating on a movie of substance.\n\nAdmittedly the deliveries were pretty good, and the script was alright, despite including time travel, but with all the time spent on the dog, and avoiding action or spending too little time building a scene, the movie evens out with there being less interesting things that good.\n\nI think kids will get into, and find a lot of the movie, especially that poor dog, hilarious.",

The acting is bad, the humour is bad, the plot is generic and the action sequences are so cheesy, they're embarassing to watch.

When I was little I was having fun with the Spy Kids sequels,Lost dreams and Game over 3D. But I watched them again and had a second opinion thinking that they were stupid. This sequel makes them look like the godfather.\nIn the most recent Spy kids movie Jessica Alba is playing a spy who has character name that I really don't remember or care about,who has her last mission catches the bad guy has a baby. Year after that some time keeper villain or whatever the heck his name was,makes time go faster and wants to go back in time to spend more time with his father.Jessica Alba recruits her kids and they must take some diamond and stop the Armageddon device and the time keeper.\nWhat immediately ticked me off about this movie is all the marvel references like for example , there is a chase scene in the beginning where the kids are in some CGI spacecraft and there being chased by the time keepers henchmen and it looks like there on the green goblins glider. But wait the references don't stop there,they also have a fight sequence going on and one of the kids have some hammer hands and guess what he says \"it's hammer time\" and then he lifts one of his hands and lightning is surging through it. That's when I lost it.\nThe movie of course even brings back the original spy kids,but here's a problem with that,they do the cliche of he/she is dead but they come back for the finale of the film for fan service although I doubt this series has fans and with this movie they lost them.\nSpy Kids all the time in the world is one of those family movies that make me hate live action family movies while the sequels before this were bad this is the worst. I give Spy Kids:All the Time in the World a half out of five.",

When I was little I was having fun with the Spy Kids sequels,Lost dreams and Game over 3D. But I watched them again and had a second opinion thinking that they were stupid. This sequel makes them look like the godfather.\nIn the most recent Spy kids movie Jessica Alba is playing a spy who has character name that I really don't remember or care about,who has her last mission catches the bad guy has a baby. Year after that some time keeper villain or whatever the heck his name was,makes time go faster and wants to go back in time to spend more time with his father.Jessica Alba recruits her kids and they must take some diamond and stop the Armageddon device and the time keeper.\nWhat immediately ticked me off about this movie is all the marvel references like for example , there is a chase scene in the beginning where the kids are in some CGI spacecraft and there being chased by the time keepers henchmen and it looks like there on the green goblins glider. But wait the references don't stop there,they also have a fight sequence going on and one of the kids have some hammer hands and guess what he says \"it's hammer time\" and then he lifts one of his hands and lightning is surging through it. That's when I lost it.\nThe movie of course even brings back the original spy kids,but here's a problem with that,they do the cliche of he/she is dead but they come back for the finale of the film for fan service although I doubt this series has fans and with this movie they lost them.\nSpy Kids all the time in the world is one of those family movies that make me hate live action family movies while the sequels before this were bad this is the worst. I give Spy Kids:All the Time in the World a half out of five.",

Over-the-top movie written and directed by Robert Rodriguez.  The silly plot involves \"A retired spy(Jessica Alba) is called back into action, and to bond with her new step-children, she invites them along for the adventure to stop the evil Timekeeper from taking over the world.\"~ imdb.com\r\n\r\nBesides Alba, there's plenty of many respected actors/ comedians including Ricky Gervais who does the voice for the family mechanical dog Argonaut who probably did it just for the paycheck, comedian and actor Joel McHale playing the role as the unsuspecting husband Wilbur Wilson who just did it for the paycheck, Jeremy Piven playing more than one role who has played forgettable roles in past.  Young little children should be able to enjoy this more than adults since common sense is not in their children's nature but to us adults- it's a total dud experience.\r\n\r\n1 out of 4",

The ongoing rivalry between the kids, the pregnant mother which shifts into the mother running around smashing spies with a kid hugging her front side in a carrier, the complexities of 2 kids getting to appreciate their stepmom, some decent humor, and most of all, the spy stuff. Spy kids always makes you feel like our world is filled with the coolest gadgets ever and this installment in the series pulled that off very well. There were even some very good life messages thrown in.\n\nMINIOR SPOILER ALERT: They do bring back the 2 kids from the original Spy Kids movies. I thought that was going to make it incredibly lame but they did it in a pretty reasonable way.\n\nNOTE: This film came out a few months before Hugo did. I guess there was some sort of bug going around the filmmaking world where clocks are just the coolest things ever. The intro for Game of Thrones which was also released in 2011 a few months before this film is also very reminiscent of clocks.\n\nOther random thoughts: the dog actually grew on me as the film progressed. That sort of character is hard to do right and most films absolutely blow it but this one did it right. The child acting was pretty decent as well. The film has superb pacing and the length is also perfect.\n\nON THE WHOLE: If you are into this general genre, this installment definitely satisfies. I was extremely upset with the 3rd Spy kids film (the one inside of the video game) so I am super happy to see the series back in business.\n\nDO YOU HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER MOVIES TO APPRECIATE THIS ONE? Not really. You should probably see the first one but as I said before, the 3rd one was extremely weak and you can skip right past that one and watch this one without experiencing any plot gaps between films.",

Even Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their original Spy Kids roles wasn't even satisfying at all because they became bland and they showed their abilities to not act very well anymore.

He may not be able to nail the appeals-to-the-adults aspect that makes the best kid flicks, but he's got the juvenile mentality down pretty \\m/ well. \n\nSpy Kids 4 checks in with our original kids and introduces a new spy family.

It just takes a lot of effort and the proper mindset to do so.\n\nSo yeah, I'd have liked to end this project on a better note, but you can't win 'em all.

Besides bringing back Alexa Vega and Darryl Sabarra, we're adding in Jessica Alba, Joel McHale, and Jeremy Piven. If you can overlook the glaring plotholes and dumb dialogue, it's a great ride. It just takes a lot of effort and the proper mindset to do so.\n\nSo yeah, I'd have liked to end this project on a better note, but you can't win 'em all. We've got Django Unchained to look forward to later this year from Tarantino and Rodriguez' Machete Kills shouldnt be too far behind. I'm already scheming my next project, so look for that in October. Until then, I'll just be spending all my time at the movie theater. Yay!\n\nhttp://www.expletivedleted.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

Other than a ripper horror movie, nothing excites me more than a quality kids flick. I was also a fan of Spy Kids 2 but the series ran out of puff with part 3. It wasn't very good... and now 6 years later Robert Rodriguz returns to the OSS (Office Of Strategic Services) with an all new adventure with a new kids. This movie is a fresh and welcome return to the quality of the original movie. The two new kids are great and Jessica Alba has a lot of fun as their Spy-Mum. The two kids from the original trilogy return as adult spies which continutes the cannon nicely. The juvenile laughs are littered throughout the movie with stupid and zany gadets galore, loads of toilet gags and a great cartoony villain played by Jeremy Piven. Most amusing was Ricky Gervais providing the voice of an animatronic spy-dog (in typical Gervais style). Rodriguz is a movie-making machine... he does it all... and I love that he balances adults movies with kids flicks (Desperado, Sin City, From Dust Till Dawn.... VS.... Spy Kids, Shorts and Shark Boy & Lava Girl)... and he practically makes them all on his own. Spy Kids 4 is great stuff. If you've got kids then check it out... and if you don't have kids then so what? See it anyway. My only dissapointment was that Machete's character (Danny Trejo) only appeared for a split second.

            "content": "The 4th Spy Kids installment came unexpectedly, and with moderate commercial success. The Cortez family from the previous movies has been pushed aside for a new cast of actors in a new spy family, the Cortez-Wilsons. The original kids Carmen and Juni do appear in this installment, but act as supporting characters for the new cast. Even their potential to trigger nostalgia for older Spy Kids fans, who watched the originals when they were young enough to enjoy them (like me), isn't enough to save the weak jokes and nonsensical plot here.\n\nThe storyline in Spy Kid 4 is disjointed and unoriginal, and ultimately, makes absolutely no sense. The screenwriters probably spent little time attempting to develop a somewhat cohesive plot to follow. The acting is wooden and stiff, as is the misplaced dialogue. The weak attempts at humor are depressing, and, at times, cringe-inducing.\n\nThe first two Spy Kids films were far from perfect, but at least the absurd ideas made for funny results and repeated viewings. When you're making ridiculous fantasy spy films for a young audience, you need to be creative and take some risks. Things like the Thumb-Thumbs, fantastical creatures on the Lost Island, and a four-headed David Shaloub made the original films entertaining.\n\nThe simple charm and connection between family members also made the originals work. How they interact, argue as families do, and ultimately band together to save the day was fun to see. But any hint of those feelings in this installment is lost by the lack of effort by all involved with 4. I tried, but failed, to find a single good thing in this movie. If you want a simple adventure spy movie for the whole family, maybe not the best one, but at something with a sense of fun and creativity, then stick with the first two Spy Kids, because this is just sad and unnecessary.\n\n1/5\n\n(review originally posted on release, but has since been edited and improved by author on April 11, 2017)",

Spy Kids 4 All the Time in the World is just wow it is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life, it should have just ended with Game Over. But what's bad about it? is it the fact that you have to keep a look out for a number on screen so you can scratch your scratch and sniff card which makes you feel really stupid? the fact that you wear 3D glasses to? It makes you look like a total Bafoon, I mean do you really need a scratch and sniff to feel like your actually there CAUSE WHEN I WALK AROUND THE STREET I DON'T NEED TO RUB A SCRATCH AND SNIFF TO SMELL A FLOWER I'M PASSING.It dosn't feel like a Spy Kids movie and one of the main reasons for me is because the main characters aren't Karmen and Juni, yes they appear in it older which is kind of cool but when I think Spy Kids I think of them, why? BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE OTHER MOVIE'S. Now had they always changed the actors maybe I wouldn't complain as much but I think the main reason is these new kids aren't memorable what so ever, I can't even remember there names to be honest.Then there's the CGI again, oh my goodness they over use CGI in this film so much, it's like Game Over all over again, except in Game Over it's kind of understandable because the creators want to make everything look like the characters are in a game, but with this film it's real life and the effects look cheap and stupid.There are some funny moments but these moments are very rare and I mean very very very very rare. I could talk about this forever but let me rap it up saying that this film is OK for kids 3-7 maybe but for fans of the Spy Kids series don't bother wasting your TIME on this rubbish film....

The cast is wasted on this movie. \r\n\r\nJessica Alba in her black spy outfit looks great, though, and I kind of wish she had been cast as either Natasha Romanov or Selina Kyle in the Avengers or Batman movies respectively. She doesn't embarrass herself in this sub-par film and I've been impressed with her growth as an actress the last few years. I think she could have pulled off either role and looked amazing doing it.",

            "content": "Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is a remarkable film. And not because it's particularly any good. It's a remarkable film because it makes Spy Kids 3D: Game Over look like Citizen Kane. It makes the worst film in the Spy Kids series be the second worst film in the Spy Kids series. That's how completely awful All the Time in the World is.\n\nSo the very first scene has Jeremy Piven getting chased by a nine month pregnant Jessica Alba....NINE MONTHS. There is no possible way that a spy agency would ever allow a NINE MONTH PREGNANT WOMAN into the field to do a job. There's NO WAY. Ever heard of a little thing called MATERNITY LEAVE? Oh wait, it's a kids movie and she's doing a bit that's funny to kids, right... But just because it's a kids movie does not mean that the humor has to be stupid. In fact kids should be offended by how dumb the humor is. That opening scene alone is entirely indicative of how utterly offensive this movie is.\n\nThe gaps in common sense and logic are abundant to the point of absurdity. The people in this movie are so stupid, it's any wonder they all haven't died already from sheer unconscionable stupidity. And while we're on the subject of death, the new Spy Kids are without a doubt some of the most obnoxious children I've ever seen in a movie (the girl especially). I kept hoping that they'd both horribly die at some point, but alas that was just wishful thinking on my part. I kept hoping and praying that they'd suffer and die from some horribly gruesome and sadistic series of Saw-like traps. Too bad that never happened...but a guy can dream can't he?\n\nNot only are they supremely obnoxious and irritating as characters, but they're also some of the worst child actors I've ever seen. Should I cut them some slack? Not at all. Just because they're kids does not excuse them from being atrocious actors. Want good child actors? See Natalie Portman in Leon: The Professional, Saoirse Ronan in Atonement or Chloe Grace Moretz in  500 Days of Summer or Kick-Ass. Even the original Spy Kids Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega were better in their first movie than these kids.\n\nSadly, the adult actors don't really fare that much better. Jessica Alba still looks great as always, even when delivering some of worst lines of dialogue this side of the stratosphere. It makes me die on the inside to see Joel McHale in this movie. JEFF WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MOVIE? YOU ARE JEFF WINGER FROM COMMUNITY! YOU BELONG AT GREENDALE. YOU ARE WITTY SARCASTIC JEFF, NOT AWKWARD AND UNFUNNY DAD WILBUR WILSON. GET THAT. Jeremy Piven I liked you so much better when you were Ari Gold in Entourage. And Ricky Gervais as the attack dog? No...just...no...\n\nNow I'll admit that I liked that Robert Rodriguez brought back the original Spy Kids for the film, if only to remind me of how much better the first and to a lesser extent the second and third films are to this utter abysmal abomination of a fourth movie. Those were the days...\n\nAnd I'm sure I'd be remisced if I neglected to mention some of the completely revolting puns and lines of dialogue in this movie regarding time. Thing is I love puns. Just not ones that small children who don't know what's good for them can understand. Puns like \"Clocked you\", \"Time's up\" or \"This time we better stop the Time Keeper from stopping time..\" Really? Really? There's a special rung in Hell reserved just for bad movies like this. Thanks for ruining my childhood...\n\nBut the biggest offense this movie has to offer is the very fact that it's another film in a long line of garbage that has kept Robert Rodriguez from making the one movie that he actually does need to make which will most certainly save his career: Sin City 2.",
