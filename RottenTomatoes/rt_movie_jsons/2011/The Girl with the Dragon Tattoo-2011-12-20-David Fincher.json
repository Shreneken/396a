Eventually joining Blomkvist on his dangerous quest for the truth is Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an unusual but ingenious investigator whose fragile trust is not easily won.",

It probably suffered on original release from following so closely on the heels of the excellent Swedish adaptation; but at more of a distance, the Fincher style does suit the dark themes - but like that earlier film, the brutal sexual assault in the film's first half is largely unnecessary at all, let alone unnecessary in terms of its graphic nature.\n\nMuted lighting, excellent cinematography and editing all contribute to the sinister tone; Craig is good, and Mara is excellent. The title sequence is a classic Fincher one and carries the sense that this will be a very particular sort of neo-Bond film. It is, of course, far more of a mystery thriller than a Bond film, but it's a shame we never got to see how Fincher and Mara would have taken the other two stories in the trilogy. All told it's a relatively minor, if interesting, entry in Fincher's filmography.",

This feels like it is Fincher's darkest movie in some ways, I had some moments like JESUS we are really going to have to sit through this. The editing is of course perfection, as well as the sound design and mixing. I do think Zodiac, se7en and the Social Network are still a bit better, mainly because those were in some parts the same as this movie, but i have had watched earlier then this one.",

Rooney Mara, in a breakout turn, can't quite match the fierce Noomi Rapace, but she puts her own brittle, damaged spin on the character. Daniel Craig doesn't try to match his castmates in affecting a slight Swedish accent, but he's good in a role that is far from Bond, a reporter who is smart enough to investigate a decades-old murder and possible cover-up but may be in over his head when facing up against European neo-Nazis. The production values have the usual Fincher touches--under-lit digital cinematography, brisk editing, the Trent Reznor-Atticus Ross ('The Social Network') score. But even if you're not familiar with the original, this isn't the gripping mystery to solve. It gets quite complicated, juggling many threads, motives, and characters, some of which gets lost on the viewer. It's also somewhat short on thrills. The best scene is a brilliantly cut silent stalking in a house, scored only by footsteps, the wind and ambient winter sound effects. It brings you the edge of your seat. Too bad the rest of this is only moderately entertaining and occasionally gripping, a lesser Fincher film",

            "content": "Not quite in the top 5 of David Fincher's best films ('Se7en', 'The Social Network', 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' and 'Zodiac') but it does come close. And this is somebody who found a lot to like about all his films, including his lesser ones like 'Alien 3' and 'Panic Room'.\n\nDespite being often considered a remake, personally prefer to call it a second adaptation of the book. The book is a fantastic read, and as an adaptation while it is condensed and has some changes Fincher's film still adheres to the basic tone of the book as does the Swedish version. Of the two versions, the Swedish version just gets the edge for its incredible atmosphere complete with bleakness, chills, shocks and is more authentic, with Noomi Rapace burning the screen enigmatically with her presence.\n\nWhere Fincher's film improves over the previous version are in four areas. One is the production values, which are far more audacious here. The cinematography, both bleakly moody and exquisite to look at, is more cinematic and perfectly captures the frozen landscape which is like a character in itself. The film is very tightly edited too in a way that is distinctively Fincher. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' music score is another winner of theirs, it is haunting and gives a really unnerving vibe, combined with some clever sound mixing. The script, even when condensed, is more polished and tighter and also has more flow. While Lisbeth is a fascinating and complex character in the Swedish film, the Lisbeth in Fincher's film has even more complexity and more variation of emotions.\n\nFincher's direction is exemplary, showing a mastery of visual style and mood setting, ensuring that the film stays intriguing throughout the length. In lesser hands and with less assured pacing, with the long running time 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' could have been a long haul but had plenty of intrigue. Much of the storytelling is gripping, and while not as authentic or quite as masterful in atmosphere like the Swedish counterpart was it has its fair share of chills, twists and turns (without being convoluted or illogical) and shock value as well as a murky bleakness. Contrary to what some believe, this second adaptation did have point (was fearing it wouldn't), as it made the story more accessible and gave it more exposure.\n\nGood acting helps. Daniel Craig is very wisely restrained, the character should have a quiet determination and dignity which Craig handles very well. Christopher Plummer is simply terrific as well, one of his best performances in recent years, while Stellan Skasgard is frighteningly demented and Yorick van Wageningen is unsettlingly sadistic. Robin Wright does her best with a shallow character. Best of all is a magnificent Rooney Mara, such a multi-layered performance and sees Mara not just playing the role but disappearing into it. See her appearance for example, so committed that when you see her in other films you would not believe that it's the same person.\n\nThere are faults however. Did not think much of the Gothic James Bond-like opening sequence that just felt jarring and out of place. Nor with the accents, which were a mix for some of the actors of having one too heavy or thick (Wright) or not attempting one at all (Craig). The decision to use both English and Swedish in some scenes did have a tendency to confuse, while the central relationship (mostly successfully done) did feel underdeveloped and, even for characters that are the heart of the story, takes over the story a little too much somewhat.\n\nAll in all, almost as good as the Swedish version and better than both of that film's heavily flawed but still worthy sequels. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This may not go down as one of Fincher's greatest achievements and the Swedish version may also be revered in higher regard, but there's lot to enjoy still.\n\nThe performances from all involved are exactly what you'd expect, the film has top class actors, Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgaard. But it's Mara's performance that captivated my attention throughout the film, she is excellent as Lisburn Salander, the troubled computer hacker whom Criag's character, Mikael, hires to assist with the investigation. She brings a quite intensity that slowly builds up as the film progresses, leading to a climax I thought reflected her whole journey in the film.\n\nThe performances are aided by a solid script from Steven Zaillian. Usually this is the case with Fincher's films, think of Fight Club and The Social Network as prime examples. The cinematography from Jeff Cronanweth is equally immersive as he manages to stylistically combine the dull Scandinavian landscapes with the films menacing narrative.\n\nThe films pacing is perhaps the consistent Achilles heel, particularly in the opening half of the film, but overall it wasn't a huge distraction\n\nI truly enjoyed this adaptation, Fincher is without one of the great American filmmakers there has been, while this won't stand at the top, it can still be appreciated and stand alongside others in his ever growing filmmaking memoir.",

Although I found some scenes of hers wooden, the guarded nature and enigma of Lisbeth eventually wins out. Daniel Craig, reliable as ever, also adds depth to Mikael, even if his method of simply toning down a British accent starkly contrasts to Mara's more concretely Swedish take. The presence of talented supporting stars such as Skarsgard, Plummer, and Wright deepens the acting capabilities on display, although the Western stars might have attracted the ire of Swedish purists. Above all, Fincher offers up an engaging visual outing and the dark, unforgiving source material is delivered with aplomb. Some of the more racy scenes will have alienated many, but I found it an important step in establishing the character of Lisbeth and developing the dual aura of both vulnerability and danger present in her actions.

Fincher does everything in his power to ensure the audience understands what is going on and beautifully connects the characters' separate lives into one storyline as the film progresses.

Daniel Craig proves that he shouldn't just be considered as the \"guy-who-plays-James Bond\". He delivers a very good performance and informs us of his talent and worth. Stellan Skarsgard was equally good in his limited role, which (in my opinion) seemed to parallel John Doe from Se7en. But I think everyone who watches this film will unanimously agree that Rooney Mara was the standout. She gives an absolutely brilliant, ruthless performance showcasing a complex, antisocial character with a dark past.\n\nThe sound design and score were amazing and manage to complement the dark tone of the storyline perfectly.

But this movie isn't paced well, and contains some unbelievably disturbing content that simply goes too far. I'm a horror movie junkie, I watch a lot of violent and intense content. The rape scene was excessive, exploitative, gross and horrific to watch. We would have more than understood the gravity of what happened if he had unzipped his pants, she screamed, and then it cut away. Instead we get an agonizingly long 5 or so minutes of pure nastiness. It doesn't make the story any better, and it just feels mean spirited, excessive, and over the top. I give credit to Mara's acting ability for selling the scene so well, which is a big part of what makes it so awful to watch. But I really question Fincher's judgement in putting this in the film. It ultimately distracts from what is mostly a very compelling storyline, instead of discussing the great performances, cinematography, and thrilling intrigue- I'm willing to bet most viewers of this movie will simply remember it for this one scene, which is disappointing. It goes too far in several other places (her revenge scene is equally nasty, but not nearly as disturbing as he clearly deserves it while she was an innocent victim). There was no reason for this movie to be almost 3 hours, cut out something like 45 minutes (especially cutting out the exploitative content) and you would have a tight, sharp, thrilling crime story.",

            "content": "David Fincher's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is an ambitious, gripping and suspenseful thriller that offers a fresh interpretation of Stieg Larsson's beloved book. With his ninth feature, director David Fincher crafted a mesmerizing murder mystery that showcased his sick strengths as a filmmaker. Using captivating cinematography, Fincher draws viewers into the world of two dedicated detectives that investigate the mysterious murder of a wealthy family. From intimate close-ups to tense long shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's gothic setting. Fincher showcases immense control over craftsmanship, proving to be an expert at building a suspenseful mood and atmosphere. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses clever narrative twists to keep viewers absorbed in the murder mystery. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Rooney Mara delivers one of the best performances of her career as Lisabeth Salander. With mesmerizing expressions, she conveys the angst, loneliness and introverted persona of an eccentric computer hacker that struggles to fit in with societal norms. Daniel Craig is equally excellent in the role of an obsessive detective that is determined to solve a mystery. He imbues layers of humanity into what could have otherwise been a one-dimensional character. Although \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is undeniably a taut literary adaptation, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a lengthy running-time. At nearly three hours, it tests the viewer's patience and may have benefitted from a tighter cut. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. At a time when American audiences have never been exposed to the Swedish book, it's a stirring reminder that stories of foreign female detectives are worth adapting to the big-screen.",

            "content": "Very good and shocking movie. \nGreetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.\n\nLet's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple re-telling of the story.\n\nDaniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger, niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.\n\nUnlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans, the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.\n\nIt's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.\n\nAll of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander. 8.5/10",

The first 15 or so minutes which introduces the titular characters, and the last 45 minutes with its plot reveals, are the best portions garnering genuine interest, mystery and intensity.  Everything in the middle however is just dull and long-winded.  I'm usually amazed by Fincher's cinematography and plot twists, but neither one of these blew me away here.  I've never read the novel this movie is based on, so whether or not this adaptation (also a remake) was accurate is irrelevant to me.  What I do know is that, once again, this is another film where the length is wholly unjustified.  A detective thriller about a cold case murder does not need to clock 20 minutes shy of 3 hours in order to be entertaining.  This could've easily been at the most 2 hours, maybe 2 and 15, without losing anything significant in the way of storytelling and subplots.  The performances were very good, and the opening Bond-esque title sequence was pretty badass.  Despite these qualities however, the flaws severely hold the movie back from being one of Fincher's greats.  I also hated the abrupt ending.  She sees Craig with his girlfriend, is heartbroken, drives off in her motorcycle, then *boom* roll credits?  Lame.  This was a rather pedestrian effort from a usually great filmmaker.",

As far as this American remake from 2011 goes, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a solid investigative thriller. I really like good mysteries and I thought this one did a good job keeping my interest. The movie is pretty long, but for the most part, I was very engaged. I thought the movie was very gritty, which as far as I know is pretty true to the source material. However, I think someone like David Fincher who is no stranger to dark subject matter lends a strong hand to a movie like this behind the camera. I also thought the performances were very good on screen, particularly Rooney Mara in the main role. The disturbing material in the movie is even more impactful due to the excellent performances. The mystery kept me on the edge of my seat but everything in the main story wraps up when there is one whole sequence left in the movie. I get that the movie probably had franchise plans, and I hope we do get to see them someday from the same team, but the last scene in the movie feels kind of abrupt and out of place. Nonetheless, I think if you like mysteries or movies that aren't afraid to get dark and disturbing, this is a solid choice.",

In fact, the entire soundtrack is fantastic and throughout college it was one of my regular \"study\" playlists. Speaking of college, I had a huge crush on Lisbeth Salander when I first saw this movie, and although that magic may be gone, Mara still provides a wonderful performance I don't think she gets enough credit for. Mara is at her best when she's getting revenge â€” horrifying scenes you can't help but smile. Even though this movie keeps going well after most others would roll credits, it does so in a good way. While I rarely require a happy ending, I would've liked to see Lisbeth and Mikael end up together, continuing that unusual relationship. One issue I had with the movie was when Lisbeth asks Mikael if she can kill the villain â€” the Lisbeth we've grown to love at that point would just do it without hesitation.",

Right from the beginning with that stellar opening sequence that sets the tone for the rest of the film to come, you know what you are about to watch will be simply amazing. Even though the film is almost 3 hours in length, Fincher keeps the pace of the story moving with quick speed that never ever bores the audience. One of the smartest decisions this film made was to allow the audience to get to know Mikeal and Lisbeth each separately. What their stories are, what they are like as individuals. The two do not even meet until after the 1 hour mark, but when they do it feels completely natural and right. It is no secret that the source material they worked with from the novel is incredibly dark and complex. I appreciate Fincher for not holding back and truly portraying the ugliness that people can truly be. Rape and torture are just the surface of it, it goes far deeper than just that, and Fincher shows us that brilliantly. Some people will certainly have issues with it, but I for one think it is just haunting to watch play out in the way it did. I really wished that the studio would let Fincher, Craig, and Mara team up once again to finish the trilogy they set out to make. I sincerely believe that it could have been one of the best movie trilogies ever put to film. However, I am so grateful that we got to witness this beautiful film on the silver screen.",

The way that the film eases the viewer into the lives of Mikael (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth (Rooney Mara) was enthralling and refreshing. I found myself caring much more about these characters than I would have if they'd just been dumped into a cliche murder mystery.\n\nLike many of David Fincher's films, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't spell everything out for you in neon letters. It isn't obsessed with providing answers, instead allowing the viewer to piece together the puzzle themselves.\n\nEvery performance in this film is spectacular. The chemistry between Craig and Mara is intoxicating, and it spills over into their performances. Their characters just feel right together, complimenting each other in the ways that each are deficient. Stellen Skarsgard does an excellent job portraying Martin as a kind, normal man; and the reveal of his true nature is chilling.\n\nThe inquisitive portion of my brain would have loved a reason for the way that Martin's father killed his victims, an explanation for his use of the Biblical references. Whether that is a facet of Fincher denying the viewer an easy answer or an unfortunate oversight, I'm not certain.\n\nI thought that the final portion of the film felt extremely forced, and was incredibly difficult to follow. I had no idea what Lisbeth was doing, and the reveal was inconsequential. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if it held some greater importance there.\n\nThere is one scene that I have an immense problem with in this film, keeping me from counting it as one of my favorites: the scene where Lisbeth is raped. I understand the purpose, but I think that showing it was unnecessarily gratuitous and exploitative. Rape is horrible enough that it could have been implied to the same effect, without subjecting the viewer to the details. Not one person would think that the rape was any less horrible because they didn't see it.\n\nOverall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent thriller and it is disappointing that Fincher will not direct the rest of the series. I would have much preferred a sequel to this instead of the dumpster fire that is Gone Girl.",

David Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth give such a great aesthetic to the movie and the overall style is just soâ€¦ Fincher. Rooney Mara gave her best performance in any movie yet. She's really captivating and, although Lisbeth might not be very pleasing to look at and has clearly has some mental problems, Rooney Mara does give her a special touch that make you like her despite her shortcomings. The script by Steven Zaillian is also phenomenal, he did a really good job translating the book to screenplay. Daniel Craig is also really good as Mikael Blomkvist, along with Stellan Skarsgard as Martin Vanger. The use of CGI is also, wow, Fincher really knows when to use it to his advantage and when not to. Although, if you really pay attention to it, you can pick out which scenes are and aren't improved with CGI. As I said the cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is just amazing. I really liked his earlier work, but now it has a new kind of updated aesthetic due to the Swedish landscapes. Those landscapes really help with building the overall feel of the movie. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is, yet again, really great. Their scores for The Social Network, this movie and Gone Girl are really interesting and have a feel and mood to them that just screams Fincher. Overall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo makes you think and feel in a really interesting way and it's a great experience to have. ",

Therefore, some of my pet peeves about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo may lie somewhere in the story itself rather than the editing. Don't get me wrong. The movie is great. I immensely look forward to sequels. Rooney Mara's performance alone is enough to want to see the series continue. The entire cast is fantastic, but what seemed to bug me most during the movie is the extended amount of time spent on some elements of the story, like her being a ward of the state, but how much time wasn't spent on explaining the backstory re: Daniel Craig's lawsuit and relationship with Robin Penn. A lot effort was spent building up the need for Christopher Plummer to hire Daniel Craig to solve this mystery, yet very little into connecting Craig and Mara together. For someone so unsociable, she unnaturally connected quickly with Craig. Then, when it was all said and done, the story seemed to wrap up too quickly as compared to the build up. So, while the story was good, the directing was good and the cast was good, the piecing together of the film itself seemed haphazardly done. Was this editing? Was it the story itself? At 2:34 long, I would have expected a better flow, but nonetheless, my high expectations were met and I look forward to more.",

David Fincher; as always, nails it when it comes to execute a mystery or crime features and has a powerful screenplay to support adapted by Steve Zaillian. Daniel Craig justifies his part but in here, Rooney Mara steals the show by giving an outstanding performance on her parallel role with him.

It's a further development in the modern psychological thriller which hasn't been attempted before. It's true, the plot is somewhat complex enough to merit multiple viewings, but the overall brilliance of the film is enough to bring more cinema enthusiasts around for a second or third viewing on its own. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have an intense and volatile chemistry throughout the film, and bring a somewhat visceral dimension to Martin Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.\n\tHowever, its the psychological aspect which adds much of the film's edge. This is a dark movie with no restraint placed on the showings of manipulation, mystery, murder, and several different types of abuse which take place onscreen. Its a spellbinding film from beginning to end, with the negative aspects clearly visible as well. The first truly captivating modern psychological thriller in almost a decade.",

For a remake that is three years after the original, David Fincher has created the grittiness that really does show the audience how intense and violent this movie is. The revenge rape scene is intense you could cringe. I stomach through it all and I'm not disturbed by it and what can I say? Revenge is a b***h. I love the cinematography in this, it makes it look so gloomy you can tell it's David Fincher's style. The best thing about this film is Rooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander as a computer hacker. The opening credits sequence kinda reminds me of something out a James Bond film. I mean, what can you really expect? It's Daniel Craig as James Bond but in this he plays a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist. So what can I say about the remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Well, I love it and this is a great film. It's gripping, dark and brutal in some areas. Very captivating for it's story, the cinematography, the direction taken from David Fincher and a great performance from Rooney Mara.

The film revolves around a girl who goes missing 40 years prior and obsessive about finding her, the uncle (Christopher Plummer), hires Mikeal Blomkvist (Craig) to uncover the mystery behind it who in turn hires socially awkward, goth and vengeful freelance hacker Lisbeth Salander (Mara), as they come close to uncover the mystery, they find secrets hidden inside the family which might shock everyone. Rooney Mara, nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in this film, made sure as long as she is in the screen, she steals the show. When I first saw the film 3 years back, I couldn't recognize that was the beautiful looking Mara. Rooney Mara's Lisbeth is vengeful, traumatized and much more humane than her Swedish counterpart portrayed by Noomi Rapace. \n\nDaniel Craig, an actor better known as the 'Blond' James Bond, delivers a stunning performance in this film as an investigative journalist who unravels the mystery. He is seductive, friendly, enthusiastic and confused person. All these emotions are portrayed effortlessly by Craig. \n\nOther cast members, specially Plummer and SkÃ¥rsgard also delivers killer acts in this film. Some scenes may disturb the viewer, but overall this is a decent, edge-of-the-seat thriller which makes you keep your eye glued to screen.

We have here a very well worked script, not only in the construction and immersion of what is being investigated, but in the construction of an environment as a whole, its two protagonists are spectacularly presented and developed, all their nuances and dikes are shown, not always Played in the viewer's face, but for those who are paying attention, he perceives everything that guides our protagonists, just as the Vanger family, all their hatred of inheritance, their feuds and disagreements are extremely immersive, fault of this excellent fincher script that tells the story of Mikael Bomkvist (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a man who lives within social standards but is professionally discredited and a woman living out of social standards very professionally credited, the two unite to investigate a case in a family, Where there has been a disappearance more than 30 years. The film talks about invasion of privacy, domestic violence and abuse in a rough way, is like a punch in the stomach, the character of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is incredible, a Gothic, with a completely opposite look of what is described in Social conventions that fight against itself in a search for something real. Technically, the film is very good, first the photography, we have nothing from another world, but the photography is always sober, gray, with darker tones, very traditional Fincher films, except in moments of flashbacks, there the Lighter tones take over, the film is clear and with a paler color palette, we can observe a care in this matter in every film, and the soundtrack is always sagacious, nothing memorable, but it is there, always. Rooney Mara, accustomed to cute roles is here completely decharacterized, and makes a very sober acting, just like her partner. Finally, \"Millenium - Men who did not love women\" is a movie that pleases.",

The book is the first in a series and though the movie is a wonderful standalone, you can tell that they hoped to do more. The sequels though have been post poned for some time, but rumors swirl of Fede Alvarez to Direct. The director on the 2011 film was the meticulous David Fincher. He worked the story into submission. The film won a best editing Oscar to inform how well put together it is.\n\nMara Rooney dug deep into this role, that comes off lie a female superhero. Jessica drw is pretty much the Salamander charcters with powers. She plays the part with great contrast to Daniel Craig, whos charcter's life is tough in different ways. The list of potential suspects are also performed well and lead you to believe anyone on this little island could be the criminal. One such performance is by the gentle men from marvels \"Thor/Avengers\", who gives a layered performance of his character who is also putting on a performance.\n\nHaving never seen the original or first adaption of the source material I am totally unaware of what could have been. Critics say it was more faithful to the books, but nevertheless. This adaption is moving and confident with each step. The Swedish setting was a nice change of pace from the Americas that we most often see on film. In between the meaty parts, this thriller does seem like a TV show thats gone on far too long. This is due in part to it needed to cover so much ground in order to get to the next reveal and because they are leadin up to sequels. Being a lover of sequels and having a potential looming by the Evil Dead director, I honestly hope Rooney comes back due to her commitment to the role. Otherwise we might get the same girl from all Alvarez's movies, Jane Levy. The film is worth more than one watch",

I cannot say because I haven't read it. But what I can tell you is that the Swedish version is simply a better told/paced, engaging, and well rounded story with (lead) characters whom you can get to know, like, and sympathise with.\n\nI found this very difficult with Fincher's take, in which the story and characters are kept at arms length from the audience. Lisbeth is also much colder and withdrawn, and although nobody can possibly condone the terrible things that she has had to endure in her troubled past, I found little in her to sympathise with. Likewise, Daniel Craig's Mickael is more of a husk and defeated man, and unlike the Swedish version, I felt no real bond or connection between the two main leads in both the solving of the crime/mystery with which they were presented, and the personal emotional connection which they flirt with while trying to crack the case.\n\nDue largely to Lisbeth's abusive past, the audience can accept that such a person would naturally be cautious and keep their cards close to their chest. But in the Swedish version this accomplished whilst also showing us glimpses of warmth, emotion, and humanity, whereas Fincher decides to keep Lisbeth more or less catatonic. I cannot possibly get on board with a character like that, even I do regret hearing about her abusive past.\n\nTo summarise, buy and watch the far superior Swedish version. 3/5",

            "content": "David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is about as good as its nauseatingly dense source material would allow. I'm no fan of Stieg Larsson's novel, nor the original Swedish film version. Fincher, however, is able to milk this puppy for all its worth. It's pulp for mass consumption. It hides its faults behind bursts of violence in the name of girl power. Yet, somehow, Fincher (with a big assist from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) makes it compelling.\n\nOur three primary characters are Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Vanger is a wealthy industrialist haunted by the disappearance and presumed death of his niece, Harriet. Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist hired by Vanger to hopefully give the Harriet's investigation new life. Salander, meanwhile, is a brilliant investigator with a penchant for violence-especially against her vile parole officer. She's brought in to assist Blomkvist in the investigation, which pits them against the Vangers-a clan of Nazis, recluses, drunks, and at least one murderer.\n\nIt takes nearly an hour for Blomkvist and Salander to connect, yet the film is oddly at its best when they are apart. Their connection isn't developed as much as it should be, and while they're focusing on the investigation, we're treated to a great deal of research-leafing through archives and photo albums. The character-building stuff, however, is strong. It helps us establish an early connection to our protagonists, even if we don't always agree with their actions.\n\nFincher's direction is very good, though perhaps not as flashy as you might expect (the opening credits being an obvious exception). The mood is instead primarily established by the film's score. Reznor and Ross, of course, won Oscars for their work on The Social Network last year. Their contribution to this film is just as strong. Without the presence of such an unusual and atmospheric score, there's little to distinguish this film from the dozen or so other high-profile potboilers of recent memory.\n\nThe film's other saving grace is Rooney Mara, whose portrayal of Salander is career-making. She's a steely individual with mountains of psychological issues, yet despite her problems and some of the more disturbing things she does, she's an immensely likable individual. She commands your attention whenever she's onscreen, and when she's off it, you long for her to return soon.\n\nDaniel Craig and Christopher Plummer disappoint slightly, if only because they play somewhat passive characters very passively. Their performances, then, are appropriate, but they aren't the most exciting individuals to spend almost three hours with. Robin Wright and Stellan Skarsgard also appear in two of the film's more prevalent supporting roles.\n\nI hope Fincher returns to this series for installments two and three. He'd be the only reason I'd bother to watch them because even though I did enjoy this film, it's not enough to give the stories a pass. That said, I also hope he doesn't abandon other properties entirely. His previous two films before this (The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) were my two favorite films from their respective years. This one won't sniff my top ten, but it's better than it probably should be, and it's a worthy whodunnit from one of cinema's greatest modern auteurs.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011-review/",

David Fincher's dark take on the films story benefited the movie in so many ways. The entire tone and theme of the film is so creepy and chilling in so many scenes but it is so fantastic to watch. Daniel Craig and Rooney Marra are terrific. Both actors are extremely devoted to their roles making them very convincing and believable.  Their chemistry on screen also binds perfectly with each other, both two dark mysterious characters that I really enjoyed watching. The films pace is also remarkably fast. You would think a film nearly three hours long will drag at times or get really slow, but not this one. I was completely invested into the story getting fed with engaging dialogue and gritty details. I also loved the visual aspect of the film. The cold snowy scenes really added to chilling, dark perspective Fincher was going for.

A troubled punk-chick who bears the scars of being a ward of the state since the age of 12 and lumbered with a legal guardian who demands sexual favours, repeatedly violating and abuses her, Lisbeth is no-one's victim. \n\nUtilising her weapons of intelligence, resourcefulness and unparalleled technological abilities, the distrustful and ruthless girl finds her way out of any situation. When the morally scrupulous Blomkvist's investigation hits a wall, Vanger engages Lisbeth and her gifts to dig deeper. \n\nAs the duos paths intersect they uncover dark secrets, attract deadly danger and each other whilst unearthing some ugly revelations. \n\nThis intricately dense and edgy thriller is a film of substance. An English remake by director David Fincher of 2009's Danish director Niels Arden Oplev Swedish adaptation of Stieg Larsson's best-selling Millennium trilogy, this is a story with a great sense of place, intriguing relationships and an enigmatic central character.\n\nAlthough some seduced by the novel or the original film may not feel the need for an English reworking and dismiss this film as just another Hollywood money grab, it does in fact stand alone with decidedly different strengths.\n\nThe marvellous pop-culture character Lisbeth; originally portrayed by the wonderfully commanding Noomi Rapace who inspired fear and awe, is now played by Rooney Mara. With just as much impact but with a more quiet intrigue to her presence, Mara delivers both innocence and volatility in balanced measure.\n\nBlomkvist, pioneered by Michael Nyqvist now replaced with Daniel Craig is perhaps the only casting misstep. Not due to Craig's acting; which surprisingly is very good, but his age. The chemistry between Craig and Mara is palpable, but with the age gap almost 10 years closer, it doesn't deliver on the same level of emotional complication as depicted in both predecessors. \n\nPlummer's Vanger is pitch perfect and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd brings gravitas and cultural credibility to his role as Martin Vanger. \n\nThe Scandinavian cultural setting is was crucial to the ambient tone, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth captured the inert chill of Vanger's private island brilliantly. The enthralling 158 minutes of running time spans emotions from curiously clever forensic detail to a disgustingly justifiable graphic and harrowing rape scene without lagging.\n\nThe Verdict: With a slick intensity, The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo English version holds a place in its own right amongst the Millennium mythology, congratulation's to a film maker who didn't feel the need to drown a great story with underlying cultural conventions. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 20/01/2012",

Seeing the people, watching them work, and witnessing their personal failures, positive traits, and places in the world gives an added layer to the story that nicely supplements the written word and helps tie together some of the ideas and themes that are fully explored in the book but that seem a little more obvious when watched rather than read. The movie is expertly crafted and the performances are superb, with Rooney Mara turning in one of the most complex and nuanced performances in quite a long time, a performance certainly deserving of more than an Oscar nomination.

That's my only flaw, this is a very well directed movie that you should definitely watch.",

            "content": "A fan of Fincher since his first \"proper\" film (discounting Alien 3, of course) and all the followings, I am always fascinated by his obsession with the illustration of inhumanity in all forms. Almost all of his characters (the leading ones) are either very crazy or kind-of crazy but in a very strange way. As much as I deeply love his different angles of such craziness, I always find the films where he \"paints\" such inhumanity in a sympathetic way, like \"Seven\" (one of my all-time favourites), \"Fight Club\" (Brad Pitt's utmost craziness did not impress me, but Ed Norton's and others' human vulnerability is always refreshing), \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\", or \"Zodiac\". Fincher has been revered most and foremost for his technical superiority - perfect colourization, perfect cinematography, perfect editing, perfect soundtrack, but I admire his human depiction of his somewhat inhuman characters more than anything else - he crafts them with care, with kindness, with the profound understanding about their fates, their characteristics, their emotional vulnerabilities. Such care makes me feel relatable, give me a look at the hidden corners of our everyday life (this may be the reason why \"Zodiac\", despite being shadowed by two very excellent films in the same year - \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"No Country for Old Man\" - both about inhumanity at the extreme, is still loved as one of Fincher's very best - not because of its mystery or technical perfection, but because of its extremely sensitive touch on the fates of seemingly-strong-but-actually-very-vulnerable characters). This is the reason why I enjoy \"The Game\", \"Gone Girl\", or \"The Social Network\" very very much, I cannot consider them the purest of \"Fincherism\". The complexity and numerous twist-and-turns of the plots of these films make me feel that I am watching a \"gimmick\" about the technical prowess of Fincher rather than being presented with his heart, his soul (still, they are excellent films that I enjoy immensely, I just do not feel that they can represent who Fincher is as an \"auteur\" - even though I am sure that he does not care being an \"auteur\" or whatnot). \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" falls in this category. The film was perfectly made, with maybe one of the best, if not the best title sequence (the opening minutes) that I have ever seen (\"Skyfall\" also has an outstanding title sequence, but that film came out later, from the same company - Sony, so maybe there is some influence there) - bleak, confusing, techno, cold, dirty, inhuman - simply everything that the audience will experience watching the film, and even better, with a perfect soundtrack by Trent Reznor. Adapted from a very popular novel, the film's plot was able to distil all the best details from the book and retain the feeling of mysterious emptiness throughout its length with very, very tight editing, cinematography, colourization, set pieces. The weakest link of the film might be its leads - Daniel Craig's wooden face may be suitable for Bond, but not for the energetic journalist Mikael, Rooney Mara's appearance is spot-on, but she seemed to be too devoid of emotions, thus appeared more as a \"super-woman\" than an intelligent girl with a disturbing past (that Noomi Rapace translated perfectly from the novel's pages to the original Swedish adaptation). The rest of the cast were also very restrained, to the point that they seemed to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of acting in the middle of the North-Pole coldness of Sweden. Maybe that was not their fault, maybe that was because Fincher just wanted to experience with this \"foreign\" materials (this is the only film so far that Fincher adapted from a foreign novel) - maybe that is why he does not want to adapt the rest two books - one trial is enough for a successful experiment (and thankfully for the audience too, since the last two books are way less impressive than the first one, yes, I read and watched both the novels and the original adaptations). Still a very interesting film, but a lesser Fincher's film maybe.",

From the opening scene, I was hooked on the compelling mystery forming around the intriguing characters, and I found myself paying attention to each little detail in the film, trying to find missing connections in the clues. From there, the story unravels in the most delightfully complicated of ways, delivering on a satisfying ending that sufficiently and believably ties up all loose ends.\n\nI can think of no one better to direct tension than David Fincher. This film is a fine example of this. Fincher's direction leads the film into brilliantly tense scenes, and I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that I was watching characters in a movie.\n\nHuge credit goes to the subtle, yet brilliant performance by lead actor Daniel Craig, who manages be the constant rock that keeps the film together. We as the audience follow Craig through the mystery, learning new information as he does. Rooney Mara, portraying the titular girl with the dragon tattoo, delivers an eerie, almost frighteningly good performance. You never quite know what her reaction to events will be, and just how far she'll go when she's pushed, which makes for really captivating cinema. Christopher Plummer and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd also deliver really top notch performances, embodying their characters with highly skilled ease.\n\nOverall, this film really surprised me with its sheer brilliance, and I wish Fincher were on board to continue the series. Sadly, sequels are not on the near horizon. However, I will most definitely be buying this film on Bluray.",

            "content": "Lisbeth Salander is the kind of character that would normally be cast aside as the female counterpart to our testosterone infused hero, appreciated but still under-appreciated all the same.  But Salander doesn't live in the constraints of your average thriller: she exists in the kind of thriller that only rarely dives headfirst into theaters, the kind that snakes along the wet pavement with effective grit while The Prodigy plays in the background and cigarette smoke suffocates the misty air.  She's not a sexy Angelina Jolie but a deceivingly sexy goth-punk, bleached eyebrows and all.  Underweight and independent, we're immediately drawn to her: she's a heroine that doesn't look like a heroine but ends up saving the day and stealing the show.\n\tIn the Swedish adaptation of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (unseen by me), Salander was portrayed by Noomi Rapace with, as Roger Ebert puts it in his review of the film, \"unwavering intensity\".  In the American adaptation, released in 2011, she is played by Rooney Mara with ferocious authority, calm and cool in the most dangerous of situations, deadly when she needs to be.  Mara disappears so completely into the role that it will be hard, I imagine, for most audiences to succumb to her powers in a different role without referring back to this one.\n\t\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" would already be an excellent murder-mystery if it relied on story alone; its stunningly structured characters (and the cast playing them) work as additional shots of caffeine that give the plot enough staying power to keep our interest for the 158 minute running time (which zig zags along with the agility of a rabid cheetah).  It's unconventional, moodier than your average Chris Nolan foray and more misanthropic than your misogynists, misandrists.  But the cynicism is intoxicating, as if David Fincher reconfigured the glamorization of death in murder ballads and threw them onto the screen for us to inhale.  Yet \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" doesn't tread into contrived darkness; it strolls along cloaked in convincing darkness, so hypnotizing because it knows the brutality life has to offer and doesn't just stand by like a victim.  It wants to fight back, setting fire to the past and coming alive in the treacherous electricity of the present.\n\tThough the film is entitled after its central heroine, the lead of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", in actuality, is Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), the newly disgraced co-editor of \"Millennium\" magazine.  Having just lost a libel suit against tycoon Hans-Erik WennerstrÃ¶m, he plans to take a much-needed vacation, gather his thoughts and figure out where his now-controversial life will be headed next.  At least, that's where he thinks he's going: after hiring Salander (a gifted hacker) to conduct an extensive search on Blomkvist, business giant Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) invites him to his barren island home and proposes the unproposable; if Blomkvist investigates and eventually solves the 40-year-old murder of his grandniece, Harriet, he will exchange unreleased information about WennerstrÃ¶m that could give Blomkvist's career a much needed needle to the chest.  Complications arise, however, when Blomkvist and Salander join forces and dig deeper into the Vanger family's shocking past; there, they find long buried secrets better kept unearthed than out in the open.\n\tThe leads of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" are not of Tom Cruise clean-cutishness but of fragmented Max Rockatansky depressiveness, committed to bringing justice to the corrupted nooks and crannies of the world but hardly able to provide closure to their damaged psyches.  That's what makes the film so tremendously sensational; while the story magnetizes with its abundance of second guesses, false leads, and red herrings, the leading characters are compelling enough to work as fragile individuals who could head a meaty character study without all the sin-infused iciness.  Throughout the course of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", Salander is raped, Blomkvist shot, tortured, stalked; Salander tells horror stories of her past, while Blomkvist continuously puts his life on the line for his career.  But consider that Larsson's original material doesn't allow them to become victims of their own tragedies (Salander gets satisfying revenge on her rapist more methodical than Beatrix Kiddo could have ever dreamed, while Blomkvist repeatedly regains composure after having his world shattered over and over again).  They are survivors.  Craig and Mara are outstanding.\n\tMore poised to get under your skin than most films, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is an unforgettable experience, from the eerie crackling of Fincher's atmosphere to Mara's staggering transformation.  A must.",

They made the movie very different from the original, but still manage to create the same story which kudos to David Fincher and Steven Zaillian for knowing how to make a remake stand out on its own. The characters are just as memorable as the original, and it created the characters a bit differently too which I appreciated. Rooney Mara is outstanding in this and whether people would ask whether she's better or Noomi Repace, I have no idea because I think that they are equally excellent in it and they never seem to be acting the same. Daniel Craig is great in it and he has some funny moments in it which the original never seem to have. The chemistry between the two leads are great, and the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is really good. The opening title is the best opening I have ever seen. The effects were amazing in the opening, and Trent Reznor and Karen O.'s cover version of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song is really catchy which is rare because I'm not much of a fan of metal rock. The ending is not as great as the original, but it's still a good ending that is nothing like you seen before. David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the rare remakes that worked, one of the best remakes in a long time, and I hope that they make the sequels with the same crew, same director, and same writer as I know that they can only serve the source material justice.",

            "content": "My respect for David Fincher as a director is tested most when I come across a film from the man which I don't find nearly as satisfactory or compelling on both a technical and storytelling level than the rest of his exploits, most of which I greatly enjoy. Seven was an entertaining and riveting escapade, The Social Network featured an all star cast and an impeccable screenplay from Aaron Sorkin, and Gone Girl's unpredictability and social commentary lends itself to great acclaim. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, a remake of a literary adaptation, is his least impressive work to date (out of the four I've seen), featuring overbearing editing, another atrocious work from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, a lack of engaging material and the issue of multiple endings. It's a bit of a mess in much of its form, and it rushes itself. It's also somewhat incoherent in its plot at various points, and unlike Inherent Vice, I'm not willing to put that down to director's intention.\n\nAll that said, Dragon Tattoo is still a reasonably entertaining, gripping criminal drama that encapsulates evil, deceit and death, and uses interesting and resonant characters to explore such. Led by Daniel Craig who plays disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Dragon Tattoo centres around Blomkvist's attempts to unravel an intriguing plot about a missing girl's disappearance from a famous and rich family forty years prior. As Blomkvist's research and investigation into who may have taken or killed the girl intensifies, he recruits a troubled and supposedly \"mentally incompetent\" computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara. The two work together to attempt to uncover the truth on the matter, as well as to seek revenge for the public humiliation of Blomkvist.\n\nConstructed with darkness and minimal lighting at the forefront, the thing that Dragon Tattoo has going for it best is undeniably its cinematography, lighting and atmosphere. It is a film which encapsulates the dread of its story with pristine clarity, and forms a mood that is devoid of emotion but utterly enthralling. Fincher fully realises the worlds he is creating, and the intimacy of some locations contrasts with the broad scope of others, and he never forgets to provide detail in all of those aforementioned shooting sites. Basically, he constructs living and breathing worlds full of people that seem somewhat realistic. Like that of the rain in Seven or the rich lighting in The Social Network, Dragon Tattoo has a black and white colour palette and snow; for someone who has a strange infatuation with cold weather in film (particularly rain, as I believe it fleshes out any location or situation and makes it feel more real or alive), this is the dream.\n\nTo boot, Dragon Tattoo also possesses some exquisite performances, namely that of Rooney Mara's as Salander. Her dedication to her role is utterly palpable, not just due to her willingness to go nude or embrace a large quantity of piercings, but because of her dark nature. She's completely embellished in the performance she's giving, and whilst it's perhaps not as memorable as other memorable Fincher performances, such as Kevin Spacey in Seven or Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl, it is absolutely applaudable. Daniel Craig's work here is also immensely impressive, his performance of the character Blomkvist amiable and brave. The latter perhaps not to the extent of her co-stars, but still commendable all the same. The rest of the ensemble is note-worthy, Stellan Skarsgard and Yorick van Wageningen in particular giving riveting performances worthy of individual credit.\n\nWhere the issues start to enter the forefront is namely in terms of the score, which whilst not as perpetually irritating and neutral as The Social Network, is undeniably simplistic and plain. Composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are often not capable of producing anything more than atmosphere for their Fincher projects, their works for Gone Girl and The Social Network never enunciating emotion or activity, but just humming in the background (or droning loudly, consuming the entire soundscape). The same can be said for Dragon Tattoo, but it's slightly less irritating in this situation, a semblance of thematic consistency and logic in place. That said, something like this is not exactly impressive or worthy of an Academy Award nomination. For those who wish to attack me on my position towards the simplicity of this score when I enjoy the works of Hans Zimmer, a man who composes generally repetitive works, I believe it's down to the fact that at least his work somewhat crescendos or develops. That and he possesses thematic consistency and the ability to reprise his ideas without blatantly reiterating them without change from the prior inclusion Much of Dragon Tattoo just stays at the same volume, lacking fluctuation or variation. It's boring and blatantly lazy. No, it's not difficult to hold down a key on the ambiance setting on a keyboard. It's not a hard job. The Social Network and Gone Girl were far worse in terms of general composition (I still don't get why In The Halls of The Mountain King was ever used for The Social Network, especially when it doesn't contain the size, scope or organic nature of the orchestral recording), but this isn't necessarily good.\n\nBut whilst I generally expect Reznor and Ross' efforts to yield little more than repetitive structures that don't contain a smidge of thematic consistency, I didn't expect to find that much of the editing within a Fincher film could be so irritatingly quick. Whilst cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth's work is predictably brilliant, the editing is far less fluid than it usually is, illustrated by this clip; whilst Fincher effectively captures the different point of views on a visceral level for this scene, his usual trademark for dialogue sequences, the editing is a bit too frantic and quick for the specific situation, and until the final shot of the scene, we don't get a hold which feels natural and relaxed. This is a small example for a huge film which contains many situations featuring such an issue, and although many won't notice it, I did. It's not overtly bad (I mean, we're not talking about Lee Smith's for The Dark Knight for crying out loud), but for a Fincher film, it's a drop in quality.\n\nAll that said, Dragon Tattoo is still an intriguing, albeit underwhelming criminal drama that is gloomy and mostly engaging. Its first act feels unfocused; the second act is impressively staged, acted and scripted, but the final act drags far too long, and whether or not the book stretches to such a finale is no matter; it felt overlong in this context. A case of The Return of the King complex, unfortunately, where the film doesn't seem to know where it wants to wrap up. Seeing as I haven't read the original literary material, I hold no biased for where I desire the story to start or end, so my opinion is based off little more than Fincher's interpretation of the material. That, and Steven Zaillian, the screenwriter's. It's a competent investigative story that has the individual pieces and often utilizes them to brutal or harrowing results, but can never seem to form a complete picture out of them.\n\nSo whilst Dragon Tattoo is not the most pristine Fincher film available, lacking the finesse that one desires from this talented individual, it is yet still an impressive feature that maintains an audience member's interest all throughout. It's cold, dark and atmospheric, and for one seeking a film of such a like, there are few better to recommend. And whilst I do not find it as compelling as everyone else, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy my time here, as I did. An entertaining venture, this film falls short of being a triumph by any standard.",

Luckily The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, having a run time of 2h 38min, is long enough to fully develop its characters and story. The movie had to get the pacing right to work, and it did a great job at that. Director David Fincher is kind of like Tarantino in the way he's able to make these really long ass movies and have them feel like 90min. The movie pulls you in from the very first shot. The intro is filled with amazing imagery and a really kick ass electro version of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song.\" You want to learn the mystery behind the movie, and even though it's just a movie, it almost feels like you're watching real people. It's impossible not to be intrigued by the movie, yes, it's very long, but don't let that turn you off, it's masterfully made, and if you love complex psychological mysteries then you'll love this, and just so you know, I wouldn't really call this an art house movie.

The biggest problem, in my view, is a very brutal rape and torture dropped early in the film. Not only is it unsettling to audiences, but it seems quite exploitative both toward the character Lisbeth and the actress Rooney Mara who plays her. If that or the revenge sequence following it were not in the film, it would be an almost perfect celebration of a very prudent and brave woman whom we could all learn from.",

            "content": "Remakes these days are usually panned before release and almost sentenced to eternal slander, before even making their release. This is no more true than when recent foriegn films are remade, no more truer than when it was announced that barely after the original remake of steig larsons millenium phenominon was shown in british cinemas, the Americans had green lit a remake. The fury of fans could be heard for months, \"How dare they?\" cried fan boys and girls. Then David Fincher released a red band trailer, with Trent Reznor and Karen O's pounding take on Immigrant Song flashing a barrage of violent and gorgeous images at our eyes. It was hard not to eat our own words. It's hard to judge a remake, especially one released so close to the original. One will always compare constantly and ultimately personal favorite will reside one or the other. But just as the original Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, had a very slow build up but successful time at the box office, it is in my most honest of opinions David Fincher's take is far superior. Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is forced to step down from his position at well regarded magazine Millenium after he loses a court battle to a very powerful business man called Vernnerstrom. Soon after he is approached by an elderly man called Henrik Vangor. Vangor proposes that Mikael stays at his family estate in order to help solve a murder case of his grand daughter Harriot, that took place in the 60's. Mikael soon falls into trouble and has to recruit the assistant Lisbeth Salander, the hacker who gathered information for Henrik on Mikael. The duo soon find themselves tied up in a family feud, a serial killer and a rapist parole officer. The previous, is just the tip of the iceberg as the film clocks in at a stonking 2 hours and 40 minutes. But unlike the original, this one does not burn slowly, it thunders through, allowing it to tell more of a story and have less computer nonsense on screen at any given time. This gives us more time with the plot and the characters. Fincher also decides to study the relationship between Lisabeth and Mikael in greater detail, which as im led to believe is more faithful to the books. The cast are all top notch, Rooney Mara is perfect as Lisabeth, giving a detached and haunting performance, that ultimately wins our hearts over from the get go, her constant struggle continues to the bitter end and we as the audience cant help but be with her every step of the way. Daniel Craig is the master of under acting and its perfect here, little mannerisms here and there, like how Mikael wears his glasses when he doesnt need them or his inability to use a mac as quick as Lisabeth, really lend well to the character, making him feel like a character rather than a performance. Stellan Skargard also puts in a powerful performance as Harriots Brother, aiding Mikael as best as he can. The most stand out however is Christopher Plummer as Henrik, he has very little screen time, on the grand scheme of things, but his performance gives us the shivers and tugs at the heart strings, as he searches for over 40 years to find his grand daughter, his torture can be felt in his voice, a rare thing for an actor to achieve. The pacing as mentioned, is super slick, for Fincher, quite possibly his best, he continually bombards you with a multitude of visual and audio information as the plot heads like a skud missile towards an enemy base. By this point there is alos no need to say that the visuals are beyond stunning and meticulous, bar the very infrequent CGI shot that lasts no longer that 2 seconds. This film has a whole lot to offer, its rich in story telling, its gorgeous, the music by Trent Reznor again is haunting and gorgeous, the acting is of an extremely high caliber and unlike what came before, it ends in such a way that it is satisfying as a single story, meaning if a sequel never gets made, it will not damage it. There are a few nit picks, Daniel Craig for example seems to be the only one not sporting an accent, but were so engaged throughout we forget about it after 5 minutes. Also the film decides to wander into the second books territory as its end rather than stick firm on where the main focus of the story feels it should end. It works however and what were left with is an excellent crime thriller, that should not be underestimated, even by die hard fans of the original.",

I immensely look forward to sequels.  Rooney Mara's performance alone is enough to want to see the series continue.  The entire cast is fantastic, but what seemed to bug me most during the movie is the extended amount of time spent on some elements of the story, like her being a ward of the state, but how much time wasn't spent on explaining the backstory re: Daniel Craig's lawsuit and relationship with Robin Penn.  A lot effort was spent building up the need for Christopher Plummer to hire Daniel Craig to solve this mystery, yet very little into connecting Craig and Mara together.  For someone so unsociable, she unnaturally connected quickly with Craig.  Then, when it was all said and done, the story seemed to wrap up too quickly as compared to the build up.  So, while the story was good, the directing was good and the cast was good, the piecing together of the film itself seemed haphazardly done.  Was this editing? Was it the story itself?

            "content": "This is a very dark character drama, or is it a murder mystery thriller? Well, it tries to be both. Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist whose career is starting to fall apart, but he's offered a chance to redeem himself when someone hires him to solve a 40-year-old murder case. At the same time we are introduced to Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara. Her story is a bit more shady. We know she is a brilliant computer hacker who works outside the law, and she's got some major issues from her past that are making her life difficult now. Eventually the 2 characters meet (although it takes almost half the movie before we reach that point) and they coordinate their efforts to find the killer. However along the way they may find more than they ever wanted about the messed up Vanger family. The pace of the film is very slow. It is loaded with setup shots of people driving to places, people walking from room to room, and often with ominous music in the background. The atmosphere of the film is dark and tense, like you're waiting for someone at any moment to jump out and stab our lead characters. I like that kind of tension, and it suits the murder mystery genre quite well.\n\nDaniel Craig is extremely endearing in the lead. I was pleased that the character felt different from his portrayal of James Bond. This guy wasn't the most suave guy in the room, he made stupid mistakes, he falls down, and he needs help from others. It proves he has range, and it makes you totally get on his side for the rest of the film. On the other side of that coin is Rooney Mara. She is so flat and dull as Lisabeth. It's strange because the things she is doing and the things that happen to her are so intense that I have an emotional reaction, yet I literally read zero emotion from her. I suppose they were going for a strong, silent type but I just wanted something emotional to engage me. Instead it feels like the plot is trying to tell me how to feel, but I'd rather have the character feel that way in order to get me invested in their story. One of the odd things with the cast are the range of accents they decided to use. Craig sticks almost completely with his standard British accent, but many others throw in attempts at Swedish. I'm not familiar enough with the sound of a genuine Swedish accent, so it didn't bother me like an unsuccessful American one might, I just wondered if accents were necessary. No one else in the cast stands out much as particularly strong characters. In fact I frequently lost track of who was who, and how anyone was related to anyone else. I felt like I needed an evidence wall with a family tree similar to Mikael's just to follow the film. Christopher Plummer could have been amazing, but his character wasn't included in enough of the film. I suppose Yorick van Wageningen was appropriately detestable, but that relates more to his actions rather than his performance.\n\nI had a tough time with this movie. When it was a murder mystery/thriller I was incredibly engaged, and I wanted to hang onto that storyline. Sadly, they kept breaking from the movie I would have enjoyed to a character drama that just included too much explicit content for my comfort. I realize that making the audience uncomfortable is part of the plan with this film, because it is supposed to elicit those reactions of anger and disgust. I just prefer films that can accomplish these things in a more subtle fashion. It's probably my conservative sensibilities creeping in, so I might be completely alone in this opinion. Yet, (and I feel like a broken record here) my biggest problem with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was simply that it showed things happening to try and elicit a reaction from me, but I'd rather see a reaction in the characters so I can connect with them as realistic people. I'm sure it's just a stylistic choice, and this isn't my preferred style, so I'll stop belaboring that point. My only other complaint would be that the mystery, when you peel away all the intrigue and character drama, is straight out of any hour-long procedural drama. I could anticipate who was the killer early because I've seen episodes of CSI and NCIS. It's a minor complaint, because that doesn't mean this wasn't a very well-executed mystery. By the end I quite enjoyed about half of the movie, but they inserted the other half, so I can't say it's a favorite and I'll probably never watch it again.",

Craig also is great here and they work together to solve a murder mystery from the 1960s. This movie has a lot going on yet it is really worth the watch due strongly to Maras performance.",

But I think David Fincher's edgy vision really brought the late Steig Larsson's chauvinist novel to the screen. The covers of Zeppelin in the trailer set the mood and the grainy Instagram-like filter made the whole show depressing. Daniel Craig is a better Blomkvist than a Bond. And Rooney Mara was a better Salander than Noomi Rapace.",

Craig also does a fine performance and Fincher directs a beautifully crafted mystery that is on par with the 2009 version.",

The film follows the material so well that it can even be more disturbing than the novel it is based off of. A definite career high point for everyone involved, from Craig, to Mara, to even Fincher himself.
