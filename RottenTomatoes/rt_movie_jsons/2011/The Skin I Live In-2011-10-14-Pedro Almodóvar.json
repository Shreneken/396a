    "summary": "Ever since his beloved wife was horribly burned in an auto accident, Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas), a skilled plastic surgeon, has tried to develop a new skin that could save the lives of burn victims. Finally, after 12 years, Ledgard has created a skin that guards the body, but is still sensitive to touch. With the aid of his faithful housekeeper (Marisa Paredes), Ledgard tests his creation on Vera (Elena Anaya), who is held prisoner against her will in the doctor's mansion.",

            "content": "\u2018I can't watch that' was all my friend could manage to say through grimaced lips. The issue was, no matter how I tried pitch The Skin I Live In over coffee, the idea sounded grotesque. Based on the novel Tarantula by Thierry Jonquet, it follows Robert Ledgrd (Antonio Banderas), a brilliant surgeon with a secret operating theatre, performs experiments on Vera (Elena Anaya), an unwilling young woman, held hostage in his home to satisfy his God complex by perfecting his invention of impenetrable skin, a miracle leap in evolution that would've saved his wife from the flaming car wreck. \u2018I can't stand body horror' put an end to my pitch, the conversation and the coffee went cold. \n\nUnderstandably body horror unwillingly brings to mind cinema's more unpleasant images, the Cronenberg-esque distortions of familiar anatomy into the sub-human, animalistic, or totally alien. Pedro Almodovar is operating in this field, clearly inspired by classics like George Franju's 60s thriller Eyes Without A Face and nodding at Universal monsters, calling Legrand's existence vampiric and inescapably inciting Frankenstein, but Almodovar is not preoccupied with the gruesome. Instead, this expertly plotted thriller is a dissection of identity, a \u2018horror story without screams', like a face without a mouth. \n\nWARNING: FULL SPOILERS AHEAD \n\nTo talk about the movie is to spoil the twist. After a home invasion, Almodovar introduces a young dress maker called Vincente (Jan Cornet) who's violent sexual episode with Robert's daughter causes a mental breakdown and leads to a tragic suicide. In revenge, Robert kidnaps Vincente and subjects him to isolation which causes the young man to yearn even for his captor's attention. It's not clear at what point the plan formulates in Robert's mind, perhaps the vaginoplasty was initially in a castrating of a rapist preventing further harm, but before long multiple surgeries transform Vincente into Vera. \n\nAlmodovar expertly grounds the schlocky shocking narrative in the reality of his characters, creating mournful imagery of lost identity with Robert's wife horrified by her burned skin caught in the momentary reflection of a window, and Vincente's melancholic dream-like inspection of his slowly transforming body. Banderas' portrayal of Legrand is admirably complex, and isn't comfortably lumped in with the manically laughing mad scientists that litter the genre. He has a gargantuan ego, a clinical coldness, but also a yearning for touch, a warmth lost after the passing of his wife, and impossible to receive from his daughter recoiling from his affection. Monstrous actions do not necessarily make a monster. \n\nWhile it is almost automatic to recoil from the premise of Skin, nauseated by insinuations largely kept off-screen, the film has an odd triumphant quality. Despite Robert's best efforts to warp his captive, like the bonsai tree he methodically wraps metal wiring round, Vincente is never consumed by Vera. Nor is he/she complacent as a victim, actively strengthens the interior world with exercise, writing, crafts, as the exterior is changed beyond into the unrecognisable. The climax has a catharsis, but one so neat and tidy it can allow the film to be put away, the wounds will heal too neatly when they should be deep and scarring. \n\nWhile Skin may not haunt like the grotesque imagery of the sub-genre, the underlying thematics are sufficiently sharp, raising questions about the identity and sexual desire constrained by societal norms. It may not be enough to scar indefinitely, but the complexity of the plot, the lavish colour palette, and intelligence of visual motif will leave an impression of admiration for a master of the craft. And as a fan of the genre, it is fascinating to see characters robbed from the crypts of bygone shockers transfused with fresh blood, and made more achingly real then they have been for a good while. A word of caution, do be wary who you recommend The Skin I Live In to. Especially if you intend to go on meeting them for coffee.",

            "content": "The Skin I Live In is like a surrealist painting. Like the best Dalis and Picassos, some will likely be horrified by what director Pedro Almodovar has put forward. Others, like me, will find the film evocative and discussion-worthy. Neither reaction is necessarily right because the film is both painfully intense and incredibly passionate. What can't be denied is Almodovar's moxie. He attempts things, for better or worse, that few other filmmakers would have the guts to try. And though the melodrama is at times too much to handle, this weird, wild, and totally original film comes through shining.\n\nDr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) is a brilliant plastic surgeon on the verge of a tremendous discovery. For years, he's worked on a synthetic skin that protects people from burns. It's a real medical breakthrough, but it's destined to never see the light of day because of the way Ledgard went about proving the skin's success. Vera (Elena Anaya) is Robert's prisoner. During the day, his housekeeper, Marilla (Marisa Paredes), cares for her, while the evenings are spent with Robert studying her synthetic skin. The two share quite a complicated relationship. Though she longs for Robert sexually, she remains his prisoner, and even attempts to kill herself early in the film, in order to escape him.\n\nOne day, an intruder, Zeca (Roberto Alamo), breaks into Robert's compound. A wanted fugitive, Zeca ties up Marilla and demands sanctuary until Robert can perform a facial transplant on him. But once he gets a glimpse of the beautiful woman locked up in the house, he breaks into Vera's prison and rapes her. Robert doesn't take this action lightly, and the consequences of their confrontation ultimately help us and Vera understand exactly why she's being held captive.\n\nThe Skin I Live In's structure is very complex, and makes a simple, spoiler-free plot description somewhat difficult. A good third of the film happens before we go back in time six years for a very large chunk of time. An extensive coda follows, which provides a semblance of closure, but it's really that middle section that will make or break The Skin I Live In for you. Even the film's most ardent supporters have to admit some of what happens is totally bananas. So your enjoyment of the film will ultimately come down to how willing you are to give yourself over to the film's sillier and less believable concepts.\n\nWhile fans like me must recognize the validity of an opposing view, at least as far as the film's melodramatic tendencies go, its most fervent detractors must in turn concede that the film looks and sounds brilliant. It's an objectively gorgeous piece of work. The way Almodovar uses his sets and costumes and music to elicit an intensely emotional response-whether it be positive or negative-in practically every scene is the kind of thing only an auteur like him can actually pull off.\n\nAntonio Banderas is excellent playing against type as the admittedly psychotic doctor. His brand of crazy is a very restrained one, but there isn't a minute that goes by in which we doubt his mental state. There isn't anything likeable about Robert, but Banderas's searing performance is very easy to admire.\n\nThe supporting cast is sold, but there aren't any performances (outside of Banderas') that I'll likely remember a few months from now. The film, on the other hand, is something I won't shake for a long time. It's a very tough sit, but it engaged me from beginning to end, and while I know it's not for everyone, fans of adventurous, challenging cinema will at the very least find The Skin I Live In an original vision from a man who really knows how to direct a film.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/skin-i-live-in-review/",

            "content": "Bringing Pedro Almodovar back together with Antonio Banderas, The Skin I Live In sounded like a promising contemporary vision from the director.\n\nThe plot structure in The Skin I Live In is brilliant. The film begins by introducing viewers to many strange characters and situations while maintaining enough genuine drama to keep them intrigued and determined to keep watching before later taking a trip back through time to explore the context of the story. It the film wasn't interesting enough before, by that point it most definitely is. Bringing back themes explored in Pedro Almodovar's prior films, The Skin I Live In touches upon concepts such as body transplants which he touched upon in The Flower of My Secret (1995) and All About My Mother (1999). It's a major plot device used as a means of establishing artistic imagery and the mindset of the main characters. Yet the familiarity of the themes hardly replicates his prior work since he takes a completely different approach this time around. Having spent years refining his style as a director, The Skin I Live In displays that the man has lost none of his talent. For me, I consider it to have only increased with his many years behind the camera.\nWhat's more impressive is the fact that Pedro Almodovar brings back his fondness for exploring transgender characters and puts it into the context of a psychological thriller. Amid the current trend of body horror films along the lines of The Human Centipede trilogy (2010-2015) or Tusk (2014), The Skin I Live In offers a more realistic look into the premise within the context of a character-driven psychological thriller. The horror in it doesn't rely on jump scares, screams or grotesque imagery but simply the reality of the situation. The film focuses on the psychology of its characters while using subtle imagery to build atmosphere. It is a very much in-depth film which goes to a new level of edge for Pedro Almodovar within the context of a new genre while retaining many of the themes he is iconic for, creating a balance between what fans have grown to love about the director while fulfilling their desire to see him innovate himself. Since The Skin I Live in fuses both so brilliantly, I consider it to be the director's finest work to date.\nThe scope of the narrative is much smaller and offers Pedro Almodovar a chance to fit many themes into a more confined story. But to ensure that he doesn't come up short on anything, the running time for The Skin I Live In ultimately reaches for two hours. This gives him more than enough time to explore his profound vision without stretching things on for too long. There are some occasional moments where the heavy reliance on thematic implications prove to drag things on at a rather slow pace, but most of the film is a richly atmospheric and engaging psychological thriller which provides insight into just how deep the rabbit hole of Pedro Almodovar's mind goes.\nFrom a stylish perspective, The Skin I Live In is still a brilliant experience. The life in the scenery is brought out by a colour scheme which is able to turn the monochromatic colours into brightness, maintaining both a grim nature and a touch of spirit at the same time. The cinematography captures this all with brilliant grip over the atmosphere, finding claustrophobia in its technique during the more intense moments while capturing a larger spectacle of things at scenes which really require a larger feeling of context to be established. The musical score helps to add the same effect to the ears of viewers, effectively reaching all the major senses.\nAfter years spent building up a larger-than-life Hollywood persona in predominantly action films, The Skin I Live In offers Antonio Banderas an opportunity to return to his roots in terms of native language and collaborating with Pedro Almodovar. In the perfect role for him, Antonio Banderas is given a chance to divert the hard edge he has depicted in his many action films into the role of a vengeful surgeon. Capturing the insane nature of the character on a subtle level while conveying the passionate genius of the man. Whether or not to sympathise with him is one of the great complexities of the narrative, but whatever side the audiences chooses they can definitely admit that Antonio Banderas supplies one hell of a performance. I would go so far as to call it the best role of his career, a role which capitalizes on what he is best at while pushing him to break new ground. In the same manner of thematic exploration Pedro Almodovar takes on the entire film, Antonio Banderas finds a brilliant balance between hopes and expectations. Antonio Banderas hits a career highlight in his post-Hollywood heyday and shows just how truly impressive his acting talents are, as well as how much more he still has to offer.\nJan Cornet delivers a strong effort as Vincente Guillen Pineiro. Capturing a selfish and careless nature in the beginning, Jan Cornet progressively fuels his role more and more with fear and anxiety which makes him slowly a more sympathetic character. The deeper he seeps into the narrative, the more the character gets lost in his own psyche before transitioning into a woman and being played by Elena Anaya. Elena Anaya manages to continue on what Jan Cornet has built and convey it to viewers all through the simplicity of her facial expressions. It's made better by the quality of her line delivery with its sense of mystique. Jan Cornet and Elena Anaya contribute brilliant performances to The Skin I Live In, and both work brilliantly alongside Antonio Banderas.\n\nThe Skin I Live In can occasionally be a rather slow film, but Pedro Almodovar's brilliant grip over the depth of its themes and maintaining the intensity of its atmosphere brings out a rich and engaging psychological thriller bolstered by the finest acting talents of Antonio Banderas.",

It's possible to say that, in a way, he's created a vehicle to perfectly portray how it must feel to be transgendered, trapped in an incorrect body that you were forced into against your will. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg; there are many ways to look at this piece of filmmaking.

            "content": "Extending some evident influence from Georges Franju's Les yeux sans visage (1960) to a disturbing psychosexual realm, Almod\u00f3var constructs a classy horror tale of truly horrifying proportions that has shocked audiences worldwide. He achieves this by drawing the thin line between obsession and insanity, between the male and the female body, between perceptions and concepts, capturing every frame with respectable artistry. Was drawing the line enough? No. As the bold director he was especially in the 80s, he crosses it like he used to do in the past!\n\nAnd that's the point, people, where things start to get interesting.\n\nThe classical score elevates tension of the melodrama and about the absolute tragedies that unfold in front of our eyes. He has not lost his trademark styles; leaving clich\u00e9d dramas and comedies aside (perhaps temporarily?), eroticism becomes a weapon in the artist's palette, assaulting the senses and challenging us to leave the theater. How ironic, isn't it? Before the horror develops, the screenplay discreetly throws a criticism towards our ethical standards: Bioethics supposedly condemns human transgenesis (even if it is proven that pig cells are strikingly similar and even superior to our own in some biological aspects) but we are happily self-proclaimed as omnivore beings. Brilliant aspect that makes you think about the foundation of your own ethics. Almod\u00f3var never takes a side, however. He captures the talents of the novel while letting our minds decide, once that our stomach has \"digested\" this aggressive beast.\n\nThis is one of his finest films. Watching him return to his glorious days 25 years ago restores my faith in him.\n\n89/100",

            "content": "Some movies actually defy classification, and I mean that in a good way. The Skin I Live In is a perfect example, a disquieting yet powerful film that really doesn't fit into any genre we know of. It's a drama, sure-- but that doesn't even begin to cover it. I think Rotten Tomatoes summed it up perfectly with their final review: \"Arthouse Ick.\" And yes, it's artsy. And OH YES, it's most definitely icky. Some scenes will make your skin crawl. But unlike other movies that have tried to be like this and failed, the goosebumps you will get are totally intentional.\r\n\r\nThe Skin I Live In stars Antonio Banderas as a plastic surgeon tortured by the death of his wife. She almost died in a car accident, yet he somehow saved her. But when she saw how burned, ugly, and disfigured she had become, she committed suicide in front of her daughter. Unfortunately, a lot of these key plot points are made deliberately confusing by a Pulp Fiction-style way of filmmaking that places everything out of order. It's organized chaos, but it's chaos nonetheless. However, I can hardly fault it for that, as the convoluted feel of it actually contributes to making the film more intense. But if you went into this wanting to see the famous you-know-what scenes... you'll have to wait a bit.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of you-know-what: This movie has unfortunately gotten the reputation as \"That Pedro Almodovor Movie With the Sex Change.\" Yes, that's in it. Yes, it's gross. But it's not like the audience actually SEES anything. Here's what happens: A man rapes Banderas's daughter, so he takes the obvious course of action: Kidnapping him and subjecting him to sexual reassignment surgery. This is a very cool concept, and it should actually be the legal punishment for rape in my opinion. However, the movie lost me at this point: Banderas makes the guy look like his dead wife. And HERE is where things REALLY get icky. I'm not sure exactly what Almodovor was trying to say about the character with this part of the story, except that he was lonely and regretful. But wouldn't you think that if you're trying to punish a guy for raping your daughter, you wouldn't turn him into your wife and bang him? Jesus Christ... the guy is messed up.\r\n\r\nThe acting is definitely strong, though, as Banderas fully embodies the tortured nature of his character. But I wanted him to have some deep feeling or knowledge that what he was doing was a little insane. His character just didn't have that kind of depth, though, and he came off as a typical horny madman. It's a shame, seeing as the subject matter is so creative, but not much was done with the main characters. Banderas's helper is pretty one-dimensional as well, but Elena Anaya definitely steals the show as the sex change-ee. I can imagine that this must have been a difficult role to play, as she had to play a man playing a woman trying to be a man... or something... but she definitely pulled it off. It's unsettling, yes. But it's also vastly entertaining.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Skin I Live In: 6/10 stars. It doesn't go as deep into the characters as I wanted it to, but it still deserves commendation for its expertly handled and well-crafted subject matter. It definitely takes a few cues from the movie adage that started with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho-- If you leave the details of a scene to the audience's imagination, they will dream up something far more vivid than anything you could possibly put on screen. And much like the infamous shower scene, The Skin I Live In doesn't show too much... well... skin. The moral of the story? Never, ever, EVER rape Antonio Banderas's daughter. I'd rather have Liam Neeson hunting me down than this guy.",

It's a film that would go over most people's heads (and i don't mean that in a cruel way) it's just it's a film that you have to be commited to and can't let your mind wander for a second.",

Risking his own career by conducting a forbidden trans-gene on his own prototype, a mysterious woman that he keeps locked in his house and has the looks of his dead wife. Now, I did my best to not spoil this great movie, with a great performance for all the main characters especially Elena Anaya, even with the creepy and mysterious art house mood that Almod\u00f3var delivers and that happens to fit well. As the storyline flows with a fluid and twisted narration, Almod\u00f3var sympathizes with the Female gender, by changing a man, to make him feel the pains of women, to show him how can a woman get hurt. By introducing the stereotype the cruelty of men, Zeca (funny, cause he even wears the costume of an animal), this kind of stereotype knows no mercy, no tenderness, no reasoning, that's why he deserved death, as for Vicente, he had his weaknesses, he could feel the pain that's why Dr. Robert took him. In the end, it was an entertaining but thrilling ride, and it might seem weird at first but in the end \"esta espectacular\"",

But, it's Almod\u00f3var's take on a horror film, and it's got a shocking twist in it, and it's a very arty and compelling story too, with some good moments. In Toledo, Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) is a plastic surgeon who has been inventing a new form of artificial skin which is resistance to burns and insect bites. Ledgard's invention makes him the toast of the scientific world, however at his home, he keeps a young woman called Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) locked in a room and dressed in a skin tight body suit. But, then there's an incident where criminal Zeca (Roberto \u00c1lamo), the son of Ledgard's servant and adopted mother Marilia (Marisa Paredes), breaks into Vera's room and mistaking her for someone else, rapes Vera, then Ledgard comes back and it's revealed as to how Vera came to be in this situation. It's a very dark film, but it has all of Almod\u00f3var's usual touches and flourishes, with the odd touch of camp here and there, but the fact remains that this is a very macabre and bloody horror film that doesn't go for shocks and scares, it comes from a weird mood.",

Marilia(Marisa Paredes) warns him that he will either eventually have to kill her or free her.

But that coupled with the director's recent formalism results in a strangely vapid concoction that has more to do with \"Vertigo\" than \"Eyes without a Face.\"  Some of that comes down to the movie's flashback structure, including a circling back to a key incident which changes nothing, that assumes we have any interest in who Vera and Robert are/were.  And Marilia's revelations about Robert's family history are irrelevant considering anybody could have snapped after all he had been through.  What would have worked much better is if \"The Skin I Live In\" had been told in a straightforward fashion, allowing the tension and unease to build naturally in a what-is-this-sick-bastard-going-to-come-up-with-next sort of way.",

The movie is not always easy to watch, and has a number of rape scenes (one of which involving a man dressed as a tiger no less) and the story is a freakishly twisted take on Frankenstein. The movie is about a plastic surgeon who, after his wife burns to death in a car crash, decides to use genetic engineering to create the perfect skin that is impervious to burns, bug bites, and various other harms. To do this he uses a human test subject named Vera, who is kept locked away in his lavish mansion and under constant surveillance. It gradually becomes even weirder until it reaches a most unusual (and unexpected) plot twist late into the movie. The entire movie is jam-packed with sex, violence, and a whole lot of soapy melodrama, making it very campy at times even though much of what takes place in the story is actually pretty dark. The Skin I Live In is not the kind of movie that can be easily recommended, simply because not everyone is into this sort of Jodorowsky/Lynch type of melodramatic weirdness.

Almodovar makes tawdry melodrama wholly satisfying, even edifying.  I loved Skin I Live In.  It is darker than many of his other films but suspenseful and engrossing throughout.  I loved this movie.  IF you can view this on Blu Ray it is well worth it.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Skin I Live In will get under your skin.",

But stuck to one and executed it well..",
