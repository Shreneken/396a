But when Tommy's underdog brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), fights his way into the tournament, the two brothers must finally confront each other and the forces that pulled them apart.",

The dialogue was thought-provoking and written with vigour and heart, the fight scenes are incredible feeling both authentic(you can smell the sweat and feel the tears) and harrowing and the story for me was absorbing and hit me hard emotionally.\n\nThe characters are fully credible too, and the wonderful performances help. Tom Hardy is outstanding in one of his best performances to date, and Joel Edgarton is every bit his equal, but Nick Nolte is a sheer delight and comes close to stealing the film on several occasions. The climax was very exciting, and while the film's end is rather inconclusive, everything else is so good you don't care so much.\n\nIn conclusion, fantastic film and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton feud as estranged brothers at the Pentagon. Nick Nolte plays a rehabilitating father with deep-seated demons. From these dynamics emerges a family drama that on the surface dances to the usual Rocky schema - but again, not at all. Warrior is, in fact, a very special sports film. Not just because of its specific sport (MMA is unlikely to play a role on the big screen anytime soon), but the storytelling of how director Gavin O'Connor manages to weave together the emotional facets of this masculine world.\n\nFor both Tom Hardy and especially Joel Edgerton, this film was their big breakthrough. Since then, Hollywood has been hot on their heels for almost everything. After seeing this flick, one has to honestly say that this is totally fine. Although I don't think too much of Edgerton's rather stoic and monotonous acting, he fits the role of Brendan perfectly. A \"reasonable\" family man with clear principles, but who has never lost his passion for fighting from his younger years. Even more on the nail, however, is Hardy's embodiment of his character Tommy. Although he is actually sullen and taciturn for the entire 130 minutes of running time (just a typical Hardy), you always have the feeling that there is so much more to this loveless-looking person. When you learn more about his background in the second half of the film, the other character traits clearly come into play. In that respect, Hardy was of course given the more interesting and diverse character, but his rousing performance never really makes you dislike this fundamentally unlikable person after all. The acting masterpiece of the film, however, goes to the account of a gentleman who had long been considered an icon in Hollywood at that time: Nick Nolte. After he had disappeared into oblivion for some time before, Nolte returns here in absolute top form. The role of the recovering alcoholic is tailor-made for Nolte. He plays everything from totally grumpy and distant to empathetic and highly emotional, and in the final part he provides one of the most memorable individual scenes in recent memory, at least in my opinion. You understand this man, want to hug him for his crumbling relationship with his sons, but can still understand why they want to avoid him.\n\nAt first glance, the film's unwinding seems generic and genre-oriented. However, if you venture beneath the surface and get involved with the not-uncomplex plot, you are completely caught off guard and left wondering. If I weren't a cold hearted person when it comes to crying at movies, I probably would have shed enough water for ten. Warrior gives you so much more than just half-naked men beating the crap out of each other in a pointless martial art. It's about passion, revenge and reconciliation. These elements are conveyed by O'Connor and the cast in such an incredibly authentic and profound way that you almost can't believe that the declared genre of this film is \"sports movie\". Rather, it is a breathtaking roller coaster of emotions with a lot of heart with an admittedly slightly exaggerated ending.",

I was very wrong, the entire cast are captivating. Tom Hardy delivers in my opinion one of his best performances. Nick Nolte also delivery a subtle performance which hits all the right beats. Two stand out scenes for me were, the scene in the hotel room with Nolte's drunken outburst and also at the very end where Hardy finally submits to his brother as he tells Hardy's character he loves him and he's sorry.",

            "content": "9.25/10. As much poignant family drama as it is riveting sports exhibition, Warrior is a familiar but powerfully told tale of coming terms with and healing deep familial wounds. An aging recovering alcoholic Paddy Conlin (Nick Nolte) trains an estranged, resentful son Tommy (Tom Hardy), a former wrestling prodigy, for an international MMA tournament. Meanwhile, his older Brendan (Joel Edgerton), also estranged brother is in danger of foreclosing on his home, and after losing his job begins training for fighting competitions as well. Their paths remain separate for more than half the film as their individual stories and relationships with their father and others are developed. Tommy constantly teeters on the edge of self-immolation as a life of trauma and abandonment have left him broken. All he knows is how to fight, and his relentless pursuit of that goal is made compelling and heartbreaking by Hardy's performance. He enlists the help of his father and former coach Paddy, a man nearing 1000 days of sobriety and desperately looking to reconnect with his sons. That desperation for redemption leads him to reaching out to his Brendan. He is much more well-adjusted than his younger brother, but in the midst of the Great Recession is in danger of losing his home after losing his job finds himself fighting for money. Never the prodigy his brother was, he scrapped his way to victories and was mediocre for most of his previous fighting career before giving that up to become a teacher. The archetypes for these characters are familiar, but are set apart by unbelievable performances from the three leads. By the halfway point of the film I felt like I had known this family for years and experienced there struggles with them. A great part of that credit goes to writer/director Gavin O'Conner - he took familiar components and created something new and inspired with them, a moving familial tragedy compelling and personal enough to almost make me forget it was a sports film through its first half. In case the audience forgets that true sports core, there is plenty of gripping action throughout that may be too much for those who normally can't stomach the violent nature of MMA, but for others is convincingly choreographed and exciting. The conflicts between the family members simmer and culminate as the brothers enter a major prize fighting tournament, with Tommy entering as until-recently unknown internet phenom famous for brutalizing a top fighter in a sparring match, while Brendan enters as an underdog, and only after his trainer's top fighter goes down with an injury and the spot needs to be filled does he get a shot. The brothers do not share screen time until just before the tournament in a scene where Brendan's attempted reconciliation is spurned. But the audience is never made to root for one brother over the other \u2013 the exposition set up two hero's that audiences equally want to see succeed. This sets up the dramatic tension of the tournament; Tommy savagely beats each opponent in his path, channeling the rage he feels for those who have failed him into his bashing fists, and Brendan, ever the underdog who has had to prove himself, scraps his way through upset after upset. O'Connor expertly plays up the coming final match without succumbing to predictability \u2013 it felt like the tournament could have gone any number of ways. But O'Connor puts a hole in the pit of the audience's stomach with each inspiring victory as he sets the course for the final match. By that point the incredible performances from Hardy and Egerton (and Nolte in a supporting role) have earned the emotional investment of viewers that the final pay-off is one of the most powerful I have ever seen in a sports film. It is a scene with such genuine, raw and coursing emotional stakes that it is truly heart breaking, and then absolutely uplifting to witness. There are some reality-defying plot points that audiences will have to overlook, but ultimately this movie is as rich, kinetic, and resonant as a sports-drama fan could ask for. In my opinion, one of the best sports movies ever made.",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the grey areas, \"it's complicated\" and flawed characters but I found the final act and ending to Warrior be an absolute cop out.  It's tries so very hard to copy the final walk out of Rocky Balboa (6) but it' just doesn't satisfy. \n\nTommy and Brendon are brothers, they grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father Paddy.  Tommy (the younger brother and then a minor) leaves with his mother.  It's clear from the dialogue in conversation that eventually occurs between them that Brendon was also supposed to leave with them, its was a plan he was on board with, but at the last minute the adult Brendon back peddled and stayed behind to be with his sweetheart who later becomes his wife.  I'm genuinely at a loss as to how Brendon's character gets sold to the audience as a \"good guy on hard times\" throughout this film (since his home is about to be foreclosed on due to the medical coasts of their daughter's heart surgery).  While a daughter's severe health crisis is a rough hand for any parent to be dealt that's an event that happens down the line for Brendon and his wife.  There was a clearly a time after Tommy and his mother left where he was working (as a fighter) and then at some point, educated himself to a level that allowed him to switch careers and become a teacher.  Brendon and his wife have improved their lives consistently and incrementally on a socio-economic level since being together, it's even a deal breaker for Brendon and the very reason he steps back into the ring \u2013 he's not going backwards he tells his wife.  He's made good for himself and his family, he has a great house, lifestyle an active social life and a respected social status (demonstrated both an early house party scene and scenes show great rapport with and support from the kids he teaches) and yet prior to his daughters health problems he had clearly never made the effort to look for Tommy or his mother despite having the resources to do so (something that their recovering alcoholic dad at least tried to to).  Brendon's wife never prompted nor prompts Brendon to look for or build a relationship with his brother (the only uncle of their children after all), and on top of all this Brendon blames Tommy for keeping his mother's eventual death from cancer from him, but  those lacking in moral character will almost always project their shortcomings on others to avoid taking personal responsibility.  It's no wonder Brendon nervously asks his father if Tommy asked about him in his first face to face conversation with Paddy who had come to let Brendon know that Tommy is around.\n\nTommy expresses in the ring what his can't in life. He's damaged from his experiences and the harsh hand he's been dealt including having to shoulder, as a minor, a burden he never should have had to carry alone when he left town.  He's made his own family among marine comrades, but a friendly fire incident causes him to desert.  He ends up courageously rescuing a comrade as he does so and is desperate to get the funds together to secure a better future for the widow of his best friend who was killed at his side. He knows training with his father will help him achieve that aim even though he despises him, so goes about emotionally punishing his father whenever he can.  In the end Tommy realises that punishing his father \u2013 a reformed and genuinely remorseful former alcoholic \u2013 does not bring him the satisfaction he might have hoped nor any level of emotional glee, as evidenced in the scene where Paddy eventually does relapse, there is no sense of release or gloating for Tommy, just complicated emotions and a resignation that the only way forward is through if they are to move forward.\n\nCutting to the end, where brother faces brother in the final fight and putting aside the improbable sequence of events that gets Brendon there.  Brendon and Tommy have trained in quite different ways. Brendon's trainer Frank is seen encouraging technical ability, calmness of mind and right thinking.  His gym is polished, his car expensive and he's well groomed, and he insists on the use of classical music.  As I could sense which way the cookie would crumble I got a growing sense of unease, knowing that the middle class fighter would eventually beat out the guy on the lower rung, I couldn't stand the thought that the writers were really going to let that happen, they could have been placed both brothers on a similar social economic status from the start but they weren't, and an uncomfortable sense of classism caused me to shake my head as the final scene approached.\n\nIn the final fight Brendon injures his brother, he knows it, he knows the fight should be stopped and his tells his trainer about it, which prompts a bizarre and hard to buy into good-trainer-turns-bad moment.  Frank who has staked his whole career on advising fighters to think right and fight with true spirit now suddenly tells Brendon to fight dirty and injure the other shoulder, he also actively thwarts Brenden's attempts to inform the referee (and the audience is to buy into this!)\n\nDoes Brendon's character make good?  Does his advocate in any way for the younger brother he previously abandoned?  Does he stand up to his trainer, does he refuse to fight, taking visible action to his brother to demonstrate that a family relationship matters more than the money he needs?  No \u2013 no he doesn't, instead he weeps, I think partly at his own inaction and the realised failure of his own moral character, he's not the man he thinks he is nor sees himself as. Instead he yells at Tommy to quit the fight (absolving himself of the responsibility to do something such as yell at the referee and alert him to what has happened).  Brenden then weeps some more as he witnesses Tommy push through physical and emotional agony and demonstrating the fighting heart and spirit his trainer talks about but which neither Brendon nor Frank actually possess. People aren't what they say, they are what they do, and Brenden doesn't really do anything but watch Tommy continue to step up to the plate despite his now physical disadvantage and heavier emotional burden. Eventually Brendon, having the advantage, finally chokes out Tommy while telling him he loves him, which is every abusive relationship in the book, sure there is an apology there but what else could Brendan do at this point?  Much is made of the fact that Brendon leaves the ring holding his brother, of course he does, he knows he's won against an injured fighter and that shouldn't have happened, how can he look any of the cameras in the eye post fight and be comfortable with that.\n\nI'm not saying there should have been a happy ending but this was just bad. It's  only the emotional performances of the leads that enabled the film to get away with it. Of course Tommy had to learn a lesson, he was tired of being alone and had to learn to let people in, to learn to forgive his father and then his brother and somehow come to know that the rage expressed in the ring was never going to be enough in life.  But this film copped out, it's ending copped out big time and left me with an enormous feeling of disappointment as the credits rolled",

            "content": "9.25/10. 9.25/10. As much poignant family drama as it is riveting sports exhibition, Warrior is a familiar but powerfully told tale of coming terms with and healing deep familial wounds. An aging recovering alcoholic Paddy Conlin (Nick Nolte) trains an estranged, resentful son Tommy (Tom Hardy), a former wrestling prodigy, for an international MMA tournament. Meanwhile, his older Brendan (Joel Edgerton), also estranged brother is in danger of foreclosing on his home, and after losing his job begins training for fighting competitions as well. Their paths remain separate for more than half the film as their individual stories and relationships with their father and others are developed. Tommy constantly teeters on the edge of self-immolation as a life of trauma and abandonment have left him broken. All he knows is how to fight, and his relentless pursuit of that goal is made compelling and heartbreaking by Hardy's performance. He enlists the help of his father and former coach Paddy, a man nearing 1000 days of sobriety and desperately looking to reconnect with his sons. That desperation for redemption leads him to reaching out to his Brendan. He is much more well-adjusted than his younger brother, but in the midst of the Great Recession is in danger of losing his home after losing his job finds himself fighting for money. Never the prodigy his brother was, he scrapped his way to victories and was mediocre for most of his previous fighting career before giving that up to become a teacher. The archetypes for these characters are familiar, but are set apart by unbelievable performances from the three leads. By the halfway point of the film I felt like I had known this family for years and experienced there struggles with them. A great part of that credit goes to writer/director Gavin O'Conner - he took familiar components and created something new and inspired with them, a moving familial tragedy compelling and personal enough to almost make me forget it was a sports film through its first half. In case the audience forgets that true sports core, there is plenty of gripping action throughout that may be too much for those who normally can't stomach the violent nature of MMA, but for others is convincingly choreographed and exciting. The conflicts between the family members simmer and culminate as the brothers enter a major prize fighting tournament, with Tommy entering as until-recently unknown internet phenom famous for brutalizing a top fighter in a sparring match, while Brendan enters as an underdog, and only after his trainer's top fighter goes down with an injury and the spot needs to be filled does he get a shot. The brothers do not share screen time until just before the tournament in a scene where Brendan's attempted reconciliation is spurned. But the audience is never made to root for one brother over the other \u2013 the exposition set up two hero's that audiences equally want to see succeed. This sets up the dramatic tension of the tournament; Tommy savagely beats each opponent in his path, channeling the rage he feels for those who have failed him into his bashing fists, and Brendan, ever the underdog who has had to prove himself, scraps his way through upset after upset. O'Connor expertly plays up the coming final match without succumbing to predictability \u2013 it felt like the tournament could have gone any number of ways. But O'Connor puts a hole in the pit of the audience's stomach with each inspiring victory as he sets the course for the final match. By that point the incredible performances from Hardy and Egerton (and Nolte in a supporting role) have earned the emotional investment of viewers that the final pay-off is one of the most powerful I have ever seen in a sports film. It is a scene with such genuine, raw and coursing emotional stakes that it is truly heart breaking, and then absolutely uplifting to witness. There are some reality-defying plot points that audiences will have to overlook, but ultimately this movie is as rich, kinetic, and resonant as a sports-drama fan could ask for. In my opinion, one of the best sports movies ever made.",

If boxing wasn\u2019t enough of a turn-off for me as the topic of a movie, MMA is on another level. I have zero interest in this stuff, and I was fairly confident I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy watching a movie about it. Then they kick off the film, and they structure it perfectly to lure me in. Like a good script tends to do, they took their time letting me meet and care about these two characters. I was on board for their introduction, and so when they enter the cage later in the film, I\u2019m now invested despite my reservations about the sport. Tom Hardy is in the best physical shape of his life, and plays Tommy as an enigma that we want to figure out. His story winds up being much more than it appears at first, which I expected, but it allows us to care for him and see why he might be a little broken inside. Joel Edgerton was superb as Brendan, and has charisma that hooked me. I loved seeing his work as a teacher and how he interacted with students, and how he had troubles at home, but ones that were understandable and not insurmountable. His character was so down-to-earth that it lent a lot of heart to Warrior. I think there were some parts that could have been handled better in the plot. The issues that they seem to make the most important are not the ones that get resolved in the end. In fact there are a number of things that are left hanging, and the reality of what happens next after the film ends is not something I even want to think about. If the entire film was ultimately going to revolve around these two brothers, then their relationship should have been addressed much more. Yet, I didn\u2019t find myself caring while I watched the film. There was enough in just a couple of scenes and the acting of these two powerhouses, that I was in tears at the end. That kind of emotional connection is something I crave from film, so Warrior is a movie that left an indelible impression on me despite the fact that I think it could have been even better.",

            "content": "Warrior\nSports films have usually had some sort of inspiring tale that can be very uplifting for the audience. These movies always have to have an underdog who ends up being a very big part of the movie. In Warrior, Tommy overcomes all sorts of adversity. His dad leaves him and his older brother at a very young age. His family fell apart because of alcoholism. Tommy ends up using that as his drive to become a very good boxer which also brings him home money. This movie represents a couple things like never giving up and putting family over everything.\n\nBoxing films, however, are the most introspective of the bunch. Inner turmoil and family hardships always play a part outside of the ring and often prove to be the biggest opponents to prevail over. There is no team when it comes to fighting; outside of your trainers and coaching staff, it's all a mind game to be at peace with one's self.\n\nThe movie Warrior fits this underdog take all kind of plot. This plot is a little different from the other fighter movies because it encompasses every single struggle he goes through. While on this journey, he has to become a better person. Little does Tommy know that his older brother that he lost contact with is doing the same thing because he is struggling with money. These kind of movies are what audiences love to watch.\n\nTo start you off with some background, Warrior is not a boxing film; instead, it goes for the more modern edge with UFC fighting. The combat in Warrior is brutal and lean, mixing up punches with deadly kicks and submission holds.\n\nThe film's plot design is two brothers. A torn apart family and conflicting personalities, enter a UFC tournament and are set on a collision course for a heated reunion. But the only problem is that they want to beat the crap out of each other. But it's the journey to that point of impact, where Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton) train and grow to understand what they are both fighting for, that's where the film shines.\n\nA big part of this movie is the two brothers trying to forgive their father. This is what makes this movie so emotional for the audience. The father forced a lot of strain on these two boys who are now rivals. But the only way for that to end is for the final fight to happen.\nBrendan's wife shows you what is looks like to be worried about her husband. Frank Grillo is his trainer who trains him to beat the best. Nolte ends up becoming Tommy's trainer which makes this movie even better.\n\nA film centered on two brothers vying for redemption with the other relies almost solely upon their heavy shoulders. It's further crucial when the story has them pounding other giant-sized men as if they were bags of meat waiting to thaw. Warrior supports two actors who go beyond the distance required for a sports film of this nature. Tommy and Brendan are both fully believable as UFC fighters and there's no visible or physical sign that they couldn't handle being in the caged ring.\n\nTommy is almost a polar opposite of Brendan. A rough soldier of duty who has a vigorous attitude that translates perfectly into the world of UFC fighting. He seems to be more of an emotional nutcase than Brendan and has a great deal of withheld aggression towards certain family issues. Hardy is a giant who dwarves Brendan. when they finally come face to face, but that's how Tommy is meant to be portrayed compared to the more nimble physique of Brendan.\n\nThese are two brothers, although seamlessly unlike, who together share a bond that carries over through endless resistance. This is why the ending of Warrior will have audiences standing in cheer. These men are fighting for family. These men want to create a bond that will never be broken. The climax is exciting and unpredictable but also a terrific emotional resolution for every character in the film. Most importantly, the troubled brotherhood between Brendan and Tommy finally comes to a heartfelt and rewarding conclusion. Hardy and Edgerton deserve most of the praise since their performances are essential to Warrior being such a moving picture.",

            "content": "Time to review another one of my personal favorite movies, and a film that I believe is incredibly underrated in light of its quality and memorability. Warrior is a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) film starring Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, as well as Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte, and it tells the story of two estranged brothers (Edgerton and Hardy) as they come together in a worldwide MMA tournament in the fight of their lives.\n\nNow, the most obvious thing one would look at in an MMA movie is the quality of the fight scenes presented, so let's start there. First of all, you don't need to be a UFC aficianado to appreciate the fights or understand what's happening. The film lays out the rules of an MMA fight fairly clearly, without explicitly informing viewers, and follows up with some impressive choreography and stylized fighting. The camera angles and sound editing makes you feel every thump, beat-down, and punch in every fight, and it is exhilarating. The action in Warrior may be some of the best action I've seen in any sports drama, maybe even any action movie. It is well-directed and well-shot, and it's amazing.\n\nThe next best thing about Warrior is its cast and their acting ability: their effort gives the film true emotion and heart, allowing viewers to forget about all of the sports-movie-cliches that fill up the movie. Hardy and Edgerton play two brothers, Tommy and Brendan Conlon, respectively, and are excellent in portraying their strained relationship as brothers and their relationships with their loved ones and, especially, their father (Nolte). Nolte provides another memorable performance in the film, conveying a man who is broken but also a man who cares incredibly for his sons and their success as MMA fighters (despite the fact that he's training one to beat the crap out of the other). Another performance I love in Warrior is that of Frank Grillo (Crossbones in Captain America: Civil War). His charismatic, friendly, and motivational personality adds a lot to Edgerton's character and his journey. Other performances in the film, even Kevin Dunn's as the principal of the school Brendan works at, as well as the actors portraying Brendan's students, did fantastic.\n\nThis is a short, straightforward review for a very straightforward movie. The point is, Warrior is an excellent sports drama that showcases incredible acting, technical editing, fight scenes, and directing. It's emotional, gripping, touching, heartwarming, and heartbreaking all at the same time. While its story is probably something you've seen done in many sports dramas before it, its effectiveness transcends that fact and pushes it out of the way in glorious fashion. Warrior is fantastic, and it deserves 5 stars.",

What sounds like a man-flick full of blood and fists is anything but! There is a decent plot only elevated by incredible performances particularly by the diverse, Tom Hardy. Nick Nolte does his job well as the drunk father who mumbles through his lines and Edgerton, is only overshadowed by Hardy.\n\nWith the popularity of UFC, it's no surprise that director and writer, Gavin O'Connor took a stab with bringing a movie like Warrior to the masses and although you may compare it to Rocky, it stands on it's own feet and does it well. The action sequences in the fights are shot remarkably well and forces the viewers to feel! \n\nWarrior is a great cinematic feature with something for everyone and comes highly recommended for all moviegoers.",

Tommy has an older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton). Brendan is married man who has two children. Tommy and Brendan had their father (Nick Nolte) who is a trainer for Mixed Martial Art. The film has a good cast and has a lot of great actors like Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo, Kurt Angle, and Bryan Callen. Starting with Tommy (Tom Hardy).

His fought for Marine and he was a hero between his the soldiers, he saved a lot of them while they were under attack. A lot of the soldiers had a lot of respect for Toomy. He returned for the first time to his home and he was depressed man. He was lost, he went to training to a fight club. In the first the trainers thoughts that Tommy was a beginner and did not know how to fight. In his first week Tommy was training crazy and one of the trainers saw him. Tommy start to try with a good fighters and he beat all of them. Then he start to compete in a lot of Mixed Martial Art championships. He was a best who had an anger inside of him.

He start to think about his family and who he need to support his family. He went to an old friend of his who had a gym, and asked him if he can help him to train so he can fight. His friend refused and told him that he cannot fight with fighter because he could die. Brendan convinced his friend and start to train. Brendan start to Compete in championship, and he would go back to his wife with bruises. Brendan and Tommy did not get along because the way their father. Their father tried them when they were young and he believed in Tommy more than Brendan. Brendan and Tommy start to beat every opponent that they had. They had a lot of fans, and they were famous in the media. Tommy was training with his father and Brendan was training with his friend. After many fight, they end up fighting each other and it was an epic fight. The movie was very good and well done. Tom Hardy played the character very nicely and he was the only one who could play it. Joel Edgerton was really good doing the character. All the actors were good doing their characters.

Mark Isham's score is very fitting to such an emotional sports movie as the music really sets the tone. The fight sequences had me on the edge of my seat - bravo to the stunt crew! My biggest issue with this movie is Hardy's character. The premise of the film is built on the idea of two brothers entering a fighting tournament and meeting each other in the final. Both characters are developed to give audience members a difficult time choosing who to cheer for in the fight. However, I loathed Hardy's character immensely. The way he treated his father, brutally attacked opponents in the ring, and the things he did in the war made him too difficult to cheer for despite his reasoning for entering the tournament. Edgerton was much easier to sympathize with. The only other thing I have to say negatively about this movie is the fact that there wasn't any closure; the movie just ends after the final fight. Despite these things, Warrior is an emotionally powerful and fun movie to watch if you enjoy sports films such as Rocky.",

            "content": "Warrior: A Knock Out or Knocked Out?\n\tWhat is arguably the best sports film made to this date, may possibly go down as one of the most underrated movies in film history.  Gavin O'Connor's unrealistic yet attention grabbing film, Warrior is an action packed, drama-filled, and heartwarming story.  This film - often being compared to the 2010 picture The Fighter directed by David O. Russel - throws a KO punch to the film cited above.  Somebody tell Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale to watch their backs, because we have two new fighters in the film industry, and they're itching for a victory.\n \t Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) and Brendan Conlan (Joel Edgerton)  are two brothers with two very different lifestyles.  Tommy is an AWOL soldier with anger in his eyes and little concern for others;  Brendan is a UFC retiree who continues his life as an average high school Physics teacher.  \nThe predictably written script is a game changer for a lot of viewers, yet others seem to find that it's what makes the film so great.  Generally in sports movies you always know the outcome.  They give you one side to root for, one team to cheer for, or one player to watch grow.  Although predictable, Warrior is special in its own way, giving you the option to choose who you want to root for.  Tommy and Brendan both have reasons to be fighting in the Sparta competition. however as the movie progresses, you will be sure to figure out the outcome,\n But hold on to the Octagon, because there is more than just fighting in this 140 minute long film.  With two brothers separated by a life impacting decision that meet up in a championship fight, how could there not be more? With the screenplay by co-writers Gavin O'Connor, the director himself, Cliff Dorfman, and Anthony Tambakis, it does seem that even with three minds, they couldn't come up with more originality for their production.  But due to their lack of creative talent,  we are able to more closely relate to the story and understand easily how the characters would be feeling in their situations.\n\tIf you think you know action filled drama films, then you must know that great acting is necessary.  Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte (Paddy) both do an exceptional job.  Nolte was nominated for 12 awards -including an oscar- for best supporting actor in his role as a recovering alcoholic father; and Hardy was nominated 4 times for best actor in a motion picture.  The movie was well made, even the music by Mark Isham.  The music playing in the last fight scene does a great job in portraying the love and relationship that the two brothers grow to develop once again.  His use of the historical composer Ludwig Van Beethoven helped make the anticipation of Brendan's improvement in his ability to fight much more exciting.\n\tHey, wouldn't one think anything that has to do with violence wouldn't make someone cry out of heartwarming sentimentality?  The brilliant plot throws together the two brothers' stories like when a chef whips up a double chocolate cake.  All we do is wait in anticipation for when we can have just a taste of the final product.  Not only does it make you grow to love the Conlan brothers, it makes it hard for you to choose a side when it all comes to it.  This chocolate cake of a movie will have you trapped in the plot.\n\tThe not-so-believable movie plot had a great surprise ending that caught most of the audience off guard.  Tommy and Brendan were able to form that bond that they once had as children.  A family had become a family once more.",

            "content": "Warrior is too long. It's cliched as hell. It's manipulative. Parts feel forced and artificial. It's overstuffed with subplots. And it's totally unbelievable. But hell if I didn't get caught up in it all. I found myself groaning and rolling my eyes far more than I'd like, but I'm a sucker for a good underdog story, especially one as well-acted as Warrior.\n\nWhen Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) shows up on his father Paddy's (Nick Nolte) doorstep after 14 years without any contact, it takes the old man by surprise. He's the first to admit that he did his son wrong growing up, and he knows that even being three years sober isn't enough to make up for what he did. But Tommy needs a place to stay and, more importantly, someone to train him for Sparta, the world's biggest MMA tournament, which is offering a $5 million prize to the last man standing.\n\nMeanwhile, Brendan Conlon is struggling to make ends meet. He and his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison), work three jobs between them, but they still aren't able to keep up with the mortgage payments, not with their youngest daughter's medical bills to deal with. So Brendan starts fighting on the side-something he promised his wife he'd stop years ago after becoming a physics teacher. But the money is good, so he keeps it up until he's suspended from his teaching job and realizes this is the only way to keep his house. He goes to an old friend for training, and once he gets back in shape, he's nearly unstoppable. He's still a major underdog at Sparta, however-especially when put up against Riordan, his brother.\n\nEverything that happens in Warrior is just a bit too coincidental to really believe it-like when a star fighter gets injured just weeks before Sparta, opening up a spot for Brendan. It doesn't help, of course, that we know where Warrior is going before it even starts (blame the trailer for that one). Even though it's familiar, however, I couldn't help but feeling for all three of these guys and rooting for them to succeed.\n\nI'm giving Tom Hardy the best-in-show award. He's sensational, giving a very physical performance, and making Tommy into a surprisingly complicated individual. If people missed out on Bronson and weren't aware of what he could do, they know now. It's the best male performance I've seen so far this year, and if he gets an Oscar nomination, I'll have no qualms.\n\nJoel Edgerton, I think, is destined for big, big things. He was tremendous in last year's Animal Kingdom. Here, he's also great, making Brendan both a tough guy and an underdog, someone who we root for, but not someone infallible.\n\nNick Nolte rounds out the main trio, and he's very sympathetic in the token \"regretful father\" role. We never quite know what he did to deserve so much vitriol from his sons, but the clues are there. He wasn't a good guy, and though he's changed, it's not really enough for them. What's interesting, however, is that because we never see any of these despicable acts, we never really see his bad side. Though we recognize that his sons have gone through too much to really forgive him, we also see him as a whipping boy.\n\nDirector Gavin O'Connor deserves a lot of credit. This is a problematic film, but he manages to make you care about it, even if you, like me, couldn't give two shits about MMA. His visual style is strong, full of confidence. And his most well-known feature, Miracle, clearly prepared him to make the Warrior finale as uplifting and heartwarming as it needs to be.\n\nWarrior will undeniably be compared to last year's The Fighter because the films cover such similar ground and came out only nine months apart. I think I preferred David O. Russell's film a little more because I remember its trajectory being just slightly different than what you'd expect. But that doesn't make this film unworthy. It's a solid release, especially for September, and with any kind of year-end help from critics, it could end up being an Oscar play for Hardy and/or Nolte.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/warrior-review/",

            "content": "It's not really an insult to say that since the release of Rocky, dramas that surround a character who fights for a living are extremely similar. What Stallone achieved with Rocky was and still is nothing short of genius. But in its wake we have had some rare gems, that can stand toe to toe with the best of their installments, David O Russell's, The Fighter being the strongest contender. Warrior boasts nothing short excellence but suffers from a predictability and style which we are far too familiar with. When Tommy Conlon shows up on his fathers doorstep, looking not to rekindle a relationship but for a man who will train him up to be an MMA fighter, with no emotional strings attached, Tommy's life soon goes stratospheric as he enters a fierce competition to win money for a charitable source. There is one catch however and that is his brother Brendan, who is struggling to keep his house and his family financially afloat, is also entering the competition and it soon becomes a true story of the under dog versus the brawler. Warrior will hit you with a jaw shattering emotional punch every step of the way and that's partly down to its powerful, yet unoriginal script but mainly down to its performances. Tom Hardy absolutely nails the American war vet, with a serious mental instability but the power to rip a door off a tank, literally. The man is yet to do wrong and here he goes full method and he bulks himself up and turns himself into a Panzer tank, he envelopes every character he takes on and he is without a doubt Warrior's biggest achievement and its biggest weakness. Joel Edgerton is surprisingly stunning as Hardy's brother, he takes an extremely by the numbers character and makes him human, giving his sense of struggle a huge weight. Nick Nolte however is utterly jaw dropping as the recovering alcoholic father, the moments both men share with Nolte will, without a doubt, leave you with a build up of the tear ducts. The entire ensemble are all great, with the supporting actors doing a brilliant job filling in the gaps. Where Warrior does falter however is not being able to evenly distribute the weight between Hardy and Edgerton. Although Edgerton is the more familiar character, Hardy is the most interesting and unpredictable and it very quickly plays its hand safe, leaving Hardy popping up from time to time to knock someone out. Of course he has some stunning moments in this film, it just feels like either the script writer or director didnt quite know how to fully portray his character, leaving Hardy being the only one truly understanding him and the audience wanting more Hardy. There are huge segments of this film devoted to father and school teacher Brendan and droplets given to Tommy, meaning we just dont get enough insight or a decent stab at what drives his motivations, and the film is 2 and a half hours long, with some easily removable scenes to make way for this inclusion. It works though and what we have is a gritty and seriously powerful movie, with some extremely well choreographed if not particularly well filmed fighting. When the punches land, they land hard and you will at times find yourself almost snapping your teeth in anxiety of some of the pain being dealt out, bigger praise goes to all the actors for really getting into shape and being able to achieve extremely believable fighting, the problem is that the DOP is more concerned about what is going on outside the ring, so you will witness Tom Hardy land a blow before the camera swings away onto some audience members expression, thus missing a huge chunk of action, I know its not an action piece, but to try so hard in making you fighting believable only to be more interested in showing us reaction shots, its a bit cheap and slightly lacking in confidence. That being said, I cannot recommend Warrior highly enough, a lop sided but solid piece of entertainment that will tug on your heart strings.",

They both give compelling performances in spots which stand out like sore thumbs, sandwiched between haymaker montages and cheap actors giving their best \"worried\" faces. \nIt felt like there were two movies being made - \"Rocky goes to Atlantic City\" and another, more interesting movie which both ran out of time, so they just shoved the two together.\nIf not for the popularity of MMA, this would never have been made, nor should it have.",

The great acting, directing and writing really keeps the audience engaged with these characters and their story.

These constant debts we carry forward in our life that make us weak & stronger at times, that once resolved we truly know our fullest potential, but until then we live these constant wars in our head reluctant that it is ever good enough. The way we are born and held to a level of standard, shapes us in who we are throughout life. If we are shown as the winning & betting horse, chances are your devoting all your focus on that horse, and not the other horses.\n\nTheogenes record versus Betthoven",

            "content": "Warrior! Warrior is a beast movie. Tom Hardy was a beast, so was Joel Edgerton, but Tom Hardy was better in my opinion ( in the ring ). The performances all around are pretty raw. Tom Hardy is this really angry dude that has been through some stuff, he had an alcoholic father played by Nick Nolte who was very good and actually got nominated for an oscar that was well deserved in my opinion, he was very good for the role and i thought he was a great casting choice. Joel Edgerton was the older son of Nick's in this film, and he is also very resentful of his father at first because i guess Nick Nolte wasnt there for him and he is mad at him for that and some other stuff. But you never find out what the big problem was, yeah he was an alcoholic, what else happened? the film just claimed that he was a bad guy and the film never really mentioned what he had done to them other than be an alcoholic. the film just mentioned in a couple scenes somthing about forgiveness. did he beat his kids back in the day? i dont know. i hated that, they never told me, that isnt ambiguity, thats just a plot hole and i really didnt like that at ALL! But, on the other hand, everything else was great. The acting as i said was great, my favourite character in this movie was Tom Hardy, he was just such a dick and i loved it, i thought it may have been one of the strongest performances in the movie, aside from Nolte. Nolte's performance was very subtle and i liked how he didnt over act in a particular scene, but i feel like maybe tom hardy should have been nominated, he added alot more impact than Nolte's character on my opinion, his raw emotions when he was fighting was insane, it was like he was a completley different person and i loved it so much! Joel Edgerton did a good job too. i didnt want him to win the fight though, i felt alot more sympathy for his character, but i didnt like his character as much as hardy's. in fact, i wish the movie focused on tom hardy way more than it did, it would have made the movie alot more enjoyable. i really liked the movie, it was always filled with tension and i really dug that, but there was just somthing missing, especially with the father son relationship dillema that kept getting brought up but never discovering what really happened back when they were kids. if you have not seen warrior i definatley reccomend you do watch it, it was really good, and im glad i got to watch it.",

Most notably is Nolte's work, but Hardy steps into the octagon and leaves with a huge improvement on his quickly soaring cinematic career as Hollywood's new badass. The only thing that hinders this film is the unrealistic splashes that were thrown in that will bug true fans of the sport, like the fact that this Russian dude is clearly heavier than everyone else, how unrealistic Hardy's too-quick fights are, and some WWE moves that truly make you shake your head in annoyance.

            "content": "Sports movies are tired. Have been for a while. You can see each beat coming and it all feels like a colour by numbers experience. Most of the time. Then there's Warrior.\n\nTwo brothers come together in the same Mixed Martial Arts competition for entirely different reasons to win the cash prize.\n\nIt's a pretty simple plot, and that really is it. But it's the way that such a simple story has an emotional kick like a horse which is really impressive. Each of these brothers is damaged in their own way and neither of them have really found a way to deal with the psychological distress their father has caused since the day they were born. As the movie unfolds, the extent of this damage becomes clearer and the relationship with their father more strained and defined. This emotional tension is ratcheted up notch by notch until it reaches breaking point, coincidentally at the same point that the action is at its climax. It's this beautiful choreography of emotional engagement and intense and furious action which puts this film above others of the same ilk. Gavin O'Connor's handling of these usually opposing forces is masterful; he maintains a familiar handheld style throughout proceedings but his restraint during purely dramatic moments shines through after the chaotic capturing of the action. He lingers on scenes in hotel bedrooms when a son comforts his father or when a husband makes difficult decision because it's reflective of their mindset. He blasts through the action because it's fast and brutal and over in fleeting glimpses. That being said, the fights and camerawork are choreographed so well that you're never straining to see what's going on. It's in capturing the feel of these situations with equal ease and control that O'Connor proves his mastery of the craft.\n\nO'Connor's influence extends to the script as well. Being one of the principal writers on the film, he keeps the focus on these two brothers at the core of the story. Bringing the two of them together on a contrivance would feel like a cheat, but the way both brothers are entered into the contest feels natural and plausible, allowing the audience to maintain some illusion of reality throughout the film. Their status in the competition feels earned as well. Brendan (Edgerton) is almost a joke by the time he steps in the ring. We may be fans of his but the audience at Sparta are not. He's there after someone is forced out due to injury and he's never seen as more than a low level threat. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, is the contest's dark horse; a brutal, terrifying hulk who has no restraint and shows no mercy as he smacks down opponent after opponent. O'Connor is able to show us the two of these very separate characters with subtle character definitions and hints along the way, and eventually shows us the juxtaposition between the two; the contrasts, their strengths and most importantly, their weaknesses. Tommy is strong because of his anger. Brendan finds strength in the ones he's fighting for. Their climactic fight is not just a fight, it's brother vs brother with no real notion of who will actually win.\n\nAnd these two brothers are played with quiet brilliance by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. Hardy may now be known for playing Bane, but his performance is here is so impressive; restrained, dark and furious and completely believable that it's a crime he didn't gain his fame from Warrior. He's so powerfully withdrawn in quiet moments and understandably antagonistic in others, less understandably in others, but he plays it all with such conviction that it's astounding to see. The flip side of his coin is Edgerton who turns in an equally impressive performance as the more relatable Brendan. He doesn't have the haunted anger to play with as Hardy does, but his soulful, open performance makes him a pleasure to watch. When the two clash for the first time, meeting on a beach for a painful, angst-filled conversation, it's amazing to see the two of them finally sharing the screen. Spending most of their time apart during the film is a bold decision, but it pays off after seeing stunning duets like this one. But the film isn't sole property of these two. Nick Nolte plays their father, and his is a towering performance, full of regret and the pain of knowing the mistakes he's made and having his attempts to fix them rejected time and time again by his sons. His alcohol-fuelled breakdown is one of the more painfully beautiful moments of the film. His occasionally cloying attempts to reconnect clashes beautifully with Tom Hardy's stoicism and the two of them are wonderful together. Jennifer Morrison also has a part to play, as the life we have to hope for on Brendan's behalf. If she wasn't as charismatic as she is, our attachment to Brendan's cause wouldn't have the strength it needs to make a connection. Thankfully, she manages to maintain a realistic sense of their relationship as well as keeping up a level attraction and support for her husband that helps us to understand what he must be going through.\n\nThe music is not the main focus of the film, which is good because the original score is nothing special. Besides a few moments where Beethoven has been remixed into an action film score with great results, it's mostly stuff we've heard before. But the soundtrack is wonderful, with a great choice of sleepily beautiful acoustic based track with an amazing use of Today by The National in the final fight which adds a huge amount of emotion to a moment which is already supercharged with it.\n\nEven though it's technically a sports movie, few of that genre have been put together as well as Warrior has. Gavin O'Connor's ability as both a writer and director shines through in every moment. Sure, it's great to see Tom Hardy pummel someone into unconscious with the self-assured savagery of a gladiator, but it's moments when we see Tommy sitting alone in his dressing room; cut off from any real connections, or Paddy's joy at barely glimpsing his grandchildren through a doorway that the film really shines.\n\nDefining Scene:\nTommy and Brendan fight and The National starts playing. Cue the waterworks.",

            "content": "Never having ever previously seen a Gavin O' Connor movie, I had no expectations as such from Warrior. The movie released in 2012, and gained a sort of cult following since then, and there were Facebook statuses and Youtube videos galore where people said that this was one of the most underrated movies of 2012.\n I have not seen Rocky. As a matter of fact the only wrestling movie I have seen is probably Never Back Down. This is not because I hate wrestling movies-but because these movies usually resort to the same old cliches.\n But in a world where there are so many boxing movies, Warrior does have some elements to it that makes it different from the others. Firstly, it is a movie which showcases mixed martial arts-and from what I know, it is shown very well. But not only are the fighting scenes well done, but the movie has a really strong plot from a dramatic view point. \n Hardy plays Tommy Conlon who still despises his father for being an alcoholic and giving him a hard time during his childhood. He is an ex-Marine and returns home to his father only so that he can train him for one of the biggest MMA events where the winner gets a ton of cash. At first, it seems a little out of place for Hardy's character to fight for cash-but there is more to it than that.\n Nolte as Hardy's father who has been sober but is still despised by both his children gives an amazing performance. You can see in his face that he really wants his children back and feels sorry for his past mistakes.\n Joel Edgerton as Tommy's elder brother is a school teacher who is in a financial problem, due to which it is imperative for him to win the tournament. We do root more for Joel's character than Hardy's as we see he has a family to take care of. But I still felt that Hardy was the show stealer here. Whenever he comes on the ring and knocks out every person in a single punch, is sure as hell does leave you awestruck.\n However, at the end, Warrior is more a family drama, with some really well done MMA in it. It is about two conflicting brothers who are not ready to accept their mistakes, a father who wants both his sons back, and a movie that really deserves much more praise and appreciation. I do not know if Warrior is the best MMA movie, but it sure must be one of the best, and it definitely would be on my Top 10 list of movies of 2012 is such a list existed.",

The first half of this film is driven by family drama clich\u00c3\u00a9, spending almost the entire half building backstories for its characters which I was not able to connect with. Why do the writers of Warrior have to try so hard? There are many campy films like this that overall succeeds due to its simplistic nature. This film clearly is trying to be sophisticated, but it does so by taking on themes that by now have been recycled way too much. Drama in sports films, especially ones that covers about family and brotherhood, are not always a negative element, as films like The Fighter succeeds in exploring this with flying colors and even at times enhancing the action in the ring. Adding on to the disappointment is the film's dialogue, with some moments splurging out one-liners that lack any sort of impact, instead leaving me cringing and sighing. The film then transitions to the MMA tournament and from there, the film immediately captures my attention with hard hitting moments that had me swearing just so I could get it out of my system. The fight choreographer for this film did a wonderful job in creating action that builds on tension, while also creating a powerful reflection on the leading characters; both brothers contain different personalities and only when they step into the ring, their true personalities emerge. Sadly the final fight of the film relies heavily on the human drama, which prevented me from highly enjoying; the emotion that the climax is trying to convey felt so heavy-handed that nothing that was delivered on screen could have possibly saved it. The performances in this film were slightly under serviceable. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton has, so far, delivered their worst performance; though they are not entirely to blame as Gavin O'Connor's direction and the screenplay are large contributors to their disappointing performances. If one is a devoted fan to UFC or MMA then go ahead and watch this as the final hour may blow you away, but if not then I recommend to stay away from this one.",

It was an emotional rollorcoaster, it was so sad, awesome and depressing, and never was a scene dull.   Nick Nolte played his character as the dad of the two fighters amazingly well.  I cried in the scene were he went to see his son Brendan and all Brendan said was how he didn't want too see him and how he was a bad father, but his father was trying so hard to get his son back.  All the acting was great, they all are well known and did very well.  It was nice too see Frank Grillo thrown in with the rest, and I'd like too see more movies with this upcoming star.  We want both of the two brothers too win, we can't root for either one because they both deserve and need it.  We are also sidding with the dad because he's trying so hard to do whats right and make it up to his tho sons but they reject him.  The ending fights that the movie is all about tool up a total of 1 hour, almost half the film, yet it never felt long or drawn out.  There were lots of quick fights, with awesome knockouts, leg bars and choke outs.  The final fight was a great finale, with one brother suffering a broken arm, and then fighting on more rounds because he was determined to win. The low music playing, the one brother talking to the often one that it was over, and the father watching it all unfold was very powerful, and again I was in tears.  It was a very powerful film, it is somewhat predictable, but you still get stuck in the moment and the final hour so gripping and tense.  The whole movie grabbed your attention and turned out increadibly well.  Wow",

            "content": "Yet another film to come from Hollywood's love affair with combat sports, this film falls into many cliches but makes up for it with strong acting and a powerful concept.\n\nTwo brothers, Tommy and Brendan, both enter SPARTA, the biggest ever MMA tournament. Tommy is looking for redemption after deserting his post during his time as a Marine, and Brendan is looking for the paycheck to prevent his young family from financial ruin. Neither brother is particularly close, and neither is interested in helping the other out, leading to a final confrontation in the ring.\n\nThe strong cast is led by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as the two brothers, with a supporting cast including Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo and Noah Emmerich. In particular, Nolte's role, as the alcoholic father who let down both sons and led to a family split, is a very powerful aspect.\n\nHowever, the fight scenes are all cliched as they get. We know who's going to win - Tommy will breeze through, and Brendan will take underdog status and scrap out a win every single time, until the final matchup. It, I think, diminishes the more interesting family storyline.\n\nA good, but not great, MMA film.",

Oh my god, Nick Nolte's character is just heartbreaking but on that note (except for one slip up) we don't get to see him when he was a practicing alcoholic either and from the state of his broken, shutdown boys you know he must have been a really, really bad man. Yeah his sons Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, so many layers to these guys especially Hardy who is captivating. He plays the youngest son who returns home and enlists the help of his remorseful (recovering) alcoholic father -and former coach- to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. Meanwhile his older brother is on the verge of losing his house and also returns to the ring which sets the estranged brothers on a collision course for the title.   \n\nThe fight scenes are gripping and intense and had me peeking through my fingers \"Arm bar for the tap out\" Ultimately, I mean you want the two brothers to come together and face off in the ring but jeez, that final round rips your heart out.

            "content": "U.S. Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) visits his father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic who has become a born-again Christian. Tommy becomes angry about his father's formerly abusive behavior and Paddy fails to convince him that he has truly changed. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where he beats a professional fighter named Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes (Erik Apple) unconscious in less than 30 seconds, in a fight which is filmed via a cell phone's video camera and later uploaded to the Internet, where it goes viral. Tommy learns about a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta in which the winner will receive $5,000,000. In order to provide for the family of his fallen friend in the Marine Corps, Tommy asks his father to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship. Meanwhile, Tommy's older brother, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter, is struggling to financially provide for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters and faces the possibility of his home getting foreclosed due to mortgage re-financing to pay for his younger daughter's open heart surgery. To increase his income, Brendan risks returning to his former profession as a mixed martial arts fighter battling amateur fighters for money. Rumors of Brendan fighting in the ring begin spreading amongst his students. The school's superintendent, objecting to his participation in such dangerous activities, suspends him without pay. Left with no other option, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured during training, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement. Later that night, Paddy comes over to meet up with Brendan in his drive way to try to reconcile with him, but to no avail. Even though Brendan had forgiven his father, he still doesn't trust him, and doesn't want his father starting trouble with his own family. Before Paddy leaves, he tells Brendan that he's been sober for 1,000 days, and that Tommy is back in town, and to be sure to look him up. After arriving at the tournament, Brendan discovers that Tommy has also entered. Tommy is still bitter at Brendan for staying behind with Tess when Tommy and their mother left the drunken and abusive Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became terminally ill. Brendan claims that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced. Meanwhile, the video of Tommy beating \"Mad Dog\" attracts the attention of a Marine in Iraq whose life was saved by Tommy months prior. The information and video of Tommy saving the Marine is shared with the press and Tommy becomes a national hero, gaining a massive fan base and appreciation from not only viewers, but from the U.S. Marine Corps as well. However, Tommy's records surface from the Corps and reveal that he deserted the military after his entire unit was killed in a friendly fire bombing. Tommy had been using his mother's maiden name as his own surname in order to evade arrest for his desertion. The military police will take him into custody after the tournament is over. However, Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog in the Sparta tournament sets him on a collision course with Tommy and the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart in a fight not only for survival but for family ties...\n\n\"Warrior\" has all the emotional themes you can imagine; redemption, reconciliation, the power of the human spirit, the bond of a family, forgiveness, love, estrangement and alcoholism. The strong side of \"Warrior\" is particularly the performances from Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. Nick Nolte gained a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as Paddy Conlon. He\u00b4s at his best here. The emotional structure with the torn apart family in the focus, is gripping and powerful and several scenes are hard to watch. The casino scene between Nolte and Hardy and also the bedroom scene between them both presents us with truly powerful acting. And the fight scenes has a very real life touch to them and they are skilfully staged. The weak side is the flag waving and overbearing sappy patriotic platform that creates an uneven balance in the movie and sort of ruins partly the movie for me. Many scenes that are set within the MMA world feels so \"staged\" and \"faked\" in my point of view and that drags down my grade. Yes, there\u00b4s gripping action, powerful acting and heart, but it\u00b4s not enough to balance up the less good parts of the film.",

Warrior is a simple story, simply told, that is carried on the backs of those two lead characters, and the acting ability of the actors who play them. There are many other things to enjoy about this movie indeed (even if you're not an MMA fan, or even a sports fan in general, and I am living testament to this), but the centerpiece is the perfect performances by Joel Edgerton (The Thing) and Tom Hardy (Inception). Neither of them has carried a major role before; both are usually found in minor supporting roles. I predict that, after Warrior, that will change rapidly.\n\nEdgerton and Hardy play brothers, Brendan Conlan and Tommy Riordan respectively. Both used to be MMA fighters. Brendan, after an ultimatum from his wife following a near-death experience, hung up the gloves and became a high school physics teacher; Tommy did...something else (the unfolding revelation of Tommy's missing years is a major subplot in the film, so saying what would be a spoiler). Their father Paddy (Affliction's Nick Nolte, and I used that 1998 effort to identify him because that's the last time I liked him in a movie this much) is a trainer and recovering alcoholic who, we get the impression, used to be something of a monster. Now all he wants is to be able to atone for his wrongdoings and make up with his kids. However, as Tommy says at one point in the film, \"the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.\" All of which is important, but has nothing to do with the main plot of the film: an entrepreneur has set up a winner-take-all MMA tournament with a five million dollar purse. Both brothers are cash-strapped, and both of them decide to go for it, Tommy under his father's tutelage, Brendan back with his old trainer Frank Campana (End of Watch's Frank Grillo). \n\nThe obvious parallel here, to me, is with Wai Man Yip's ridiculous, but fun, 2003 comedy Anna in Kung Fu Land, which I watched a week or so before this without realizing how parallel the two films are; each is about half setup and then half competition (though Warrior spends much more time on character development even during the competition portion), with the same single-elimination winner-take-all tournament style, even with almost the same number of contestants (Anna's competition has fifteen, Warrior's sixteen), leading to a series of battles that expose the strengths and weaknesses of our main characters. The fight scenes are beautiful, the best I've seen since Girlfight, and with a refreshing lack of the ridiculous tendency in fight scenes these days to have slo-mo blood spray as soon as someone gets tapped with a daisy. But it's all leading exactly where you think it is, so if you dispense with the fighting as a draw here, all you have is these characters and the familial drama that surrounds them. And Gavin O'Connor (Miracle), who also co-wrote with Anthony Tambakis (his writing debut) and Cliff Dorfman (Entourage), knocks it out of the park. The family-drama side of the script is impressionist, light-handed, gives just enough to get you filling in the blanks yourself right up until the end (and gives you enough clues that the unanswered questions at the end are easily answerable with a bit of thinking). It's a very risky proposition, especially in a movie where the other half of the action has all the subtlety and impressionism of a sledgehammer to the face. And they pull it off tremendously. As I've stated a time or two, that is in no small part down to Edgerton and Hardy, who show the world that they are both forces to be reckoned with. This is an amazing piece of cinema, ironically one of the best-reviewed (83% at Rotten Tomatoes) and yet least-seen in first run (the movie made back just over half its $25 million budget), movies of 2011. If you were one of the legions that missed it in the theater, do what you must to see it now. It is a phenomenal film. ****  1/2",

Without being overly cheesy like \"Never Back Down\" or being horribly cast..... you know where I am going with this. First off, everyone who saw \"Rocknrolla\" back in 2008 got to see Tom Hardy like Jason Statham being thrown into the world of major motion pictures via Guy Ritchie. Tom Hardy has turned himself into an all star actor showing incredible versatility in the roles he plays. Secondly, Joel Edgerton is always impressive in every role he plays. It is no wonder he knocked this one out of the park. What I really enjoyed about his and his brothers characters is that they are former wrestlers from Pennsylvania which is known for producing the best wrestlers in the Nation. Not to mention Nick Nolte playing the Irate alcoholic turned soft grandfather. His facial expressions are priceless when his sons are competing which just adds to the realism if you have ever been to wrestling match. You know that one or five dads who turn red yelling from the stands. \n\nAnyway, go check this movie out. it rocks!!!",

However, Nolte's performance isn't the only great one--the entire cast earned high marks on my scorecard. This movie is part \"Rocky\" and part \"Million Dollar Baby\"...but it's easily the best of the trio with it's focus on fighting, family, and forgiveness. Whether you enjoy UFC bouts or not, you'll find this flick enjoyable until the last tapout. Grade: A",

Gavin O'Connor films the fighting rather conventionally but gets bailed out by the adrenalin of the sport itself. His framing technique on close-ups is not functional given the chosen aspect ratio of the picture, but when you got great and good actors in the frame, it becomes only a minor nuisance. I can't really recommend it, but if you catch on TV don't turn it off.",
