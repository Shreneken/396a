            "content": "Set in Tehran, a young Iranian couple find themselves in front of a magistrate in order to facilitate a separation, not because of a lack of love or an infidelity, but due to a moral dilemma.  She wants to take advantage of an expiring visa and have the family move out of Iran in order to give her daughter a better opportunity at life.  He feels that he is unable to leave due to his obligation to take care of his elderly father who suffers from Alzheimer's, all of which leads to an unimaginable chain of events.  Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is a film filled with characters who struggle to do what they believe is the right thing to protect their interests and their families.  It is compelling throughout, filled with believable dialogue and scenarios, naturalistic acting, effective handheld camerawork, and an ending that will break even the hardest of hearts.  There is nothing else out there quite like A Separation, arguably Farhadi's finest film.",

            "content": "Feel that? That's the combination of moral grayness and empathy washing over you. The response that A Separation may give you certainly doesn't trend towards \"warm and fuzzy\", but even if it's uncomfortable there is no denying its power. \n\nI love tough films about human nature that deal with complex characters, they're the best; this 2011 Iranian film by Asghar Farhadi revels in its tough decisions, crafting a vitriolic and devastating (yet entirely plausible) modern-day conflict between people that each retain a bit of kindness and cruelty in themselves. Nobody in the film is explicitly evil, they are the culmination of their past experiences, present circumstances, and personal desires, the embodiment of the phrase \"people are not against you, they are for themselves\". Actions taken measure individual benefits against the risk of harm to others, or emerge out of simple, irrational emotion or personality flaws; take for example, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) facing limited time to take care of her daily tasks, and deciding to leave her senile patient alone and tied to a bed for some time. Nader (Moaadi), the patient's son, comes home and sees a cruel act and a broken promise, while Razieh thought of it as an unfortunate necessity as a result of her financially unstable household. Thus, every conflict is a battle of perspective and circumstance rather than objective right vs. wrong. \n\nFrom this potent foundation, Farhadi builds a sweeping story that expands from base human nature to a portrait of modern society in Iran, focusing on the state of social and religious influences as well as class conflict and disconnected government influences. Along the way we keep this claustrophobic, uncomfortable perspective that lets even small confrontations loom large, creating a consistently taut atmosphere that never lets you turn away. And yet, it doesn't feel like there is a moment wasted here, as the story builds organically and in a compelling manner. Despite any cultural divides, I was absolutely absorbed in the screenplay, the performances, and the outcome.\n\nAnd random note, this is the first film where I've seen someone with the title of 'Investor' in the opening credits.\n\nAnd that's every movie from every edition of the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die released to date! Going out on a high note. (5/5)",

            "content": "Hearing how highly regarded A Separation was among my IMDb friends, I knew I had to see it. My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It won a Golden Globe for best foreign film in January (2012) and is nominated for an Academy award.  \"This is a gritty movie that can described as both slow paced yet riveting.  It touches on the human need to express their will.  It becomes a study of human foibles and the impossible subtle lies they create that then start to define themselves.  \n\nIt is a story about Simin (wife) who begins the divorces proceeding to both force the husband Nader to leave the country for a freer environment for their daughter but more importantly having the need for Nader to fight to keep her home (she moves out).  This creates problems for Nader who has a father who has dementia so must hirer a housekeeper Razieh who is pregnant.  Then one day Nader notices that Razieh improperly cares for his father, anger spills over which leads to he-said-she-said machinations.  \n\nThis slice of life film presents you with a variety of human mistakes but does not preach.  Then it overwhelms the family by the specifics of a legal case that grows pricklier as the movie goes along.  The lies build which ultimately causes major mental anguish in their 12 year old daughter Termeh who not only must deal with the lies but must make a terrible choice of deciding between staying with the father or mother.  This is not your typical film and a surprising choice for winning awards.  However, the film presents us with the turmoil that anyone of us could find ourselves in within our daily lives.  That is what makes it both simply yet riveting.\"",

Then there's the loss not just of an 'innocence', but the loss Termeh feels here as she loses real faith in her father's character; his credibility. \nThe father gives a strong impression of a man who was once much more than he is now- a cynical, unhappy man, always ready with excuses for his failings or someone else to put it on.\nAnd Farhadi uses class status, poverty, and the paralyzing effects of religious zealotry as further aspects of life that can be bring out the worst of us, or leave us seemingly (literally?) helpless.\nFarhadi's screenplay and direction are at a master's level here. The dialogue is highly detailed (how did he know she got the number if he didn't hear them talk?) but still so natural and arresting.\nThe acting is equal to the level of writing and directing. Bayat is the very image of the helpless, desperate victim arrested by the sway of zealotry and poverty.\nMaadi and Hosseini are equally great as loving family men who are undone by righteousness, anger, and a refusal to see/accept how their actions damage others. Shahbazi as the elderly father with dementia seems all too real, authentic.\nBut none of them are better than Sarina Farhadi as Termeh, the moral heart of the film. One simply cannot be a warm-blooded sentient being and not feel her torment, disappointment and fragility. 4.5 stars",

            "content": "A Separation is a great film that helps the audience empathize with imperfect people. The main characters all had a virtue when taken to an extreme became a vice. The wife, Simin, is pragmatic, but this leads her to looking for expedient solutions to problems (such as the inciting incident of her seeking a divorce for practical, rather than emotional, reasons), which leads to problems for herself and others down the line. The husband, Nader, is proud, which leads to him embracing Pyrrhic victories. Razieh is devout, but can't fathom how to react when hypothetical injunctions in her religion clash with the real world. Her husband, Hojjat, is also over-proud, but whereas Nader's pride is a luxury on top of his other advantages, Hojjat's pride is all he has, and can't see how he is acting despicably to hold on to it. The performances feel natural, and the characters' actions, thus the plot, stem from their personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the handheld camera, which always takes me out of a film as I imagine the person pretending to struggle to hold on to the camera and making the movie look unnecessarily sloppy. That was one artistic decision that didn't work, in my opinion, in an otherwise excellent film.",

It does NOT need guns, bullets, epic car chase scenes nor the threat of a nuclear bomb to make a movie a nail biter. The stark and brutal realities of every day life, with no embelishment, is more than enough.\n\nA pivotal perspective here is that of Termeh's. In her eyes, it begins with many of the idealizations which an 11 yr old girl would have. Her encounter with each parent reveal much of the character of both adults while also revealing hers. The innocence of her questions and observations as she tries to find what truth is, what loyalty and love are, the value and meaning of choice and freedom and realities of practice the freedom to choose, are so poignantly depicted. Everyone of us can relate to that singular event when we felt the silent anguish as the bubble of innocence breaks into a million pieces. \n\nIt was moving to see the depth of self-condemnation, victimization and projection which runs amok in a mind that is enslaved to the morays, culture and religion in which one belongs to. The quality of life we experience is protracted and painful when we are unable to recognize our own inner divinity; slavery is when we are asleep to our inherent innocence of being. To look outside of ourselves for salvation, redemption and validation take us to never ending dark pits of guilt and despair. No amount of fixing the outer condition (through lies or smashing windshields or working long crazy hours while pregnant) will address the inner condition. The couple Razieh and Hodjat showed this truth. This condition they are in is NOT unique to the Muslim faith; it goes across the board. The dogma preached is that if one practices strict adherence to the tenets of their faith, it insures the safety and well-being of those they love. The irony is of course, this fallacious illusion is perpetuated ad nauseum even WHILE there are plenty of examples of devout practioners of who were NOT shielded from the same things all these spiritual practices are meant to allay.\n\nI loved how the women, who had many different loyalties, kept finding themselves come together to bridge the steadily growing fracture and violence threatening to consume them all. They are, of course, each contributory to all that was unfolding. The motivations of each character are so successfully fully fleshed out that it is clear there are no good guys or bad guys, no saint and no sinner. Every part supports every other part in making the whole picture play out the way that it does.\n\nAgain, what a masterpiece.",

They have a pre-adolescent girl who has to deal with this situation, and decide after all which parent she wants to live with.\n\nAsghar Farhadi directs, writes and produces this wonderful piece of art set in the mordern-day Iran and that is an important factor due to progress that we have seen in the last years in Islamic countries. As the story goes on we see how modernization in social aspects have arrived to Iran and how the people deals with it, but also how traditional they remain even for legal issues.\n\nWe do not see this movie as a technical achievement of course, that was not the intention and neither was to make a symbolic complex film that would have different interpretations, as far as we know those are not the reasons why Farhadi made A separation. The whole idea is supported by an outstanding screenplay, every dialogue and every line are so powerful and well written, in particular the discussions of our two main characters and the conflict that involves Nader. The cast is simply the best not only our four starring actors, yes, four, but also the children are superb, we can feel with them, either is sadness or fear they are always believable.\n\nAnd that end, oh my god that end scene it just defines the title that is really important through the whole film because our two main characters always feel separated, distant and where they are together there are no happy moments, everything is a conflict. \n\nFor me is the movie of the decade, all in it works in a perfect way, I felt delighted from that great first scene to that monumental final shot. It is so refreshing to see something from another culture completely different and feel so attached to it, Cinema is a universal language that make us feel alive and A separation is the living proof for that. 10/10",

I always find it interesting when a film explores how mundane events can snowball into something serious, and this film shows a great example of the compounding effect one simple decision can create. I was riveted as the plot progressed because they managed to keep enough details from the viewers, so we never quite knew the truth. Eventually the film devolves into a prolonged legal battle, and even though the Iranian legal system is slightly different from our own, it still had all the excitement that I love out of courtroom dramas. In fact, there was some simplicity to this court proceeding that I found delightful. (Perhaps the absence of lawyers helps.) There were twists and turns, bold lies, and emotional pleas to the judge. This all made for a movie that worked much better for me than I expected after the slow setup in the early scenes. What I always find amazing is when a film is able to shift my opinions of the characters over time, without completely rewriting them. The personalities of the characters in A Separation never changed one bit, but each time something more would be revealed, I would reconsider how I felt about the people involved. There are no clear villains or heroes in this story, because it feels like real life. Instead, each character is doing what they think is right, and whether they are actually in the right or in the wrong is in the eye of the beholder. There are several aspects of this movie that are tough to watch, though. It prominently features an old man struggling with Alzheimer’s, which I’ve experienced firsthand and I don’t enjoy reliving it. The ending is also a real gut punch, and sadly left me hanging instead of giving me the closure I typically prefer. However, all-around I think that A Separation is a wonderfully constructed film, and one that more people should seek out.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de In A Seperation versucht jeder der Charaktere sein Leben zu leben innerhalb der Grenzen von Staat und Religion. Es ist ein persischer Film und wir lernen ganz nebenbei eine Menge über ein System, in dem der Staat die Religion vertritt. Schliesslich landen alle Beteiligten vor Gericht, dass menschliche Gefühle durch einen Regel-Katalog zu verrechnen versucht. Wir, die Zuschauer, werden bei diesen Verhandlungen so direkt mit einbezogen, wie ich es bei kaum einem Film je erlebt habe! Wir verstehen die Logik jeder Position und selbst unsere eigenen Gefühle widersprechen sich dabei. Versuchen wir uns ein Leben vorzustellen im Iran, einer modernen Gesellschaft, die sich die Gesetze des Korans auferlegt hat. A Seperation hat übrigens keine Probleme mit dem Islam; der Film führt vor, wie Theorie und Praxis des Rechts nicht miteinander vereinbar sind. Ein Problem in allen Staaten der Welt. Das Gesetz versucht, hypothetisch zu richten und dabei besteht die Gefahr, dass das Recht durch Prinzipien ersetzt wird. Und so funktioniert die Grundkonstellation: Nader und Simin (Peyman Moadi und Leila Hatami) sind ein glücklich verheiratetes Ehepaar aus Teheran mit einer süssen elfjährigen Tochter namens Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Ausserdem lebt Naders siniler Vater bei ihnen. Um ihrer Tochter ein besseres Leben zu ermöglichen, wollen Nader und Simin auswandern. Nader will nur noch eine Weile bleiben, um für den Vater zu sorgen. Ein Konflikt: Sein Vater würde ihn doch gar nicht mehr kennen; sagt Simin. Nader aber widerspricht, dass er seinen Vater dagegen sehr wohl noch kennen würde. Für den Vater hat Nader eine Pflegerin engagiert, Razieh (Sareh Bayat). Sie arbeitet im Geheimen, da ihr Mann Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), niemals erlauben würde, dass sie in einem Haushalt arbeitet, in dem sie mit einem Mann allein ist. Ein strikter Moslem offensichtlich. Eines Tages kehrt Nader heim und findet seinen Vater ans Bett gefesselt. Razieh tat das aus gutem Grund, doch in diesem Moment wissen weder Nader noch wir das. Nader feuert Razieh und sie beschuldigt ihn, dass er sie die Treppe herunter stiess. Dabei erlitt sie eine Fehlgeburt. Nader wird des Totschlags angeklagt. Ich denke, das ist alles, was du über die Ausgangssituation wissen musst. Der Richter agiert übrigens fair in diesem Prozess und auch die Geschworenen versuchen, möglichst objektiv zu entscheiden. Niemand im Gerichtssaal aber, kennt alle Fakten und das Urteil muss gemäss des Korans ausfallen. Nader und Simin sind moderaten Glaubens, Razieh überlegt immerhin, ob sie die Unterwäsche eines Mannes wechseln darf, obwohl der alt und krank ist. Die treibende Kraft hinter ihr, das ist ihre Familie. Ich denke, wir haben es hier weniger mit einem Gerichtsfilm zu tun, der die Wahrheitsfindung zum Ziel hat. A Seperation versucht vielmehr, alle Seiten zu verstehen und Empathie aufzubauen. Im Mittelpunkt stehen Liebende, deren Handeln sie entweit. Es fällt uns am Ende schwer, überhaupt wen zu verurteilen. Ich hatte die grössten Probleme, Naders Position zu teilen. Ja, ich verstehe ihn. Nein, ich denke, er handelt falsch, weil er immer noch in den Kategorien Recht vs. Unrecht operiert - das aber auf Kosten seiner Familie. Ich denke, in den Zeiten von Pergida und Trump, in denen die dümmsten Menschen davon ausgehen, der Iran sei eine Nation voller durchgedrehter \"Kameltreiber\", ist A Seperation eine vernünftige Medizin. Wir bekommen das Portrait einer Gesellschaft in all ihren Nuancen. Die Menschen im Film agieren moderat mit dem Willen, das Richtige zu tun. Richtig und falsch zu entscheiden, das gestaltet sich hier zu einem moralischen Befund über das Wesen des Gerichts an sich.\n(Dazu gibts unsere Film List Arthaus Iran auf cinegeek.de",

            "content": "So simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot. The fact that it is already overwhelming to see the usually under-the-wraps domestic life of Iran and to couple it with near perfect screenplay, performances and mounting suspense is more than what you can ask for and nothing you would have expected. Doing the right thing, setting an example, moral ambiguity, people's reaction to different circumstances were so beautifully fit into this complex puzzle. \n\nPayman Maadi (Nader) and Leila Hatami (Simin) are a couple going through a divorce after 14 years of marriage. While the reasons could be complicated and ambiguous, it is taking a toll on their teenage daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's and requires constant care and attention. When he employs Razieh (Sareh Bayat) for household work, an incident triggers aggression from Nader who unconsciously acts rude to Razieh. Nader's life crumbles into further shambles when Razieh's family accuses and lodges a case on him for murder as she has suffered a miscarriage. When Razieh's husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini), an unemployed, depressed and debt ridden man takes matters to his hand, things turn ugly. \n\nThe beauty of it is the realistic approach taken in every frame resisting the temptations of being sensational. The screenplay was so exhilarating pushing the boundaries of such a simple premise into heart-pounding suspense. The ideology, the general mindset and day-to-day life in Iran was quite informative and fulfills your food for curiosity. Coming to performances, it is near perfect with none tampering into each other's space and doing the best in their zone. A special mention should go to the sweet little girl who plays Razieh's daughter as she conveys a lot through her big expressive eyes and hardly uttering a word. While the divorce story as advertised plays a poignant role, it mostly takes a backseat during the tense drama. \n\nSome scenes that were informative or packs an impact \n> When Razieh calls a religious helpline to check if she could change a helpless old man's pants \n> Razieh's daughter's eyes conveying and covering the facade of ugly spats \n> When Teremeh confronts Nader if he lied \n> Climax tussle between Razieh and Hojjat \n> Nader's unflinching love and support for his father \n\nSo simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot",

            "content": "A Separation is an absolute tour-de-force of storytelling. Long after the credits have rolled, I still have hard time comprehending how writer/director Asghar Farhadi managed to fit so much into just two hours. The film touches on a number of potentially melodramatic issues with real clarity and poise, and the cultural differences between the characters and us just enhance our interest in what's happening to them. It's a masterful piece of filmmaking, and one that'll stay with you for a while.\n\nNader (Peyman Maadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are our main characters, and they've decided to get a divorce. Simin wishes to move to America to give their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), more opportunities than she'll be afforded in their native Iran. Nader, however, won't go. His father was recently stricken with Alzheimer's and he's obligated to care for him. Though these two are generally agreeable and relatively forward-thinking, this issue wedges them apart in seemingly irreparable ways.\n\nBut it's the aftermath of this separation that moves the film forward. A now single Nader hires a woman, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), to care for his father during the day. She does it for one day but has number of issues with the arrangement. She travels a long way to do it, and she's forced to take Nader's father to the bathroom (which makes her, a married woman, uncomfortable). But the biggest complication is that she's pregnant and her husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), doesn't know she's working in the home of another man.\n\nOne day, Nader returns home early to find Razieh gone, some money missing, and his father passed out and tied to the bed. When the woman gets in, he's understandably furious. She needed to run an errand, she says. But the ensuing shouting match ends with Nader shoving her (somewhat gently) out the door. She falls down the stairs, and the next day, Nader is arrested. Murder is the charge, for Razieh lost her baby, and the two families take their extraordinarily complicated problems to the Iranian courts.\n\nYes, A Separation is quite dense. There's a lot of set-up necessary for the viewer to understand the relationships and how the consequences of both the separation and the confrontation will reverberate throughout this small group of people. Will this little shove mean Termeh and her mother end up in America? Could Razieh also go to jail (for negligence)? Her husband (for insolence)? Then, there's the questions about the real cause of the termination of Razieh's pregnancy. Where exactly did she go that day? And could her husband's very short temper have caused him to abuse her after finding out about her work? These would have been incredibly complex issues and questions in, say, an American suburban drama. In the hectic, overcrowded Iranian courts, the film takes on a whole other level of confusion and complexity. In this way, Tehran is itself one of the most important characters in this story.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a film like this (and one that's been so universally praised) features extraordinary acting. Of all the great, authentic performances (and there are many), I think Peyman Maadi's is the strongest. Overall, he's a good man. He's struggling to do the best he can after being thrown for a loop when his wife leaves him, and this pressure causes him to make one mistake. And he's trying to show his daughter what's right and what's wrong, but then he chooses to lie to the judge in order to protect himself. The film ultimately comes down to deciding to do what's right and what's easy. This question is embodied most in Nader, and Maddi does an astounding job bringing his character's struggle with it to life.\n\nA Separation has been acknowledged by countless critics groups and is a frontrunner to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign-Language Feature. It deserves all of this attention, and more. It's a relatively accessible motion picture, though general audiences are, of course, subtitle-phobic. I hope it gets an audience, for it's a film that deserves robust discussion and debate.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/a-separation-review/",

It's a very intimate film, done with an almost documentary style feel, which suits the dark mood. It begins in Tehran, where married couple Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), who have been married for 14 years, suddenly decide to separate, even though they have an 11 year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), and Nader's father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) is living in the apartment, he's extremely frail and is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. With their divorce application rejected, Simin moves over, and Nader hires carer Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to look after his father while he's at work. But she soon finds the job of looking after Nader's father very difficult, so she brings in her moody husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) to help. It's a very powerful film about the difficulties one family have to face when they split, although this one is set in Iran, where customs and laws there are very different to customs in the west. Iran gets a lot of bad press for it's politics, but it's cinema is quite beautiful, and it should be given more of a look in on the basis of this.",

The socio-cultural norms of Iranian society, the role of Islam and the Iranian justice system were fascinating to me. It's a world we don't see often.

It's competent on most technical aspects and it's well written. But I fail to see anything special about it... While the argument is interesting and relevant in the islamic context, it seemed to me the developments were too much akin to what can be seen in soap opera stuff, or Telenovelas... I'm not saying this work is such a thing, however, for a family drama movie it left me wanting on cinematic and emotional nuance, I found little of it.\n\nThe lack of physical tenderness in transgender relations, for example, has taken away some depth and nuance in human relations I would expect to encounter in a family drama, here I suppose the islamic context is to blame with all its omnipresence even in creative circles. So praise must be given to Asghar Farhadi for still being able to make a movie with some emotional power and, in fact, he might have used this sort of peculiarities to his advantage as depicted in the only scene where there's an act of physical tenderness between a man (senile grandpa) and a woman (young granddaughter): here the viewer is only able to see part of the woman's body while the act itself (kiss or hug the question remains) is covered in a very interesting way, I found this one of the rare interesting cinematic nuances of the whole movie. These peculiarities give this work a potentially educational value to anyone who doesn't know the daily life in Iran. I feel that the greatest value of this work are the difficult moral and social questions it arises as a challenge to the viewer which compel to reflection.\n\nThe very first scene of the movie promised a lot (brilliant!), but in pretty much the whole rest of it I failed to see anything that could depark this work from all other alike dramas that abound so much nowadays, the islamic context added its own quirks and peculiarities to the social, moral and religious paradigms depicted here but cinematically it contributed little to nothing, in fact I would say that it subtracted some nuance and depth in human relations... but maybe this was precisely the intent of the director in order to most realistically portray the true social paradigm of the country... honestly I got the feeling it was more of a limitation than deliberate choice of Asghar Farhadi, in any case, he surely has tried to use it to his own benefit... within possibilities...\n\nThe thing is, the main complain I have of this movie is that it is emotionally dry and very plain as I perceive it... Those are precisely the words that first show up in my head to describe it - very realistic but dry and plain in almost every level... and boring to watch despite a few thrills and curiosities here and there... I actually forced myself to see it a second time to try to figure out what I was missing before writing my thoughts, but no, this is not the sort of movie that keeps me interested for more, actually it went down on my estimation in the second view, it wasn't entertaining at all.\n\nIn the end I fail to see what's so special about it and hardly understand the high praise from critics. I don't think it's a bad movie, I think it's a good movie but not exceptional in any way to deserve so much love and kiss. If not for the few rare interesting scenes and the external factors limiting its production, I would possibly rate it lower. I'm curious to see what this director can do in a more open environment, but if The Past is just more of the same I'm afraid I'm not interested.",

            "content": "Becoming one of the Top 20 best Iranian films in my book, Asghar Farhadi puts the Iranian industry in the celluloid map once again with a film that works remarkably as an essay on responsibility and lack of communication. Lack of communication leads to lack of trust. Lack of trust leads to loneliness. Loneliness leads to depression. Depression leads to suffering. Suffering, in one way or another, is transmitted to others, and has many ways to manifest depending on your personality. We see this axiomatic spiral in one of the most memorable films of 2011. It doesn't matter where you come from, or where you were born; family matters come first, and they should be treated responsibly, with an open communication.\n\nAgain, this is the second time I see international cinema putting children in the middle of consequences brought by adults, and therefore having to pay for the broken dishes that their parents broke. They are, unwillingly, protagonists of catastrophes (the ending scene is incredibly ridiculous just as it is real nowadays). Their ideas, expressions and tears are the only hope of light left in this chaotic (and dramatic) world. Also, be careful in taking sides, Every single character in the film made a mistake or said a lie except for the two girls, and each mistake and lie brought to light had a negative impact either on the same person or on somebody else. The power of the spoken word is sacred; do not use it to ruin people's lives. If you were on only one character's side and agreed with him/her completely, you did not understand the movie.\n\nMarvelous performances by a very talented ensemble cast of all ages and a screenplay worth worldwide appraisal accentuate this Iranian statement about being honest and taking decisions thinking of your family first and putting yourself in the last place. I had never hated the character of a wife so much since Kramer vs. Kramer (1979).\n\n97/100",

The story concerns a couple who divorces when the mother wants to leave Iran, but the father decides to stay behind with his Alzheimer's-suffering father. What follows is a compelling drama about divorce and its effect on the people involved, even how it can reach beyond the immediate family. There are many other complex issues discussed, and all of it is through lens of Muslim culture, which I found fascinating. Thematically, the central issue is about making tough decisions in the context of a culture where religion and government are so intertwined. As far as acting is concerned, it was some of the best I've ever seen. Every performer gave their all, and it felt like I was watching a documentary with real people. This tone was also reinforced by the handheld camerawork and (until the closing credits) a lack of music. Overall, this is not just one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the best period. The only minor issue I take is the rather ambiguous ending, but after watching the problems that the characters go through for two hours, it's probably just my personal desire for a more clear-cut resolution. Overall, if you love foreign films or complex, realistic dramas then give this a try.",

Unfortunately, for most viewers it practically demands multiple viewings because it also boasts some unusual creative decisions. To get this out of the way quickly, there are two big problems that kept me from fully enjoying it: the title and the character Simin. The more appropriate title would have been \"A Messy Court Case\", because the majority of the running time is devoted to resolving a difficult legal dispute between Nader and another couple. There are very few scenes that actually explore the relationship between the two divorcees, even though these are excellent. On top of that, the wife Simin receives an aggravatingly small amount of screen time; out of a total duration of about 2 hours, she only appears for approximately 25 minutes, frustrating because she is even at the forefront of the movie's cover. I am sure there was a reason for this, but I still believe it to be a detriment. It prevents us from fully understanding both sides of the story. \nThat being said, if you understand these things before watching the movie and keep in mind that everything in it is more or less a result of the divorce, you will probably appreciate it much more. It is very different from what I am used to and I believe that with repeated viewings I too will learn to appreciate it more. There are a slew of insightful, powerful moments and, despite any initial issues, this is still a stronger and more dignified film on the complexities of marital issues than Eyes Wide Shut.",

There are few films as intricately crafted, as socially aware (without for one moment lapsing into didacticism) or as perfectly realistic as this gritty family drama. \n\nThe film begins with Simin filing for divorce from husband Nader, the camera placed in the perspective of the apathetic judge watching the couple bicker. Yet what starts off as a merely domestic dispute goes on to have wider implications, and while the plot thickens it remains plausible, never for a moment lapsing into the far-fetched sorts of devices which so many filmmakers today use. Simin's moving to her parents house forces Nader into hiring a housekeeper, tasked primarily with looking after his Alzheimer's-stricken father. The tensions of looking after the old man in light of the divorce form the main plot complication. Nader's relationship with the housekeeper, a lower-class woman who has to make a long commute for a meagre wage, is always strained, but deteriorates to a new low when the housekeeper suffers a miscarriage caused by trauma and blames a one-off act of violence by Nader.  \n\nA Separation is intricate, both in style and substance. The director unfolds the film in an elliptical fashion, leaving out seemingly tedious details which slowly, and one by one, come to be of great importance. After the murder investigation gets under way, little white lies, tedious conversations, and small actions become paramount. Details the viewer is likely to have forgotten are dredged up and painfully explored. Suffering abounds on all sides: the poverty of the housekeeper and her husband's indebtedness do not absolve her of her treatment of Nader's father, but Nader and Simin, whose marriage continues to crumble throughout the film due to their intransigence, are without flaws either. Simin may or may not be viewed as hysterical and manipulative; Nader's coolness may be seen as apathy or even contempt. The murder inquiry is settled in a moving sequence in which Nader calmly asks his pious housekeeper to swear by the Qoran that he killed her child, and her own fear of sinning prevents her from lying. Yet in spite of the appearance of unifying against the charges up against them, Nader and Simin do not manage to reconcile by the film's end. Throughout, their daughter Termeh is portrayed as a hapless victim, a fact brought to the fore by her being asked by another anonymous official to choose which parent, both of whom have been shown to be so flawed and manipulative, to live with. A strong script complemented by outstanding performances allows for the subtlety of all the characters to be explored; if but one were lacking it's unlikely the film would work. \n\nBy the standards not only of its genre or its country of origin, but of filmmaking generally, A Separation is an exceptional creation which will surely be remembered in decades to come as a classic.",

But it feels surprisingly relevant and very close & credible.\n\nThe film begins as the main couple of the story, Nader & Simin, are appearing before a judge of some kind. They are intelligent, attractive, educated and fond of each other. But their lives are about to take divergent paths. Simin is asking for a divorce from her husband, because she wants to be able to leave the country with her teenage daughter, who is a bright, studious girl with a great future ahead of her in a country that doesn't put so many obstacles in front of women. Nader does not want to leave, because he feels he must stay and take care of his Alzheimer's -ridden father. Simin advocates that the father go into a home, because he doesn't know his son...and because the welfare of their daughter comes first. Simin seems both callous to her husband's desire to tend to his beloved father, and she seems completely right too. Her daughter NEEDS a chance to fulfill her promise.\n\nThe parents dote on their terrific girl. She loves them. She loves her wretched grandfather. They are a terrific if troubled family. But Simin moves out of the house, and Nader must hire a woman to tend to his father while he is at work. Razieh comes to the job from a long commute away, accompanied by her small daughter. She is likely from the country, and wears more traditional, conservative clothing. She is lower class, devote, shy and frightened by the job she has undertaken.\n\nFrom this simple setup develops a complicated story of misunderstandings, cultural roadblocks, honor betrayed, legal machinations and the sickening realization that everyone is digging themselves into holes from which they cannot emerge unscathed.\n\nI don't want to tell you anymore, because the joy of this film lies in part in discovering its secrets. All the characters, even Razieh's hot-headed husband, are mostly good people who make some small but unfortunate choices. It's a chilling film in many ways, because while the passions run hot in these characters as they fight for their souls, they must maintain a mantle of politeness and respect. Their culture demands manners, even as it prevents them from expressing what is REALLY on their minds.\n\nThis is a small story, as I said. It involves primarily two families and their troubles. Nothing that happens would ever make the news, even on a small scale. The world churns on around them, completely oblivious to their plight. And yet, for the viewer, the film quietly grabs your attention in its opening moments, and simply does not let go. In part, this is because the script (Oscar nominated) makes each and every person a distinct, fleshed-out and understandable character. If you've ever wondered what folks mean when they decry a movie's lack of character development, check out A SEPARATION. You'll understand what true characters are.\n\nThe film is brilliantly acted, as well. Every part offers juicy moments for the actors and they tear into their work. Peyman Moadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin are fantastic, but no one really lags behind. Young Sarina Farhadi as the daughter Termeh is heartbreaking, and special notice must go to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as the elderly father. He's so immersed in his role, you forget utterly that this is an actor portraying a man with Alzheimer's.\n\nFor me, 2011 was not a great year for movies. Very few moved me. THE ARTIST and THE DESCENDANTS were delightful and excellent...but did not make me lean forward in my seat in utter engrossment. Finally, A SEPARATION (even though I saw it in 2012) came along and in its subtle power, made me remember how worthwhile the wait is for a truly great movie.",

The woman is filing for divorce, claiming that after exhaustive efforts, she has finally gotten a visa so she, her husband, and their 11 year old daughter can leave Iran and give their daughter a better life (not that their existence in Iran is all that shabby - but the promise of freedoms and all the west has to offer is enticing, especially to the mother).  The husband is resisting the move as he feels he needs to care for his ailing father, who suffers from severe Altzheimers.  The wife tells her husband \"be reasonable, he doesn't even know you anymore\", to which husband replies \"but I know him\".\n\nThis sets the table for all that follows, as Farhadi expertly weaves a tale where The Law comes head on against humanity and every major character acts responsibly, and yet all is still a jumble and everyone opposes everyone else, and even themselves and their own best interests.\n\nSo much is wasted by conformity - to religion and the social mores it insists upon - the wife of a poor family cannot work as a caregiver because there will not be another woman present to confirm her sanctity (a woman is NEVER supposed to be left alone in a room with a man).  That the adherence to this tradition is an impetus to so much of what goes on in the film is telling.  Each character tells their version of truth, and acts according to their beliefs, but in the end, in spite of their sincerity, there is tragedy and loss and misunderstanding - as if Babel is in effect and everyone is speaking, but no-one understands.\n\nThis is a very powerful film, and as it points its lens on the 11 year old girl, the film gives us time to ponder how this bright young woman is trapped in a rigid society, just as her parents and the other main characters are equally trapped.  The law is an absolute, and when it is formed and cemented by fundamental religious beliefs - its inflexibility is harmful to the citizen... the age old concept of protecting the citizen by keeping them in ignorance so they won't be corrupted by that old Satanic snake of knowledge.",

Living at a crossroads, his characters are often forced by events to make an inevitable choice: a fake and comfortable life or a real and dangerous existence.\n\n\"A Separation,\" Farhadi's Oscar-winning feature, is a profound social document that centers on a middle-class married couple on the verge of divorce and on the destiny of their eleven-year-old daughter. The movie begins with a long take of the pair (Nader and Simin) looking right into the camera, supposedly in front of a judge. Is the audience the judge? Simin claims the right to leave Iran with her husband after she has finally obtained her visa because she does not want her daughter Termeh to grow up in \"these conditions\" (here the reference to an oppressive environment is clear), but Nader refuses to leave his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Since her request before the judge has failed, Simin moves back to her parents' house, leaving Nader and his father to their destiny. Termeh decides to stay with her father. The need for a maid to take care of Nader's father brings the couple to hire Razieh, a working class woman with a bad-tempered husband. From this moment on, a seamless series of conflicts and consequent separations takes place against a backdrop of anger, innuendos and oppression.\n\nBeneath the facade of a family conflict, Farhadi tackles the issue of class struggle and gender roles in a society where the government is subject to religious authority. But the author's pursuit of the truth does not focus on politics. To explore the status quo, he prefers to highlight Iran's humanity and culture: the feelings, the fear and the pain of a community that is usually only mentioned in reference to its politics.\n\nAlthough the mise-en-scene of \"A Separation\" is realistic, an Iranian movie demands constant symbolic interpretation. First of all, the author's recurrent visual motif of glass hints at something more lurking beneath the surface of the story. At the beginning of the movie, the real intentions and depth of the characters are unclear. This uncertainty is conveyed by the symbolic use of glass: when Simin decides to leave her husband's house, the director shoots the actors behind glass doors and windows, suggesting a filtered reality. Nothing is what it seems. As the author himself reveals, the key to his cinematography is in the details that uncover untold truths and unveil little epiphanies.\n\nIn addition to the symbolic use of objects, Farhadi employs another device that stimulates the spectator's mind: a narrative ellipsis. When the movie reaches its climax - Nader and Razieh's clash - the author cuts the most important sequence, allowing attentive observers to fill the narrative gap with their imagination. It is easy to guess that Razieh has fallen down the stairs, but the scene is omitted because, once again, there is a glass door blocking the view. The author subtracts instead of adding: he stimulates the audience, whose imagination becomes part of the screenplay.\n\nUnlike his fellow Iranian directors, Farhadi, whose next film stars Marion Cotillard and is set in Paris, prefers the use of analogy to metaphor - a touchstone of recent Iranian cinema. He looks at the suffering behind a separation and uses it to explore the pain of many kinds of separations, turning a private drama into a public issue, a regional problem into a universal one. As a matter of fact, 'A Separation' is not just the movie title: separation is the gist of all dramas in the film.\n\nThere is a fine line between social commentary and moral judgment and Farhadi walks on it, without ever taking position. Through the lens of everyday life, he digs into a shapeless territory with a cold eye, using a local setting to reflect on universal issues. His work, along with the films of Kiarostami, Makhmalbaf and Panahi, holds a mirror to the face of modern Iran, and its somber reflection is the only authentic truth.\n\nhttp://www.bluewingsfilms.com/blog/how-iranian-cinema-makes-an-oscar-winning-art-out-of-ambiguity/",

She's not granted a divorce from the courts but she leaves him anyway to live her mother since their only daughter doesn't want to go with her.  A caretaker is then brought in and she does her job exceptionally okay but wants to be paid more since she had to do specific things her faith wouldn't exactly permit her to do and then after that all hell breaks loose.     \r\n  What I find fascinating about this film are the Iranian customs and traditions which can be defined as just as civilized as any other developed country throughout the world even though the court system is different, but the main problem I had with this whole thing is the \"stolen\" money issue from the husband's dresser was never addressed since if the caretaker never stole the money then the question was who did. Had the money had not been missing, the caretaker would still be employed by the husband but because that was the main reason he dismissed her was because he assumed that she's also a thief when it wasn't really her.  I also would've liked to see a better result.\r\n\r\n3 out of 4",

Egli è preoccupato per il suo anziano padre, che è malato di Alzheimer. Quando Nader decide fermamente di rimanere in Iran, Simin chiede il divorzio.\n\nLa domanda di Simin viene respinta dai giudici, che ritengono i problemi della coppia non abbastanza gravi da giustificare il divorzio. Simin lascia così il marito e la figlia e torna a vivere con i suoi genitori. Nel frattempo, Nader assume Razieh, una giovane donna, incinta e profondamente religiosa proveniente da un quartiere povero, per prendersi cura del padre mentre lui lavora in una banca. Razieh ha fatto domanda per il lavoro senza consultare il suo irascibile marito Houjat, la cui approvazione, secondo la tradizione, è necessaria.[it.wikipedia.org]",

Their daughter, Termeh, brilliantly played by Sarina Farhadi, is caught in the middle, but chooses to stay with her father.  Simin, her desire to leave Iran having failed, moves in with her mother.  The initial story is revolves around the employment of Razieh (Sareh Bayat) as a helper to look after the father, but struggles to fulfill the role due to the commute as well as religious issues.  Razieh's husband agrees to help but then fails to assist, leaving Razieh to cope by herself.  As the problems mount, Nader finds himself involved in a legal battle following an altercation.  The film remained interesting throughout as the religious and moral issues both dictated and clouded the views of all parties involved, and Nader battles on several fronts to avoid prison but retain trust of his daughter.  Good acting throughout combined with the unique and fascinating story line combine to produce an excellent World Cinema offering.",

It's an Iranian movie, from director/screen writer Asghar Farhadi, with sub-titles. \n\nIf something can be held has an example of how the ordinary can be turned into the extraordinary, just by sticking to the basics, this movie is it, in the genre of family dramas. As grim, complex, and antsy as the subject matter is, watching it turns out to be simply a joyful experience. The way it is made, with relentless close-ups of handheld camera, and by shunning the artificial background score that we are so used to (the only background you hear here is that of real life), it doesn't merely bring some vivid imagery in front of your eyes, but it also literally transports you into the lives of the characters you are watching. They look so real and so three dimensional. And, it is the sincerity of acting (just awesome by one and all -  the lead players and the support cast) and the presentation that bring  it all home here, not the technology. \n\nTo say that t is truly the 'Saving Private Ryan' and the \"Avatar' of family dramas is one way to sum it up. \nA better way to do so, is to say that it is in a class by itself. \nBravo!",

The fact that it is already overwhelming to see the usually under-the-wraps domestic life of Iran and to couple it with near perfect screenplay, performances and mounting suspense is more than what you can ask for and nothing you would have expected. Doing the right thing, setting an example, moral ambiguity, people's reaction to different circumstances were so beautifully fit into this complex puzzle. \r\n\r\nPayman Maadi (Nader) and Leila Hatami (Simin) are a couple going through a divorce after 14 years of marriage. While the reasons could be complicated and ambiguous, it is taking a toll on their teenage daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's and requires constant care and attention. When he employs Razieh (Sareh Bayat) for household work, an incident triggers aggression from Nader who unconsciously acts rude to Razieh. Nader's life crumbles into further shambles when Razieh's family accuses and lodges a case on him for murder as she has suffered a miscarriage. When Razieh's husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini), an unemployed, depressed and debt ridden man takes matters to his hand, things turn ugly.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of it is the realistic approach taken in every frame resisting the temptations of being sensational. The screenplay was so exhilarating pushing the boundaries of such a simple premise into heart-pounding suspense. The ideology, the general mindset and day-to-day life in Iran was quite informative and fulfills your food for curiosity. Coming to performances, it is near perfect with none tampering into each other's space and doing the best in their zone. A special mention should go to the sweet little girl who plays Razieh's daughter as she conveys a lot through her big expressive eyes and hardly uttering a word. While the divorce story as advertised plays a poignant role, it mostly takes a backseat during the tense drama. \r\n\r\nSome scenes that were informative or packs an impact\r\n> When Razieh calls a religious helpline to check if she could change a helpless old man's pants\r\n> Razieh's daughter's eyes conveying and covering the facade of ugly spats\r\n> When Teremeh confronts Nader if he lied\r\n> Climax tussle between Razieh and Hojjat\r\n> Nader's unflinching love and support for his father\r\n\r\nSo simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot",

But it also speaks to the alienating betrayals two mirror image families -- acted with startlingly authenticity by an unforgettable cast -- experience from each other, their society and themselves.\nUnderlining the implosive domestic conflict at the center of this outstanding film are the social and legal strings that alternately trip up and strangle the husbands, wives and daughters striving to hold their worlds together in modern-day Iran. It's that heartbreaking struggle that ultimately make their worlds fall apart. The tragic irony -- and the delicate way it's achieved -- makes \"A Separation\" recall, of all things, the works of Russian literary giants Dostoevsky and Chekhov.\nPolitical subjugation dressed up as religious piety, inflation-fueled financial hardships and a maddeningly haphazard legal system all act as invisible yolks here. They're like the smog the denizens of this car-drenched country don't see but inhale, except they're insidiously more toxic.\nDirector Asghar Farhadi's incisive script marches his characters down the narrow chutes of an enclosed maze they don't know is rigged against them. The journey is tense and, ultimately, heartbreaking. The more his proud, sometimes prideful characters try to do what their religion, culture and internal moral compasses tell them is right, the more alone they become.",

Anyway, this film, in it's bare concept, is about the obscurities of normal life through the process of divorce, and where that leads us. Each character sort of represents a kind of person. The main character, Nader, is bold, argumentative, and reserved in his sense of humanity. The daughter represents the innocent, to which where most of the answers lie. Nader's wife is the kind of person who just wants everything to be ok, but can only take so much troubles. She is the most motherly, especially compared to Razieh, who takes life only seriously in the sense of religion. To me, she is very cold and probably the emphasis on why I relate to Nader oh so much. Though she can't entirely speak to herself, she isn't expressed as a selfless and defenseless being like other cliched films. However, the most humane character of them all, is the grandfather. His oblivious to his problems, the problems he caused, or even humanity itself. The film focuses so thoroughly on the problems within the film, and yet the grandfather is still placed within the film. But, when he is present in the scene, he doesn't feel out of place, I feel is the direct representation of life being larger and greater than everything the film is expressing. It was a brilliant move to have him in the film. The messages of the film can be easily said, but you won't purely understand them without watching the film first.\nThe greatest film of 2011.",

As the film opens, Nader and Simin argue over their inevitable separation. Nader wants to take their daughter and leave Iran, but Simin refuses to do so because he is responsible for the care of his aged father. But while the film is about that conflict, it becomes primarily about the tension between Nader and Simin's family and that of Razieh, a young pregnant woman who is hired as an aide to help care for Nader's father. Razieh is accused of theft and forced out of the house by Nader, and what follows is a labyrinthine series of dramatic events that unfold over the course of the film and pit the two families against one another. It is a brilliantly-structured plot that sizzles with the measured intensity of a thriller, and Farhadi's careful attention to character allows everyone in the film to be complex, their stakes high, and their plights sympathetic. For in exploring the lives of these people, he explores expectations of family, gendered roles, religious responsibility, and class differences that reflect the larger complexities and foibles of contemporary Iran. It is a morality play in which every character is well-intentioned, and there is nothing as simplistic as a villain. The final scene of the film is stunning, a perfectly-framed visual note that lingers, leaving the viewer to think on the ideas inherent in the film. And the best part is it is ambiguous enough not to suggest any kind of closure to the conflicts that the film was so careful to lay out in a nuanced, respectful way. A Separation won the Best Foreign Language Oscar for 2011, but it could just as easily have won Best Picture. This is the best film from anywhere, of 2011.",

All people wanted to talk about was how this film teaches us how we're not all that different from each other. About how \"those\" people love their families just like we do. About how they respect their parents and teach their children right from wrong, and how surprising that was.\n\nIf you're one of the people that only pulled that basic sociological lesson from this movie, you are a moron. Of course they love their kids. Of course they respect their parents. If you ever thought otherwise, you need help. It really irked me when I heard critics and the media refer to this film in such a manner. Plus, it was stated in such a magnanimous way. As if the rest of us savages aren't as enlightened as the crack team of experts that work for the entertainment department of some shitty newspaper.\n\nReally, you enlightened ET anchor? Really, you learned People Magazine reporter? These people from another culture love their families too? We're not that different after all? Gee, thanks for the civil rights lecture. Most of us had no idea that, GASP, muslim families have the same problems and successes that we do.\n\nWhat got lost in all the hyperbole was the fact that this is an amazing film no matter where it's from. A beautiful piece of filmmaking like this is rare, especially when it comes to family drama.\n\nThe typical family drama plot usually centers around the same premise: cheating, spouses no longer in love, someone's addicted to something or dying of something, etc. Not this film. This plot centers around a split due to different ideals. One spouse wanting to try new things and one happy with the way things are. \n\nIt also reminds us that one little thing, one little bullshit thing, can lead to something. Then that one insignificant something turns into several other little somethings. Eventually those little somethings then turn into a big something. Next thing you know, you've got a disaster on your hands.\n\nPride, anger, lies, sorrow, fear, guilt, revenge and remorse all play a part in this tale. When it's over you can't help but feel their pain. We've all been there before, but the fact that it happens to \"those\" people too, shouldn't surprise us.",

Exciting, moving and controversial, it stretches the boundaries of morality, duty and truth to a level at which this all seems to be a story happening behind the door of your neigbors. \r\n\r\nSet in contemporary Iran, the movie starts in a trivial way: driven by the social ,religious and economic difficulties in the country, a woman is striving for the best for her family and wants to leave the country. Led by his love for his Alzheimer-sick father, Nader (Peyman Moadi) refuses to follow his life. And just when it all seems to be a painful movie about a family getting torn apart, director Asghar Farhadi brings the actual central point of the story. A Separation quickly becomes fast-paced movie, with elements of thriller and mystery. Yet, at every single moment of the movie,it remains shockingly normal, simple and realistic. \r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the criminal part in the movie, director Asghar Farhadi builds up a powerful and brilliant story which delves deep into questions such as : what is moral, what is truth and where are the limits of honesty. A Separation becomes much more than a movie, it is a study of characters, of interpersonal conflicts, of multi-layer personal drammas and of a society having its own problems. The clashes between rational thinking and family love, pragmatism and religion are heart-breaking. \r\n\r\nFarhadi succeeds to increase the dramatic and realistic feeling in the audience by his choice of very intimate camera-work. It is as if the main characters Leila Hatami, Peyman Moadi and Sarina Farhadi are talking to the audience and not to themselves. Their facial expressions and eye-contact with the camera make watching the whole movie a moving dramatic experience.\r\n\r\nAs a person who has been in Iran more than dozen times, I have always felt connected to Tehran, to the Iranian culture and the people there. Despite the fact that A Separation is strictly non-polictal movie, some political nuances are to be felt. The contradiction between progressive thinking (Simin and Nader's family) as an embodyment of the Green Movement and the rural, economically suffering part of the society (Hojat and Razieh's family) as en embodiment of the conservative supporters of the regime is striking. The whole conflict happens amidst the Iranian social and economical reality in which daily clashes of classes have become a painful part of life. \r\n\r\nThe movies goes far and just when we are expecting the ending, director Farhadi leaves us with an open end. It is for the audience to decide on the last issue, on the last open question. And yet, the audience would feel satisfied and fascinated with the story, with the end. \r\n\r\nTruly, A Separation could be labeled a masterpiece. It is in very rare cases as this one, when somebody succeeds to create such a realistic, and complex human drama. This is a pure cinematographic delight. A must see !",

Typical Oscar movie - I shouldn't have had my hopes so high.  Secondly, while it's well-acted and set apart from other melodramas due to being set in Iran, it's fairly shallow, and I really don't see how it got a nomination for Best Original Screenplay (though, it was better than 'Midnight in Paris').  The story is apt, but not really gripping or terribly meaningful.  It's not unwatchable, it's just unsatisfying.",

It makes no judgments on the actions of each character, but rather lets you decide for yourself.  Which is certainly a challenge, as each character is utterly sympathetic.  In this aspect, this movie was effective in all the ways The Descendants was not.   The acting was flawless and pacing was good (though I thought it started to drag a bit in the third act).

            "content": "Again, after a long hiatus in film reviewing mainly due to countless school works and some love sickness, yours truly is back with a take on \"A Separation\" on his sleeves. Bar none, this film is indeed one of the best of the year on different levels. It's not just a film made good because of a couple of excellent performances or a film made exceptional by a good story. \"A Separation\", an Iranian film that has won a record of three bears in the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, is a socio-religious morality play that combines a compelling narrative with stirring performances. And in this mixture, one can easily see the flawlessness of it all. Its Academy Award is more than deserved. \n     \nDirected by Asghar Farhadi, what also makes \"A Separation\" a notch more special is how it has seemingly made all the complex issues within it flow quite effortlessly. On one side, the film is about the utter devotion to Islamic faith and how doubt can shake things up for the worst. On the other, it's also a penetrating study of class conflict and the fragility of truth. Watching \"A Separation\", I can't help but be reminded of both \"12 Angry Men\" and \"Rashomon\" in terms of how it has also finely explored the subjectivity of truth based on perception and biases and also of a local independent film here in the Philippines entitled \"Last Supper No. 3\" in terms of the film's realistic portrayal of the legal system. \n     \nBut then again, \"A Separation\" has too much going on with it that it can't just be merely branded as a meditation on truth. It is, after all, a film about a couple's (played by Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami) separation and how this can cause a definite ripple effect to other people, specifically a pregnant helper named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) and her husband (Shahab Hosseini). \n     \nPartly seen through the eyes of the pre-adolescent daughter named Termeh (played by Sarina Farhadi), the film is an observation not of a crumbling marriage but of the domino principle that comes with it and how it affects those around them. There were even no questions raised regarding whose side (husband or wife) are you on. Instead, the deeply moral questions are raised not mainly to us but to the daughter herself, which leads to one of the most quietly powerful endings in recent memory. \n     \nAs the film patiently unfolds, one can easily see how \"A Separation\" could have also worked quite beautifully on stage. It has the right amount of intensity, complexity and spontaneity; ingredients of an effectively modern theater play. It's also populated with characters that are both realistic and fascinating thanks to the natural performances of the actors involved, which makes me to think that this may also be the most powerfully-acted film of the year. \n     \nFor me, what makes a film powerful, aside from the weight of the things that it wants to say and how they are said, is not being conscious of its strengths. This is the case for \"A Separation\". It definitely knows what it wants to say but does not preach it. It has a very beautiful material but does not flaunt it. Its drama is powerful enough to explore far-reaching themes of immense societal relevance but does not impose it. Instead, the film just went its way to use the universal language of marriage, separation and religion within the confines of the equally universal language of cinema and tell what needs to be told. \n     \nWhat resulted is a film of disquieting power and truth that echoes far beyond its country of origin. Although I would occasionally fawn over an incoherent art film or two, I believe that films like \"A Separation\" are the ones that we really need today. In a contemporary world where failure of communication is a widespread occurrence, the role of cinema has never been more important. \"A Separation\" has just exercised the core reason of the medium's very existence.",

Furthermore strikingly yet expectedly, the most severe collateral damage has been put upon the two children, the most innocent onlookers of the dispute, the final staring between the two girls are hauntingly disturbing, there palpable wounds which will never heal planting inside both twoâ(TM)s memories. \n\nMostly enclosed settings (inside the bourgeois coupleâ(TM)s apartment, their cars, the maidâ(TM)s low-end shack, his husbandâ(TM)s cobblerâ(TM)s house, the classrooms, police office and hospital) and an almost score-free deployment (which I hardly noticed until the ending), the vortex of seeking for the justice is tormenting everyone who are directed or indirected embroiled in. As an inward-delving essay, it is compelling from A to Z and leaves an unanswered question which literally does not need one since its irrelevant at all after the separation evolves into a bona-fide divorce.\n\nAll the major characters are potently organised and three of its four (Moadi, Bayat and Hosseini) all finish inside my top 10 performances of the year (sorry Hatami, rounding just outside the top tier), also the youngsters are tremendously great under their more compassion-arousing suits. The film presently is my silver medalist and Farhadi champions the BEST DIRECTOR stature in year 2011.

Then again, progressive is a relative term when the women still have to dress like that.\n\nAnyway, a good story and solid acting carry the movie. Peyman Moadi has little acting credits but basically carries the movie as a man dealing with the separation of his wife, raising his young daughter, and taking care of his dad who suffers from Alzheimer's. I kept expecting to hate this guy...like when he slapped a woman, etc. But as I said, it's progressive, and he's a solid character. It is through him we run into the dilemma of when lying is okay, etc.\n\nThe conflict arises from the hired help. Pregnant and in over her head, she makes some mistakes. Moadi's character reacts, and you've got the conflict: did his actions cause the death of her unborn child? A lot goes into it. Almost too much.

It revolves around a married couple who are separating because the husband wants to stay with his Alzheimer stricken father and his wife wants to move on.  He hires a young pregnant woman to help him out while he works, since his wife has moved out.  One day the he comes home early to find his father face down and tied to a bed, but the woman is gone.  When she returns they get into a heated argument, and she falls down, and suffers a miscarriage.  From there it becomes like a mystery, as to whether or not he caused the miscarriage, and the effects it has on their families.

            "content": "This year's Oscar winning film in the Best Foreign Language category is Asghar Farhadi's fifth feature, the absolutely thrilling 'A Separation'. The victory in February marked the first time a director has taken an Academy Award back to Iran.\n\nSet in modern day Tehran, Nader (Peyam Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce. Simin wants to leave Iran with her daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) after struggling for 18 months to get a visa. Nader wants to stay with his father, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Unable to compromise, Simin leaves her husband to live with her parents. Termeh, played by the director's daughter, decides to lead the battle her way. Staying with her dad, she hopes, will force her mother to remain in the country and return to the family home.\n\nFeeling solitude's pressure, Nader hires the pregnant, lower-class Razieh to take care of his ailing, demanding father. Razieh works against her husband's will and knowledge. In contrast to Simin, she's a religious woman desperate to support her unemployed spouse who is, if it couldn't get any worse, weakened by the threat of jail by his creditors.\n\nOne day Nader returns home from work to find his father tied up to his bed, on the floor and about to die. Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is nowhere to be found. When she returns to her now furious employer, they engage in a struggle with unexpected and unfortunate consequences.\n\n'A Separation' is a simple yet layered drama, paced like a thriller. Each memorable scene is spectacularly acted and so naturally that audiences will feel like these characters could be their next door neighbours.\n\nIt's a separation of a couple with different priorities; Simin's future is up against Nader's bitter reality. The only character trying to hold everything together is the torn-between-parents Termeh, an almost universal and familiar fate for crumbling families. It's a separation of classes; the educated elite vs. religious labourers. Both struggle to survive regardless of the moral or physical conditions that may threaten them. In between the troubled tales, Farhadi drops in events which provide a glimpse into what lies beneath society's cover.\n\n'A Separation' is like a literary masterpiece printed on film. It triggers different interpretations and is a genuine reflection on the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other. Questions abound over honesty, compromise, total innocence and guilt. It's also a portrait of a city, misinterpreted by many as purely fanatic and radical.\n\nThis is 2012's best film so far, the kind that you probably won't be able to separate from, maybe forever.",

            "content": "A Separation is a wonderful combination of genres rolled into one: courtroom drama, family conflict, mystery, and a dysfunctional institution story. Director Asghar Farhadi sets up a wonderful scenario that unravels little by little, thus building tension with each new reveal and creating varying levels of superiority for each of the leads. The dynamics of the adults do a great job of keeping the children's story in the background, adding extra poignance to the added complications in their simple lives. By the end of A Separation, I felt as worn out and conflicted as all of the characters in the story. Forget Kramer vs. Kramer; A Separation takes that core story and adds a more realistic story to it.\r\n\r\nSimin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) are seeking a divorce because Simin wants to leave Iran to find a better life for her pre-teen daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, the director's daughter). Nader is not willing to give up his daughter and leave the country because he has to care for his senile father; however, he would consider granting his wife a divorce if he lets her daughter stay in the country. Obviously, they have hit a stalemate. The judge sides with Nader, and Simin leaves home for her trial separation, which causes Nader to hire someone to look for his dad. He uses Razieh (Sareh Bayat) at first, but Razieh's commute with her young daughter is too long and the hours too tiresome because she is also pregnant. She suggests to Nader her husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), but due to money issues, he cannot attend at first and Razieh fills in for him. \r\n \r\nOne day, Nader finds his father left tied to his bed, his oxygen removed from his face. After Nader revives him, Razieh and her daughter return; Nader, obviously angry, accuses the woman of stealing and negligence. He fires her, but she comes back to argue. Frustrated, Nader shoves her and she falls on some stairs. Nader finds out later that Razieh suffers a miscarriage, and Hodjat files a claim in court that accuses Nader of murder. \r\n\r\nThe setup is very lengthy, almost an hour. Without it though, the story would lose its necessary complications. The intro is not only important in establishing characters and family dynamics, it also sets up a situation where every adult is to blame for the miscarriage during the fight in court: Nader pushed Razieh, Razieh tied up Nader's father alone to leave work for an unexplained reason, Hodjat's money troubles caused his wife to cover for him, and Simin's separation caused the housekeeper problem in the first place. As a result, it is hard for the audience to choose sides, and provides a layer of ambiguity to how the court case will be resolved as there is no clear cut victim. The story stays fresh too as every new scene leads to another reveal in the case that shifts the character dynamics and where the power lies between the involved parties.\r\n\r\nOne of the underappreciated aspects of the story is the painting of modern Iran. It is mostly seen as a country in transition: where old habits like religion and female subervience are being challenged by strong females and democracy. As a result, religion and government are not seen as the enemy: habitual thought and inflexibility are. Simin's divorce, in the eyes of the judge, does not have enough cause for the judge to grant it to her. Razieh is a devout Muslim, and in Iran swearing on the Koran and lying is a much more serious offense than lying on the Bible in the US as it carries more eternal consequences. \r\n\r\nA Separation does a great job hiding its main story though the compelling court case. At its center, A Separation is about Termeh (and to a lesser extent Razieh and Hodjat's daughter), the 11 year old daughter of Simin and Nader. She is forced to grow up very quickly because of the situation thrust upon her. The adults keep insisting what they are doing is in the best interests for their daughter; however, she is forced into the middle of both the separation and the court case. As the story evolves she is forced to make more decisions, usually with increasing repercussions for her parents. By the time the story reaches its end, she is forced to make the biggest choice of her life, which is a few weeks from the start of the story. Each decision weighs on poor Termeh, showing the consequences of the actions of each adult acting in the \"best interests\" of their children can forget to consider the child in the first place.\r\n\r\nA Separation is ultimately a very sad story. However, it is also a brilliant tale of how actions, sometimes decided without your involvement, can have devastating consequences on those you love. Even though I was already wary of separations and their effect on kids, A Separation confirmed my thoughts. If any parents are reading this and considering a separation, please watch this movie and know what you might be getting yourself into.",

This film admires complexity, and once you see it you'll recognize how much of an understatement that is.  Never have I seen a film paint such an elegant web of catastrophe coming from good intentions as I have with this film.  Every character rightly deserves some combination of justice and blame in this film.  No one is culpable, or everyone is.  No one is innocent, or everyone is.  Because of this quality, and the continuing complexity of the story, I was completely engaged by A Separation.  It feels like a thriller, but in reality it's a richly layered drama about people, culture, and understanding.  It takes a massively disruptive problem in culture and shows the personal effects of it.  A Separation is not preachy: in fact, it knows that there aren't many answers to the questions it proposes.  But that's why it's so compelling, and so necessary.  As difficult a picture of the complicated world this film paints, I'm thrilled that in reaction to that world we have films like this that change our perspectives, and our lives.",

It quite deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThis is the story of an Iranian couple, Nader and Simin, who have separated and are in the process of getting a divorce.  When Simin moves out, Nader has to hire a someone to take care of his elderly father, who has Alzheimer's disease.\n\nA tragedy ensues (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into the details), which brings conflict between Nader and the woman he had hired to take care of his father.  The conflict and its repercussion expands outwards, drawing in family members on both sides as well as their friends.  \n\nGrief, greed, guilt, lies, tragedy, inter- and intra-family conflict, revenge, justice, and mystery:  all of these elements unfold and ensnare the characters, and we in the audience cannot help but be completely drawn into the story and into the lives of the characters.\n\nMuch of the film is shot with a hand-held camera, which gives it a very intimate, personal feel, and the actors are phenomenal.\n\nThis is a film that should not be missed!",

            "content": "In the U.S. we've been trained to vilify Iran, simply count it one of the most dangerous countries in the world and leave it at that. Yet the nation is much more complicated than such an obtuse generalization, and the average, every day citizens are far from mindless Ahmadinejad clones. A Separation won last year's Best Foreign Language Film, the first entry from Iran to do so, and it truly is a piece of stunning filmmaking, as its unanimous worldwide acclaim implies. The story is simple and yet intricately layered to the point where it isn't easy to briefly sum up, which I won't attempt to do so. Suffice to say, we do get a revealing look inside Iranian society, particularly its judicial system and the roles of women, and we do so through the eyes of some wonderfully complex characters. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film with such natural characters that have so much going on they are impossible to describe in just one note. Writer-director Asghar Farhadi is an undeniable talent, and he gracefully weaves the characters amongst the storylines in such an evenhanded way there are no simple heroes or villains in sight. In fact, he leaves much of his own views off the table, right down to the ambiguous ending, leaving it up to the audience to come to grips with on their own. One of the most powerful observations is that of the nature of justice, as religious, secular and internal views are all presented and contrasted in the film but with obviously different results. Above all, though, A Separation is a story about humanity that will blow you away and stick with you. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",
