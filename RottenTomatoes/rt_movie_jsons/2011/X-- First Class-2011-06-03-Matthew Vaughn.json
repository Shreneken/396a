    "summary": "In the early 1960s, during the height of the Cold War, a mutant named Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets a fellow mutant named Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Despite their vastly different backgrounds -- Charles grew up with a wealthy family, while Erik lost his parents at Auschwitz -- the two become close friends. As the world teeters on the brink of a nuclear war, Charles and Erik with other mutants join forces to save humanity. However, a situation soon tears the friends apart.",

            "content": "First Class serves a great action film in and of itself. But is also acts as a revitalisation to the X-Men franchise with its two predecessors failing strikingly. Both Professor X and Erik have their younger selves represented in a genuine manner and what is especially compelling is how the film manages to make you feel as if the stakes were as high as they have ever been yet containing that within the parameter of an origin story. I was pleasantly surprised, particularly towards the third act as many of the preordained facts of the previous films came to fruition in a seamless manner. Sure the plot is one in which a 5 year-old could come up with; a big bad evil guy trying to take over the world, faced with fierce opposition. But this is rectified by a tight script and relationships within the film that we actually care about.",

The Pacing is very well done also with no scene ever feeling like it lingers too long on one character or an action scene that goes on for too long. Really no weak points at all and this film is All Time Classic Action Movie and All Time Classic in General.",

            "content": "First Class is the greatest X-Men film for me.\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn's superhero sci-fi thriller X-Men: First Class (2011) is a marvelous motion picture that provides origins for several mutants, while demonstrating how Professor X and Magneto's friendship blooms and depicts how their moral ideals fell out in the first place. I loved seeing how Vaughn uses mutant superpowers on full display from Magneto turning a satellite dish to lifting a submarine or Emma Frost and Prof. X warping peoples' minds. Vaughn's hyper kinetic direction and slick comic book style worked miracles for Kick-Ass as well as First Class. I love this movie.\n\nFirst Class balances coming of age drama with Stan Lee's mutant ethical dichotomy as these young adult mutants are choosing their path in life to live amongst humanity living at Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters or be themselves within Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. I love all these intimate moments of self-discovery and revelation with the X-Men's serious dramatic conversations as well as all the exciting action sequences. I really enjoyed Matthew Vaughn Bryan Singer's story using historical context like President John F. Kennedy's speeches and The Cuban Missile Crisis as the backdrop to his groovy 1960's mutant movie. Their social commentary for The Holocaust and gay pride apply beautifully to The X-Men. Writers Matthew Vaughn, Bryan Singer, Jane Goldman, Sheldon Turner, Ashley Edward Miller, and Zack Stentz find the sincere heart of these mutant characters to touch you with raw emotional interactions throughout First Class.\n\nJames McAvoy is fantastically endearing as Charles Xavier with his charming personality, while contributing a genuine sympathy for Magneto that lets you see how assuring Professor X is as a leader character. McAvoy is charismatic, funny, and considerate with the same kindness and patience that Sir Patrick Stewart brought to his older Xavier. Michael Fassbender is phenomenal as the rage filled Erik Lehnsherr as he experiences all the agony of desiring revenge on the Nazis involved with The Holocaust. You feel every bit of Magneto's fury and independence through Fassbender's commanding presence and assured confidence, yet he also adds nuance to Magneto as he builds control for his powers thanks to his steadfast friendship with Xavier.\n\nJennifer Lawrence is an instant star after Winter's Bone and before The Hunger Games as her conflicted Raven Darkholme lets you feel why Mystique hates humanity and appreciates her natural blue form. Lawrence is emotionally raw and real in every single scene here. She's beautiful, tough, sincere, and vulnerable as an excellent foil for Xavier's arrogance and oversight, like how Magneto sees the world differently. X-Men: First Class is very much about separate perspectives. Rose Bryne is adorable, funny, cool, and moving as Professor X's love interest and CIA agent Moira MacTaggert. Kevin Bacon is a fearsome villain as Sebastian Shaw or Black King with his eerie manner of speech and scary persona.\n\nJanuary Jones is drop dead gorgeous as Emma Frost or White Queen with her icy personality, piercing gaze, total confidence in her awesome psychic prowess, and effortless grace. I still wish we got an Emma Frost film starring January Jones as I love her as Frost. She's wonderful. Jason Flemyng is unrecognizable as Azazel, the teleporting red demon mutant. He's ferocious and as cool as Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler from X2 since you can see how lethal his mutation can be in the hands of evil. √Ålex Gonz√°lez is pretty neat as Riptide with his cyclone summoning skills. I like to think Michael Ironside's cameo was because he was the villain telepath in David Cronenberg's Scanners back in 1981. Hugh Jackman's cameo as Wolverine is hilarious and fits Logan's loner attitude. Rebecca Romijn's cameo as Mystique is sultry and playful.\n\nNicholas Hoult is outstanding as the sincere scientist Hank McCoy, who captures Beast's insecurities over his appearance. Zo√´ Kravitz is alluring as Angel Salvadore and interesting with her flying abilities as Tempest and frustrations with humanity's judgemental hatred of mutants. Lucas Till is engaging as Alex Summers with his devastating laser rings as Havok. Caleb Landry Jones is funny as Sean Cassidy or Banshee. Edi Gathegi is likable as Darwin, but they really should have given him more to do honestly. Oliver Platt is funny and likable as CIA Man in Black Suit with his eager appreciation for mutants. \n\nEditors Lee Smith and Eddie Hamiltons bring sharp cuts and a fast pace for First Class' 132 minutes that feels half that length. Cinematographer John Mathieson always frames faces in close-up for the emotional moments for a real connection between these fantasy characters and the audience. I love the smooth look to the panning wide shots as each scene breathes naturally without the rapid fire cuts many modern movies employ to hold your attention with gentle movements.\n\nVisual effects artists John Dykstra, Guy Williams, Denise Davis, and Sachin Bangera's CGI looks incredible for First Class. I love the look of Emma Frost effortlessly turning into shining diamonds, the warping camera effect for mind manipulation, Magneto's writhing metal bending, Azazel's reddish black teleportation plumes, to the fearsome explosions from Kevin Bacon.\n\nProduction designer Chris Seagers recreates Xavier's mansion with a wealthy splendor and warmth, while creating a CIA headquarters for the mutants that's sleek and got that cold government polish. Set decorators Sonja Klaus and Erin Boyd bring playful 60's furniture and props to all the sets for a realistic retro look to First Class that is certainly colorful. \n\nArt directors Adam O'Neill, Alan Gilmore, John King, Marc Fisichella, John Frankish, Dawn Swiderski, Grant Armstrong, James Hambidge, Steve Cooper, Paul Booth, Alex Cameron, Tom Frohling, Marc Homes, Joe Howard, Sue Whitaker, and Chris Cleek choose warm oranges and browns for the 60's aesthetic, while providing bursts of blue, yellow, red, and white for the mutant palettes. I am so impressed with the CGI and practical effects for Mystique, Beast, and Azazel, let alone Emma Frost's abilities.\n\nComposer Henry Jackman's score sweeps above the fray with epic intensity and thoughtful melodies for the drama. Jackman provides First Class with a sense of grandeur and heartfelt feeling. Costume designers Sammy Sheldon, Nicole Young, Wendy M. Craig, Stephanie Paul, Bruno de Santa, Risa Garcia, and Miloslav Skorepa's outfit choices are brilliant. From returning to the comic book purity of yellow X-Men suits with blue limbs and black lining. I loved all of January Jones' sterling white costumes as Emma Frost.\n\nIn the end, First Class gifts us with glorious mutant superpowers and intimately sensitive mutant drama with equal grace and gripping entertainment. First Class remains the prestige picture of The X-Men series.",
