And with that the film generates a reflection in the people who watch it.\nI recommend this film, even more if you are Brazilian, because this film manages to give a shock of reality to those who watch it. And this is very important for discovering the role of each individual in society to be able to improve it",

Though this film significantly predates it, I can't help but shake the feeling that The Enemy Within is just a discount version of 2015's Sicario; however, I realize that doesn't do justice to the earlier vision or the peculiarities of the Brazilian setting.

Had this film been made like 20 years ago, I would've recommended this film highly, but as a result of seeing so many films similar to this one.  Again, it can become tiring because so many of them had already been made throughout the years, which the only difference is that it takes place in \"Rio\" this time.  Financially successful in it's native country, it's success lies solely from the area where it's been made from.  Mexico, Hong Kong or the United States had also made movies about corruption within the police force and this film seems to have echoed it from those original films made before it.\n\nThe previous film, called \"The Elite Squad\" was based on a novel that was partially based on fact- similar to \"City Of God\" which viewers can actually figure out that it's based on actual events and at the same time changing specific things.  \"Mississippi Burning\" and \"JFK\" are two examples where it's about the idea that is based on fact using fictional characters that had never existed nor had never happened- they're reminiscent of 'what if' scenarios, providing viewers are aware about it.   Much of the set up of the entire movie has Lt. Colonel Nascimento (Wagner Moura) 'narrating' his entire experience, started by the time he got promoted to head an elite squad.  It's baffling, because it resulted into controversy regarding a corrupt prison guard being bribed by a gang member for a piece(hand gun).  This gang member's main goal was to use it on other rival gang members who're locked in the same prison as him.  And by the time this guy completed his objective, the swat then moves in with one, (to be precise it's Captain André Matias played by André Ramiro) of them shooting down the leader in cold blood even though he was going to give himself up. Human rights activist/ journalist, by the name of Diogo Fraga (Irandhir Santos) calls for justice which of course, nothing gets done or goes anywhere.  It does however, promotes Squad leader, Nascimento in the process to a much higher rank.  And that is when one of the real problems begin to start, including a couple of journalists attempting to unmasking the corruption within the elite unit and government.  One of the main things I didn't like was the fact that, since the movie was also fictionalized, why can't the main corrupt official suffer a much more grueling death since viewers always have to endure the atrocities in which this guy had inflicted, but once the tables are turned, it turns it into another mafia style movie that's similar to \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas\" which viewers don't really need to see again.  I mean, if viewers have to subject this corrupt cop blatantly getting away, shooting and torturing others without worrying about getting caught or suffer consequences, that we deserve to see this main bad guy suffering the same fate, and we don't.\n\n2 out of 4 stars",

Dramatically on-pitch, director Jose Padhila crafts a narrative about drug dealers, crooked politicians and corrupt cops that leaves you both in dispair of the intratractabilty of the system and in admiration of those brave enough to resist it. Wagner Moura, playing Col. Nascimento, adds depth to what is typically the cliche \"cop absorbed by his job fighting the system\" role, just one of quite a few surprisingly great performances for this genre. From yacht parties in the bay to street justice in the favellas, this is a heart-pounding tour of Rio that shouldn't be missed.",

Here the bad guys in this movie are really cruel, and as a result, the stakes are higher for the protagonists.\nThe film features the same cast of 1, and a few guests, and all the characters are very well used.

            "content": "José Padilha's \"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\" explores the deep-seated corruption riddling Rio de Janeiro through a visceral, powerful Brazilian drama. Building on the success of 2007's \"Elite Squad,\" Lt. Colonel Nascimento is back to take the fight to the drug cartels as well as the corruption within Rio's law enforcement and political system, exposing the true depths of the city's social problems. Breathless, brutal, and thrilling. It's a gut punch of an action movie with political undertones.\n\nPolice Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) has devoted his entire life to taking down Rio de Janeiro's most notorious criminals. He leads a special ops group (NOPE) known for its uncompromising effectiveness, but his efforts haven't received a lot of support from the corrupt authorities. When Nascimento's attempts to defuse a prison riot, it turns into a blood bath, and the media creates a public frenzy. The government is eager to use the incident as an excuse to fire Nascimento, but the level of public support for the Colonel's actions is overwhelmingly positive. As such, Nascimento is promoted to a high-ranking security position. Initially, it seems that this new power will grant him the ability to fight crime even more effectively. Alas, it doesn't take long before he realizes that the corruption runs even deeper than he could have suspected. The system has no center, Nascimento tells us, and it always wins.\n\nThe corruption of the Brazilian political system serves as a backdrop to the unrestrained violence and tension that permeates throughout the film. The action sequences are swift, violent, and sharply crafted. \"The Enemy Within\" presents the question -- which is worse: the amoral politicians who run the city, or the violent cartels who oversee the slums? Padilha's film offers no easy answers, but the title is a tip-off as to where at least his sympathies lie.\n\nThe film, with its slick production and on-point narration by Moura as Nascimento is an edgy, action-drenched thriller dipped in blood and dirty politics. Still, even during its slickest Hollywood-style action sequences, it's hard to ignore the unyielding, socially conscious anger which fuels the movie. While \"The Enemy Within\" is not as punchy as its trigger-happy predecessor \"Elite Squad,\" is an intriguing slice of drama with the advantage of a much more balanced standpoint. Previous crime dramas such as \"City of God\" (2002), \"Carandiru\" (2003) and Padhila's own 2002 debut \"Bus 174\" have helped make Brazilian cinema an international critically acclaimed medium. Thankfully, \"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\" successfully continues with this trajectory.",

The original Tropa De Elite shocked viewers with ultra violence and realistic action, but it's breathtaking pace left many confused. Elite Squad 2 corrects some of those mistakes and is a more easier to approach overall. \n\nThe story continues to follow Lt. Colonel Nascimento (Wagner Moura) and how he gains better means to fight corruption and crime in Rio de Janeiro through an unexpected promotion. As citizens of Rio De Janeiro get more and more fed up with drug gangs and violence, Nascimento finally has the political power to expand Battalion of Special Operations (BOPE) and put an end to drug dealers reign. Unfortunately, the power vacuum left by drug dealers give rise for an more dangerous enemy - Corrupted Government and Police force - for Nascimento to deal with.  \n\nAs stated before, Elite Squad 2 has a more structured script than its predecessor and and the violence level has been toned down somewhat.

Promu responsable du service des Renseignements, le colonel Nascimento va découvrir le \"système\", cette corruption qui, du flic de quartier jusqu'aux plus hautes instances politiques, gangrène l'état brésilien à tous les niveaux.  Charge politique vigoureuse à l'encontre d'une certaine réalité nationale, \"Troupe d'élite 2\" a récolté un succès comparable à celui de son prédécesseur dans son pays natal, et devrait sans peine intéresser le public européen, bien qu'il suscitera sans doute un débat moins passionné que son prédécesseur (véritable glorification de méthodes policières expéditives que, depuis le confort ouaté du vieux Continent, on pourrait sans peine qualifier de \"fascistes\").  Bien sûr, l'exotisme compte pour une part dans cette appréciation positive : ça fait toujours du bien de regarder un mélange d'Actionner policier et de Thriller politique dont les codes et l'atmosphère changent agréablement de l'uniformisation hollywoodienne.  Pour une raison mystérieuse, alors même que José Padhilla fait preuve d'une certaine paresse dans sa mise en scène (par le recours quasi permanent à la voix off, notamment), \"Troupe d'élite 2\" fait monter l'adrénaline de fort belle manière, autant dans la découverte de cette toile de magouilles et de délits qui constitue l'ordinaire de la classe politique carioca que dans ses - trop rares- scènes d'action. Peut-être parce que pour une fois, la mention \"inspiré de faits réels\" n'est absolument pas galvaudée...?",

New actors were included, mainly to compose the new gangs of criminals and corrupted politicians. The plot has more thrilling scenes and less violence.\nThe connection among police, politicians and drug dealers is very well detailed, and gives us more sense about the reality. I loved a scene where a high level policeman chief was stopped by a police barrier, when Capitão Nascimento was waiting for him. Then, this police chief asked: \"What is this, who is the commander\"? Capitão Nascimento catches the policeman chief, he gets him off through the window and begins to beat him a lot! I felt a desire of doing the same if I had have had the same opportunity!\nI really recommend this movie, because it is important to get further information concerning police and politicians.

Padilha's script is actually rather more nuanced than that of the first film, which tempers the fascistic overtones as Nasciento comes to find common ground with the lily-livered liberal Fraga when he realises that they both want the same thing; justice. It also attempts to address the corruption of the system beyond the streets showing the self serving politicians pulling the strings and their manipulation of the media. It's essentially a visceral tirade against institutional corruption and as such seems a little preachy, especially since the first person narrative makes it feel rather dry and detached. The action scenes are brilliantly executed however and the multi-layered story gives it a depth missing from the original film making for a quality action thriller with a political spin.",

Basically it's a story of corruption and the things people in power do to maintain themselves in that position, no matter if it involves illegal activities.  But there's a whole cast of characters involved with a lot o  The one thing I very much liked, and I'm a big fan of this, is that every moment in the movie seemed to be working toward the same endgame.  Everything that happened had a purpose and it all played out in the end.  It's rare to see films do this and do it as well as this movie has.  Of course the movie is also full of shootouts and it's definitely kinetic and high-octane.  Visually the film feels like a documentary so the shootouts feel tense, and again high-octane, and very realistic.  Really it's a movie that clicks on all cylinders.  Wagner Moura does an excellent job as a man who's torn apart between what's right and what he, as a former Skull, would have done to protect his colleagues.  Not to mention having to live with the fact that his system, through no fault of his own, just the manipulations of others, created this widespread corruption.  I also enjoyed how we're always one step ahead of Nascimento in knowing what's happening in Rio.  Nascimento, in a voice over well after the events have happened, narrates the story and tells us how things escalated and how he played a part in that.  Sometimes this makes the character look like a dumbass because the 'bad' thing, in this case corruption, is happening right before his eyes and he doesn't even realize it.  But in this movie it doesn't make the character look like an idiot, it actually makes you want for him to find out what's happening even more.  It's very well done.  Wagner also brings a completely weariness to the character, you can tell by the end of the film that he's just tired of everything and he wants to put an end to it all.  Really he feels like a very complete character with his own flaws yet a man that always tries to do what's right, in his eyes.  Really this movie is just fantastic.  It's complex, flawed and violent.  Always a good combination if done correctly and this movie does it excellently.",

It helped at the beginning since I didn't see the first one, but as the movie progressed, it started to feel like they could have done away with the VO in favor of something that would have been more expressive. VO can be great (see Memento), but this felt like a cheat, and that's just too bad.

Where in the first film we were treated to a somewhat enjoyable film, more action than substance and little effort to morally question the kill first ask questions later attitude it was packed with. \n\nThe previous film was narrated by the protagonist Captain Nascimento, he tells of how his brute-force squad are helping to fix the violent problems Rio faces. In this film he narrates again, but this time tells us the story of his discovery how the system works in reality. His simple belief from before is shattered as he begins to understand the depth the corruption runs through the political system.\n\nAlthough it seems a bit convenient for his family life to be tied in to his battles with the liberal Fraga it doesn't sting too much. The resulting additions to the narrative and the culmination of Nascimento's enlightenment all help to justify this otherwise distracting blip in what is a really solid film.",

It's apparently a  sequel to the first Elite Squad outing in 2007, which is said to have covered the Special Police Operation Battalion in more detail, but this stands alone as a tough crime capper of the type that Brazil has become known for in recent years since the groundbreaking City of God (2002).

He is intelligent, sober, and fits in the organizations, and executes his commands in forceful ways. I was constantly contemplating, over how he would deal with Major Rocha (Sandro Rocha) the main antagonist villain of movie. I should put it here, that as soon as I played the movie, my curiosity grew larger, with opening scene, which is brief and reminded me of Spanish movie called 'Celda 211' (although the later is wholly shot inside prison, inmates have taken-over prison with no-go-area block). \r\n\r\nThe film was selected as the Brazilian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, however it did not make the final shortlist.",

The picture explodes onto the screen, immediately developing a following of faithful fans to sing its praises, almost effortlessly parroting (in a good way!) its messages in works of their own, be it reviews or academic papers or commentaries.  The film inspires others to rise up and begin telling stories of their own, encouraging them to craft original tales from whatever corners of the world have given them their unique experiences, and these efforts invariably end up influencing the next whole generation of additional filmmakers to carry the torch.  It's the 'circle of life,' as applied to film, and ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN is such a film.\n\nClearly, Director Jose Padilha owes his inspiration to some of the great crime films from the 70's and 80's, back at a time when Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were doing what they were doing with MEAN STREETS and THE FRENCH CONNECTION, respectively.  Obviously, you can see some inspiration from the likes of Brian de Palma, directing the virtuoso performance from Al Pacino in SCARFACE.  Undoubtedly, a director like Michael Mann - who raised the bar with HEAT and even COLLATERAL - comes to mind as an ancestor to the kind of flicks crafted by Padilha.  In no way as that meant as a detractor; ELITE SQUAD is exceptional - as noteworthy, original, and impactful as crime dramas come.  Rather, it just shows that \"quality\" influences more \"quality,\" and I've no doubt about the great things to come from Mr. Padilha.\n\nRio de Janeiro is in chaos.  Crime rules, and the drug lords - even though they've been sheltered away in prison - are still calling the shots for what goes down on the wild streets.  However, when Rio's Special Police Lt. Colonel Nascimento (played by Wagner Moura) fails to successfully end a prison hostage situation without the loss of life, the political organization still needs a 'hero' to show the masses that crime doesn't pay, and he's uncharacteristically promoted to managing the urban nation's campaign to wipe out gangs.  Once he's removed the warlords, he inadvertently unleashes an even greater beast - the crooked government that runs the country from the shadows - and now he's become their target, with his friends and family also trapped within the cross-hairs of institutional corruption.\n\nIt's a brilliant tale, wide in scope, but never losing the personal connection to its lead characters.  Despite indicting the entire organization of bad government, ELITE SQUAD always shows the true risks to the men and women who attempt to 'tame the beast' of change only to find themselves and their loved ones at even greater risk.  Equal parts crime drama and investigatory procedural, the film maintains a blistering pace from start to finish, all the way never losing sight of the threats posed by a system fraught with dishonesty.  It's never easy to do the right thing; in fact, in Padilha's world, it will almost always get you killed.\n\nThe disc comes issued by Flatiron Film Company but was produced in cooperation with several international film companies.  It's being distributed by New Video here in the United States.  Production qualities were very high - despite the obvious grime of the locations - and the violence here is played out to tremendous effect.  This one ain't for the light-hearted, folks.  It's a grim reality - one lived in by unfortunate folks who populate the slum surrounding big cities in foreign lands - making it all the more important to be seen and experienced.  The disc includes a 45-minute 'making of' featurette that plays out strong enough, but, sadly, it doesn't match the intensity of the picture it compliments.  I'd also be remiss to point out that ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN was an 'Official Selection' to the 2011 Sundance Film Festival as well as to the Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlin.  I've read about it on film boards for quite some time now; I can't tell you how pleased I am to have finally seen it firsthand.  Indeed, I've watched it twice since it showed up in my mail.\n\nAlso, while I'll admit that the film is a sequel (it's predecessor, the first ELITE SQUAD, launched in 2007), no viewer has to have seen the first picture to understand the events of the second; I haven't, and this is no way tempered my enjoyment.  If anything, it's only made me want to reach out and find the first installment in the life of the crime-fighting Nascimento character.\n\nA cinema cocktail of crime and corruption, Jose Padilha's ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN is a break-through sensation.  Everything I've read written about it is nothing less than spot on.  The story bursts onto the screen with vivid characters and sequences tightly controlling the chaos in the frame.\n\nHIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  While I don't agree with all of the political messages within the film - especially some of the more liberal depictions of how society regress into criminality when institutions fail them - it's easy to put those ideas aside, sit back, and enjoy one incredible, highly-kinetic film experience.  ELITE SQUAD is quality filmmaking of the highest order, and, as such, I give it my highest possible recommendation.\n\nIn the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener for the expressed purposes of writing this review.",

            "content": "Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is rougher, more brutal, faster paced and much more intriguing than its predecessor. It is one of those rare cases when the sequence is better than the original delivery. The Enemy Within is more provoking, more complex and depicts the true ugly face of societies, where crime, corruption and politics have become one.\r\n\r\nSituated several years later, Jose Padilha's story is as realistic as in the firs installment. Unlike its predecessor the narrative is not way too much and the story is easier to follow as the going-forth-and-back is minimized. From the very beginning Padilha trashes once again the liberal, the social and all kinds of bourgeois human rights activists whose perception of reality is based on non-existent ideal and nothing else. While showing how the life of Captain Nascimento evolves into the brain who brings BOPE to a new professional level, Jose Padilha takes a bold turn on politics and corruption on the highest levels. With no sentiments,  he shows the growing up of Captain Nascimento and the revealing of the monstrous face of the symbiosis between crime, corruption and politics.\r\n\r\nEach detail of story is a hard hitting one, especially when one realizes that the \"system\" is everywhere and cutting its head will only result the giving life to two others. The documentary style typical for the first movie is kept and this straightens the grip of the movie on the audience. \r\n\r\nPositive comments should be made also about Wagner Moura, whose performance evolves from being a rough special forces cop, into someone who has gained wisdom, experience and who never stops to believe in the righteousness of his actions. His solid acting is definitely something to be followed up in the next projects with him (Neill Blomkamp's Elysium) and probably he could become the next established Brazilian movie-star.\r\n\r\nElite Squad: The Enemy Within is an excellent cop-thriller, which will grab you from its first minute and won't let you long after the final credits. It is not only the brutal violence in it, but also the message and the determination it contains. A must see movie !",

After a bloody prison riot, Nascimento becomes a bureaucrat and Matias is demoted to a cop.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, Nascimento cracks down on the drug dealers of the slums, which in turns makes the corrupt officers turn into a militia that regulates the slums. With this new shift of power, Nascimento's world turns upside down when everything goes out of control and the people close to him are hurt/killed.\n\nThe movie takes an interesting turn, by focusing on the corruption in government. The action is still there with BOPE, but it's not the main point of action. It's the power struggles between different parties and the tactics that must be used when not out on the streets firing at each other.\n\nIt maintains the same gritty tone of the first film while further developing the characters and expanding the universe of the first film's limits.

Wagner Moura gives an astonishing performance that deserves awards attention, he has never been better. A brilliant piece of work that stands with filmmakers like Coppola and Scorsese.

The greatest pleasure the film provides is letting the audience understand in key moments throughout that, even as Nascimento sinks deeper and deeper, he is creating his own wiggle room and means of combating his enemies.

Brazil's Official Entry for the 2011 Academy Awards and the highest grossing film in Latin American history is a blazing genre film with a strong political statement.\n\nClearly inspired by GOODFELLAS, this intense story shows the many levels of corruption within Rio's government and police force, who conspire to take over the drug trade in the favelas (aka slums) and subsequently rule every aspect of its businesses. The police become a mafia-style militia, and it's easy to see this playing out in cities all over the world. All you have to do is look at the crackdowns on protesters in Egypt, Iran, Syria, Lybia, or the victims of pepper-spraying and worse in our own backyards, and you can relate to what's on display here.\n\nThis is a highly complex story, but I had no trouble following it because the characters are so richly drawn and the direction is so immediate and engrossing. Jose Padilha impressed me with his documentary, BUS 174, and his experience making it pay off tremendously with great handheld cinematography and a clear sense of what story he's telling. Many have complained about the wall-to-wall voiceover, but it's very similar to GOODFELLAS and truly helped me keep track of the story. Sure, it overstates the obvious at times, and the film would most likely have played just fine without it, but it helped me sort everything out.\n\nWhat really keeps you grounded are the wonderful performances. Wagner Moura, a dead ringer for Mark Ruffalo, plays Captain Nascimento, who attempts to rid Rio of its corruption, particularly that of the most disarmingly frightening bad guy I've seen in a long time, played by Sandro Rocha as the most corrupt cop you're likely to see on screen. His intensity, even at a backyard barbeque, is the stuff of nightmares. Also contributing great work is Maria Ribeiro as Nascimento's ex-wife, Irandhir Santos as her current husband and voice of uber-liberalism, Andre Ramiro as Nascimento's right-hand man and potential loose cannon, and Andre Mattos as a blustering, over-the-top tv host who makes Peter Finch in NETWORK look like Mr. Rogers.\n\nThe opening sequence alone, detailing a prison riot and how it's handled, was enough to make me sit up and take notice throughout the entire 116 minutes. A sequence in the favelas as Rocha takes over and an amazingly intense scene in which a reporter stumbles upon key evidence are master classes in movie suspense. Ultimately, this is a highly depressing treatise on the never-ending cycles of corruption presented as a ferociously-paced cop thriller. Jose Padilha is pegged to direct the reboot of ROBOCOP next, which seems like a perfect fit, as he's pretty good at turning a genre film into something deeper.",

            "content": "I wasn't even aware there was an original Elite Squad until after I had heard about and had access to Elite Squad: The Enemy Within. The Enemy Within has been receiving rave reviews from pretty much everyone who has seen it. This is the type of movie that sucker punches you in the gut and you never see it coming, but all you can do is smile because that rush is unlike anything else you've ever experienced. Elite Squad: The Enemy Within makes full use of the term, \"thriller\" before turning it upside down and inside out and doing it all over again in a two hour time period.\r\n\r\nSome rather interesting camera work is utilized throughout the film. You take notice of it in the very first scene as the camera catches every crack and break in a pane of glass as a car is riddled with bullets. Slow motion is also used in a refreshing kind of way mostly because slow motion has looked the same way since 2006 when Leonidas kicked the messenger into the pit in 300. While this was probably done in a cheaper way since the budget wasn't nearly as big as it was in a film like 300, the fact that it was done differently is what makes it noteworthy. This feels more raw and less polished. The \"size of a tangerine\" scene is fairly awesome, as well. The scene is frozen at one point, but you see that scene from two different perspectives.\r\n\r\nTaken, Man on Fire, and The Man From Nowhere; these are a few of the films the action scenes in Elite Squad: The Enemy Within may remind you of. Those scenes when everything hits the fan are the main reason to see this film, but everything in between is so tense that you find yourself easily getting absorbed into all of the events that are going on. Corruption is fascinating in a very disturbing kind of way. This is Nascimento's (Wagner Moura) story, so he's pretty much your guide through this journey as he's removed from BOPE (the Special Police Operations Battalion of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police) and struggles to survive in Rio, but the way his story ties in with the stories of Matias (André Ramiro) and Fraga (Irandhir Santos) is rather brilliant as they're both involved with Nascimento in more ways than one. The bloody brutality of the film seems to be lurking around every corner even when things may appear calm.\r\n\r\nIn The Boondock Saints, Paul Smecker (played by Willem Dafoe) yells, \"There was a firefight!\" during one the most extravagant shootout of the film. Elite Squad: The Enemy Within almost seems to redefine that term. While there isn't a lot of property damage in the film, people get wasted left and right and blood sprays into the air whenever a gun is drawn. People get the hell beaten out of them before being lit on fire and dead bodies are burned as their teeth are pulled to hide their identities. There's a grittiness to Elite Squad: The Enemy Within that many films have barely scratched the surface of.\r\n\r\nRemember when you first saw The Empire Strikes Back where you had this fairly awesome movie on your hands that left you with this rather huge cliffhanger ending? Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is similar in that aspect. Elite Squad is obviously going to be at least a trilogy, but it'll be one of those things that will be less of an issue when you don't have a long wait between films. In the meantime though, it feels a little cheap.\r\n\r\nElite Squad: The Enemy Within is a lot like City of God if it was on steroids; there's more action, more intensity, and bigger payoffs. Its biggest flaw is that it doesn't end and is obviously just building toward the next sequel. With an excellent cast and eye-catching cinematography, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a compelling look at the underbelly of society that's a must-see.",

It's certainly more ambitious, focusing less on shootouts and the favelas and more on the behind-the-scenes politics and ideologies. In doing so, it addresses some of the fascist accusations leveled against its predecessor, which I thought was a wily touch. I doubt this portrayal will quiet the naysayers, though, as nearly everyone in the government is presented as corrupt to the core, but it offers up some good food for thought and how anything can get twisted for bad use or reelections. The film is also set many years after the first one, with hardly any characters returning, but Nascimento remains front and center. Wagner Moura turns in a deeper performance the second go around, and even Jose Padilha seems more confident in the director's chair. I still cannot wait until he takes Hollywood by storm. While it's far from the format of a traditional blockbuster, and will barely make a dent here in America, I find it encouraging and heartening to know something of this nature can actually smash records somewhere.",
