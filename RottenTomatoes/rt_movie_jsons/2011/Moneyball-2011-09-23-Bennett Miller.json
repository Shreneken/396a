Its telling is all the more bold for keeping the game itself at arm's length, as Beane himself superstitiously does (\"it's hard not to romanticize the game\"), and placing the focus squarely on the offices and locker rooms where his work unfolds.",

            "content": "Released in 2011, \"Moneyball\" was directed by Bennett Miller as well as starring famous actors such as Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. The highly rated movie was based off a very famous season that the Oakland Athletics had in 2003. The making of this film involved a very well though plot which was easy to understand and unravel in the viewers mind, a relatively high budget, fan favorite actors such as Chris Pratt, Brent Jennings, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill who were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. \nMoneyball begins at the end of their 2002 season where they lost to the Yankees after being two games up in the World Series. Following that season the Oakland Athletics had three of their so called \"irreplaceable\" players wanting to leave, to any other team in the MLB they would be able to extend their contract, but the Athletics had the smallest budget in the entire MLB. To put in perspective the A's had a 41 million dollar budget compared to the New York Yankees's budget of 125 million. This created a lot of internal problems that Brad Pitt (Billy Beane) had to face as the general manager. During one of his proposals to the Boston Red Sox to try and replace one of his key players, \"Billy\" kept dropping his offer for one of the players that they had, the offers seemed to be a steal, but the general manager kept taking advice from what seemed like a loser in the back of the room. After \"Billy\" left the meeting empty handed he found the guy and eventually asked him to come work for the A's, with the hope of making a huge impact to the success of the A's, his name was Jonah Hill (Peter Brand). Once they teamed up the movie becomes very interesting in the decisions and involvements that they make in order to help the team become successful. \nFor a movie released in 2011, I was pleasantly surprised with the cinematography. There were moments that weren't as good as others but overall it was very good. The acting was very good apart from the amount of facial expressions Brad Pitt makes throughout the movie. The plot for the first hour and a half was very good until it got to the end, then it started to drag a bit. My favorite part about the whole movie was the way that they introduced the main characters in the movie, the thought that went into introducing the third main character was extremely creative. There were very creative flashbacks leading the viewer to understand multiple plots and a history of the main character which helped develop the story in a clearer way. \nMoneyball taught me that even if you don't have much you can still make the most of it and enjoy what you have. It also begs the point that if you work hard enough for something and have a strong enough desire you can achieve anything that you put your mind to. Billy Beane is a perfect example of what hard work and dedication leads to. \nIn conclusion, Moneyball is a great movie. I recommend it to people who enjoy sports or enjoy watching a good movie with a very well thought plot. People who would not enjoy this movie, are those who do not understand baseball at all, or don't have the time to sit down for two hours to watch a movie. Overall the plot, the acting, the production, and the story lead to a four out of five star rating.",

            "content": "For an otherwise uplifting film depicting the importance of giving every player a second chance, \"Moneyball\" regrettably takes three strikes when it comes to the fundamentals: plot consistency, character growth, and presentation. In short, the film delivered a narrative that was as satisfying to watch as hitting a fly ball in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, thanks in large part to lead protagonist Billy Beane's grating personality. Though it has a measure of historical merit in terms of enjoyability, a more concise and thought out script would have scored it more runs.",

            "content": "Moneyball covers the real life story of Oakland A's manager Billy Beane and his implementation of the then controversial sabermetrics to the game of baseball during the 2002 MLB season to stay competitive after losing key players and being given no budget to court new ones. Like all dramatized adaptions of real life stories, there are inaccuracies, but for the most part, they don't detract from the story. The dialogue and acting are phenomenal with humor that often lands. The minimal soundtrack is memorable and the sound design itself is strong. It's not without flaws, mainly the story jump cutting a little too much and flash back sequences to Billy's time as a player not greatly implemented. Still, these flaws are for the most part, minor and should not steer one away from what is a solid sports history movie.\n\nThe plot of Moneyball opens with the Oakland A's 2001 loss and general manager as well as former ball player Billy Beane left to pick up the pieces. With no budget and the star players being bought out, Billy begins the arduous process of trying to replace them. When coming to discuss trades with another team, he happens upon Peter Brand who is standing in for the real life counterpart Paul DePodesta. Peter introduces Billy to the sabermetrics approach to scouting and the film follows these two as they work against public opinion, coaches, scouts, and pretty much everyone to build a World Series team all while Billy balances a relationship with his daughter as she grows more concerned for his job.\n\nThe casting, acting, and dialogue are the strong points of the film, which is good because that's where it focuses generally. Most of the dialogue sounds almost improvised which carries a realism to it. Not only that, it often had me laughing. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill play near polar opposites and bounce off each other well. Scenes breath and sometimes, they have no dialogue at all, allowing the viewer to reflect. The plot is tight, though this is expected given that it's built off real events. Some may take issue with the inaccuracies to real life, but they didn't bother me personally. The real issues with it come in the form of it jumping rather than transitioning smoothly between scenes. Billy's flash backs to playing in the majors aren't always immediately clear either because of the jump cuts. Still, these gripes aren't enough to dampen my enjoyment.\n\nSound is excellent. The music is memorable without ever being explosively bombastic. I especially love the closing scene choice of ‘the show' and how it's used. The sound design itself is more than satisfying. I think I could listen to baseballs cracking off bats all day in this movie.\n\nMy end conclusion is Moneyball is a solid entry into the long standing history of Hollywood baseball movies. It's historically fascinating and you don't have to be an aficionado to understand what is going on. While it does have trouble with transitions and jump cuts, this should not be enough to detract from a great movie, especially those who have a love of the game.",

            "content": "One of the smartest sports dramas, and a great film on America's (former) pastime. It's fascinating, funny, and surprisingly deep. Brad Pitt delivers an Oscar-worthy performance here in a role where he gets to bring his athletic baggage with a chip on his shoulder. His Billy Beane is intelligent, dismissive and impatient at times, charismatic when he needs to be, and ruthless when it suits his interests. It's a stunning turn that Pitt handles with movie star confidence. Just as effective is Jonah Hill, in his first serious dramatic role. He does away with his crass vulgarian schtick, and channels his inner meek nerd in a role that allows him to be anxious, tentative, shy, but often the smartest guy in the room, at least when it comes to baseball players and stats. The fine, witty script (by the great Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin) makes the (literal) inside baseball stuff comprehensible. It also eschews the \"big game\" sports movie formula while simultaneously breaking down the mythos of the game and questioning long-held cornerstones of how you win a baseball game. Director Bennett Miller brings a curious outsider's view to the proceedings, which I loved. Romantic notions of the sport run up against the modern complications of managing and running a major league team. It all adds up to a lovely, engrossing and moving real-life account of a moment when MLB was changed forever, and it's one of the great films of 2011",

Phil Seymour Hoffman and Chris Pratt's characters are great examples of 2 bit characters, with the talents of the respective actors wasted.

Yet, like Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) approach, Moneyball takes an unconventional turn.\n\nOne aspect that I admired from Bennett Miller is that he also explored the different conflicts that face each character. We see GM's and Team owners pushing Billy Beane to handpick successful athletes that will make the team great. We see each team member's fear that they're past their prime. And we see the emotional toll that this takes on Billy Beane and his family.\n\nThis is a thought-provoking movie that doesn't go too far into the statistical details. It keeps things interesting for those with a passionate love of sports and has an interest in the Moneyball story.\n\nDig deeper and one can find deeper meaning in this story. We can see the shifting realities of the sports world as they move from all-stars to cold statistics. We see the implications that algorithms will have over human intuition and what that can mean for the world. We also see the fall of Oakland after other, more well-financed teams start to pick up and use Oakland's successful method, leading the A's back to underdog status.\n\n4/5.

That was a real stretch for him I'm sure. PSH is also great here not playing some sort of pervert or weirdo, it was a great change of pace. Chris Pratt is also here showing that he had some chops beyond screwing around on Parks and Rec, and the next year or two after this he'd get into action mode and take gear and stuff to be in the MCU an Jurassic World.

Do not let ego interfere with the finding the root cause of a problem. The status quo is a veil that prevents progress and fruitful introspection.\"",

            "content": "Bennett Miller's understated style, with his lulling and hypnotizing time stamp, is here enmeshed with Sorkin's dialogue and the mashup delivers. With solid work from Pitt and Hill, what could seem at first glance just the husk of a film, a flimsy disposable series of facts, factoids and true history, becomes a nuanced tale of relationships and the journeys of life -- lifetimes and within 9 innings of baseball. There's something in the DNA of a Bennett Miller film that invites us in, subtly. He sculpts time uniquely, and I have the sense that he's probably a fan of Tarkovsky, even though he has no fear of the edit or quick moving sequences. But there's something biological, human, humane, tangible, body-like about the substance of his films, and here with Moneyball, we avoid the pratfalls of Sorkin's machinized engine of words, Pitt's charm and even Hill's comedy. It all meets and melds in a way that creates a kind of naked authenticity that feels true and deserving of our attention. We get glimpses throughout the 2 hours and change at Billy Beane, and by the end, get a sense of his psychology and soul. And there's a shot of his truck pulling off the highway and Phil Hoffman's brief turn that are both shockingly simple and wonderfully great -- small things do add up. It's a small movie that feels big, and a big movie that feels small. It's a baseball movie that even people who hate sports, can get behind. It's good, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd times around. Even the 4th, or maybe I'm susceptible --- \"it's hard not to be romantic about baseball.\"",

We know for sure that the stakes are high as the season starts, but the pay off is a little shy of satisfactory.

I liked how it was about following ur own gut n redeeming urself. I did feel like it was lacking something tho. It couldn't quite get inside the main character's head enuff, altho in the beginning I think it did that well. I also thought this strategy takes some of the heart out of baseball, even tho its clearly effective and I was not a fan of how he cuts ppl from the team. It isn't just a business, it's people lives/careers. It didn't show the critics enuff of this method/Beane IMO. The acting and all the details were well done tho-editing, shots...etc.",

Il baseball è solo un pretesto usato per raccontare qualcosa di molto più profondo, qualcosa che ci viene presentato attraverso un filtro decisamente troppo pesante.

Like most things involving Aaron Sorkin, women are underwritten to the point of near-invisibility, only ever doing what's necessary to allow their talented men to shine. But for a Sorkin film, it's also uncharacteristically laid-back in the amount and pace of dialogue, which works well for a film about a sport that trades on the marathon rather than the sprint. More than accessible for those who know nothing of the sport, it has much to say about how we approach any of life's endeavours - but never quite gives the characters a rounded-enough life to really push through to essential territory.",

Everything then builds to the action, which eventually arrives to give things a new lease of life. Never a boring moment, at least for me.\n\nThe sporting side is ideally told, despite the sizeable use of real life footage as opposed to newly captured content - which was a smart call, by the way. All the while connecting the characters and making us care for them.\n\nBrad Pitt plays lead as Billy Beane, fantastically I must add. He gives the perfect performance, absolutely nothing to negatively note about it - except the cup spitting, though that's a film thing rather than him.\n\nJonah Hill is also impressive here, as he's suited to composite character Peter Brand well. The support cast are ace too, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman (Art Howe).\n\nIt's all riveting stuff.

The story of the general manager of a small team with a relatively small budget for players ($37m, a mere pittance) who, through the statistical analysis of a Harvard graduate, finds a way to fly in the face of traditional baseball team selection and compete with the big boys. It's an odd film, structured like a traditional sports film but rather than big, blustery and emotionally manipulative, it's very quiet and still for large swathes. The performances are all good, with Brad Pitt being as cool and unflappable as I can remember, almost to a fault as he doesn't show a huge amount of the doubt that one would have assumed would be coursing through his brain. I think ultimately the film's success lies in the simple, incredible, almost-unbelievable story. Now I'm not a baseball fan at all (so another credit to the film is that everything is explained effectively such that a neophyte can understand enough of what's going on to care), so I don't know how many liberties were taken when turning real life events into a plot, but I really don't care. I don't watch films for real life, I watch them to be told an engaging story. If, as in this film, that story is an underdog story, if it involves ingenuity triumphing over money, if it involves courage triumphing over tradition, and if it involves Philip Seymour Hoffman in any capacity, I'm probably going to enjoy it a great deal.",

His caustic and nostalgic relationship with his past is a relatable throughline to many would-be sports stars who fizzled too early. This existential angst is what propels him to think outside the four corners of the proverbial management page. It seems as though Pitt's character is chasing the dream that he lost much too early. Hill also had a formidable performance, outstripping his usual droll roles. He is a capable dramatic actor, who in my opinion is well-suited to more earnest stories. Overall, this is a self-effacing movie leveraging substance over CGI, which is becoming more rarified in the current geist. ",

            "content": "When you think of films about sports you usually envision Chariots of Fire (1981) and Rocky (1976), films that deal with athletes specifically. Moneyball manages to show you sports from the perspective of an ex-athlete turned general manager which gives it a different flavor as we see what goes into assembling a competitive team of athletes instead of seeing the events through the eyes of the athletes themselves. The screenplay from Aaron Sorkin, coming off of The Social Network (2010), helps to pep up what could have been a rote story and confident direction from Bennett Miller creates a deceptively deep and emotionally compelling film about an issue that some, like myself, will have no investment in heading into the film.\n\nThe general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane, Brad Pitt, is still haunted by the fact that his own baseball career never panned out despite having been a highly drafted prospect. He is determined to have his team be successful in the upcoming season. He enlists the help of saber metrics advocate Peter Brand, Jonah Hill, who encourages him to make risky decisions and unexpected decisions that cause the team to pick up talented players such as Scott Hatteberg, Chris Pratt. Although Beane initially faces resistance from the more traditional leadership group that surrounds him the players he had drafted are eventually given a fair shake and experience unprecedented success with 20 consecutive wins. The Athletics go on to be successful and Beane remains with them despite offers from the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe film takes a subject, baseball, that would usually confuse me or just disinterest me and makes it relatively easy to understand in addition to presenting us with a main character we care for in Beane. We see the game as something difficult to understand even from the perspective of people who have interacted with it their entire lives but as Hill's character breaks down why certain players would be good selections we start to understand his logic and are wrapped up in his passion. A lot of the credit is owed to Sorkin whose style can become grating if ingested in high doses but whose talents shine here. Much like The Social Network the sight of older white men in suits arguing in conference rooms is actually cause for excitement because it is where we get to hear some of the juiciest dialogue. The fact that Sorkin lost the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award is disheartening but at least he was defeated by the highly talented Alexander Payne.\n\nThe performance from Pitt should also not be undervalued as he plays his character with a quiet restraint necessary for us to believe this story. He is a man living with a lot of regrets, among them the disintegration of his marriage, who does not outwardly project a lot of his stress and anxiety and yet Pitt makes it clear that these feelings are there in every forced gesture and tossed of line of passive aggressive encouragement. Of the five actors nominated for Best Actor I would have chosen him because although I do not usually like his work as an actor I think he gives a very good, nuanced performance here that is essential to the film's success and deserves more recognition.\n\nThe film is not one of my personal favorites of 2011 as I preferred Margaret (2011), The Tree of Life (2011), Young Adult (2011) and Margin Call (2011) but it is one of the best films to crack the mostly wrongheaded Best Picture lineup of 2011. It's reputation will probably endure as it taps into the interests of sports fans, a rabid base of people willing to support films, in addition to being smart enough to be championed by critics and film buffs alike. When you boil it down to the basics I would much rather people watch this film than Invictus (2009) and The Blind Side (2009), the second of which is an actively offensive and infuriating film.\n\nI would recommend that people see this film if they are a fan of Pitt, like baseball or just generally films that manage to be both entertaining and informative. I would not call the film perfect because there are times when it gets rather dull in the middle but it's a largely worthwhile viewing experience.",

Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who assembles the team, who has an epiphany: all of baseball's conventional wisdom is wrong. Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs. The onetime jock teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that the scouts call flawed, but all of whom have an ability to get on base, score runs, and win games. It's more than baseball, it's a revolution - one that challenges old school traditions and puts Beane in the crosshairs of those who say he's tearing out the heart and soul of the game.\n\nSports films seem farther and fewer nowadays. Granted, I think they're extremely difficult to write. It's difficult to write a quality sports film for people not familiar with the sport, while also making it interesting enough for the cinemas. But this film really hit it out of the park and we got a really amazing film at that. \n\nFirst off, I loved the story. It was a character-driven piece where we were allowed into the mind of each character, protagonists and supporting alike. We get a look into the world of baseball, as the film really does a good job of putting  that harsh reality into perspective. \n\nBrad Pitt is someone who has been and has continued to impress audiences with his performances. Not only that, but he had a great partner in Jonah Hill, who has shown his ability to excel in diverse roles constantly. Actually, the cast is filled from bottom to top with amazing actors and amazing performances. The film feels extremely genuine and that's what makes it stand out from other sports films. It takes a true story and brings it to the screen in a realistic, yet entertaining way. \n\nHonestly, I think even people who aren't sports fans will find solitude with this film. It's a really well written piece with so many layers to it. It's keeps tension high without ever feeling like a thriller of any kind, but it's also really emotional. There's a lot of themes of career, family, and life itself. It's a story that I think a lot of people will be able to resonate with, even if they're not sports fans.\n\nIn the end, \"Moneyball\" is a film that's gotten better and better over time. It's a high quality piece that you should watch if you get the chance. It's definitely one of my favorite sports films and a constant re-watch in my book.",

In the beginning Billy Beane saw how his team was getting defeated in every single game, and was losing their players by the Yankees since they had deeper pockets and were willing to pay them a lot more than the Oaklands did,  the Yankees would keep stealing the Oaklands players, the workers tried to solve the problem by replacing their three key players with professional baseball athletics. Billy knew the problem was even more worse than replacing players, he knew that all the games that were played were unfair, needed players who he could afford to hire and pay. But when Billy met Peter at the meeting in the Yankeeï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s office for a trade with their players. Billy hired Peter to be his assistant of the General Manager since he had graduated from college with a economic degree and had some experience working under a baseball company. Billy truly believed in Peter and his analysis and statistic of getting his team up to the top, since Peter had found all the possible predictions that could later happen. He knew there was no other way of finding a solution to solve the problem, besides agreeing to Peters method and taking chances. Billy had replaced all of his strong players with old, injured players which confused a lot of the people, even who were working in the company and the news reporters. Because Billy had trusted Peter so much they both went through ups and downs, they also had to fire a lot of their team players. The main focus that Billy and Peter had was to get all the players onto the field. After breaking the Americans League Record a winning streak 20 Billy decided to quit and spend more time with his daughter, and he truly left a true market value for baseball players. Billy realized that his team was one of the fewer teams that was undervalued by other teams. Billy changed that by proving to the other higher teams that they could break the American League Record and they did. The director did a impressive job outlining the movie based on a true story. The rich and the poor teams have a different salary between them which was true that the professional players would rather join a company that paid more money than a small company that was not worth working for. One specific concept that I would criticize on is how the athletes are only willing to play for teams and or companies who are paying them big bucks, instead of helping Billy who has worked his whole life just to compete and eventually win a game. Billy decided change the baseball into a game instead of a splitting the teams/companies into a upper class status, because he wanted to prove everyone wrong that his team full of players who were ill made it to the very top.",

            "content": "Behavior and Economics in Moneyball\n\t\nIt is, to me at least, a foregone conclusion that Moneyball is a great film. Released in 2011, just 9 years after the events of the film take place, directed artfully by Bennett Miller, with great performances from ï¿ 1/2~big leaguersï¿ 1/2(TM) like Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour-Hoffman and Chris Pratt, and, maybe most importantly, with a sharp, witty and endlessly entertaining screenplay by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. However, just for the sake of argument, Iï¿ 1/2(TM)m going to pretend I donï¿ 1/2(TM)t care about any of that. Take away all the personal drama, production value and intimate moments. Do the economics at play in Moneyball really stand up under closer inspection? Much like the characters in the film, Iï¿ 1/2(TM)m going to take emotion out of the equation and focus solely on the numbers.\n\tThe first thing I thought was that of course the economics work, the film is based on a true story. So whether or not the ideas are actually sound, something worked back in 2002 that hadnï¿ 1/2(TM)t been tried before. However, in todayï¿ 1/2(TM)s world, statistics and sports are now inseparable, very different from just a few short years ago. What this means is that the techniques used in the film are now already commonplace, or to outdated to make an impact. But the year the Aï¿ 1/2(TM)s broke the record for the longest winning streak in MLB history, they were revolutionary. Essentially, the principle the film is built around is that on base percentage was severely undervalued in professional baseball. The characters made the leap that higher on base percentage meant higher percentage of wins. Players who got walked consistently, like Scott Hatteberg, were extremely undervalued, and small market teams could make a big splash by buying undervalued assets, and selling off the players whom they felt were overvalued, such as big swingers and closing pitchers. Although baseball is a game of offense, the same can be said for defence. Save percentages play a huge role in the game. This is explicitly stated by Peter Brand, or rather, the equation that he based his entire theory around.\n\nRuns scored2  / (Runs scored2 + Runs allowed2)\n\n\tThe system works similarly to a principle in the stock market, in fact, the primary principle. Buy low and sell high. Brokers believe that by buying undervalued stocks and selling those which are overvalued by the rest of Wall Street, they can make it rich. Of course, in the stock market this all comes down to speculation. There is only so much the data can tell you because of the extreme volatility of the market. Billy Beane and Peter Brand thought that they could come out on top by betting on people. Some might think that they got lucky, that their numbers were only part of the reason they won so big. I think a little differently. People are driven by habits, but stocks are not. When people repeat any activity, especially one that they are good at, they fall into routines. This is now common knowledge, and a huge part of the study of habits. If a player has been getting walks for their entire career, they have ingrained in themselves the ways in which to get to first. Even tiny habits that they arenï¿ 1/2(TM)t even aware of could make a game. That is why I think Beane and Brand were so successful. They used statistics to determine who could be the best player for the cheapest buck, and they took advantage of one simple human truth. Patterns are hard to break. Some teams spend years trying to form new habits, but the Aï¿ 1/2(TM)s, whether they were aware of it or not, leaned into the habits that their players had already developed, and came out with a superstar team that would change baseball forever.",

Non-baseball lovers may enjoy the proceedings but are likely to be less impressed than their sports-savvy counterparts. It will be interesting to see how much of the early Academy Awards word-of-mouth is transformed into late-innings buzz and, ultimately, into Oscar gold. Brad Pitt is very good and along with The Tree of Life he has shown that a typical award worthy role doesn't have to be a mentally handicapped or a paraplegic or a raging alcoholic- He is the guy next door here.

Brad Pitt brings such empathy and understanding to the role of Billy Beane. You will be rooting for the storybook ending, but end up getting something much more resonant and profound. You will learn about baseball, management, and marriage without needing any prior expertise or knowledge. I do not even care about baseball, but Moneyball will make you romanticize the sport like only the greatest sports film can accomplish.\n\nMoneyball boasts some of the finest cinematography you will ever get in a major motion picture. The numerous far wide shots of baseball stadiums and urban scenery are stunning! Long panning shots down hallways and intimate close ups and medium shots in offices will make even the most mundane locales fascinating. You get the gorgeous setting of complete realism brought to life with vivid color.\n\nMoneyball takes on a human drama with hopeful intentions and great speed. You get engaged by the intriguing choices and unbelievable story. It is hard to believe because it is real and grounded. Moneyball is unlike any other baseball movie.\n\nJonah Hill gives perhaps his finest performance ever. He endears himself to you as the brilliant and awkward economics graduate with a mind for baseball statistics. I think audiences will put themselves in his shoes. He adds a genuine feel and great natural humor to Moneyball. Together alongside Pitt's likability and comedic prowess, they build a baseball roster with heartfelt drama. I bet Hill may even make you cry.\n\nFrom Bennett Miller's stellar direction to Aaron Sorkin's realistic writing, Moneyball is a joy to watch.

That's why I putted this movie off for a very long time, and I really regret doing that.\n\nDirector Bennett Miller, along with screenwriters, Steven Zaillian, and Aaron Sorkin took a story that sounds uninteresting and turned it into an enjoyable movie that is funny, intense, and very touching in equal measure. I didn't know that Aaron Sorkin co-wrote the script but I felt his touches while watching the movie till I became completely sure that he co-wrote its script even before I check that out.\n\nThe dialogue is so smart and sharp, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill were both great, especially Brad Pitt, and they had an incredible chemistry that made the dialogue even more captivating.\n\nLet's face it, no director-screenwriter collaboration can beat Fincher-Sorkin's one. But that , by no means, means that Bennett Miller didn't do a great job directing this movie. Besides the fact that he made a very good-looking movie, he captured some truly magical cinematic moments that can stick in my head for a very long time. A very long sequence near the end, in particular, that is about ten minutes is easily one of the most riveting and gripping sequences I've ever watched. I was literally on the edge of my seat sweating, and putting my hands on head. It was really stressful and exhausting to watch. Also, the moments Billy Beane, Pitt's character, has with his daughter are just delightful to watch.\n\nNevertheless, Moneyball's problem, IMO, is that it's a bit boring! Its runtime is 133 min, and the movie definitely could have been way shorter. The problem is that there is too much talk that I really wasn't interested in, and most importantly, didn't need to. The movie lost me sometimes at the middle and the very end.\n\nBilly Beane is a well-written and grounded character that brought to life by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance. It had a lot of development, and it was a very interesting character. That being said, I felt that his backstory isn't complete. I think it was interesting at the beginning, but then the movie just ignored his past. As a result, I felt like there was something is missing in this character. The movie actually did keep advancing his backstory forward in a way that connect very well with the ongoing events of the movie, but that, unfortunately, didn't happen after the first act anymore.\n\nOverall, I loved Moneyball so much, and enjoyed watching it quiet a bit, and I didn't even think that I was going to like it.\n\n(8/10)",

Right in the heart. A key line in the film is, \"It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.\" Being a die-hard baseball fan, it's hard not only to not get romantic about baseball, but it's also hard not to be romantic about stories like this. While based on a true story, written by Michael Lewis to explain the sabermatic approach that Billy began taking with his previous GM (when he was an assistant), and continued on with Paul, the movie never mentioned the previous GM and began the story of using the sabermatic method after meeting the fictional Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill. The acting is the best I've seen Brad Pitt do. He was a great fit for this role and I can see why he produced it. He must have thought the same thing. I've heard Oscar buzz about it, but I don't see it carrying that far. He certainly deserves it more than for the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Jonah Hill plays seemingly the same character he does in every movie, and does it well. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as a generic portrayal of uncooperative manager, Art Howe, a portrayal in the film and book that the real Art Howe has heavily criticized and blames Beane's disregard for him. Aaron Sorkin brings his skills as a co-writer of the screenplay to dramatize the story very well and make it palatable for non-sports fans, but for those die-hards like me, Moneyball hits all the right places.",

Although some may think this movie is just about baseball statistics, it is not. This movie is about Billy Bean's quest at redemption. After his disastrous professional player career, Billy Bean chooses to become a General Manager and try to put together a team for the Oakland Athletics. Brad Pitt turns in a fantastic performance that translate Billy's love of the game and his daughter perfectly to make for a protagonist that is both relatable and easy to root for. Jonah Hill also turns in a surprisingly sentimental performance as the shy, nerdy Peter Brand. Our connection with Billy and his sidekick are what makes this movie special. One can feel their love for the game in this film and desire to change baseball for the better. Even after losing in the postseason, one still sees success that Billy has accomplished in bringing a change to the game and a bright future for his daughter.",

It just doesn't read like something that could transition, but the writing team did a masterful job with it. It's some of the best work by Aaron Sorkin, which is saying something. It's not just a baseball movie either, as anyone who appreciate an underdog can get behind it. Brad Pitt (Billy Beane) is excellent in one of his more grounded roles. He brings a realness to the role and dominates the screen whenever he's on it. Jonah Hill (Peter Brand) is good in his role, as are Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Art Howe) and Chris Pratt (Scott Hatteberg). The baseball scenes that we get are beautifully shot and they give you just enough to keep you interested. The off the field stuff is never boring, even when they're just sitting around talking about scouting players. They also did a great job inserting pieces of Billy's past and home life, to give the character more depth. It was also never done to the point where it felt overly long or took away from the main plot.\n\nWeaknesses: It's hard to find any. I guess the final scenes do feel to go on longer than you'd expect. Just when you feel the film is wrapping up, the trip to Boston and stuff after can certainly drag a bit. \n\nOverall: An incredible film. The acting, writing, and cinematography are all great. There's a well-told story that everyone can relate to, while still being great for baseball fans. Outstanding work that turns out to be the best baseball move in history.",

Moneyball works as a majestic entertainer for the Baseball fans but if not, then it may come off as reading news as it depends a whole lot of on factual events which may sometimes sound like just plain old news. Bennett Miller is perfect for the job and holds onto it but what really factors in is the screenplay which is filled with compelling arguments and amazing dialogues; kudos to Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. And on performance level, Brad Pitt offers some of his best work along with a great supporting cast like Jonah Hill. Moneyball has its ups (exhilarating conversations) and downs (an over stretched drama) and more importantly plays for more than 2 hours which could have been edited better but all in all it works.",

When we need to destroy what others see to rebuild. When we see others are not seeing it our way when they can see what we are done and who we are to know we font see eye to eye. When we see the eyes, brains, body of the organization to know it does take 1 person to rebuild a team to see we are going no where.\n\nWhen we see who knows more than meets the eye to see they see eye to eye with us. When we see we can get things that others undervalue. When we see the game for everything it is to know we can rebuild with the stats we see. When we see the world as 1, when everything has a final total in the end. When see we fo need to have some math & education to see the game not for it's talent & big budgets but what we can make out of somethings with the right team seeing the game differently. When we see we have to restore more then a team but faith in a club that loses sights on big talent and see nobodies to easily lose faith in a championship. When we are bidding for more eyes and sights when we need people to see & pay.\n\nWhen we see we were once a promising prospect with all eyes on us to see others missed an opportunity that they couldn't see coming.

When we see that we are starting to see the game more like business then clubhouse, with no hard feelings. When we don't see somethings coming that we need to uproot all the old weeds of from the ground before they grow any longer and ruin the entire longevity. When we see we need to make our team see us, when that's all this game is about seeing somethings coming to hit it right on target.

            "content": "With Moneyball, Bennett Miller does more than tell a soul-stirring sports drama. Set in a Giambi-era Oakland A's, Mr. Miller immerses audiences in a struggling institution's data-inspired revolution that shook the baseball world while shifting the sport's competitive approach. Festering in tension between long-embraced traditions and boundary-pushing innovation, the A's are challenged by shallow pockets and lackluster talent when General Manager Billy Beane decides to question the foundations of scouting logic by adopting an obscure statistician's \"sabremetrics\" claim that an OBR (on-base percentage) is significantly more effective in assessing a player's quality than an RBI. In this, Beane, played by Brad Pitt, supplants his scouts with equations and causes an uproar in the process. \n\nShining as A's General Manager Billy Beane, a former fielder who bombed the majors as a player, Brad Pitt is Miller's underdog innovator trapped in baseball's dated paradigm. Cocky in a high school star athlete sort of way, Pitt is masterfully authentic in digging into the complexities of the divorced father experiencing meaning in his life by redefining baseball strategy. In this sense, the antagonist isn't a person, or even a character, but an ineffective system reflecting American decay and technological renewal. \"Is an algorithm more effective than an experienced professional?\" is the central question guiding the plot, breeding a relatable range of self-doubt, insecurity, and courage. Thematically, this translates to, rather Darwinian, \"adapt or die\" -style lessons on the risks of questioning accepted norms in the name of progress. The story may not be sweet, Pitt's Beane discusses the romance of baseball while he ironically is accused of destroying baseball's mythic romance, but Pitt still shares tender moments. This juxtaposition puts Pitt's impressive versatility on full display - he swings from the ruthless GM trading away his players to the vulnerable dad enchanted by parental love. The best part? He does it in a low-key, natural style that makes it seem effortless. Jonah Hill stars as supporting actor, shining light on Beane's doubts and obstacles. \n\nWith a stand-out performance by Pitt and masterful directing by Miller, Moneyball proves an original, beautiful, and insightful take on a data revolution indicative of the times.",

            "content": "\"Moneyball\" is the 2011 sports drama film directed by Bennett Miller , based on Michael Lewis' 2003 book, \"Moneyball\", the screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. It tells the amazing history of Oakland  Athletics general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) as he, with the help of assistant g.m Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), try and apply Bill James' Submetrics analyses into 2002  MLB season. The film also stars Chris Pratt and Philip Seymor Hoffman.\n\nThe plot of the film works by making baseball and its analyses cool and entertaining, keeping the viewer attentive at all times, and also giving its main character depth and development, making this real-life figure much more interesting, and succeeding in not transforming Pitt's character into yet another cliche sports movie coach, or in this case, general manager. This is a great story about baseball and the complexity of the sport that deserved to be told, director Bennett Miller could not have done a better job.\n\nThe cast is certainly the best thing about \"Moneyball\", there's no miss. Brad Pitt gives a praiseworthy performance as he nails the part of Beane, and beside him, doing an even better job is Jonah Hill, the actor does a quiet, yet great performance that stands in the cast. In supporting roles we see (and reminisce) Philip Seymour Hoffman, as always, doing a fine job in the role of coach Art Howe, but the man that caught my eye, and surprised me the most was Chris Pratt, yeah. Pratt is here, as we've never seen him before, from his first scene where we see his character looking down and depressed due to the failure of his career, to his last as see him doing the Home run point. He's been variating between his usual comedy movies and Tv to do more serious roles in drama films, those include his minor appearances in the critically acclaimed films, \"Her\" and \"Zaro Dark Thirty\", and the main role as Star-Lord in the new Marvel franchise \"Guardian of the Galaxy\". As someone who've watched him grow from \"Parks and Rec' \" to now, I couldn't be happier for the guy.\n\nIn the end, \"Moneyball\" is really well acted, written and directed film with great production value in sound, editing, and music, its a great film for the genre lovers, as it is for the usual movie joe, it's a must-see. 4/5.",

I want it to mean something.\" - Billy\n\tBaseball is about people, not statistics.\n\t\"There is an epic failure going on in the game to understand what is going on.\" -Peter Brand (Jonah Hill)\n\nThings I liked:\n\tDirector Bennett Miller uses interesting camera angles to help you \"see\" things differently.  He also jumps from the roar of the crowd to complete silence to help you \"feel\" things differently.\n\tWriter Aaron Sorkin is a master at quick-talking deals and clever wit.  Some of the dialogues are simply hysterical.\n\tBrad Pitt gives a stirring performance, even though most of the time he is snacking on something or chewing gum.\n\t   You hear the voice of sports announcers Bob Costas and Tim McCarver. \n\nThings I didn't like:\n\tAt times the flashbacks get jumbled up with the present day and break up the flow of the story.\n\tI hate it when brilliant, visionary protagonists get away with being jerks.  For example, Billy is constantly pushing over desks and throwing chairs in tantrums.\n\tIf you're not a baseball fan, you might be a little bored at first and not understand some of the references to legends and players.  Keep watching.\n\nFunny lines:\n\t \"I'm not going to fire you.\" - Billy\n\"F-You!\" - Grady Fusion (Ken Medlock)\n\"Now I am.\" - Billy\n\t\"Who's Fabio?\" - John Poloni (Jack McGee)\n\t\"That sounds like fortune cookie wisdom to me, Billy.\" - Grady\n\"No, that's just logic.\" - Billy\n\t \"I asked you to do 3 evaluations.

So, play like one tonight.\"\n\t\"Is losing fun?  Then what are you doing having fun?\"\n\nTips for parents:   \n\t2 F-bombs.  Wait, this is PG-13 movie, right?  According to the MPAA, PG-13 movies are only allowed 1 F-bomb, unless a vote earns a two-thirds majority saying it's ok to have more.  Lame.\n\tThere's a scene where a baseball player starts to take his pants down and dances on a table, but you don't see anything.\n\tIt's actually a really safe movie for kids, although they may be a bit bored with all of the talk of statistics and economics of the game.",

Then other teams play in smaller markets and have to watch their best players sign elsewhere for more money than they can offer.  How do you replace those players?  And with what money?  \"Moneyball\" highlights the events after the Oakland Athletics lost the 2001 American League Division Series to the New York Yankees leading up to their loss to the Minnesota Twins in the 2002 Division Series.  \nThe Oakland Athletics lost three great players in Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen to free agency.  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) can't get an increase in his payroll to sign big players.  The scouts are all quite older than Beane, they are trying to replace those players using the same techniques that have failed before when valuing a player.  Beane knows that firsthand.  In a flashback, he was scouted by the New York Mets and touted as a five-tool player.  These scouts say this is a once in a time opportunity and he has to go all out if he wants a shot in Major League Baseball.  His parents seemed skeptical and want him to take his Stanford scholarship.\nOn a trip to Cleveland trying to find a replacement for Damon in a trade, he comes across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a man whose opinion is so valued by the Indians organization that Beane buys his contract.  Brand convinces Beane that players are judged on superficial means and some are undervalued.  He conceives compiling a team of misfit players on a budget by buying runs.  They base their decision almost solely on on-base percentage.\nThis sends shockwaves to the scouts and to the manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  They sign a player who can no longer be a catcher named Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) to be their new first baseman.  They trade for David Justice (Stephen Bishop) for his high on-base percentage and the fact that the New York Yankees will pay half his salary just to get rid of him.\nThe season gets off to a rocky start starting off at 20-26, Beane starts getting upset with the way Howe is using his team.  Howe is putting Carlos Pena in over Hatteberg.  Beane retaliates by trading Pena away forcing Howe to put Hatteberg into the lineup.\nThe team improves over the season and they go on a 20-win streak before ending the season with more wins (103) than the previous season with those star players.  Although the film makes it seem like it's due to these sabermetric ideas, the film never even mentions star shortstop Miguel Tejada and third baseman Eric Chavez, pitchers Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder.  If the season wasn't successful, this never would have been a movie.\nIt's still a great movie that does a great job making a movie about baseball, that isn't about baseball.  It's about how you compete in a game that is almost rigged for the teams with more money.  The film deduces that you always have a winner with money but then shreds that idea by presenting the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics.",

            "content": "While Moneyball might seem like an odd cinematic fit, the dream writing team of Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zailian transform the story of the 2002 Oakland A's into something exciting, emotionally-involving, and surprisingly thoughtful. Though the film (thankfully) doesn't shy away from the nuts and bolts of building a successful baseball team, it's ultimately about more than hits, home runs, trades, and general managers. It's about a man sticking to his convictions. It's also about the fickle nature of legacy, especially in sports. And Sorkin and Zalian, as well as director Bennett Miller, make their points in as entertaining a way as possible, and for that, I give them a tremendous amount of credit. I really was skeptical about Moneyball earlier this year, but as things stand right now, it's among my favorite films of the year.\n\nIn 2001, the Oakland A's took the New York Yankees to the brink of playoff elimination, only to collapse in nearly unparalleled fashion, losing three straight games (two at home) and watching the rest of the playoffs from the sidelines. Though general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) was largely praised for putting together such a strong team on a payroll that's a fraction of Yankees', he'll have his work cut out for him during the off-season, as three of the team's biggest stars are departed for bigger markets and bigger paychecks.\n\nThis gets Beane thinking: Why continue bringing up the league's best prospects only to see them in a Red Sox or Yankees uniform during the peaks of their careers? He decides it's time to rethink the process of building a championship team, and in Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), he finds a mind that's young, smart, and uncorrupted by the old ways of thinking in Major League Baseball. And though there are plenty of growing pains-and a large chorus calling for Beane's head-his and Peter's methods prove quite successful.\n\nFor Moneyball's first two-thirds, it's an engaging character study and fun underdog baseball story. The acting is excellent, the film's pacing is right on, and the direction is energetic. Things take a quick change, however, and the film's coda (which thematically reminded me a lot of another Sorkin screenplay-Charlie Wilson's War) adds several layers of depth to the proceedings. Where I found myself involved throughout the entire film, it was the final thirty minutes that had me enthralled. The pace slows down quite a bit, but the film's message is clearly presented and quite resonant.\n\nMoneyball, however, is nothing without Brad Pitt's exceptional performance. He's in pretty much every scene in the film, and he manages to disappear behind the character of Beane while simultaneously bringing a little of his own personality and swagger. There's a little of Rusty Ryan in Billy Beane, but this character has a great deal more to him. Beane's backstory is developed (perhaps not as much as I would have liked), but we see that he really started on this path at an early age, which helps us understand why he's willing to risk so much.\n\nJonah Hill is a big surprise. One would expect the star of films like Superbad to be full of snark, even in straightforward roles like this. He's not. Instead, he plays things quite earnestly. Peter is a low-key individual and is really meant to help move Billy along. But Hill keeps us invested in him, and though I'm still not sure he would've been my first choice for a role like this, he proves he's got real chops.\n\nThe film's missteps are few and far between. I already mentioned that I thought the Beane flashbacks didn't pay off as much as I would have liked. I also thought Phillip Seymour Hoffman was tragically underused as the A's manager, Art Howe. His character, I also thought, was given the short end of the stick, but all those things are neither here nor there. This is an excellent film and, along with Contagion and Drive from earlier this month, part of one of the strongest September movie lineups I've ever seen. If the rest of the fall plays out this well, we're in for a real treat. If it doesn't, expect Moneyball to be a major Oscar contender, for it's a damn good movie and well-worth the price of admission.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/moneyball-review/",

This is a film that are just as much about economics and numbers and we get some nice characters along with it. Brad Pitt is doing what he does best. Being an overcool and quite cocky guy that's smart and has a lot of heart when you really get to know him. Other actors are doing well and the film is not dragging out at all. The pace is fine and two hours plus works like a charm.\n\nPrety standard at most levels, but the remarkable story of the underdog against the rest are key here. Combine it with Billy Beane's smartness and attitude and you got yourself a winner. I liked it a lot, even if it's never anything really special. \n\n7.5 out of 10 screwballs.",

Brad Pitt remains the weirdest of movie stars - too cool to succumb to his own obvious charms (the camera will never stop loving him, surely), yet nowhere near the depth of acting it would take to move beyond surface impressions. Jonah Hill too offers little more than mumblecore aloofness with no real emotional connection or even a modicum of root for the average shlub everyman that might let audiences cheer for more than abstractions. In that, this is the purest of sport films - what can you do but root for the home team of charming underdogs in all their obscure anonymity?

More bases equals more home runs, but the answer is underappreciated, old, or injured players. As a result, no one has faith in the two men's recruiting selections.

Its not anywhere as funny as the book (Michael Lewis is a fantastic writer), and it does not get in deep into the statistical stuff, but that is largely to its credit. Lewis fawned over Beane's now antiquated stats and a 2002 draft which looked revolutionary but turned out badly. The movie also compressed multiple real people into one fictional amalgamation, form what I've read this was because some didn't want to be depicted on screen. That this movie works at all is impressive, but that it works even better because of all these things is remarkable. The element from the book that is focused on most is the psychological history of Billy Beane, and how that history prompts his new approach to building a team on the cheap. The emphasis on the human drama, the need to fix trajectories in life which have veered off course is explored with real warmth and heft, made more so by the sad fact that Beane cannot control this either, no matter how much he wants to. Baseball is just as prone to frustrating, seemingly absurd sudden turns as anything else in life. This is especially true of the playoffs, a capricious, tiny slice of baseball which is too small a sample for any math to predict, and which is believed absolutely to define the legacy of any player, manager and GM. To this day, The A's under Billy Beane haven't found any success in the post-season.\n\nI'm not a fan of the kind of movies Brad Pitt normally makes, so I'd seen little of him, but he has matured into a hell of an actor. The true surprise is Jonah Hill. I didn't think I would ever like him in a movie after his unpleasant, even loathsome, turns in Superbad and Knocked Up. All is forgiven, all is forgotten. But this is Pitt's movie. I'm guessing the reason this one resonated as much as it did is because of what it says about being a father.  Billy Beane's decision to stay in Oakland proved that none of his psychological baggage mattered to him as much as the well-being of his daughter. The decision to remain surrounded by an ongoing legacy of near-misses, was something that he could control, but it is more than that. In the scenes with his daughter, one can see a depth of pride and love untouched by his competitive drive and history of failure. The personal validation is there already in the mixtape his daughter made: \"You're a loser Dad, just enjoy the show\"",

Right in the heart.  A key line in the film is, \"It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.\"  Being a die-hard baseball fan, it's hard not only to not get romantic about baseball, but it's also hard not to be romantic about stories like this.  While based on a true story, written by Michael Lewis to explain the sabermatic approach that Billy began taking with his previous GM (when he was an assistant), and continued on with Paul, the movie never mentioned the previous GM and began the story of using the sabermatic method after meeting the fictional Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill. The acting is the best I've seen Brad Pitt do.  He was a great fit for this role and I can see why he produced it.  He must have thought the same thing.  I've heard Oscar buzz about it, but I don't see it carrying that far.  He certainly deserves it more than for the Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Jonah Hill plays seemingly the same character he does in every movie, and does it well.  And Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as a generic portrayal of uncooperative manager, Art Howe, a portrayal in the film and book that the real Art Howe has heavily criticized and blames Beane's disregard for him.  Aaron Sorkin brings his skills as a co-writer of the screenplay to dramatize the story very well and make it palatable for non-sports fans, but for those die-hards like me, Moneyball hits all the right places.",

            "content": "The best film of '11 hands down and (aside from 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo') it wasn't even particularly close. My thoughts that this is a masterpiece must be taken with a small grain of salt as I am a baseball fanatic who vividly remembers these events happening in real life, but regardless, it is just an extraordinary film. \n\nAs I said, the fact that I remember all this actually happening (down to the details of the trades, the media coverage and the 20 game win streak) adds a great amount of value. All the names, meetings, transactions and confrontations actually did happen, and the fact that its a 100% true story adds to the films value exponentially. \n\nAside from my attachment as a baseball fan and its historical truths, the film succeeds on every level simply as a film. The acting is top notch all around. Brad Pitt is absolutely on his A game, bringing the real life Billy Beane to life flawlessly. Veterans like Hoffman, Wright, Pratt and Jennings are all excellent in supporting roles, but surprisingly, it is Hill who steals the show as Peter Brand, the man who was actually the brains behind the Moneyball philosophy. \n\nThe script is spectacular, sticking very close to the book from which it is based. It creates multi-layered characters who just pop off of the screen. The direction is terrific, splicing real game footage with reenactments which are pulled off flawlessly. Its overall execution, cinematography, scoring and story flow are just great.\n\nAnother thing that helps this movie greatly is that it isn't one of those typical 'feel good' sports movies. Its actually kind of bleak and does not leave you on a high note, which I respect alot in a genre known for happy endings. It has a very 'The Social Network' sort of feel to it. Kind of brooding and introverted. That isn't to say that its dark by any sense because its actually very funny, but it is seriously taken, and a serious film at its core.\n\nThe only negative I can think of isn't a gripe with the movie, but rather its timing as far as where the A's are at right now, and its contributions to building of a false legacy. The fact of the matter is that Moneyball doesn't work. There's a reason the A's won in 2002 and 03, and it wasn't because of sabremetrics, it was because of something called 'The Big 3'; three ace caliber starting pitchers Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito who were flat out untouchable during their years with Oakland in the early 2000's, including Barry Zito's Cy Young award winning '03. This movie (like the book) hardly mentions them despite their being the actual backbone of the A's winning ways rather than the Moneyball formula. The A's have been to the playoffs once since '03, and at this current time are the laughing stock of baseball and appear to be headed out of Oakland. Looking back on it, a baseball team can simply not be built on these numbers. All of Beane's detractors in the film are completely and unequivocally correct when looking at the whole story, which really dampens the overall message of the film.\n\nOf course these gripes have nothing to do with the film itself which is brilliant and more than rightfully deserving of its 'Best Picture' nomination. While being a baseball fan will most certainly help, it is by no means a qualification you'll need to enjoy this terrific film. Perhaps the greatest baseball movie of all time, and I don't say that lightly.",

            "content": "Have to say, I really liked this film! Initially I thought this wouldn't interest me since I'm not a baseball fan, but the movie is so well made you don't have to love baseball to appreciate it. The actors make you care about it, the cinematic camera pans of the grass and the stadiums are done with such care and reverence, it's hard not to get caught up in the romance of the sport. It reminded me a bit of The Wrestler from a few years back and how that affected a lot of people who didn't really care for wrestling. In a sense, the movie is not really about baseball, it's about rising above and not following the status quo, even when you put yourself at great risk doing so.\n\nIt was surprisingly very funny and true to the sport. Easily the best role I've seen Jonah Hill in (and yes, better than he was in The Wolf of Wallstreet). He's really solid in his supporting role and almost steals it from Brad. This movie has the best musical score I've heard from 2011 (or at least I can't remember a film that tops it); it's really effective in driving home some of the important parts of the film. And I found it pleasantly ironic that film called Moneyball ends up concluding on the fact that life isn't always about money.\n\nI thought Brad Pitt was strong in this film. It was a very subtle performance, but I think he nailed it. As I watched the movie, I really believed he was a beleaguered manager, frustrated with his team's inability to complete with the big market teams; I really can't say that about a lot of his roles. For once, I actually believed he was this character; I believed he was Billy Beane. His performance might not have been Oscar worthy (as he didn't win and I agree with that), but it was strong nonetheless.\n\nOne of the more memorable moments of the film is at the end when Billy Beane asks \"How can you not feel romantic about baseball?\". After seeing this movie I have to admit, I kind of do.\n\nDon't miss this one!",

I know if I was an A's fan, I'd feel pretty shortchanged about that ending.\n\nPitt and Hill do an excellent job in this movie, but the stoic and subdued performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman is actually the most memorable. There was a resignation in his performance that spoke volumes without any change in the tone of voice. It showed how heart had been substituted by cold logic, and the heartlessness displayed throughout the entire movie made it disconcerting as players and games became nothing more than numbers and commodities to be traded like so many grade school lunches. By distilling the game to a sequence of stats and numbers, the joy of the game disappeared, which made the lone game featured that much more powerful.",

There's plenty of number-crunching and analysis thrown our way, but this is more than just a film about stats.

            "content": "I'll be honest guys, I don't like baseball whatsoever. I've never really been able to get into the sport, playing or watching, but there are a few baseball-related films among other sports movies that have actually made me go, \"You know what, baseball is actually a little cooler than I thought\". My favorite of them all is Bennett Miller's biographical sports drama MONEYBALL (2011), in which both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill (first dramatic role) stars. The film is also my most favorite Brad Pitt movie of all time as well. Based on the nonfiction book of the same title (written by Michael Lewis), Moneyball recounts the 2002 season of the Oakland A's-at a time when they absolutely sucked-and how general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) and assistant GM Peter Brand (Hill) used sabermetrics to scout and analyze players. The A's barely had a budget which is why they had to use this unconventional approach (at the time at least) anyway-nonetheless the A's ended up having a 20-consecutive-game winning streak, an American League record. Alongside Beane and Brand's exploits, the film also chronicles Beane's relationship with his daughter and ex-wife (Robin Wright), though that is a minor part of the movie. The film also stars Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) and Star Lord aka Andy Dwyer aka Chris Pratt.\n\nThis movie is stunning-without a doubt one of my top 3 movies of 2011 and I'm surprised that it hadn't won more awards for Pitt, Miller, and Hill. Bennett Miller always brings out the best in his actors. I feel like whenever he makes a movie, the actors starring will get some major award recognition, which is great because it shows just how great of a director he is. And he is not afraid to go with some unordinary choices, such as Hill as Brand or Channing Tatum and Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher (which is set to open THIS WEEK). Surprisingly enough he's only done four movies in total (including Foxcatcher), and I've only seen two. But just from those I'm amazed at how great of a job he did with tone, performances, and pacing. He's a guy that's here to stay in the industry for years to come and I have been a fan of his ever since I saw Moneyball.\n\nObviously the performances are fucking SPECTACULAR. Especially Jonah Hill. The same Jonah Hill who played the funny fat guy in Superbad and Knocked Up. He completely shows another side of himself in this movie, and I honestly would rather see him do more dramatic roles than comedies. Now don't get me wrong, I do not want him to quit acting in comedies, but Hill excels in drama so well and it was such a surprise in the first place. As Brand he is intelligent, yet inexperienced, and overall his development throughout the film is interesting: he starts as a Yale graduate with \"radical\" ideas of picking players, and later starts as a protégé to Beane; by the end of the film, not only had he become Beane's only friend, but Brand was also more competitive. Of course, overall this is Brad Pitt's movie. He steals every single scene in the film (except a few that he shares with Hill) and his portrayal of Billy Beane was astounding. Jean Dujardin won the Oscar for Best Actor that year but I feel like it should have gone to Pitt. Not only is this my most favorite movie of his, but also my most favorite performance. There was never a moment that I saw Brad Pitt-I only saw Billy Beane throughout the entire film. His scenes with his daughter were also magnificent and though the family scenes were a little unnecessary, it was nice to see the more personal side of Beane-him as father rather than a coach. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is awesome as always as Art Howe, the manager for the A's. It is simply so tragic that an actor of such a high caliber had to have passed away, especially at a fairly young age. Chris Pratt stars as one of the baseball players that Beane and Brand recruit using sabermetrics, and I would say that he was fine. Nothing horrible, but he wasn't that prominent throughout the movie anyway.\n\nNow we come down to this incredible screenplay, one of the writers being AARON SORKIN. I don't know how that guy does it, every single one his scripts are fantastic: The Social Network, A Few Good Men, The Newsroom (he's written a script for a NEW Steve Jobs biopic; we can ignore that Ashton Kutcher one). He's always so precise with the dialogue, and though he co-wrote it with Steve Zaillian (Schindler's List, Gangs of New York) there are a lot of his trademarks in the script. One of my favorite lines ever is when Billy Bean is talking to his scouts and he says: \"The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams and there are poor teams. Then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there's us.\" I surprisingly quote this often, but for some reason I always say \"twenty\" instead of \"fifty\". And there are so many more quotable lines than this one in Moneyball too. It's a remarkable story overall and although I haven't read Lewis' book, I definitely think they did a good job adapting it to the big screen. Technical aspects are also top notch-this was nominated for Best Sound Mixing of all things too.\n\nOverall, I LOVE MONEYBALL! This movie in general is special in my life because it actually had me interested in baseball for some time (no offense to baseball fans though). But as I said earlier I thought some of the family scenes were a little unnecessary to the film. However, Moneyball also made me realize that Jonah Hill was not a one note comedic actor. He brought personality and layers to the role of Peter Brand and his debut in a full-on dramatic role was extremely successful. Although Hill is revelation, Pitt is the one that steals the movie and probably should have won that Best Actor Oscar. He wasn't fighting zombies or trying to kill Kevin Spacey; Pitt WAS Billy Beane. The character was so distinct and complex compared to several of Pitt's other performances (perhaps not as complex as Tyler Durden though). And that ending... Whoa. For one thing, I can't believe Beane had done what he did, and later: that final scene was a perfect way to end the movie in my opinion. Brad Pitt is not just Angelina Jolie's husband, he's not just the pretty boy-Moneyball shows that he is definitely one of the best of his generation of actors. I highly recommend watching this magnificent film, especially if you are a fan of sports movies or Pitt - 9.6/10",

He was rather good at baseball. He was about to enter a collage but some sports agents (scouts) urged him to become a pro baseball player. He could not resist the temptation and preferred sports to collage. But he did not manage to become a top player, as the story shows us he could not overcome his fear and uncertainty and consequently did not make a brilliant career. Finally he became a scout, and at the beginning of \"Moneyball\" he is general manager of Oakland Athletics. As Billy puts it there are top teams, there are ordinary teams and then there is \"Athletics\" club. As you can guess, \"Oakland A's\" has almost no chances to win. Any prospective players who appear in the team are in no time bought by other, more well-off clubs. So Oakland Athletics has to work with the players the team can afford financially. At the same time Billy does not like the present situation, but what can he do?\nRead more\nhttp://www.viewforum.net/movie-stunned-me-150/moneyball-2011-a-2914/#post5390",

I had heard many good things about it over the last few years from reviews to friends viewing and enjoying it.  I wish I had taken the plunge sooner as it is brilliant.  Now, being from the UK it may not have the same kind of feel that it would to someone from the US.  It is not one of our major sports like it is across the pond.  I however, have followed baseball for years, and been  lucky enough to go to a few games when I have been in America to.  The point I am trying to make is that some people may avoid this film because they think that they won't understand it.  You would be foolish to not try it.  It is a heartfelt story regarding the Oakland A's through a turbulent time of finance issues and change.  The story pulls you in the whole time whether you know what RBI's are or not.  Brad Pitt is fantastic as Billy Beane, the GM who is not afraid to put his neck on the line and try something for the good of the team.  he doesn't care who he upsets or who disagrees with him as he pushes to stay the course for the greater good of the team.  Jonah Hill plays his assistant in the film and is brilliant in his supporting role.  He helps bring the comedy aspect along with him as he tries to make you believe with him that all of these stats that they are using to try and build the best team they can on their budget will work.  It will make you laugh at points and also make you really root for them as you want all of the time, effort, and support that's gone into building it to actually work.  Overall, even if you are not a fan of baseball you should give this a punt as you will not be disappointed.",
