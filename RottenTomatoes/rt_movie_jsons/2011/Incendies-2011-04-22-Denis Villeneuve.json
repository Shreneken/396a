Jeanne (M√©lissa D√©sormeaux-Poulin) is to deliver hers to the father the twins never knew, and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) is to give his to the brother they never knew they had. The siblings travel to the Middle East separately, where they each experience acts of brutality, uncover a startling family history, and have revelations about themselves.",

And to make matters worse, the entire plot is based on a (in my mind) false premise, that a loving mother would knowingly ruin the lives of two of her children. \nAs I watched I could feel the writers slapping each others backs as they elicited oohs and ahhs from the audience via the films twists and turns, and to be fair, I was oohing and ahhing like a perfect little doll as all my strings were pulled... but in the end I felt cheated (and a little dirty) because I had been led on this jouney under false pretences via a plot that relied on coincidence after coincidence and finally, a decision by one of the main characters that I just cannot believe she would make.\nThere's something about the basic premise of this movie being used as film fiction that felt a little sick to me, and I'm not against tough films, Come and See and Quo Vadis Aida are two of my favourite films, but this one just felt like misery porn.",

As a stipulation in their mother's will, a brother and sister must deliver sealed letters to a father who they thought was deceased and a brother they didn't know existed, setting off an unimaginable journey of self-discovery.  The film alternates between past and present, leading to a climax that is unforgettable.  Featuring strong performances, a labyrinthine plot, and beautiful cinematography that showcases the arid landscape where most of the story is set, it's a remarkable commentary of how social injustice, armed conflict, and twisted ideologies shape our lives for generations.",

It has a lot to say about the horrors of war-ridden regions and trauma that comes with it; how it affects entire generations in an endless cycle of violence, anger and hatred until someone tries to break it. It's harrowing in many ways, even if the melodramatic way it presents its ideas doesn't quite mesh with the realism it seems to be shooting for.",

Where it is so powerful is the shocking elements that take place from start to finish, whether it is showing them or implying that they happened in a way which shocks you as if you were experiencing it all yourself.\n\nThe main plot is focused around discovering family secrets, however Villeneuve leads that story through the Middle East which along the way opens up for more powerful and shocking stories, not to mention that he captures some beautiful scenery to add to the overall quality.\n\nLike many great films do, Incendies (2010) pays off what can be quite a slow paced and confusing film at times with an absolutely shocking and heart breaking final twist, which will leave your jaw on the floor, making the 130 minute runtime worth it.",

It is raw like the worst lives and unpredictable like the worst wars. It is a couple of simultaneous trips in different times that show us the worst atrocities committed in war conflicts and their consequences. It is an explicit and unspoken story at the same time.\n\nGreat directing work, excellent editing and photography.\n\nRecommended only for people with trained criteria.",

Throughout the runtime, the plot switched back and forth between the past of the mother and the present where the twins tried to learn about their mother. The flashbacks had some brutal scenes. Denis Villenueve, with the great direction of cinematography, showed the harshness and devastation of the land because of the civil war. The raw and a bit low in quality camera enhanced this harsh atmosphere even more. One of the harshest scenes was the one with the bus. There was no need for any background music to see how unforgiving and brutal the scene and the movie as a whole was. \n\nI would be lying when I said that I was hooked through the whole movie. It was slow and took time to have the characters explored their mother's past. It was a bit dragged for me. \n\nWhen the twist hit, I initially refused to believe what I had in mind. It couldn't be like Oldboy, right? Gosh I fell into silence as the rest of the movie panned out. \n\nOverall, a great movie with an intriguing and unexpectedly brutal plot. 8.5/10",

In fact, he respects the whole system, even the hefty hectic part of the film. If his film ticks for more than two hours, he definitely has edited at least half an hour from it. He isn't ashamed, afraid or lazy on going deep in to the tunnels and get his hands dirty. He foliates the darker side of the human as a compelling arc for the storytelling. Take the imprisoned part of Nawal's (Lubna Azabal) life, even something so informative and dry part of the script as such, Denis Villeneuve, the director, has crafted out a nail biting drama where the emotion is installed in it by introducing a song in it.\n\nNow, this song isn't something he just throws out randomly, he first teases us by formulating a title to that very act as \"The Woman Who Sings\", so incredible is that name, that every time it is referenced for advancing the storyline, there is a pathos in its vocab that he armors in for this long, long battle. There are plenty of scenarios in the film and often the filmmaker loses the tone of the film and there is an uneven pace that itches the viewers, but Villeneuve's experience is mostly the saviour of it.\n\nWhile the rest of it, is left upon the actors like Lubna and Melissa, where despite of going back and forth in timeline there is an equal force resisting the dogmatic postulates of the world. There is a poetic bridge connecting these parallel worlds and the answer is the performance so magnificent that it deconstructs all the semantics of the script. Incendies is the fire that will not spark the charge but will burn the whole forest down unapologetically.",

I feel like it was less than an hour in when I articulated what I thought might be the big reveal at the end because it was similar to something from another film. As the movie progressed it only reinforced what I had already assumed. But Incendies takes a long time to get there, and it is extremely slow moving. I tend to have this problem with many of Denis Villeneuve‚Äôs movies, while they are beautiful in the visuals and contain thought-provoking stories, they lack proper pacing. Incendies felt like it could almost be a short film, considering how simple the story was at the heart of it all. Another problem I had with Incendies was how they jumped from present day to flashback without warning. Every time it made that transition, it would take me a few moments to adjust and figure out where I was in the story. It doesn‚Äôt help that the two female stars have a lot of similar features so I kept getting them confused. That being said the acting was excellent in Incendies. I was impressed with the way they handled all the complex emotions that would come from the life-altering facts that are revealed in the end. I wasn‚Äôt quite bored by Incendies, but because I know what is coming and it drags in pace, I can‚Äôt imagine watching it again. I still recognize that it is a well-made film, and I bet if you didn‚Äôt see the end coming in advance that would be a powerful reveal. Sadly, it lacked that power for me.

Written and directed to perfection by Denis Villeneuve, the film slowly unfolds its secrets and gives you subtle, emotional jabs at every corner, and when you find out the big reveal toward the end, you'll find yourself being completely devastated. It's powerfully acted, beautifully shot, and the story is never less compelling. However, despite all the great things in the film, I can't imagine myself watching this film again anytime soon. I have to say while it is powerful and gut-wrenching on many levels, the big reveal about who the main characters' father and brother, I thought, were uber contrived and it slightly tips into the more melodramatic territory. It is not an easy film to sit through, but if you are a fan of mystery films with a twist of Greek tragedy, then I think you will absolutely love \"Incendies\". It is a brilliant piece of work.",

Like much of Villeneuve's later work, I ended up enthralled halfway into it and shocked by the riveting climax that took me almost entirely by surprise, as did most of the violence in this fantastic film.

            "content": "Incendies (meaning \"destruction by fire\") was Canada's representative in last year's Best Foreign Language Film race at the Oscars, and it's an absolute punch to the gut. The film is all story and plot-there's no clear, obvious message coming from writer/director Denis Villeneuve. But the film doesn't need one, for it more then gets by with its compelling characters, strong and unusual structure, and a few truly moving moments.\n\nTold in a jumbled (but sensical) manner, the film follows a pair of twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette), who just lost their mother, Nawal (Lubna Azabal). Upon her death, they are each given a letter. Jeanne's is to be delivered to their father-whom they believed to be dead their whole lives. Simon's belongs to a brother neither knew they had. Simon wants to open the letters and put this situation behind them. Jeanne, however, heads to her mother's village in Lebanon and begins asking some questions.\n\nThe story of the twins is intercut with Nawal's. We meet her just as her boyfriend is murdered by religious extremists. We then find out she's carrying his child, and she's shamed, presumably both for the act of pre-marital sex and the fact that it was with someone with different religious beliefs. She gives up their baby for adoption, a decision she regrets almost immediately, and she spends most of the next few years trying to track him down. This leads her down a dangerous path, ultimately leading to a 13-year prison sentence, where she's tortured horribly but fights back with music. \"The Woman Who Sings\" becomes her monicker, one that's equally loved and detested by those in her country, and one that could ultimately hold the key to Jeanne and Simon learning what they need to know about their family's history.\n\nThe way Incendies is constructed turns what would ordinarily have been straight drama into a mystery. I know some reviewers faulted this, calling the film manipulative. And I suppose it is. I took some issue with the resolution, which feels a bit much, but for most of the film, I was fully engaged, and I credit the mixed-up chronology for that.\n\nTwo out of three ain't bad as far as great performances go, right? Lubna Azabal (as Nawal) and Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin (as Jeanne) are terrific. Hard to single either out as better than the other, but I'd argue the latter does a little more with less to work with. Unfortunately, I didn't think Maxim Gaudette (as Simon) measured up to the high bar set by his castmates. He has even less to do than Desormeaux-Poulin, but he's just not convincing. In one key scene late in the film, he goes totally emotionless. I didn't get it, and it wasn't the only time I took issue with a decision of his.\n\nIncendies isn't a political film, but it definitely condemns war and religious extremism. It also speaks toward the everlasting power of love. But all of that is secondary to top-notch storytelling. That's Incendies-plain and simple. If that's not your thing, it'll be a long two-plus hours. Otherwise, you'll likely eat it up the same way I did.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/incendies-review/",

            "content": "Our Daily Free Stream: Dennis Villeneuve - Incendies (engl. subt.). Dennis Villeneuve hat mit Sicario schon wieder den Film der Saison gemacht! Sicario verst√∂rt und wirft Fragen auf, die unm√∂glich in 90 Film-Minuten gel√∂st werden k√∂nnen. Genauso wirkte sein Rache Thriller Prisoners nach und genauso schockierte Incendies, den der Kanadier noch in franz√∂sisch inszenierte: Nawal Marwan ist vor 20 Jahren aus einem Land geflohen, dass Libanon sein k√∂nnte. Sie lebt gemeinsam mit ihren Zwillingen Jeanne und Simon in Montreal. Als sie stirbt, hinterl√§sst sie zwei Briefe, die Jeanne und Simon auffordern, ihren Vater und ihren Bruder zu suchen. Beide meinten, ihr Vater sei tot und ahnten nichts von einem Bruder. Simon bleibt skeptisch. Jeanne erf√§hrt, dass Nawal 15 Jahre lang eingesperrt und im Gef√§ngnis von ihrem Folterer geschw√§ngert worden war. Das ist der Plot f√ºr Denis Villeneuves Thriller, der viel mehr sein will als nur das: Der Film demonstriert, wie sinnlos es ist, andere aufgrund ihrer Religion zu hassen. Religion wurde von den meisten Menschen nicht ausgesucht, sie ist angeboren und in Incendies stellt der Unfall einer Geburt keinen Grund f√ºr Hass dar. Zu dieser Erkenntnis gelangt Nawal (Lubna Azabal) in den Briefen f√ºr ihre Kinder. In R√ºckblicken erfahren wir, dass sie sich als Christin in einen Moslem verliebte, ein Ding der Unm√∂glichkeit. Nawal aber begab sich auf eine romantische, religi√∂se Reise, auf der sie das Undenkbare probierte. Undenkbares geschieht auch um sie herum, da Menschen, die nicht zu M√∂rdern geboren wurden, im Namen ihrer Religion t√∂ten. Dem Tod aber folgt nicht Gott, sondern Rache. Villeneuve zeigt bewaffnete Kinder, bereit zum T√∂ten, in dem Moment, da sie alt genug sind, das Gift der Rache zu verstehen. Der Film basiert auf dem St√ºck von Wajdi Mouawad, das getragen wird von poetischen Monologen. Der Film gestaltet die Vorlage um, f√ºgt Action hinzu und macht die Dinge sichtbar. Im Grunde ist es der Plot f√ºr einen klassischen Film Noir, in dem traurige M√§nner die Rechtfertigung f√ºr ihre Rache suchen. Der Kontext, dass Incendies im Nahen Osten spielt, begr√ºndet knapp und erbarmungsslos Folter und Vergewaltigung. In kryptischen Dialogen offenbart Villeneuves Film schliesslich sein schreckliches Geheimnis. Das Ende des Films (das hier nicht verraten wird!) wirkt auf mich wie ein Aufprall. Es mag nicht logisch sein, doch das ist irrelevant angesichts des gewaltigen Pathos! Warum aber hat Nawal die Briefe an ihre Kinder geschrieben? Welchen Zweck verfolgen sie? Sicher, Jeanne und Simon sollten die Wahrheit erfahren, doch die h√§tte Nawal ihnen zu Lebzeiten sagen k√∂nnen. So schickt sie ihre Kinder auf eine Mission, die leicht als Akt der Rache begriffen werden k√∂nnte. Villeneuve benutzt MacGuffins und erkl√§rt so die Motivation - letztlich setzt er die Handlung dadurch in Gang. Etwas entt√§uscht? Doch das ist unn√∂tig angesichts dieses schockierenden Meisterwerks! mehr auf cinegeek.de http://cinegeek.de/incendies-rating-90-omeu-dvd4286",

After an opening which Kubrick would be proud of, he fills the screen with shot after beautiful shot which manage to capture both the harshness of the surroundings and the inner feelings of the character. He moves easily between the dreary suburbia of Canada and the unforgiving wilderness of an unnamed Middle-Eastern country in the throes of religious and political turmoil. The savage war serves as a background for Villeneuve's equally savage story of a young woman's journey from a headstrong and impulsive girl to a strong, resilient woman who stays in the minds of even the most vicous war criminals. Villeneuve is unafraid to dwell on the bursts of violence which are inherit in the setting of the film but they are never gratuitous or glorified, making it that much more sickening when they occur. He shows himself to be an extremely diverse director too, handling the drama as adeptly as he does the violence, capturing what's not being said with the subtletly and deftness of touch of someone with a rap sheet twice the length of his own.¬†\n\nThe script is fittingly restrained. No explanations or putting on of the brakes for the unlucky viewer who falls behind, no sir. And with a narrative structure which makes Pulp Fiction look like a children's book, it's very easy to lose track of both time and character. We skip back and forth, seemingly at random, from the ongoing search and Nawal's turbulent past, but in the film's powerful finale it's as if you can almost see all the threads being pulled together. It's not as pretentious a trick as The Prestige, nor as bamboozling as The Usual Suspects, but it's as hard hitting as a sledgehammer to the stomach.¬†\n\nAnchoring this entire labyrinth are the wonderful performances, particularly on behalf of Lubna Azabal. With an incredibly restrained yet distressingly realistic performance, Azabal invests her character with nuance and intricacy. The character may not look like much chop on paper, but the life and reality which Azabal fills her with is simply astounding to see. Most fascinating to see is the distinction between her character in the past and her character in the future. The huge differences between the two sides of the coin makes the journey in between fascinating and Azabal executes it perfectly. Her character's children also pull their weight in the film, Gaudette's Simon is a powerhouse of angst where Poulin's Jeanne is his polar opposite: cool, calm and collected in any situation. And when the final revelation hits home to these two characters, their shock and despair is palpable without feeling like a soap opera. The two share a beautiful moment in the swimming pool where they confront their feeling and share their unbearable grief with a single embrace. The supporting cast may not have all that much to do, focussing mainly on the three at the centre of the film, but Elaaziz is as terrifying as his character would demand and Remy Girard makes a solid notary as Jean Lebel.¬†\n\nBut apart from Azabal's incredible performance, the star of the show is the beautiful style employed by everyone involved. The difficult and intimidating structure of the narrative is fantastically original and groundbreaking, investing more trust than usually expected in its audience, the film looks beautiful in every scene and the sprawling storyline is able to make its mark on various themes from politics to family to life itself. It may not be for everybody but it's definitely for this guy. I'm sitting here with my thumbs pointing at my face by the way. This guy!¬†\n\nDefining Scene:¬†\nNawal Marwan takes a bus through the country and doesn't quite reach her destination.",

Meanwhile, flashbacks tell the story of their mothers trauma, radicalism, criminal activity and imprisonment whilst still living in the Middle East.\n\nThe mostly French and Lebanese cast members all put in a remarkable amount of emotion into this film, adding weight to some of the darker moments of this terrible story.

Once you think you've got it all figured out, the film slams you with a sledge-hammer. It's great filmmaking.\n\nThe language barrier may be a stumbling block to some viewers, but those willing to read subtitles will be rewarded with a great film.

            "content": "Incendies belongs to that rare breed of films that induce a tumultuous surge of emotions in its spectators while engaging them through the narrative. Jerry Seinfeld once said in his show Seinfeld, to add to the humor of that show undoubtedly, that Leo Tolstoy wanted to name his novel 'War: What Is It Good For' instead of \"War and Peace\". Maybe that rhetorical question of a book title would have been an apt tagline for what was portrayed in this film. \n\nWhat sets Dennis Villeneuve's 'Incendies' apart from other films with post-war trauma as their underlying theme, is the spectrum of human relationship he constructed on the screen. The film starts with twin brother and sister, Jeanne and Simon, receiving their recently deceased mother, Nawal's funeral wishes; wishes that need to be fulfilled, before the children can proceed with the burial. In two different letters, the twins were asked to locate their father and half-brother, who we would later find was called Nihad.  With initial reluctance and refusal from her foreboding brother, Jeanne finally set upon the journey that would uncover the truth through several different realisations, taking the audience with it. \n\nIn Incendies, Villeneuve never loses the grip that he gets to hold from the very first few minutes. The narrative had the mother and daughter tracing the same path in a Middle-Eastern country, only with different perspectives and scenarios. The civil war, that was shown here to have its inflictions on the protagonists, can be compared with the Lebanese Civil War. The places that had horrific memories for the mother are visited by the daughter. Thus, blending the two timelines in the narrative, a sense of d√©j√† vu is channeled in the film. At one point, viewers along with Jeanne would be forced to ponder whether being oblivious to the truth was a blessing or not. \n\nIf the screenplay is the heart of the film, then the oxygen was provided by the cast to keep it pumping. Lubina Azabal's Nawal Marwan is tremendous feat in acting. It was important for her performance to be in accordance with the story, with she being the protagonist in this tempestuous journey of a film. M√©lissa D√©sormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne, was not far behind either. Apart from these stand-out performances, the film is bolstered with performances from the rest of the cast akin to that of a neo-realist film. \n\nIncendies is as intense and brutal as one can get. Nothing hits harder than the truth that comes out of nowhere and you do not want to hear. Incendies is quite an achievement at that. It becomes incessantly difficult to revisit the first scene where Nihad, a child, would leave you with self-judgment and introspection.  Radiohead's \"You and Whose Army\" adds to the cause.",

It plays like a modern Greek tragedy, tragedy being very much present throughout the sections set in the Middle-East. In the end it is just a little too much like a play (indeed it was adapted from one) to pack quite the same punch as a true story, but it's still an arresting, well-made drama.",

It hides in this premise but in the end it just gets sicker and sicker. And I thought old boy was the sickest film of all.  True enough it's a marvelous story but then again you have to wonder, how did it come up with that silly ending. If it was a bio-epic, I'd be amazed by the turn of events. But given that it's fiction, man it takes a wild chance to make this story realistic. Award winning maybe but I still find that ending illogical.",
