Once he finds Kyung-chul, things get twisted. After brutally beating the murderer, Kim lets him go free, and a demented game of cat and mouse begins.",

            "content": "Seeking revenge leads to an annihilation of feelings.\n\nKim Jee-woon's South Korean psychological horror thriller I Saw the Devil (2010) is brutal beyond belief. The blood, gore, and torture makes this closer to a snuff film than any regular thriller like its clear inspirations of The Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. I saw Kim Jee-woon's hilarious action-comedy The Good, The Bad, and The Weird (2008) and I Saw the Devil destroys that level of bloody violence and bodily harm. I must warn viewers that I Saw the Devil features numerous murders of the most shocking nature. If you get easily disturbed or upset, this is not for you. For everyone else, I hope you find I Saw the Devil as compelling and entertaining as I did.\n\nKim Jee-woon's direction is so visceral in his violence and unrelenting in his depiction of heinous crimes that you may look away from these horrible crimes being committed on screen. His direction never shies away from atrocity or pain, so I was simply enthralled the entire time. Cinematographer Lee Mo-gae captures all the intimate struggles of violence being inflicted as well as the stunning environments in these ethereal wide shots. His few close-ups find just the right angle to let you see every emotion on someone's face. I Saw the Devil is so well shot.\n\nKim Jee-woon's style is similar to Park Chan-wook's for his beautiful and poignant Vengeance Trilogy of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, but with less humanity and empathy. Writers Kim Jee-woon and Park Hoon-jung craft an intricate tale of revenge, sleekly going from murder to torture and into an unreal chase you will not believe where it ends up. Their dialogue revels in the sadism of murder as much as it makes you feel revolted for having witnessed these crimes. I Saw the Devil proves that seeking revenge against those that have hurt you will only leave you hollow. It is a phenomenal picture that will stay with me forever.\n\nLee Byung-hun (The Good, The Bad, and The Weird, Squid Game) is outstanding in his greatest lead acting role as secret agent Kim Soo-hyeon. His performance is captivating as you witness him experience profound loss at hearing his fiance has been killed in an unthinkable way. As well as, seeing his grief compound into a poignant and moving realization that his love is gone and he's lost his humanity in seeking out his wife's killer in order to slowly torture the man. Byung-hun lets you into his deepest feelings with his hurt expressions of grief, guilt, uncertainty, rage, and anguish every second he's on screen. I Saw the Devil is as much about Lee Byung-hun's portrayal of coping with loss as it is a testament to the futility in seeking vengeance.\n\nChoi Min-sik (Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) is relentless with his insane serial killer villain Jang Kyung-chul. His sadistic pleasure in torturing, raping, and murdering innocent women, men, and children is disgusting to behold. Choi Min-sik is truly gifted as portraying ruthless sociopaths with ease. He delivers one of cinema's most despicable antagonists with his jeering insults, cold killings, and hateful personality. Choi Min-sik is simply sublime in his delight at killing all in his path.\n\nJeon Kuk-hwan is touching as the grieving father of one of Kyung-chul's murder victims and a former Police Chief named Jang. He is subtle in his pain, yet feels completely authentic. South Korean actresses Oh San-ha and Kim Yoo-seo are wonderful in I Saw the Devil. You feel such devastating empathy for how scared they feel. They are as realistic and moving as anyone in I Saw the Devil.\n\nEditors Nam Na-young and Kim Mi-young tastefully cut around the brutality for 142 minutes, giving the scenes a brisk pace. You never linger too long in one place, unless there's a murder taking place or a heartfelt conversation occurring. Jo Hwa-seong's production design creates grimey homes as bases of operation for murdering victims as well as gentle homes for residing. Art directors Kim Byung-han and Son Min-jeong paint a vivid picture with imagery of blood red bodies getting dragged in white snow to chains binding a victim to their torturous fate in squalid areas. Set decorator Kim Cho-hea places butcher knives of all manners in every room for an eerie atmosphere everywhere.\n\nVisual effects artist Jung Sung-jin creates these realistic blood and gore with dismembered heads and limbs like you cannot imagine. Composer Mowg wrote all these wondrous themes for I Saw the Devil that will take you away to an ideal reprieve in your mind as you witness murder after murder. I adored Mowg's music throughout I Saw the Devil with a variety of sounds and genres present for all the slaughter. Kwon Yoo-jin's costumes are classically fitted and stylish with a realistic modern approach. I am amazed at all the cuts and wound make-up from artists Kwak Tae-Yong, Lee Hee-eun, and Kim Hyun-jung.\n\nIn the end, I Saw the Devil is a must see film if you can handle the bloody revenge ever present on screen.",

Outside of the first meeting of the protagonist and antagonist, not much happens to progress the story. The second half of this film, when the stakes are raised, is a lot more exciting and intriguing. The cinematography and music is the opposite, being more prominent and impressive in the first half. I enjoyed the film and found it gripping toward the end, but much of the first half of this movie could have been cut to make it a more palatable experience. There was no action that I hadn't seen before, but how the story plays out and the perspective of it make this a unique film. This is a self-indulgent revenge movie in the horror-thriller genre that will leave you digesting a memorable battle of psychological wit and its consequences.",

I Saw The Devil is the most sadistic game of cat-and-mouse you'll ever watch. In the beginning it seems like a typical revenge film, almost disappointingly so, but as both men try to one-up each other, the blood spatter soon stains every wall in sight. Jee-woon crafts a multitude of deliciously suspenseful scenes that earn quite a few good jump-scares. The film's ethereal lighting and close quarters framing make for some phenomenal visuals throughout. The action is tightly edited and the extreme gore is wickedly effective in channeling the viscous story oozing out of the screen. Lee Byung-hun's steely investigator matches perfectly to Choi Min-sik's droll killer. The core of the film lies in the interplay of these to characters. As we watch there psychotic dual, we soon realize that after a certain point neither of them will win. They have both lost. There are a few times when we feel something for each of them. The only way I could describe it is pity. Not for the horrible things each of them are going through, but pitying them for being so far lost from what a person should be capable of before stopping themselves. —————Overall: I Saw the Devil takes the usual revenge film and injects it with some brutal new twists to make a bloody thriller that is often hard to forget. ————–Highlight: The ending may seem like it was ripped-off(no pun intended) from one of the Saw movies, but with this new context it is a perfectly disturbing ending for a film such as this.",

This film has fantastic performances across the board, from the minor characters to the leads, you can tell that the director invested a lot towards the cast and it pays off, but what stands out the most here is the depiction of a psychopath, Choi Min-Sik who plays the antagonist performs flawlessly as he dives in his diabolical persona, this by far one of the best showcases of a psychopath in recent years.\n\nThis film left me in a state of awe.

Of course, Choi Min-sik is amazingly convincing in his role, as are the rest the cast, all of whom the film owes a huge debt because it really is the actors and characters here that keep you glued to the screen. As far as the story goes, it starts out well and ends with a realistic message about hatred and violence, but at a running time of almost 2 and a half hours, a very large portion of the time in-between consists of little else other than scene after scene of graphic violence; after a while, it can start to feel a little over-the-top and repetitive.

It is not a film for the faint of heart and I consider it to be one of the most violent and disturbing films I've ever seen. The plot involves a man seeking revenge against the serial killer who brutally murdered his pregnant fiance, eventually catching the murderer and playing a twisted game of cat and mouse - he tortures him and then releases him, finds him again and tortures him some more (Like a scene where he slices his Achilles heel with a scalpel). But the killer is rather cunning, too, and soon catches on to how he's being pursued. It's an interesting film that brings new light on the true nature of revenge. Whereas with other films, revenge is celebrated and we as the viewer cheer as the bad guy gets their comeuppance (The more violent the better), I Saw the Devil portrays the true nature of revenge as ugly, brutal, and frankly accomplishes nothing. This isn't a matter of the line between good and evil blurring - the line disappears altogether as the seeker of vengeance becomes the very monster he sought to destroy (Brought home by the cruel, harshly truthful ending). I Saw the Devil is no genre masterpiece - it is a masterpiece of film-making as a whole and one of the best films of the 2010's. If you've got the stomach and a fondness for brainier horror flicks, this should be right up your alley.",

Are we ever truly satisfied after revenge is complete? All I know is that revenge is best served with a healthy dose of blood gushing, a good amount of adrenaline pumping, a bit of heart break, a ton of soul wrenching, some stomach turning, even eye duct depleting, and of course: utter agony. Who really is the devil?\n\nKim Jee-woon here has crafted a monster of a film. In many ways of course. There isn't only the two monsters in Kyung-chul (played by Choi Min-sik) and Soo-hyun (played by Lee Byung-hun). There is also a monstrous amount of emotion. Hate filled vengeance fuels this film which makes me want to take hacks myself (obviously at Kyung-chill). And even some tears wanted to bail out of my eye sockets. Obviously that is good because that meant that this is a film that gets you really invested in the story and its characters. The sheer amount of red not just of all the blood shed, but of rage was mesmerizing to watch. \n\nI didn't expect it to leave me with questions. The final scene just teared at me afterward. Revenge being central, you can't help but ask to what extent does revenge actually resolve any heartache, and what you gain from achieving it. It's a sad fact of life to know that even if you, a do-gooder, even exacted revenge against your enemy, a majority of the time you're left with that void. In major cases like this film, thine enemy still accomplished just about everything he could have dreamed. And that final shot just captured all the anger, frustration, bitterness, and any other emotion perfectly. I didn't just see two Devils in a game of cat and mouse. I saw a great film.",

The story follows a special agent whose wife was killed by a psychopath on her birthday, and now he wants to have his revenge! Pretty simple story, really, but it has some really clever plot developments. While I do think the main character is a bit stupid for letting the killer go after capturing him (twice) just so he can catch him again and then torture him some more, the ending felt just right! It was seriously emotionaly disturbing and shocking. Much like the rest of the movie. The violence/gore is very detailed and it looks very real. The cinematography and the director's work was brilliant, as well as the acting. You can really feel the pain the main character is going through, especially at the end. The characters aren't black and white, like they mostly are in this type of movies, but there sure are some really sick ones throughout. The soundtrack is great and really works with the scenes. There are some really well choreographed fighting scenes, too. The only thing that really bothered me was the stupidness of the main character, but other than that, this movie is pretty much flawless.

            "content": "\"You pissed off the wrong guy\".\n\nI think I'm a fan of 'Kim Jee-woon'.His american début 'The Last Stand' was a decent action flick (The direction being one of the strongest aspects) and 'The Good, The Weird' is one of my personal favourites (it says on the blu ray box \"What the fourth Indy should have been\" and it's right!). And now with 'I Saw The Devil' (admittedly a bit late to it) his style of direction has my attention.\n\nBleeding between horror and violent thriller 'I Saw The Devil' is certainly not for the squeamish. It's a cat and mouse between grieving husband 'Soo-Hyun' (Lee Byung-hun) and the psychotic serial killer 'Kyung-chul' (Choi Min-sik). It's a revenge film where the main protagonist becomes more and more like the killer. He's willing to go as far as possible to torture the killer so he can feel the pain his wife did. The two main characters are both interesting. \n\nWhen we first see 'Kyung' he's being pleaded with (by Soo's wife) to let her live and he takes a moment then with a blank stare throws back his meat clever. It's clear from the get go he's not so much human as a ghost just moving from one victim to the next. it appears he's indifferent to his acts (those that aren't sexual) and it's more of a \"have too\" thing than want. The the pursuing 'Soo' is not much better treating 'Kyung' more like a dog on a leash - inflicting pain, allowing the wounds to heal then doing so again. The confrontation between the two are the main highlights. \n\nWonderfully shot with ferocity from the director. One that involves 'Kyung' going back to an old friend, who's as psychotic as he is and the subsequent fight between the three in the hall ways of a huge house. 'Kyung' is irredeemable you know that from the off but he drags 'Soo' with him. The story in itself isn't anything ground-breaking but the two pitted against each other and visceral bloodshed are what make it a joy to watch.\n\nAs I said those of weak stomach you won't find much luck here. There are limbs, heads chopped and one point a mouth pulled apart at the sides. There's gore and violence aplenty, there's really no one to route for in the end it's more about seeing it come to an end and how. The hunt and hunter game could go on forever.  \n\nI'm not one for gore, slasher films and similar horror hold nothing for me. But when there's two interesting characters, a simple but effective story and a hunt/hunter vibe it's wonderfully macabre. Acted superbly throughout and directed by the deft hand of 'Kim Jee-woon' 'I Saw The Devil' lives up to the billing, no mystery of who the killer is, no crisis of confidence. This is about revenge and as long and painful as possible.",

This film boasts my complete and utter respect depicting the world class story telling and writing skills. The script for this film keeps it in a world of it's own and definitely paves the way for the cat mouse genre mixed with murder and revenge. What's on display is a professional agent bringing down a sadistic, cunning, and ruthless killer where the results are like fireworks being blown off right in front of you. It's pure dynamite with how it engrosses you with its grim and dark visuals, and offering you richly detailed environments along with it's intriguing score which paints the picture for your overall feeling- coming along for a thought provoking, constant pressuring hunter and hunted story line. It'll walk away with complete recommendation from myself and will take it's place among one of my favorite revenge thrillers. Watching CHOI Min-Sik play a sadistic man who feeds off the agony of others is a different kind of treat and a treat that proves great results. He has a character that I've not witnessed from him before, he brings a sicko hannibal lecter type of feel to the grotesque murder scene. \n\nActing, check. Direction, check. Screenplay, check. Score, check. Cinematography, check. All the qualities you would want to see in a great film exist in this one and it won't take long for admiration to kick in from a genre that still proves to bring the goods. No matter the cost",

It happens in most Hollywood horror movies were they try to show how brutal and dark they can get, put it just comes off torture porn. I think it's best for movies to have a reason for the use of gore and not make it mindless. The Human Centipede movies are a perfect example of what not to do with mixing gore and story. Until I sawed the 2010 film I Saw the Devil in which it has it's gory parts but it never felt like it's over doing it, and that's what I wanted for dark movies like this.\n\nThe director of the movie Ji-woon Kim who directed such movies like: The Good, The Bad and the Weird and The Last Stand. I only seen two of he's films and that's this movie and The Last Stand, but I haven't seen The Good, The Bad and the Weird yet. But anywhere Ji-woon Kim directed this movie with that sense of cold revenge which set up the tone perfectly for a film like this. Every shot in this movie is shot excellently and it's sometimes beauty and sometimes ugly, I mean this movie dose have a serial killer killing dozen of people and of course it's going to be ugly unless your Hannibal the TV show that you can make that ugliness into art, but it can be beauty with the open shot view of Korean even if it takes place in a environment of snow falling which is beauty to see or just outside. Ji-woon Kim directed the action scenes really well and smoothly and I got to say it's much better than most action movies are filmed today and I always love fight scenes from Korean or different kind of countries, because they fight scenes are quick, well performed, it get's you glued to the screen because it's that good and it's just awesome, and Ji-woon Kim did a excellent job directing at matching the tone and the action scene together perfectly.\n\nByung-hun Lee who I have seen before but not in such good movies like: The G.I Joe movies and Red 2. But in this movie I actually sawed him delivered a solid and heart breaking performance that Byung-hun Lee really humanist he's character that I can feel he's pain and fury against this killer who ruined his life. But without spoiling anything Byung-hun Lee crying at the end was hard not to laugh I mean he looked like he was smile or something, if you seen the movie then you know what I mean. Everything else was good but that cry at the end which made me laugh a little. Besides that Byung-hun Lee gave a strong performance that even I forget that cry at the end.\n\nChoi Min Sik the main serial killer of the movie delivered both treating and a uncomfortable performance that at times made me think that he wasn't acting at all he was that good. He played the devil like serial killer so well that I can picture him in real life doing all these crimes. Choi Min Sik did a excellent performance in the movie that's chilling and unforgettable.\n\nNow this movie does have a strong hold of blood and little bit of gore that some viewers may be turned off by. This movie isn't for everyone and I understand it may not be they type of movie to watch. I would only recommend this movie to people who love a dark gritty revenge film.\n\nNow for the problems: What really took me out of the movie is how many times the serial killer get's smashed in the head by a metal object or by anything that can knock your teeth out or kill you. I'm not kidding you this guy is evil but still human and some many times he get's tortured a little bit and get's brutally injured in the head which starts bleeding, but somehow he's okay after that. I know it's a small little problem but to me it's big enough for me to talk about it.\n\nOverall I Saw the Devil is a gritty crime drama that it's sometimes hard to watch and hard to take in with the level of grittiness that's in the movie, and that's what made this movie both great and brilliant.",

Tthere are so many things here bothering me. The cops are acting like imbeciles and the main-guy is also making some rather stupid actions. It's also very long.

I Saw the Devil is a brutal, relentless and gory revenge flick that takes such a weird turn that I was genuinely surprised. I heard a lot about this movie, especially it's brutal violence, but for some reason, none of it really shocked me. It's perhaps how stylized it is (not Kill Bill, but not a psychological horror-gore fest either) and maybe I'm a bit desensitized. This film is full of insanity, cruelty, barbarism and utter contempt for human life, yet it never feels grim or mean spirited. It's sad and depressing and it's horrifying, but there are moments of dark humour and moments of kindness that really offset it. Which is good, because a movie like this couldn't work if it was completely grim.\n\nThe performances are very good, with some of South Korea's best known stars taking on what would NEVER happen in the United States, a film that's uncompromising and absolutely ballsy. Min-Sik Choi is BIG in South Korea and for him to play a character like this is pretty remarkable.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot and there are some moments that to me, seem like they've been ripped out of an ultraviolent manga. Some scenes are absolutely brilliant to watch; the way the camera moves, the way it doesn't shy away from the action. It's the best thing about Asian action films: typically, the choreography is superb. \n\nHowever, there are some flaws. The movie is way too long and gets a bit repetitive at moments. There are couple of flashback scenes that try and reinforce the grand theme of the film and scenes where it almost feels like the director is trying to tell you exactly what message he's trying to convey that feel...out of place, to say the least. I'm generally not a fan of flashbacks and they feel a little cheap. But overall, if you're not squeamish, not turned off by excessive violence and love Asian cinema, I recommend this. What it's almost guaranteed to do is peak your interest in South Korean film, because right after it, I went searching furiously for Korean comedies. Seriously, you guys need to lighten up a bit.",

A very different character to that of Oldboy's Oh Dae-Su, he never-the-less delivers an equally exceptional performance, creating one of the most disturbing movie villains since Hannibal Lecter.\n\nSome truly incredible action scenes, weaved amongst some genuinely emotional moments derived from great chemistry between the two lead actors; this movie has a lot to offer, providing the violence isn't too much for you.\n\nMy only real criticism to this movie, is how good so many of the characters seem to be at surviving extreme, repeated blunt-force trauma to the head.",

The man who is avenging his wife becomes obsessed with torturing the psycho murderer, but he can't bring himself to kill the murderer and end his suffering, because that would be too merciful. So basically, this movie is over 2 hours of a (pretty attractive) Korean man exacting his revenge on the psycho a lot at a time, and in some gruesome ways, before letting him go, catching him again, and torturing him some more. \nYeah, so........ I think I kind of loved this movie. The acting was amazing, the violence was extreme, the story was actually really good. THIS is what a revenge flick should be. The man going after revenge knew that it wouldn't make him feel better about loosing his pregnant wife, and he knew that he was turning into a monster, and that innocent people were getting hurt because he kept letting the psycho killer go, but that didn't matter! All that mattered was that the killer feel as much agony and pain that he was feeling before fulfilling his revenge. This movie is actually pretty interesting from a psychological and metaphorical stand point. Who was the devil? Was it the psycho killer? Or was it the man who is portrayed as being good in the beginning but is just as unsympathetic about commuting numerous atrocities as the main antagonist? It really just depends on how you look at it. \nAll in all, I really liked this movie. Might even have loved. That being said, It's DEFINITELY not for anyone! For example, if you HATE gory movies with realistic violence and violence against women, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! However, I don't know if people who like movies like Saw or Hostel would like this movie either, because it's pretty dramatic also. It's also a Korean movie with subtitles, so that drops the number of people who would enjoy this movie even more. Basically, if you love all kinds of movies, you're not afraid of gore and subtitles, and you're willing to try and watch something different (violent/morally ambiguous plot); definitely give this movie a go.",

Aside from thematic similarities (and an ability to show cringe-inducing violence), the visual aesthetic is right on par, too.\n\nWhere I Saw The Devil fails to reach Park's glorious heights is in the arena of convenience. The protagonists (a term used loosely in the Revenge genre) in Park's films have to scratch and fight for every twist and turn and drop of blood. As such they hit in a much more realistic way, even as absurd as some of the scenarios seem. This film, however, isn't so cleverly crafted as to hit in that realistic way. You can see the invisible God Hand playing with the characters in the guise of convenience. Maybe not quite up to Deus Ex Machina levels, but it lacks that gritty reality that makes Park's work so epic.\n\nBut this doesn't make I Saw The Devil a bad film. Even Tarantino can't reach Park's eye for cinema. Still, Ji-woon Kim is dabbling in a particular genre, style, and aesthetic that has already been mastered; the comparison is both inevitable and inescapable. Because for as good as I Saw The Devil is, it feels a bit tired as it reaches to distance itself from the comparison, all while reinforcing them.\n\nEven that might keep this a solid 4.5 star film. Because even as a sub-Park work, it's strong. However, the runtime goes about a 45 minutes too long. It seems like Kim wanted to squeeze it a couple too many storylines. Unfortunately, not all of them are good enough to justify the extra film. \n\nAt the same time, that excess seems to mostly come at the expense of a relatively slow beginning, so once you get on the rollercoaster, it'll keep gripping you through the last minutes. Yes, there is some fluff padding the other areas of the film, and cuts could be made even toward the end, but by-and-large I Saw The Devil captivates.",

Agonizing torture and bloody revenge have never looked as ravishing as the director of A TALE OF TWO SISTERS offers up his next masterful entry in to the genre. The stunning cinematography and fluid fight choreography from which each of his action sequences are composed can only be compared to the works of Chan-wook Park in their graceful beauty, despite the horrific and ultra-violent images that are being displayed on screen. Min-sik Choi of OLDBOY renown bests even his finest performances in his depiction of the charismatic killer, Kyung-chul. After luring his prey with an innocent smile, Choi reveals a cold and heartless interior that is chilling to the bone. Byung-hun Lee must become divest of all emotion, as well, if he is to track and destroy his fiancee's killer as the vengeful Soo-hyeon Kim. The cat and mouse game in which he catches and releases Kyung-chul in order to prolong his torment constantly calls in to question the meaning of good and evil, when Kim commits many of the same sinister acts in the name of revenge. It isn't until Kim sees the futility of his actions that the swell of emotions finally springs forth as he realizes that the violence and vengeance that he has wrought will bring no further satisfaction or closure towards his fiancee's death. I SAW THE DEVIL is perfectly played on all parts, and another fine addition to the genre to set beside THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, and ANTIBODIES.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

After the initial setup (which is honestly pretty gripping), most of the movie involves sadistic killer Kyung-chul wandering from one situation to the next, being pursued by Soo-hyun, and doing random reprehensible things that further illustrate to the audience just how really, really bad he is (even though that was already established very effectively in the opening scene). After awhile the repetitious encounters become tiresome, as does all the gore. The makers of this film definitely fail to grasp the \"less is more\" rule with horror films. After awhile you just feel numb to all the blood and violence, which is not the intended effect here, I don't think. There are also an overabundance of elongated fight sequences in lieu of any more interesting ideas. They're well done I suppose, but after awhile I was really hoping they'd do something other than just having the two main characters beat each other up some more. As much as I like the central themes this movie explores about the line between good and evil, and what revenge does to people, it seemed like any potential opportunity to do something interesting with them was squandered. They get the protagonist Soo-hyun right, showing a very compelling descent into damnation, but they make his antagonist so completely awful and 100% reprehensible without a shred of any decency or really anything other than just rotten badness that it almost stands in contrast to the smarter, more nuanced, and more complex aspects of the film. He's actually very one-note and kind of uninteresting despite being played by such a talented actor (Min-sik Choi of Oldboy fame). He might as well cackle madly and twirl a mustache.

Jang Kyung-chul, played by Choi Min-sik, is a dangerous psychopath who kills for human meat. He has committed infernal serial murders in diabolic ways that one cannot even imagine and his victims range from young women to even children. The police have chased him for a long time, but were unable to catch him. One day, Joo-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief becomes his prey and is found dead in a horrific state. Her fiancé Soo-hyun (Lee Byung-hun), a top secret agent, decides to track down the murderer himself. He promises himself that he will do everything in his power to take bloody vengeance against the killer. When tracks down this serial killer, turning him in to the authorities is the last thing on his mind. The lines between good and evil fall to the waste side, and a diabolically twisted game of cat and mouse ensues. Pushing the concept of revenge to its most extreme limits, Jee-woon Kim transcends the police procedural/serial killer genre in exhilarating fashion. Unfortunately, the approach taken by Jee-woon Kim compromises plausibility and it goes on far too long. \n\nThe sheer length and repetitiousness of the film becomes laborious, and takes on the feeling of \"enough already.\" The bloodletting is unrelenting, displacing any real character development or narrative ingenuity. Allowing Kyung-chul to escape time and again quickly becomes repetitious, and the narrative grows tiresome. The killer continues to roam, and chased, for the duration of the entire film, adding to his already prolific body count before the chase is over to even a score. It makes for gruesome entertainment, and dedicated fans of South Korea's infamous revenge genre will be more than pleased. To anyone else who might be interested, come prepared to clean up the blood splatter.",

While there are some brilliantly brutal scenes and the concept behind the revenge is interesting and refreshing, it never really entertains.\nThe film is never truly thrilling nor is there any difficulty for the main character.  Even when things start getting a bit sketchy, he still manages to get the job done in only a few minutes.  It's a few minutes too late but still. \nAnd while I thought the sub plot of a good man going bad for revenge could have made for some interesting film, it failed to do so here. \nThere's no arc of development from anybody in this film. It's just violence after violence for violence sake even though so many possibilities existed to give us something more.",

One of my favorite foreign films of all time. THIS is how you do a thriller. As impossible as it sounds, Min-sik Choi actually surpasses his work in \"Oldboy\" as perhaps one of the most ingeniously-written serial killer roles I've ever seen. If you haven't seen this yet, SEE IT NOW!",

            "content": "I think it would be fair to compare it to Oldboy since both deal with a theme of revenge and star Choi Min-sik.  Oldboy, however, was a far more engaging movie that was only enhanced by Choi Min-sik's performance, and I Saw the Devil is terribly repetitious with Min-sik's performance being the only real saving grace.  This movie had me at the beginning, but at about 90 minutes in I was spent and ready to just call it quits.  You know where the movie is going, it isn't going to shock you with any twists.  What we get in the 140+ minutes is the same story that could have been told in 80 minutes.  This is your basic revenge picture that just happens to have some good performances and is beautifully shot.  And as much as I appreciate the effort and hard work, the script easily could have been trimmed down to make this less of a marathon.  I'm not against long running movies, I'm just against long running movies that really offer nothing more after 90 minutes.  Yes, there is plenty of well-shot action.  Yes, it is gruesome and fun at times.  Yes, the acting is great.  Yes, the direction is great.  Can I recommend it?  I don't know.  I wanted to like it more than I do because the elements for a great movie are all there.  When it's all said and done though, the movie just doesn't offer as much on the level of Oldboy and it's a forgettable film that really doesn't warrant more than one viewing.  If you enjoy Korean cinema then it's probably on your must-see list, but for me I've seen plenty of revenge thrillers in my lifetime that this one was just lost in the shuffle.",

Without going into what would any of us do in similar or exact circumstances, I must say the direction could have be a little bit more subtle, but that's just my preference. Where the film doesn't shine is the screenplay, where a crucial mistake by a character fuels almost 40 or so minutes of action. If it didn't happen, potentially we could have seen a more visceral or potent film, but it's pretty hard hitting anyway. Recommended, but not for softies like me.",

I was glad I did. as the story progresses its gonna take some suspension of disbelief. and then there's the scene in the cab. but overall I liked the movie it was well acted well directed the gore effects were pretty cool. its not the best movie ever made but its enjoyable as long as you know what you're getting yourself into and what you'd be getting yourself into is one heck of a crazy movie. its not for children or the weak stomached I highly recommend it if you're into these types of movies.",
