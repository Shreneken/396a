I grew up in Barcelona, where everyone speaks Spanish and nobody Catalan, but all I can speak is English so I can't understand anything they tell me.. Well, except for the key people, they all like to speak English, even when talking among themselves.\nMy brother (who probably is the only actor capable of canveying a semblance of emotion) is a priest, and our dying father is a priest, only that none of us knows what fictional denomination of christians it may be, because sure as hell it isn't a real one.\nI'm an IMF agent fot the occult, and I have been Activated... And I believe this easily, even though I'm a full-on Atheist, only because everyday has an 11:11 (not in the one at the a.m., mind you, the one at NIGHT!!!!) - by the way, is it 11:11 ET or Barcelona time?\n\nSome cardboard and plastic mask men have been giving me cheap jump scares for a couple of days.\n\nI know I can't suspect my brother, but I'm not in the audience, you know? They seem to have figured him out very early, but me? I have to worry about the jump-scare-guys, who're making this movie look like a carnival's hounted house.\n\nThen Bousman gets to the last scenes, and applies the \"Saw montage\", where he explains what was obvious troughout the movie, and closes this turd in the stupidest way he could have thought.\nReally. Is THAT bad.",
