    "summary": "Innocent Midwesterner Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) works in a dead-end job as a grocery bagger and has never even kissed a girl. Obviously, his life is going nowhere. While watching a stag film with his buddies, he discovers that his conservative parents (Edward Herrmann, Miriam Flynn) were once porn stars. Convinced that he has found his true destiny, Bucky heads out to Hollywood to make it big in the adult-film business -- even though his \"qualifications\" for the job come up short.",

            "content": "Bucky Larson is a tour de force in the vein of Adam Sandler-esque sophomoric comedies where the protagonist is a loveable loser who shouldn't get the girl but does in the end because he treats her like a queen.  Not just that, they always have a pure heart.  I believe future generations will look at Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler films like my generation view Jimmy Stewart and Jerry Lewis movies... as classics.  Although I, myself, have barely seen any of those classics like \"The Nutty Proffesor\" or \"The Philadelphia Story\", but am aware of their reputation.\n\nBucky Larson turned off many because of its hypersexualized humor even though Bucky himself is a virgin which is the only way the movie could work.  It's nowhere near as smart nor realistic as \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\" nor does it have any traditional observational humor except when it lampoons the porn industry.  Stephen Dorff is excellent as Nick Swardson's rival and the lovely Christina Ricci is wonderful as always.\n\nThe Chemistry between Christina and Nick in their respective roles is palpable enough for the viewer to get lost in the virtually implausible storyline and crass humor.  There is an excellent supporting cast with Nick Turturro, Don Johnson and Kevin Nealon in hilarious roles.  The movie is very very funny, but not for everyone's taste.  Many will be disgusted at the premise and more will be turned off by the unlikelyhood a guy like Bucky in real life could ever get a girl like the starry eyed Kathy.  But the movie has plenty of heart and that's where it works the most.\n\n88/100 B+  It is a modern day classic with a unique approach to the Romance Comedy which will be more appreciated in the years to come.",

            "content": "In many ways this is a formulaic comedy about an underdog exceeding all expectations, but there are a number of attributes that make it rather special.  It is a satirical answer to \"Boogie Nights,\" with its new performer on the porn scene who is \"special,\" and in this movie's case the title character being the polar opposite of the exceptionally endowed Dirk Diggler.  Meanwhile,  the director character, played by Don Johnson,  is an affectionate \"homage\" to Burt Reynold's character in \"Boogie Nights.\"  More memorably, star Nick Swardson has created a character that is so naive and nice making him the brunt of all the silly situations, yet somehow retaining a sweetness, a likability in his interactions with everyone else, especially with his loving Midwestern parents and the charming, though hardly believable, relationship with the beautiful, kind waitress he meets. Christina Riici is outstanding here.  (In their first intimate moment, she asks if he has protection and he wonders if she means if he carries a knife.)   \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is certainly not for children or those with delicate sensibilities, but its preposterous situations and dialogue will surely make you laugh.",

Bucky Larson was savaged by critics when it came out and it's easy to see why. In an hour and a half Nick Swardson & co. manage to squeeze in just about every HM trope. Underestimated, geeky lead, inexplicably interested love interest, one dimensional, unfunny bullies, characters with either bizarre motivation or not motivation at all, contrived scenarios, a fetish for crude humour and cringeworthy attempt at sentimentality. I'll admit I did laugh a couple of times, but for nearly the entire 90-minute runtime I wore an expression of befuddlement. How did anyone think this was entertaining, or clever, or in any way worthy of being shown to the public? Swardson is a painfully unfunny presence, chewing every inch of scenery with his stupid prosthetic teeth, overacting even the tamest of jokes and utterly failing at attempts in engaging our interests or sympathies. It's sad to see the likes of Don Johnson and Christina Ricci debasing themselves with the lousiest of scripts, looking truly stunned at the stupidity of the lines they're being paid to deliver. It's no wonder it bombed and has been largely forgotten. Some things are best left to the pages of history. This one doesn't even deserve a footnote.",

He moves to LA to follow his dream and ends up meeting Christina Ricci as a waitress who helps him adjust to the bustle of the big city. He has trouble making it big since, umm, he isn't quite so. However, he meets Don Johnson (not a porn name) and he is a broke director who wants to hit it big again. He hires Bucky since he is the son of stars and they stumble into a weird niche of films where Bucky makes a mess everywhere. I liked Orgazmo for its funny take on the industry while still being funny, this just seems like a cheap version of Orgazmo. It has some great actors, but it just isn't as funny as that one.",

Just small parts.\n\nBucky Larson is an ordinary loser who lives in the Midwest, and after he sees a nude flick, that his parents starred in, he wants to follow in their footsteps and heads out for the bright lights of Hollywood. \n The film fails in all aspects and is painfully unfunny. I never thought I'd ever see a movie even more stupid than Jack and Jill. The plot sucks, there's little attempt at character development that isn't very interesting at all, and the acting isn't good. It feels like a spoof film, and it's hard to get good acting with this poorly written script. \n The film relies on three main unfunny jokes: Bucky's buck teeth, his small penis, and his premature ejaculation. \n The only good thing about this film is the short appearance by Adam Herschman (Glen from Accepted), he wasn't exactly funny but it was nice to see him in a film again. Like I said, it's hard to be funny in this flick. The talents of Nick Swardson and Christina Ricci are extremely \nwasted. \n I don't know how this is a movie.

The gross out jokes are sickening, the main character is unbelievably stupid and the plot so predictable it's frustrating. How can we believe, in a comedy set on earth that someone would be so stupid to think that masturbating to a porno film featuring your own parents is normal and that just because your parents were in a dirty movie that you are yourself \"born to be a star\"? Nick Swardson plays \"Bucky\", a mentally challenged, bucked-tooth and incredibly naive boy who misunderstands his parent's history as 70's porn stars as a sign that he should travel to Hollywood himself because he is destined to be a star as well. Actually that description is inaccurate because there is nothing in the film to indicate that \"Bucky\" was brain damaged in an accident or was born with a medical condition but he acts like such a cretin that you almost have to see the film as an incredibly bizarre and cruel film about a naive boy who is tricked by the entire porn industry into thinking he is a hero when in fact they are all laughing at him behind his back and not as the actual movie they are presenting to us. When \"Bucky\" arrives in Hollywood he acts like an alien that has no understanding of human customs (stripping for a grape juice ad, acting like a wild animal in the presence of women and sleeping outside like a beast because he can't find a place to live) until he inexplicably catches the eye of the prettiest girl in the movie, becomes a huge sensation and somehow becomes the biggest porn star in the history of the medium. Nick Swardson could not have picked a worse film to try and jump-start his film career and audiences will feel embarrassed for Christina Ricci, who is a legitimately good actress who is stuck playing a woman who's life ambition is to be a waitress. Yes you read that right. \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is an the definition of a cinematic train wreck and even if you like to make fun of bad movies you should under no circumstances see this film.",

The characters and plot are implausibly positioned and there is a huge lack of cohesive sense to the story - one can only suspend disbelief so much before accepting shear stupidity.  Christina Ricci hands in a painful performance and Don Johnson surely isn't stealing the show like Burt Reynolds did in Boogie Nights.  Stephen Dorff is believable as the successful rival porn star.

            "content": "Nick Swardson co-writes and stars in this Happy Madison gross-out comedy about the biggest dork ever entering the adult film industry. ...Man, do I even need to make a \"How can this go wrong?\" joke? I can think imagine that plenty of people out there are thinking, \"No need, because seeing as it's a Happy Madison production, we already know that you like it.\" Hey, I'm just going ahead and speaking for the readers, because although I neither liked nor disliked the other Happy Madison films of 2011, considering that this is the internet, all anyone is going to remember is the \"didn't dislike\" part, and I can understand, because I'm giving these films more credit than they deserve by calling them \"borderline\" bull. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, in all fairness, compared to this film, I almost love those other Happy Madison productions. ...Yeah, I'm waiting for the part where I say, \"Okay, maybe that's going a bit too far\", but that's not going to happen, because this film is absolutely unpalatable. Okay, maybe it's not as bad as I though, in as much as I was going in expecting an unparalleled, unholy experience of horrible pain while watching this abomination of desolation torture me in fashions that make the stuff they do in Guantanamo Bay look like getting slapped in the arm with a thin rubber band, when really, all I got was just a mental scar, because, make no mistake, this film is still pretty blasted awful, and yet the torture still goes toned down just a slight smidge by... hot chicks... and that's just about it.\r\n\r\nIf I have nothing else to say about this film, then it's the fact that... um... I'm at least glad that the ridiculously over-the-top offensive hick town that the Bucky Larson character comes from is in the Midwest and not the South, because if it took place in Alabama, then I'd be just about ready to kill somebody. No, but seriously though, although I would have probably actually spent money to have Nick Swardson hurt horribly if he was taking shots at sweet home Alabama, I feel genuinely offended on behalf of those poor buck-toothed, Dutch-accented weat farmers in Iowa - you bet ya -, mostly because it's a joke that's so startlingly unfunny (Yes, even less funny than the Iowa joke I just made), as opposed to about, I think three jokes that are actually pretty good, as much as I hate to admit it. Okay, now, there are points where timing and absurdity fluke and create a quick gut punch that evokes a chuckles, and that would be the John Mayer joke that Kevin Nealon practically introduces himself with, and that's about it. Okay, fine, after that, the film makes a few undeniable flukes, and yet, what really keeps this film from falling so far under the radar that it's untracable has to be those moments where the film stops being so over-the-top and fall back into being that kind of Happy Madison down-to-earth, where things are still exaggerated, but mediocrely so. Of course, even that tonal shift is a glaring flaw in the film, because this film's dance between over-the-top and relatively down-to-earth is so inorganic and incompetent, making the film tonally inconsistent. Still, those inconsistent moments are far and few between, because this film mostly rests on one type of tone, and as much as I wish I could say the frequent tone is the mediocre, relatively down-to-earth, I've got too many scars from the awful over-the-top to know that's not the case. I really don't know what to say; this film is just an absolute embarassment, and yet, I just have to bite the bullet and go into detail, because if you're thinking that there's even a mild glimmer of hope, I have to educate you before you see this film and hurt yourself beyond any repair, emotionally, mentally and, well, physically, because watching this film made my muscles almost instinctively jump out of me to try and get away.\r\n\r\nEven during it's mediocre, relatively down-to-earth moments, the film is cheesy and somewhat obnoxious, and yet, it's hard to not beg for more of that when the film jumps back to the over-the-top that is more prominent throughout the film, because the torturous \"humor\" that this foundation is practically built upon is anything but palatable. Fish-out-of-water humor, alone, is enough to drive me up a wall, as it stands among my absolute biggest pet peeves in comedy; right up there with over-the-top, gross-out raunchy. Put those two pieces of \"humor\" together, and you've an unrelenting barrage of horrorible, consistently fall-flat humor that's obnoxious enough at a slow and steady deliver, let alone when it's delivered with the kind of frenetic loudness that can be found in this film. Now, the film isn't as relentlessly, frantically vulgar and loud as something like \"Freddy Got Fingered\", or else I probably would have bailed by the hour mark, but believe me, this film is still loud and annoying in its totally unreasonable and unfunny gross-out scenarios. However, through all of that lack of intelligence and wit, this film still boasts volumes of pretense in its atmosphere, as if the swill it's spouting is comedy gold. It's a problem with most films of this type, and this film isn't as intense in its pretense as something like a Friedberg/Seltzer movie, or the aforecited \"Freddy Got Fingered\", the film still stands with its chest in the wind as it pokes at you over and over again, silently exclamining, \"Isn't this funny, you stupid, money-making movie-gore?\" It's a problem I often have with Nick Swardso, who, I must admit, isn't as terrible and unlikable as I expected, but is still so very obnoxious, showing that even when he's at his best, he's still an annoying, pretentious little idiot in this powerful testament to his lack of talent, as well as how \"not\" to make a performer vehicle, much less a movie.\r\n\r\nTo shut down this star, credit to the ever so occasional fluke in humor, as well as those moments where the film tonally inconsistently, but still relievingly tones down the over-the-top and stands as simply mediocre; yet on the whole, this film wishes it could be as good as mediocre, and I don't just mean that figuratively, as this film, with an overbearing pretense, delivers one wildly offensive, repulsively disgusting and obnoxiously frantic fall-flat joke of a joke after another as it self-righteously pushes and pushes for any kind of positive reaction, when really, the only reactions it gets and deserves to get are overwhelmingly negative, thus making \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" to collapse as an insufferable, mean-spirited onslaught of unbearable raunch that, like all the other atrocities of its type, haunts, scars and gives both comedy and filmmaking, in general.\r\n\r\n1/5 - Awful",

I'll also be honest and throw out there that I have never once really found Nick Swardson to be at all funny, so that really doesn't help the situation here.  However, Bucky Larson doesn't destroy my faith in cinema, as every critic panned.  I'll also openly admit that I laughed quite a bit during this, but maybe it was because I just needed an absolutely stupid movie to laugh at. I don't know.   Bucky Larson is loud, crude, rude, and plain offensive at times.   However, I found quite a few things to laugh at, not that I would recommend this movie to anyone.  In a world where we have many hilarious and classic R-rated comedies, Bucky Larson stands as less then a foot-note, that's for sure.  The movie itself gets 2 stars, but I had to award an extra half star to Kevin Nealon for his insanely hilarious and random cameo appearances in this, all of which not only make no sense, but he pops up at the right moments.",

Obviously, that positive part get's dark when you realize that the job he does is not good and is not a thing actors or actresses should do to get famous. Seriously, is true.\n\nPlot: Is simple, Bucky discovers something about his parents. They were famous persons in the past, something he wants to be. He wants to get on Hollywood, get awards, etc. But he will do it in the wrong profession...the one his parents did. The other story inside this one? Kathy's story, which I think is the most nice one and should be the one people should admire, since is not vulgar, nasty and horrible as Larson's. Spoil much? Nope. You want to know what this stories are about in full speed? Watch the movie, but trully, I won't recommend it at any cost.\n\nActing: Nick as Bucky....I never imagined him on a role like this one. First of all, those teeths looked SUPER FAKE! (dunnot if I write right or wrong the teeth thing). But honestly, I got surprised. Christina as Kathy did great, really, her role was trully for her. The rest of the cast did somehow great and somehow meh (needed more skills I admit). Anyway, one star for them all.\n\nMusic: Some songs were nice for some parts, some were not used properly. Defenetly, the score was ok, the songs were amazing, but they were not great for the scenes. So, one star for the effort made in this part, crew, cast and director.\n\nTo end this review, 2 stars of 5. Enjoy and HASTA LA PROXIMA AMIGOS/AS! CHAO! BLESS YOU ALL!!!",

With that said  the script is awful;  the villain, or antagonist, or whatever you wish to call him in this film, doesn't seem to really provide any real resistance to the protagonist, and there doesn't seem to be any real inciting conflict in the film until the last 15 minutes of the film.  I almost feel if this had been done as if it were a \"Behind the Music\" expose' it might have actually worked a little better.  As a straight movie it did little for me.

Grandma's Boy is top three of all-time funny. He was also funny in Chuck and Larry and Benchwarmers among others. This is quite a step backwards. The character is not that funny, nor were most of the situations. I chuckled some, but it's not real funny like his other stuff. That said, I've often disliked Sandler movies on the first time through, only to really enjoy them later. Maybe, just maybe that's the case here though I'm skeptical. \n\nNot much else to say on this one. Ricci is actually kinda adorable instead of weird for once.

Movies like The Happening and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li are awful because I play up how insane they are, giving you a challenge just to know how bad it is. This is not the case with the excruciatingly unpleasant Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star. Do not see this movie. Do not EVER see this movie. Yes, I'm guilty of seeing it because of the astoundingly bad reviews due to my curiosity of how putrid it could be, but I saw it anyway and regret it and I don't want you to suffer the same fate. It's worse than people make it out to be... it's nowhere near being a fun kind of bad. In the realm of terrible cinema, is there anything worse than a boring, laugh-free comedy? It's offensive not in the porn-centered story, but in the way the comedy and characters are so putrid. Bucky (Nick Swardson) is a bad Midwestern stereotype like Marge Gunderson from Fargo but with no appeal. Big teeth hasn't been funny since the 1800's, but a great number of jokes are devoted to it. Christina Ricci has to act like Bucky is charming; something Meryl Streep can't even pull off. Plus, dick jokes... I guess if you're eight years old and not desensitized, you may laugh, but that's because you haven't matured yet.\n\nNothing here is funny. You can create a comic world where everything is satirical or over-the-top silly, but this requires talent and a funny screenplay and there is none of that here. From the first two minutes, I knew this was going to be contender for the worst comedy ever made.

The only good movie I can think of that he starred in was Bolt, the animation film by Walt Disney starring John Travolta as the title character. Anyway the story is about Nick Swardson who plays \"BUCKY LARSON\", the normal average daily life guy who has big goofy teeth and watches porn with his friends. Yeah classic. Anyway when he finds out that his parents were once porn stars, he finds out that he is \"BORN TO BE A STAR\"! so he does all this dumb shit like stripping in front of the camera, getting horny before having sex with the girl and cumming all over the place. Yeah movie you are so messed up. I don't mind someone being goofy or sexual references in a film which i always love but turning that into a annoyfest just to b funny is what I hated the most In this huge failure. Unfortunately another failure I had recognized in this film was Adam Sandler as the writer an producer along with Nick Swardson and another guy which was not his best career move. Stephen Dorff has added another shitty movie to his shitty career's list along with Alone in the Dark and Christina Ricci who I loved since Sleepy Hollow had almost killed her career with this film. Why Christina? WHY!?!?!? This was a film that was so broken and lame that it should be buried forever!

            "content": "There is very little to say about Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star other than \"I hated it ... I hated ALL of it!\"  The film is not funny and it is repellent.  I cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's.  Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom (notice no running for me) to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.  This should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year [the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical commedienne Nicole Kidman] ... so I question whether or not his days are  numbered?).  An unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (un-shaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) pornstars of the 1970's.  Leaving behind an insulting-to-midwesterners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.  Bucky luckily meets the nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster -- and no wonder she seeked-out employment on television!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - \"SNL\", \"Weeds\", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work.  Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep (ugh) who sees something \"special\" in Bucky (disgusting) and decides to exploit the freak (its explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the freak-tag that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!).  Stephen Dorff (who's stellar \"comeback\" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays the jealous porn-star rival.  As vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is suprisingly little flesh on display.  It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing.  Just as impossible would be finding \"the best\" part.  This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover fillms.  What works with those 3 films is that they are \"equal-opportunity offenders\" ... this one -- NOT so much.  It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism.  I NEVER want to see something like this again.",

It stars Nick Swardson, also known as the unfunniest comedian in Hollywood, and my public enemy #1.

This is beneath Don Johnson, and it is even beneath Pauly Shore, which you know is saying something.  The writing is unspeakably obscene, and there isn't a single thing in here that's inoffensive or even funny, for that matter, as everything is a disgusting, unamusing gross out gag.  This is a laugh-free movie that is littered with face palms, and hopefully, if anything good comes out of this, it's the financial failure that speeds up Nick Swardson's inevitable fade into obscurity.

Even more upsetting, perhaps, is that the movie is just so lazy.\r\nIt follows the cookie cutter pattern of all the Happy Madison productions. Create a supposedly lovable, goofy character who is a really one-note, annoying moron. Fill the film with supporting characters who pop up from time to time to do or say something nonsensical. And finally, give the lead dweeb and impossibly hot girlfriend and try to make the film sweet by letting her see something in him that no one else can, including the audience. \r\nIn this case, that unfortunate part goes to a radiant Christina Ricci who hasn't looked this good on film in a long, long time. Swardson proves once and for all that he cannot carry a movie and should always be a secondary performer at best. It's an offensive, embarrassing performance that's one joke. And that one joke was never funny to begin with.\r\nI laughed a total of three times, and I'm not very proud to have to admit that. The majority of the jokes are quite obvious and have to do with Swardson's exaggerated appearance. It ups the ante of distasteful humor to the breaking point, and I just felt like walking out after thirty minutes.\r\n\"Bucky Larson\" seems to aspire to new lows, and that's a target it hits with ease.

            "content": "A loopy yet entertaining comedy to pass the time for extremely undemanding comedy fans, Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star may not compare strongly to other comedies of the genre (Austin Powers, Bridesmaids and MacGruber for example), but is not as terrible as some may predict.  Nick Swardson is genuinely funny and the unevenness of the story may not sit well with all viewers, but enough sporadic laughs keep it from sinking too low.\n\nBeginning in a rural town in Iowa, Bucky Larson starts as a an underprivileged bum pushing middle age who still lives with his folks and works as a checkout boy at the local grocery store. He thinks he is breaking all boundaries by getting together with some buddies to watch some old porn movies. But this turns out to be more than he bargained for as he realizes this porno stars his parents! Though most would be scarred for life upon seeing their parents bang on screen, Bucky sees it as his destinyâ¦being a porn star is in his genes!!!! Next thing we know, Bucky is off to Hollywood to fulfill his destiny and happens to meet a kind diner waitress who quickly becomes his soul mate. He goes surprisingly far and manages to meet just the right people who can make his dreams soreâ¦except for one bitterly jealous dude who just might jeopardize everything he has set out for.\n\nThis one lagged at the box office and is hardly a memorable film, but its share of yucks makes it a good selection to enjoy while drunk (if you get off on this sort of thing). Swardson is good in his first leading role and Christina Ricci is quite watchable as his charming love interest. Edward Herrmann, Kevin Nealon and Miriam Flynn (known for her role as Cousin Catherine in the âVacationâ? films) are also fun in supporting roles. Probably not the best couple hours to invest into oneâ(TM)s day, but you could certainly do worse.",

While the character of Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) is likable for his naivete and stupidity, he is not funny and doesn't carry the film whatsoever and his antics wear thin really, really quickly. Overall, if you have that thought in the back of your mind that says this movie might suck, that's the right way to think about this.

            "content": "One important rule of comedy for me is not to give your characters funny names, because chances are that the names themselves aren't really that funny. After seeing \"Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star,\" which breaks said rule in the first scene and continues to do so throughout its course, I think a few new rules ought to be employed. Rules that prohibit characters to have one-trick jokes involving buck teeth, doofy hairdos, ridiculous accents, bestiality and certain physical inadequacies. I may feel sick to my stomach if I am ever reminded of this miserable tragedy.\r\n\r\nI won't make the obvious joke about how Bucky Larson himself, Nick Swardson, is NOT born to be a star; other critics have already run that joke into the ground. Sure, the only movie I found him to be legitimately funny in was \"30 Minutes Or Less\" (where he was still upstaged by Danny McBride), but Swardon DESERVES better than this. In fact, every person in the cast warrants a better use of their talent. Christina Ricci, Kevin Nealon, Don Johnson, Pauly Shore. Yes, Pauly [freaking] Shore, the guy who was in such abysmal trainwrecks as \"Jury Duty,\" \"Bio-Dome\" and \"In The Army Now,\" is too good for this bomb.\r\n\r\nThis cinematic conflagration tells the story of a naïve young Iowa...boy (man?) named Bucky Larson. This is a character that the film somehow wants us to empathize with and concurrently point our fingers and laugh at, I guess. Only problem is that I don't remember ever identifying with him as a person and I CERTAINLY didn't do any laughing in this movie. The aptly named Bucky (because his two front teeth match the size of a beaver's) lives a humble existence with his parents (Edward Hermann and Miriam Flynn), but a kind elderly woman named Mrs. Bozobop (ho ho!) tells him one day that he was put on this earth to do something with his life. Destiny awaits him somewhere down the line.\r\n\r\nLater that same night, an epiphany comes to Bucky as he and his equally gawky friends convene to watch some adult videos. As you may have already predicted, Bucky is a pure minded fellow who knows not the slightest thing about sexual acts or human anatomy or innuendo, so the guys give him a crash course on the subject in repulsively graphic detail, yet told as if it is coming from the mouths of some immature fifth graders who have little to no idea what they are talking about. As they watch one video, they realize the two people in it look oddly familiar...like Bucky's folks...oh God, no.\r\n\r\nYup, it is them alright. So is Bucky understandably shocked and appalled and possibly scarred for life from seeing his parents nude and on film? Actually no. Instead, he is jumping with joy at the thought that he is the offspring of a couple of so-called 'celebrities.' He runs back home to ask them about it, and sure enough, they admit to it to their son with the utmost honor. Putting two and two together, he believes that his destiny must be to travel all the way to Hollywood and become a \"movie star,\" just like his mom and dad were. Speaking of mom and dad, they support his decision to journey onward and they even help him pack up. Don't you just love it when characters' personalities do a 180 out of nowhere with no explanation?\r\n\r\nOn his unbelievable voyage, he becomes good friends with a sweet diner waitress named Kathy (Ricci) who dreams of landing a bigger and better job in the food world. Christina Ricci's big doe-eyes and caring smile may be the only glimmering hope in an utterly desolate project and the half-star rating I will arrive on may as well belong entirely to her. As for the other eccentric side characters, we have an easily irritable roommate for Bucky (Nealon), the sleazy, washed-out skin flick director Miles Deep (ho ho!) played by Don Johnson, and a hot shot porn actor named Dick Shadow (ho ho!) played by Stephen Dorff. Who gave these people their names? Austin Powers?\r\n\r\nAnd through a series of events that are equal parts stupid and unlikely, Bucky becomes an overnight sensation on the Internet thanks to a website I will not directly name, but it's a revolting play on the brand 'YouTube.' Oh, and if I haven't warned you yet, I hope you like jokes about big teeth and small male appendages, because the film has no shortage (ahem!) of these. And if that is not all, it may have even more moments where Bucky vapidly responds to questions with the innocence of a child: \"I thought you had some sort of macaroni and cheese fetish.\" \"Oh, I don't use feta. Only cheddar.\" Well played, Bucky...well played, indeed.\r\n\r\nI simply could not crack a smile while watching \"Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star.\" I was too offended by the sheer laziness in writing gags and by the blatant disregard for the audience's intellect that I wanted to crawl into a whole and wait until it was over with. This is a joyless comedic wasteland that fails to deliver raunchy laughs and doesn't even offer much cheap nudity if you are a perv who is looking for that kind of thing. Plus, I could have come up with a better title: \"Bucky Larson: PORN to Be A Star.\" I had one more good idea OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD than this film had in its gag-inducingly long 97-minute length. \r\n\r\nBucky Larson is a born devastation.\r\n\r\n0.5/4",

            "content": "September 9, 2011\r\n\r\nLet me be clear: \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is a very bad movie--stupid, unfunny and infantile. It's clearly one of the worst movies of the year. And yet, it's not mean or hateful, and in that regard, it's not a completely painful experience. It's a bad one for sure, but it's more lethargic than excruciating. That's about the only praise I can offer it.\r\n\r\nAfter the movie, I pictured the so-called creative sessions between the three screenwriters, Adam Sandler, Allen Covert and Nick Swardson. I wondered, when they gathered to write this swill, did they really laugh at the material they were putting on paper? When one of them pitched the idea of a grown man masturbating in front of his friends, did the others start to laugh and urge him to keep going with it? Is that how they responded to the overall tired premise of a Midwestern man coming to Hollywood to be a porn star? Or that same man having a small penis and ejaculating uncontrollably?\r\n\r\nI suppose this kind of stuff can be funny in certain contexts, like when talking crudely among your guy friends at a party or on a long road trip, but that doesn't mean it belongs in a screenplay. Unfortunately, Sandler, Covert and Swardson see things differently, and because of Sandler's inexplicably strong box-office clout, what he says probably goes, which includes letting his friends write and star in their own movies. If only Sandler would star in a bomb; maybe then movie studios would question his decisions.\r\n\r\nSwardson plays the title character, Bucky Larson, a buck-tooth, virginal mamma's boy from a Podunk town in Iowa. One day he's fired from his job as a bagger at the local grocery store and his friends decide to cheer him up by showing him a porno. To their surprise, the thirtysomething Bucky has never masturbated before, so they give him tips and watch him conduct himself as the movie rolls. When he sees his parents (Edward Hermann and Miriam Flynn) are the stars of the porn, he thinks it's his destiny to follow in their footsteps. So he hops on the bus for Los Angeles and tries to break into the industry.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, he befriends a cute waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci) and meets a has-been porn director named Miles Deep (Don Johnson), who offers him a leading role because he figures there's a variety of perverse, sexual audiences out there, even ones willing to pay to see Bucky. The first day of shooting reveals Bucky is prone to involuntary orgasms at the slightest hint of female sexuality, and the footage becomes an overnight sensation on YouTube. By sheer luck and circumstance, Bucky is suddenly rocketed him into porn superstardom.\r\n\r\nYou might say \"Bucky Larson\" is a play on \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" as it's about an ignorant wanderer who obtains fame just by being in the right place at the right time, and because that fame happens to be rooted in the porn industry. And just like Dirk Diggler, Bucky wins several awards and steals the limelight away from the current porn juggernaut, Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).\r\n\r\nBut even though I dared to compare \"Bucky Larson\" to \"Forest Gump\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" purely from a content point of view, I'm not saying Sandler, Covert or Swardson were necessarily mindful enough to satirize those two movies, not least because their idea of humor hovers around that of a 10-year-old, one who's curious about sex and private parts but too embarrassed to ask questions and then simply reverts to making fun of them as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nHowever, because this movie is rated R, and rightfully so, it's not likely to reach many 10-year-olds, which then begs the question, who's it actually meant for? I know humor is all relative, but I can't imagine any adult would find this material funny. Maybe it's for those who find overgrown buck teeth a riot? Or maybe fans of Kevin Nealon, who plays Bucky's irascible L.A. roommate? Either way, the list is small.\r\n\r\nWhat's baffling is how an actress as pleasant and full of range as Christina Ricci would ever think to appear in this movie. Although, in a way, I'm grateful she did, because her radiant face and charisma helped save it from being a total disaster. She is at least sweet and likable, as is Swardson, but the material and jokes are so puerile that it's darn near impossible not to always be shaking your head or rolling your eyes.\r\n\r\nStill, as much as I cringed during this movie, I have to admit I didn't walk away angry. That's not laudation, but more an observation that \"Bucky Larson\" isn't so bad it deserves to be placed in the lower echelon of offensive movies, just bad ones. The movie is stupid, but it's the kind of stupid you automatically forget as opposed to actively trying to forget. And I have a feeling that when Sandler, Covert and Swardson realize just how badly it's going to crash and burn, not only with critics but also at the box-office, they'll be the ones trying to actively forget it. I suppose that's an appropriate punishment for writing it.",

Not that that will make it easier to sit through -- you've got to do a lot of thinking to get through the initial pain of watching.\r\n\r\nIt's well known that Adam Sandler has outgrown his infantile, baby-voiced six-year-olds-in-a-man's-body parts to become a mainstream actor in romantic comedies and occasional serious star vehicles. It is also now apparent that he is still being pitched the same tired old horseshit that he saw from his early successes and odd Saturday Night Live characters.\r\n\r\nAnd he's sick of them.\r\n\r\nSo he and his production team sat down to explore every mindless cliche that attaches to just such a movie.  And then, along the way, thought to include every \"small-town-boy-dreams-big-in-the-city movie, and every \"little guy stomped by the big, bad stud\" movie.  And blow them up. Throw in a few jabs at \"Boogie Nights,\" and a brilliant use of Don \"Beer Can\" Johnson as the pron director, and you have a brilliant movie that's bound to enchant every Frenchman who's ever worn a beret.\r\n\r\nFrom its initial (but soon-dropped) awful visual production valuea at the start, to the over the top. . . . well, everything, this is a bold , daring, and ultimately brilliant movie.\r\n\r\nThat will be hated by every critic to see it.\r\n\r\nWhy should they waste time enjoying the thought behind it when they can pan it on its superficial flaws.\r\n\r\nWhich permeate every frame.

It might be the worst comedy ever made or maybe the funniest...I am not sure.\n\nSo the plot is about as linear as you can get.  Weird kid from Iowa goes to his friends house and they put on an old porn movie which stars his parents from the 70s.  So his parents were famous porn stars in the 70s but they are as weird as him.  However, after being fired from his job at the grocery store he believes is destiny is to go to hollywood to be in porn.\n\nThat's basically the movie.  Kind of like the naive, midwest kid who isn't retarded but just well sheltered.  He goes off to the big city with nothing and runs into people who unlike normal hollywood don't take advantage of him but actually find him likable and help him along the way.  From the commercial director, to the old washed out porn director, to the head of the porn studio, to his loser roommate to his girlfriend.  I mean in most movies like this people find his talent and then take advantage of him, use him just like real hollywood.  However, the biggest twist and maybe the joke of the whole thing is that this kid is so nice that nobody can't be anything but nice back to him.\n\nThe problem with this is that their isn't much of any drama or plot left in the film.  Even his issue with his girlfriend at the end of the movie becomes an on entity.  Like isn't he suppose to struggle and fight against the machine to overcome things.   No, everything comes pretty easy to him so we simply walk through the movie that is all goodness.  He doesn't even get all the fame and then turns on his friends, gets a big ego or misguided by peers or mentors.  He stays nice throughout and so do all the people in the film.\n\nThe funnier thing is that he has these big buck teeth and that prince valient haircut that hardly anybody makes fun of and simply accept along with him not even having the right \"parts\" for porn.  He becomes the anti star because of his very limited \"talents\" but everyone is ok with it and when served lemons makes lemonades and he becomes a star.  \n\nYou would even think that his main rival the old time porn star would someone sabotage his plans, ruin his future or even steal his girlfriend.  No way this guy doesn't do much but make fun of him as he destroys this guys career.  It is just a really odd plot.\n\n\nThe other odd thing is all the people who were involved in making this film.  This is an Adam Sanler movie and which he and Nick Swardson who is Bucky wrote and produced the movie.  Then you take pretty big talents like Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, Stephen Dorff, and Kevin Nealon who actually are all kind of good in the movie but you just say what the hell are they all doing in this film.  Somebody must have had extra film stock and lots of money to say hey, lets give you all some change and a free weekend and pump out this movie because I am Adam Sandler and it will be kind of fun to hand out and kind of make this movie.\n\nWas the movie funny, well there were a few scenes that made me laugh but for the most part I just kept watching saying this is the most silliest, stupidest thing I have ever saw.  I am wondering if this movie is really so stupid, pointless and just odd that it isn't the funniest thing ever.  I don't know what to make of it but it is just a really weird movie.  Of course Nick Swardson is really funny and plays this character right 100 percent maybe just like Jerry Lewis used to be just out there in all his films.  I guess this is the closets thing.  So maybe if the French like this film we will know.\n\n\nSo first I don't think you should see this movie at the theater or even on DVD or for free.  Now maybe this becomes some sort of weird cult film that we can make  up a drinking game with or something that the college kids will catch on to something.  However, I think most of you will be scratching your head trying to figure out what the hell is this movie and what a train wreck.  Compared to all the other comedies this year this has to be the lowest and I am not sure of the two stars I gave it even deserve it.  However, I but some people think this is the funniest thing out there so its one of those films that is a go figure...",

            "content": "Here we have yet another movie produced by Adam Sandler starring one of his buddies, this time Nick Swardson. So how does Bucky Larson: Born To Be a Star hold up?\r\n\r\nWe follow Bucky Larson (Swardson), a small town guy who is as nice as can be and isn't quite aware of all of his surroundings. He and a few friends end up getting together to watch a porn movie to which Bucky and his friends find out that Bucky's parents used to be big porn stars. Bucky takes it as them being huge movie stars and wants to follow in their footsteps and become a star. So he sets out to California where he meets a good number of people who either try and help him become a star or try to stop him and send him home crying.\r\n\r\nWatching the trailer for this movie, one would think that this is quite possibly one of the dumbest movies to ever be made, and they would not be wrong. This is definitely one of the dumbest movies I have ever watched and it really is downright terrible. However, despite it's terribleness, I did get a few solid laughs out of it, most of which come from a pretty funny Kevin Nealon, and surprisingly it does have one sweet moment or two in it. That didn't make it any better but it definitely didn't hurt the movie either.\r\n\r\nThe real big problem here is this movie does actually have a cast that is either good or have been good in other works. Christina Ricci plays sort of the love interest in the movie and it seems like she's trying to act but really there is no point. Stephen Dorff plays a rival porn actor by the name of Dick Shadow and Don Johnson a director who ends up taking Bucky under his wing, but neither of them really do much with what they're given. Like I mentioned before Kevin Nealon is a running character throughout the movie who is Bucky's roommate and most of his scenes are ridiculous by at the same time a few are actually pretty funny, including one scene with grapes.\r\n\r\nI happen to be a fan of Nick Swardson, at least somewhat. His stand up is actually really good and he's been decent in a few movies here and there but most of the movies he's in either aren't good or he isn't in it much to do anything. This being his first lead role is a shame because this couldn't be worse of a movie to have as your first lead role. Sandler and his crew need to try and make something that's actually worthwhile sometime. The last ten movies or so from the Happy Madison production company have all been terrible and it's not like Sandler doesn't know how to be funny or act because we have seen him do it before.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this movie is without a doubt in the top ten dumbest movies of all time and altogether it is just a really bad movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone, not even die hard Nick Swardson fans.\r\n\r\nRating: D",

This film had all the potential to be a comedy classic or even just a decent film, but the film falters because of a disastrous script filled with uninteresting and poorly developed characters, awful sex jokes (This film contains some of the worst sex jokes I've heard in ages), and the film just reeks of half-assed effort because nothing seemed to have been made with care. Plus, it doesn't help when we are greeted with the sight of seeing Nick Swardson naked (I haven't cringed this much at the sight of a naked man since Sam Mraovich in Ben & Arthur. It's really that bad!), and the viewer is continuously slammed with unfunny tiny penis and masturbating jokes which begin to reach an unbearable level after a short time. One can't also help but wonder how desperate Christina Ricci or Stephen Dorff must be if they agree to star in this awful film (I actually had to resist the urge to yell out, \"Why Christina Ricci?! WHY?!). However, I cannot deny that I did manage to pull a full chuckles from this film mostly from the character Gary because of his random lines and the weird grape scene.

The writer has taken far too much leniency thinking that they are penning for 70's/ 80's audience.\r\n\r\nFor some strange reason every Swardson movie has heroines drooling over him. Why? The hero becoming a porn star just because hhis parents were artist - is simple bad digestion.\r\n\r\nComedy track could have been improvised. Sandler is over-exposing himself. And Tom Brady is already over-exposed.\r\n\r\nSandler makes a good cameo appearance.\r\n\r\nChristina Ricci is pretty and coy. Miriam Flynn must have found acting easy as she was imitating Naghma in Gharana Mogudu. And apart from these two you have Meredith Giangrande (okay), Darrin Lackey and Raza Murad from Bollywood.\r\n\r\nAs from any Swardson movies, editings are good.\r\n\r\nI presume that the fans of Bucky Lawson always order old wine in new bottle every time and that is precisely what is served here, yet again.",

Zero critics enjoyed this movie? Zero? Really? If you're a 'happier than normal' person, don't let the 0% Critics' rating frighten you away from seeing this movie. Critics aren't my favorite people. The tend to be disappointed a lot. I tend to appreciate honest reviewer's insights instead. Hopefully you agree.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I laughed out loud many times and smiled nearly all the way through this film. It's a comedy. We both enjoy Happy Madison productions and only wish we could befriend Sandler and his entire crew. Our days would be filled with more laughter than they already are...\r\n\r\nLet's get to the short of it... if you laughed at the scene in Grandma's Boy \"I can't stop coming. It feels so good!,\" chances are... you'll love Bucky Larson. Ejaculation and facial contortions spawned from those moments of release are abundant in this film. Nick Swardson kills me and his character Bucky doesn't disappoint. He's one of my favorite comedians and comedic actors. Just the sight of him makes me smile. Watching his version of the \"Oh\" face made me laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nBucky Larson is chock full of sophomoric humor, nudity and yes, \"swill\" as some say. I guess to some, just mentioning porn equates to swill. So what? Who cares?. I like my porn and I like my comedy. Both offer relief. Nick Swardson truly delivers the funny throughout the film, but especially during his 'new experience' and climactic moments. Kevin Nealon plays the perfect nightmare roommate. He is a funny, funny man. Christina Ricci is endearing and sweet. Don Johnson's character is an anomaly in the porn industry; known as Miles Deep, a director with integrity and the ability to recognize a very tiny diamond in the rough (bush).\r\n\r\nIs Buck Larson the funniest movie of all time? No, but it's definitely worth the price of admission. If you're a fan of Happy Madison productions. Chances are, you'll like the film. To you critics with nothing nice to say... seemingly ever... did you really think you were going to see a mature, though provoking comedy? Huh? Did-ja?",

I have never seen a movie try so hard to make a story work before. So an idiot with over-exagerrated buck teeth tries to become a porn star with his parents. The comedy is that he has a small penis, which makes his very popular. Funny right? No, it's not funny at all, but for some reason, some of the secondary characters in the film seem very funny at times, particularly Kevin Nealon, who puts a roof over Bucky's head. That being said, this film is in no way funny and it is easily one of the worst of 2011. Every joke that the filmmakers force on you seems like a penis joke every 20 minutes, followed by someone making fun of his buck teeth. Cristina Ricci helps to hold whatever is left of the movie, on it's feet. This film is a great big pile of garbage that made me laugh once or twice!",
