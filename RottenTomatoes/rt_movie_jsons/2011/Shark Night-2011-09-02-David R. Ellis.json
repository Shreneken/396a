    "summary": "Newly arrived at her family's lake-island cabin, college student Sara (Sara Paxton) and her friends prepare for a weekend of fun in the sun. But soon after they dive into the lake, football player Malik (Sinqua Walls) stumbles out of the water with a grievous wound. Thinking Malik is the victim of a freak accident, the friends pile into a tiny speedboat and head for the hospital. To their horror, they discover that they are surrounded by hundreds of massive, hungry sharks.",

            "content": "Like most shark movies a group of beautiful friends heads to a lake house for a fun water sports filled weekend not suspecting that a man eating shark is looking to take a bite out of their fun. \nTypical shark flick although they added in some human predators in a secondary storyline.  The cast makes this better than it should be.  The CGI shark isn't very convincing. Sara Paxton and Katherine McPhee make this an enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "If you're a fan of shark horror, this is worth watching at least once because of all the detail put into the sharks to make them appear realistic. Their unlikely eagerness to attack hapless college students is never explained (were the sharks drugged with something?)  but they used a mix of CGI and practical effects to create beautiful replicas of various species which is what makes this worth viewing. On contrast, I found most of the acting  sy- Fi b movie sharknado quality at best which may be  the fault of the writer as the characters are unsympathetic and not really likable, nor really  annoying enough to be dis likable so you can really enjoy or mourn them getting eaten. You're literally just watching to see how creative the sharks can be with when and how they strike.  Also, I have never figured out the back story with Sara and her ex boyfriend, whether he actually attempted to drown her or whether she was a hysterical teenager that flipped out, jumped to conclusions, ran over and nearly killed her lover with a boat and then dumped him at a hospital without so much as a goodbye. Shouldn't there have been a police investigation into all this? And also, she wears a bikini through the entire film despite it being here house and having access to her own clothing. I mean, after my first friend got  his arm bitten off, I'd sort of feel inappropriate running around in a two piece and a thin robe. If you're going to take someone to a hospital, you usually want to be wearing some pants and sweater because you're gonna be sitting in a waiting room for a few hours at least and you don't want a bunch of people staring at you while you wait for hours to find out if someone will live or not I'd imagine.",

There's too little exciting action, even of the goofy overblown-CGI kind, which is the least that may be expected from this movie. The actual shark scenes are almost always one-sided and dependent on banal contrivances so that people are eaten but there is neither suspense nor actual palpable conflict between man and man-eating fish. \nMuch of the movie centers way too much four rednecks who capture the protagonists, then torment and feed them to the sharks. It's not fun to watch the characters being terrorized. It's not fun watching them being helplessly dropped into the water as shark bait. It isn't fun when one of the rednecks makes a female protagonist strip then drop herself into the water as bait. \nAnd it is not fun in the meantime to watch the romantic dilemma between Sara and Nick, who are obligatory, standard, and do nothing out of the ordinary.",

They're used really well for a horror mechanic, there is almost a Rob Zombie vibe to this one.\n\nThe weirdest part of \"sharks in a lake\" is how the sharks are surviving, or if we believe the movie discussion that it's a \"salt water lake\".  There are lakes of weirder stuff, so a lake of salt water is reasonable, but it is very clear when you are in salt water versus fresh water.\n\nIt is honestly the biggest problem with the movie: the rest makes a lot of sense so it doesn't play with your suspension of disbelief.  The story is well structured, and the actors mostly do a good job.\n\nOverall, it's just not the best movie though.  I personally don't mind forces of nature as adversity / antagonists, I liked \"Crawl\", but it has to done with a good delivery.\n\nI don't feel like I care about the characters or the sharks all that much.\n\nIt feels like there should be options to just stay out of the water, which is what makes \"sharks in the ocean\" scary, its harder to get away.\n\nIn the end its a good watch that feels like it should be a great watch, but that could just be critical thinking defeating my movie experience.",

People complaining that there's not enough shark action in the film... if you want shark action that takes up the entirety of the film then just watch blue planet!. You can't always please everyone but the reviews of this film are just being nit picky and people just trying to downsize a decently made film with some good humour and good panic scenes. People need to stop expecting so much from B-Movies and just enjoy the fact that they are B-MOVIES!!!! I really enjoyed this film and found the characters and actors very enjoyable to watch. If this was a slasher movie people would love it but because it has to do with sharks most critics and viewers expect Jaws-Esque movie quality. Whereas us B-Movie lovers just enjoy these types of films for what they really are.",

I'm also ignoring the fact that people can't see clearly underwater without goggles because every movies with water does this. Shark Night had me constantly rolling my eyes aside from these things. \nFirst of all the opening of this movie wants to be Jaws so bad I got whiplash. A group of \"end of high school kids\", who look like they're in their mid-20s, head off on a vacation to a lake house. On the way they meet a childhood friend/sheriff, an ex-boyfriend, and a couple completely psychotic stereotypical rednecks.  In fact as the movie progresses there end up being more psychopaths, all of varying degree of insane for reasons that also vary in explanation. \nOnce they arrive they have some typical horror movie college bound \"kids\" fun till Uh OH! A shark plucks one out of the water and rips his arm off.... Not eats... just takes it off. Despite this the gentleman makes it to shore and proceeds to bog the rest of the group down as they try to get him help. One would think just stay out of the water... but no. They go back into the water several times (once on a damn skidoo) and loose members of their party one by one to the various lake sharks. Why are sharks in a lake? Because the various psychopaths put them there... somehow.\nThe main villain of this movie I believe was written to be a grotesque man with a disfigured face. They tell this story of how the ex-girlfriend/party member tore his face up with a boat propeller on accident, and now he's doomed to a life of horror!... except he's like a GQ model with a small hardly noticeable scar on his cheek.\nThe whole movie is full of CGI sharks launching themselves out of the water at people in a totally overdone way, stupid people going out into the water despite knowing the sharks are there, psychopaths who are inhumanely crazy to the point where they have no problem murdering people in cold blood for no reason, and a terrible ending of a typical shark jumping at the camera. It has been done and over done better before.",

Then you have the typical redneck, which of course you will find on the way to your giant lake house that has no neighbors close by. Once we get to the house, that's when the mangling and dismembering begins. What they think of as a freak thing, (the shark must have came through the levy after hurricane season), quickly turns into sharks everywhere. \n\nThe sheriff (who plays Harvey on Gotham... love that crazy show), adds some comic relief as the bumbling country bumpkin. Very little nudity, and no sex, just lots and lots of blood. The final reason as to why this is happening makes sense in a twisted way.

One of this film's biggest drawbacks lies in its PG-13 rating; whereas a film like 'Piranha 3D' manages to put forth an incredibly enjoyable effort by going all out, this film almost feels stunted and unfulfilled. \n\nWithout giving too much away, I do have to say that this movie has one of the most ridiculous twists I've ever seen, but it's so far out there that it's almost bitingly perfect. This is one of my favorite unintentional comedies, and for that reason, I cannot completely dismiss it.\n\n***\n\ncertainlycinema.com\nfacebook.com/certainlycinema\nInstagram: @certainlycinema",

The story is your typical teen schlock-fest slasher with no suspense, tacky gore and basic run of the mill characterse: A sexy slutty type, cocky arrogant guy, cool black dude, his hot girlfriend and a nerdy guy, but two of the characters aren't bland and they are played by Sara Paxton and Dustin Milligan as Sara and Nick, the former being a young girl with a past she'd like to forget and the latter a devoted college student desperate to pass his course, and these two alone drive the movie away from most of the generic parts and are actually enjoyable to watch. Paxton is severely underrated, she was incredible in The Innkeepers and Last House On The Left and she is the saviour of Shark Night. The direction is lousy, David R. Ellis throws in fast forward montages accompanied by cheap guitar riffs and the result cheapens the film giving it a TV movie feel, the movie lacks tension, even considering that this is one of the gore-fests there should at least be palpable air of suspense, like Final Destination but instead we get sharks that fly out the water which in turn delivers unintentional laughs, I enjoyed myself at parts but never thrilled.",

Unfortunately, I cannot think of any audiences that would be flocking to see this dribble and come out entertained.\nFor one thing, its editing style is seriously retarded. It cuts back and fourth between fast forwarding its shots and leaving them at a regular pace during various scenes.\nAnd frankly, it's not worth writing a review over but I guess I'm going to have to. It's because Shark Night matches its unintelligent script and poor visual effects with one of, if not the single stupidest plot to have ever been featured in a shark movie.\nEven the idea that there may be some form of cheap fun is too much to ask for from Shark Night, and instead its just a film that must really hate the viewer to be this terrible.\nAlthough Sara Paxton's sex appeal and performance, as well as the performance of Sinqua Walls are generally appealing, Shark Night is a ticking time bomb set to self destruct once it completely disintegrates.",

The story is horrid and gives you easily no reason to give a shit throughout the runtime.

The biggest problem though is the lack of direction or script; in all honesty I don't think the film had either, seriously this felt like really bad improve with cheap effects.  Oh, did I say cheap effects, yup; somehow with a $25 million budget, the film looks like it cost less than a Sci-Fi channel film.  The only reason I gave it a .5/5 instead of a zero was simply because at times, especially towards the end, I laughed uncontrollably just seeing how horrendous it was.

Make no mistake about it, the PG-13 rating for SHARK NIGHT clearly designates both the intended audience and the level of intelligence behind the script. Every attempt to make this movie \"hip\" for the younger generations instead comes off as being trite and cliche, and every move the characters make is utterly predictable... That is, up until the ridiculous final act. Technology has apparently devolved once again, considering that the computerized sharks in SHARK NIGHT look worse than those created 13 years ago in DEEP BLUE SEA. It is also sad to think that a film like this could ever have made it in to theaters, when the quality of the overall production falls behind many of the awful made-for-TV movies that drown the SyFy channel yearly. At least with the 2010 PIRANHA remake, Alexandre Aja knew enough to play up the high camp in the picture, and delivered an abusive amount of gore. There is no fun to be had anywhere in SHARK NIGHT, and it is nearly bloodless. Do not waste your time on this pathetic film. \n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

Sharks give this movie potential, but its not used. The situations are not believable (such as a person losing an arm all the way to the shoulder and walking around afte a little recuperating and no doctors, medicines etc). So this is not quite on par with Deep Blue Sea, but its stil relatively watchable, even though its silly and not really fun at all.",

It has to be one of the worse movies I've seen in ages. Ok the premise, which you can see from the trailer was that some college kids go out to an island surrounded by a salt water lake that happens to have tons of Sharks living in it. Now the question in the movie is 'how did the sharks get in this lake?'. Now when it came to the reveal of this question, it had to be one of the worse reasons ever to why the sharks were there. I mean it was seriously something you would come up with if you were totally drunk!!! So basically the story was crap. Ok lets get onto the death scenes! Now I know a bit about sharks and I can tell you that the sharks in this movie were like......Super or something. We all know that sharks are fast swimmers but these sharks were swimming at Warp Speed!!! (Spoiler alert) I mean there was one scene where a shark jumped out of the water at some speed and bit a guys head off when he was on a Jet Ski!! I was like \"WHAT!!\" Also and I hate saying this but there was a token black guy in the film. Now I'm not going to go into what they did to this guy throughout the film as it just makes me angry!! Let's just say he got it worse than anyone!! By the end of the film I guarantee you that the people who you predict will survive by the end of the film, survives!!! Bottomline, avoid this movie at all costs! Don't buy a cinema ticket, don't rent it, don't even watch it on tv!!! Avoid Avoid Avoid!!!!! OH YES!!! There's more! (Spoiler Alert) After the end credits there is a terrible rap song sung by the cast of the movie obviously about sharks!!! This was the icing on the terrible cake this film made!
