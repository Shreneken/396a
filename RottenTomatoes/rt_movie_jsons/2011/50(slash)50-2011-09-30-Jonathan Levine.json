Gordon-Levitt is solid in lead role, showing an understandably wide range of emotions as he tackles the reality of his own mortality, and Seth Rogen and Anna Kendrick give solid supporting performances (both seem to just play themselves, but that's okay).  Despite the fact that it's horribly predictable from the start and that it sticks closely to the standard Hollywood formula, 50/50 at least has the courage to tackle a difficult subject with a degree of levity.",

But this hit hard.\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt starring 50/50 turns out to be a solid movie with equal amounts of humor, realism and despair. The realism depicted is pretty fresh. Certain character scenes done are exactly how you'd react when someone you care about gets hurt. How one can be ignorant to be the people who care them. Anna Kendrik is in this and she's just adorable and she's a med student so thats an automatic win for me. Wish we could have had a bit more of her. The death and that despair has been handled perfectly it makes you cry at the perfect moments. Joseph Gordon Levitt really made me think what would happen if I were in that situation and how I'd have to handle it.\n\nSeth Rogen is equal part good and equally on the nose but he provides a good balance to the movie.\n\nYeah, this movie is pretty good. I RECOMMEND to watch it. No regrets.\n\nThanks for reading. See you later\u270c",

Why does his story of survival warrant a movie over the thousands of other survivors?  Also, they never explained why he shaved his head when the Kemo causes temporary hair loss.  But my biggest issue is the pacing.  God this thing is SLOOOW!  It has a few chuckles but it is SLOW!  Almost to the point of boring.  Because for something billed as a comedy, because of Seth Rogan, it's mostly a drama.  Bordering on melodrama at times.  Overall, it's not good.  It's not horrible either.  It could have been WAY better but it could have been a lot worse.  I can't fail it but I can give a very indifferent, Meh.",

The cast here of Rogen, Gordon-Levitt, and Kendrick all do a good job of giving a healthy balance to the humor and drama in the film. I thought this film would be more like other Rogen comedies such as pineapple express but I was surprised to find a lot more drama here. Sure there are scenes where Rogen will go on his little comedy tangents but they feel authentic and like a real crazy buddy you might have in real life.\nThe chemistry between the lead of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his therapist Anna Kendrick feels weird and awkward at ifrst but slowly swells into something special.\nCancer is a topic that can be hard to cover in a comedy because so many people face or have loved ones who have faced cancer. Somehow this film navigates the scenes dealing with the serious tones of cancer really well while still making light of the leads crappy situations he is always in. The main character's life could be seen as hard or unfair but the characters do a good job of still pushing forward and finding things to be happy and joyful for.\nI found myself laughing, cringing and getting emotional while watching 50/50. Johnathan Levine really captured something special here. Sure the plot might not have the most grand or shocking story arches ever but the way the film feels so grounded in reality and the way we as humans find humor even in tough situations was special to watch.",

            "content": "This film can only be described as a highly enjoyable, heartfelt trial by fire. I think that the main reason this movie is as funny as it is, as gut-wrenching as it is, and as special as it is is it's blend of chill buddy comedy and romance after breakup story under the solemn shroud of looming cancer. I was struck by the absolute futility, the despair that Adam must be feeling. The scene before the day of his definitive surgery, after fellow cancer patient had recently passed away, after he has expressed how tired of being sick he is, he wants to drive, he angrily kicks Kyle out of the car and calming down he calls Katherine finally saying wistfully \"you would've made a good girlfriend\". After the build up in the first part of the film that wanders through the ever worsening prospect of Adam's life with humorous, sweet and sad predicaments, this moment of despair, this realization of his loss of hope is heartbreaking, what could be the last night with his best friend to end in a fight, to have to leave the prospect of a good relationship, all of this, developed with the air of light comedy and romance, makes for an emotionally crushing window into the inferno that is terminal illness. I'm sure to those who have gone through similar this movie rang true as well, I have been in surgery and I had the same fear as Adam of waking up before the surgery was over. That along with the high emotions the main characters and we feel coupled with the completely normal procedure carried out by the hospital hit hard. But what makes this movie a highly enjoyable window is that it doesn't just show the sorrow of Adam's struggles, it shows the good that a trial by fire can do. Adam is driven down the path of not only bettering his life, but finding the good things he had all along. The moment where he sits next to his mom and asks her how here day was, when he sees the book that Kyle was reading about cancer, he lets go completely of his relationship with Rachael. All of these are poignant moments of growth for the better, but they were hard to come by which makes them all the better. While I choked up a lot in this movie, the parts I loved the most were the genuine moments with Kyle. His bumbling around (and his being played by Seth Rogan) make it seem like the character is just some comic relief that also just brings out the \"friend\" aspect in Adam, getting into misadventures together. I love that he's more than just that. That Seth Rogan got a great character to play, that there's a friend who I know genuinely cares about his buddy to the very end even when they fight and get on each others nerves they're there for each other. That's the kind of friend I want to be. Add to the performances Joseph Gordon-Levitt making the most of every frame with evident anguish under the surface and Anna Kendrick's uncanny ability to look nervous and awkward and there's excellent performances all across the board. Overall this movie was the good kind of rollercoaster, there were some slow and straight sections for sure but they were eclipsed fully by the ups and downs around them. I laughed, I cried, it moved me.",

Before changing his stance to: I haven't been to Canada, I haven't told a girl that I love her\n\n interactions are somewhat awkward, sometimes in a good and justified way, and some are not, for instance, the protagonist has an odd relationship with his parents at first, and though it's marginal, it sheds some light on how much of a \"dick\" you are when don't appreciate your mom's worry, who also deals with a husband with Alzheimer's and feels lonely, hence, she resorts to support groups. \n\nhe also breaks up with his girlfriend, who cheated on him, due to constant stress and issues before his sickness. This shows how relationships are fragile during sickness, especially out of wedlock. He says in one scene: \"it's not like you're my wife\" giving her the option to bail out on him.\n\nI must say that his best friend as vulgar as he is, he's also genuine in his care of him and always tries to cheer him up, and added a much-needed sense of humor during these hard times.\n\nthe story gets bleak towards the second half, a breakup, loss of mates at the hospital, awkwardness with parents and the therapist, and to top it off, the tumor isn't responding to the chemotherapy. \n\nhowever, the movie ends in a joyful tone, and things look up for him after all. He heals and shortly after starts dating his therapist and there the movie wraps up.",

Some Seth Rogen fans may find it disappointing that this film is not a nonstop laugh fest like most Seth Rogen films, but it didn't bother me in the slightest. What my problem was is Anna Kendrick's character. Though the filmmakers make her likeable, the direction they take her character in is extremely predictable from the moment she is introduced.

I get that it's supposed to be a touching tale about someone who goes through one of the worst human experiences in existence, but it falls extremely flat. The biggest disappointment is the writing. The entire movie consists of awkward exchanges between characters and bizarre story elements. So many parts of this movie were just written in to draw tears from its audience. Why did we need Rachael's whole storyline? The in particular just seemed to be there to say, \"Hey, look how terrible this guy's life is! Feel sorry for him!\" The characters didn't learn anything from her character, the audience sure doesn't, so why is she there? A similar technique is used with Katherine. Will Reiser (the writer) just wanted a romance story to make the film feel wholesome and beautiful at the end. She never said anything profound. She never did anything extravagant. She sat there through the whole movie and exchanged choppy dialogue with Adam. How did a relationship blossom from this? Their interactions showed no signs of attraction between the two characters, but they're all of a sudden together and falling for each other. This story was just repulsively clich\u00e9 and jumbled.\n\nAs if this doesn't remove you from the movie already, the actual filming of it leaves much to be desired. So much of the quality of a film lies in how it was shot and framed for the audience. There was so little creativity put into this movie. It never comes alive and gives you more information about the scenes. Even some of the most basic shots that are commonly used to convey information aren't given any attention here.\n\nThe only decent part of the movie is the acting. The actors do the best with the script they were given, and I can appreciate that. Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt make a great team, despite how shallow their characters are. Bryce Dallas Howard does some wonderful work here, even if her character shouldn't be in the movie. She commands most of her scenes with raw emotion that makes her Rachael come to life. Unfortunately, this was probably the wrong role for Anna Kendrick. She has done some great things in her career, but this is not one of them. She requires a character with so much more personality and individuality, something that Katherine does not have in this film.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can't write a pile of dog crap, sprinkle some good actors in there, and try to serve it to me as a cake.",

It\u2019s clear that a lot of this came from personal experience for screenwriter Will Reiser, because this isn\u2019t the Hollywood version of a man fighting cancer, it all feels real. It helps that Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers what could easily be the best performance of his career. He taps into all the emotions of this journey, which did a lot to connect me to his struggles. I cannot express how invested I was with this film. I felt like I was going through this with him, as if it was my own best friend who was dealing with illness and his mortality. I\u2019m not at all ashamed to admit I broke down in tears more than once while watching, and any time a movie can impact me in that way I love it more, because a cathartic outpouring of emotion is a powerful thing. Ordinarily I\u2019m not a big fan of Seth Rogen\u2019s brand of comedy, but he is more controlled in 50/50. This isn\u2019t his movie, and he doesn\u2019t feel the need to steal the spotlight with ill-timed jokes that are more inappropriate than they are funny. Instead, this is Rogen as a real human being, and the picture of true friendship between these men is astounding. There aren\u2019t enough movies that show realistic depictions of male friendship, but this was a powerful example of how to do it right. I always love Anna Kendrick, and she adds a lot to this movie as well, even though she doesn\u2019t have a huge role. It\u2019s in the scenes where she\u2019s attempting to counsel Joseph Gordon-Levitt where some of the more repressed emotions come pouring out. The arc of their relationship is where this movie comes closest to being the clich\u00e9d Hollywood version of the story, but I still love it. 50/50 has so much going for it. Between the powerful story and the great performances, I struggle to find anything to complain about. This is one of those movies that I don\u2019t find to be easy to watch, because it deals with some heavy subjects. It\u2019s hard to see someone so young facing their potential death, particularly because I\u2019ve seen people I know deal with this exact same thing. However, the power of this kind of film is undeniable. It has humor that works, and that gives me some laughs, and breaks up the serious tone of the film. Then it has some darker moments that make me cry. Taking me on that kind of emotional roller coaster is one of the most exhilarating experiences I can have watching a film. I\u2019m sure there are those cynical people who find 50/50 to be lame or uninteresting, but I think it\u2019s close to a masterpiece. ",

Jonathan Levine's execution seems like a TV dramatic episode along with the writer Will Reiser. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is doing some of the best work of his career in here and along with the help of a good supporting cast like Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard and Seth Rogen it pretty much gets it right on performance level. 50/50 even though being of around 100 minutes seems a bit long, slow and quite pretentious and one of the main thing it lacks is carrying out the emotional or intense sequences to the audience.",

Aided by his best friend (Seth Rogen), girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), mother (Anjelica Huston), and therapist turned love interest (Anna Kendrick),.  The basis of the story is Will Reiser's experience with cancer diagnosis and the fragility of human life is always kept within the balance of the script.  The performances are full of wit and tact.

Jonathan Levine does a great job with that as the director. The movie is consistently funny, yet never gets to a point where the serious moments miss the mark. Each important moment feels big. The music led scene before and during the big surgery is exceptional and showcases the good soundtrack choices made for this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Adam Lerner) is tremendous in this. It's one of the best performances of his career, which is saying something. The scene where he's in the car and has his breakdown is incredible. Seth Rogen (Kyle Hirons) is playing the kind of guy he always plays. It's not special, but he gets it right. His chemistry with Levitt was key. Speaking of chemistry, each scene involving Anna Kendrick (Katherine McKay) is delightful, partially because she and Levitt had it in spades. Anjelica Houston (Diane Lerner) and Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael) both also did well in their roles. The screenplay is another huge positive. Most characters are given some depth, the dialogue is sharp, and there's a lot of heart to everything done.\n\nWeaknesses: While I thought his performance ultimately fine, Seth Rogen's character is the one that doesn't fully work. He's overly vulgar to the point where it feels a bit out of place. He's one note and it's not a note that is always funny.\n\nOverall: An incredible movie. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and this is one of his two or three best movies in my opinion. The cast is stellar, the script works completely, and the balance between comedy and drama is perfect.",

The acting by Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick was outstanding; and Rogen, whom I normally avoid like the plague, gave a surprisingly honest and deep performance. The film deals with many issues related to serious illnesses such as cancer, especially in how friends, acquaintances and relatives react to the patient.

            "content": "Cancer, sadly, is something most people need to deal with sometime in their lives, whether it's their own diagnosis or that of a family member or friend. That's what makes 50/50 so believable and relatable. It looks at one young man's diagnosis of a rare form of the disease, the way he copes with the possibility of death, and how his friends and families react to such sad and shocking news. It's a very thoughtful film with one of the best screenplays of the year. I thought it dipped into comedy a little too often, but it manages to cover a lot of ground in a surprisingly smart and emotional way.\n\nAdam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a happy, well-adjusted, and relatively successful twenty-something in Seattle. He's dating a girl, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is way out of his league and has a good job at a radio station with his best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogen), but after complaining of back pain for a while, he visits a doctor and finds out he has a rare form of spinal cancer. With only a 50% survival rate, Adam nearly goes into shock, as do Kyle, Rachael, and Adam's mother (Anjelica Huston). As he begins chemotherapy, he starts seeing a shrink, Katherine (Anna Kendrick). But as those around him begin changing, Adam realizes it's up to him to find strength and the necessary attitude he needs to defeat the disease.\n\n50/50 has three very distinct thirds, and if I had to give them all a grade, I'd say the first third is a solid B+, the second third a slightly worse B, and the final third a definite A. Our introduction to Adam is just what it needs to be, and it's interesting to see the various people that will play different, but equally important, roles in his hopeful recovery. The middle of the film spends a little too much time with Adam and Kyle trying to pick up chicks and not nearly enough time with the underused paring of Phillip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer, Adam's kindly, pot-brownie-eating friends from chemo. I thought the way Adam's relationships with Rachael and Katherine change to be interesting, but like I said, this section of the film suffered a little from Seth Rogen overload.\n\nThe film's final 20-30 minutes, however, are near perfection. It's during this time, that Adam's relationship with his mother shines, and Anjelica Huston seizes the moment by turning out one of the best supporting actress performances I've seen in years. Hell if I know how her name has been kept out of the Oscar discussion, but she's phenomenal, and an easy choice for supporting performance of the year thus far. JGL, of course, is as good as you'd expect, and he has two, maybe three, scenes during this portion of the film that will just break your heart. Anna Kendrick, as well, is fantastic, especially during the film's latter scenes. I was feeling good about 50/50 most of the way through, but my opinion skyrocketed as it inches closer and closer toward its very poignant finale.\n\nI loved 50/50's screenplay for the most part, though I blame Will Reiser (the inspiration for Adam) for the missteps with Rogen. It's not as if the actor is bad (he's doing what he's asked to do), nor is it that the material isn't funny (quite the contrary, actually), it's just that I didn't think it was necessary and I think the crude Apatow-style humor distracted from what was, at its heart, a very moving story.\n\nBut no amount of dick jokes can take away what I ultimately took away from this film: That JGL is one of his generation's best. That Anjelica Huston has still got it. That Anna Kendrick is the real deal. And that it's possible to make a story about cancer that's so relatable I nearly found myself in tears on multiple occasions.\n\nIt's the last point that really made 50/50 so special. So many moments in this film rang true to me. I couldn't help but identify with Adam, despite (thankfully) never going through what he did in the film. And every relationship he found himself in-whether it be with the overprotective mother, the girlfriend who is in over her head, or the young professional trying a little too hard-was easy to accept. Bravo to all involved for making a real winner-the fourth such film already this fall.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/5050-review/",

            "content": "50/50 is a heartbreaking take on the topic of cancer, and will not only manage to bring you tears, but has a decent balance between comedy and drama.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt plays a guy who one day out of the blue got diagnosed with cancer. As the story progresses, we see a lot of what someone in this situation would have to go through, and not only was this movie excellent, but it also felt really genuine. Everything about this movie felt very human and real, and at no point did I feel like this topic was being taken lightly, or being overdone. When watching the characters on screen, it felt like they were actually living through this situation, and at times, it's one that is really a tear jerker. \n\nTo start out, this movie really is a respectable nod to those who are still fighting through this battle. Although there is a couple lines of toilet humor or a couple of raunchy moments, overall the movie had a perfect tone to it. I felt the perfect amount of emotion that I wanted to feel from a film like this, and there were also plenty of moments where I was dying of laughter. Considering this can be a sensitive topic, we don't neccesarily see a ton of movies being made about cancer, but when made, they are normally done right. This movie made a great film out of cancer, and shows many people just how difficult in can be at times. \n\nThe actors were phenomenal in this movie, and I really liked every single one of their performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was superb in this movie, and I truly admire him as an actor even more. He played the role perfectly, and I can't think of anyone else that would've been better for this role. He makes the character his own, and he makes everything feel so real. As I watched him, I completely forgot he was Joseph Gordon-Levitt at times, and I just saw him as a guy who was diagnosed with cancer. He was amazing, and I loved his relationship with Anna Kendrick. Anna Kendrick plays his therapist, and there's no other word to describe them other than cute. They really are cute together, and when watching their relationship evolve and grow, it felt real, and it made me really happy to watch their chemistry on screen. Anna Kendrick was amazing as always, and I'm glad she's carved out a career for herself today. Seth Rogen was also good in this movie, and I actually really liked the banter between him and Bryce Dallas Howard. Both were great in this movie, and their arguing actually made for some of the funnier moments in the movie. \n\nI'll be honest, the first act of this movie was actually pretty slow. I wasn't too interested in what I was watching, and it felt like nothing really happened. It had a couple of weird jokes, and I wasn't entertained by the events that were taking place. I felt that the pacing could've been a bit better in the movie, but as the movie started to progress, I soon found myself loving this film. As the film advanced, it started to gain momentum and I was eventually hooked on it. The second act started to make the movie feel a lot more life like and the script started to feel more natural. Things started to feel less stale and less awkward, and by the time the finale unfolded, I was nearly in tears. \n\nThe script was also great for the most part, and I could just imagine that people actually in this situation would do or say many of the things that they did in this movie, so props to them for that. The movie also had a consistent tone throughout, which is not something you can say for many movies nowadays. It had a great blend between its drama and comedy, and for every comedic joke cracked on screen, there were two more sentimental moments to follow. Although it did a good job of that overall, there were still a couple of jokes that didn't settle well and a few awkward moments, but otherwise, the movie really was a quality produced film.\n\nIn the end, I have to say that this film was nearly perfect. It really touched my heart and it took the topic of cancer, and turned it into something that we can all relate to. I truly mean it when I say this film is worth watching, and if it weren't for the slightly troublesome first act, I would've given this movie a perfect 5 stars.",

He's not the typical whiny cancer kid, and he's not the typical bold pretty boy.

His character is supportive, caring and really caring and it's all by the brilliant performance from Seth and the movie groundbreaking writing. \n\nThe writing is some of the best written comedy and the most down to earth wring I've seen in a while, and I'm still shocked that this movie didn't get a Oscar Nomination for writing. Man f''k the Oscars.\n\nNow I normally don't do this in my reviews and what I mean is like I don't talk about big dramas or something very serious happening in my life, because it's my life and it's private, but now I have to get something out there and I want you all to know why I think this movie is freaking fantastic, is because one of my family members use to have cancer and that was my mum, while she was going through chemo and surgery. I watched her and supported her and I saw her doing extreme and crazy things that she will never do before, and as a person (Like me) who had to go through something so horrible like that and then watch 50/50 a movie that to me get's anything right and the character's that feel like people not movie character's that's why I think this movie is just flawless and get's it right.",

It is a film that easily could have gone to cliched/forgettable territory given its usual subject matter, but which deftly avoids those genre trappings with a truly refined direction and execution.

Anyone can jump to the conclusion that this movie wouldn't work due to the casting of stoner comedy actor Seth Rogen. Not only was Seth Rogen really good but the movie he was in was phenomenal! The plot of 50/50 consists of the life of Adam (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) who finds out that he has a tumor growing in his spine and that there's a 50/50 chance that he will survive. As weird as this sounds, this is most likely the funniest movie about cancer you'll ever see. There a lot of humor that makes a depressing and sad situation seem lighter in heaviness of the fact that Adam may not survive. This adds an on edge experience to an otherwise funny movie. The character of Adam I really enjoyed because of his attitude. He doesn't always accept the fact that he may die and when he does accept that he has a poor attitude and doesn't know how to handle it in the best ways. He lashed out at people and treats them like garbage even. He's vulnerable and nervous and I really believed Gordon Levitt's performance. Seth Rogen was perfectly cast as Kyle, he was the brightness at the end of the tunnel. Like Adam, he couldn't channel his emotions very well either with people. Deep down everyone hides their emotions and even though they don't always show it, they care. Adam wasn't able to realize the way he was treating people until he talked to someone. Katherine was the perfect and believable significant alter for Adam because of the way that they connected with each other and knew each other's flaws when they themselves couldn't realize them. There's also multiple takeaways from 50/50 that apply to everyday life like realizing what you have and treating it respectfully. But not only that but also to find hope at the end of it all. Adam is told to have hold throughout it all and that even though he feels alienated that there are people all around him that care. This whole experience changed Adam's life around as well as everyone around him and while not all of that was positive, he still learned that it's important to have an open mind about the situation. There were more than a few emotional scenes that didn't feel fake or forced, they felt real. When a situation as sad as this feels real, there's something special to behold. 50/50 is not your typical film. At one point it feels like a downer and then brightens up, it made me laugh in one scene and then cry in the next. It was endless entertainment and a really great time to watch. A",

What's more is that the cast have done superlative performances making the protagonists' situation even more moving and dramatic. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen did a fantastic job in portraying a duo of friends who stood by each other through thick and thin. Likewise, the writing is undoubtedly a killer!

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI wasn't blown away with the first film that I have seen from director Jonathan Levine, Warm Bodies, as there were elements of it that showed high potential when read on paper but seeing his execution on screen felt underwhelming. Though even after that experience, I still had high hopes for 50/50, as its premise seemed to show an opportunity for drama and its poster and cast shows that it also could come off as funny. This film could have been the perfect drama-comedy but due to problems in balance prevent it from being so. Nevertheless, 50/50 still has its charms.\n\nThe film's plot of a young and healthy man, who suddenly received news of spinal cancer, was definitely an interesting one. I have seen many films that contain characters who suffer from the disease, but their role always seems to play as a hurdle for other characters to deal with. This time, we see a film that centralizes on the stages during this unfortunate event and ultimately leading to the final destination that determines his prognosis.\n\nThe story features interesting events that I felt was true to life. We get to watch the ranges of emotions that a person would go through when the chance of death is just around the corner. Stages of grief are clearly shown obviously here but the film prevents itself from being predictable in that sense, as though our protagonist does undergo those stages, it is written in such a way that felt personalized rather than an example from a psychological textbook.\n\nThough I was impressed with the film's personal character driven narrative, I was even more impressed with the aspects slightly outside that, which are the relationships that the protagonist has. All figures of his life are given enough time for exploration, and each one could simply be a story on their own. I did have fun watching his relationship with his best friend as it handles the idea of friendship in such a natural way that one can't help but feel a little convinced that these are more than just fictional characters. The protagonist's relationship with his girlfriend and therapist, particularly the former, felt realistic and dealing with problems that one can also find in the people that walk around us; though I did have minor issues with his relationship with his therapist as its ending felt warm but ethically immoral even if he is not her patient anymore, I think my problem is that for a film that contains so many elements that feel organic, why hurt that with a false ending? Both of these relationships were entertaining to watch, none of them though was able to make me care as much as his relationship with his parents. Levine handles it with such tenderness that I was close to showing external sadness towards it.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI wasn't blown away with the first film that I have seen from director Jonathan Levine, Warm Bodies, as there were elements of it that showed high potential when read on paper but seeing his execution on screen felt underwhelming. Though even after that experience, I still had high hopes for 50/50, as its premise seemed to show an opportunity for drama and its poster and cast shows that it also could come off as funny. This film could have been the perfect drama-comedy but due to problems in balance prevent it from being so. Nevertheless, 50/50 still has its charms.\n\nThe film's plot of a young and healthy man, who suddenly received news of spinal cancer, was definitely an interesting one. I have seen many films that contain characters who suffer from the disease, but their role always seems to play as a hurdle for other characters to deal with. This time, we see a film that centralizes on the stages during this unfortunate event and ultimately leading to the final destination that determines his prognosis.\n\nThe story features interesting events that I felt was true to life. We get to watch the ranges of emotions that a person would go through when the chance of death is just around the corner. Stages of grief are clearly shown obviously here but the film prevents itself from being predictable in that sense, as though our protagonist does undergo those stages, it is written in such a way that felt personalized rather than an example from a psychological textbook.\n\nThough I was impressed with the film's personal character driven narrative, I was even more impressed with the aspects slightly outside that, which are the relationships that the protagonist has. All figures of his life are given enough time for exploration, and each one could simply be a story on their own. I did have fun watching his relationship with his best friend as it handles the idea of friendship in such a natural way that one can't help but feel a little convinced that these are more than just fictional characters. The protagonist's relationship with his girlfriend and therapist, particularly the former, felt realistic and dealing with problems that one can also find in the people that walk around us; though I did have minor issues with his relationship with his therapist as its ending felt warm but ethically immoral even if he is not her patient anymore, I think my problem is that for a film that contains so many elements that feel organic, why hurt that with a false ending? Both of these relationships were entertaining to watch, none of them though was able to make me care as much as his relationship with his parents. Levine handles it with such tenderness that I was close to showing external sadness towards it. There was a scene near the end of the film, where the protagonist and his parents are at the pre-operation ward, waiting to be called into surgery; that moment resonated so much with me as I have had many opportunities to care for patients like him and I never really understood the feelings they go through as they always seem to project a persona in front of you telling that they are fine.

Seth Rogen is playing himself in a similar manner as his other performances, and it is probably the best movie he has been in.  Oddly, he doesn't often come off that well, and I don't think he was really meant to in the way he often is.  He is an inept friend who doesn't know how to respond to something as unexpected, serious and seemingly unnatural as a young best friend getting cancer.  Nobody else does either, especially the stricken lad's mother.  Frankly, there is no good way to respond to this sort of thing, only levels of insufficient. \n\nThis is a movie of disarming realness which creeps up on you.  It isn't raw, but it knows when to be harrowing.  The scene where Adam finally breaks down in the car is hard to watch, especially for me because I've seen that breakdown with my own eyes.   50/50 unexpectedly takes the understated approach throughout, this is effective in capturing the banality that makes up most of the life of being a patient.  It is a movie which, due to the trailer and the presence of Seth Rogen, one expects to be like another buddy raunch movie, but it isn't.   I found it to possess a quiet dignity and resonance.  A really good little movie.",

The relationship between JGL and the men he meets at Chemo was equally as compelling and funny and gave an added element to the film to toss you back and forth on that roller coaster of emotions you had no idea a movie like this would insight. \n\nIf you are going just for funny you will be disappointed as this movie isn't just about funny (Which it has) it is about fear, pain, heartache, friendship, family and new beginnings.

            "content": "My 90th R-rated movie, and an interesting and unique look at those who suffer from or survived cancer.  Loosely based off Will Reiser's experience with spinal cancer, 50/50 follows Adam, a public radio journalist, suffering from back pains, goes to the doctor, only to discover he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma, a malignant tumor in his spine (spine cancer), and must try to beat it while going through therapy and dealing with his life.  The film perfectly explores the way a cancer patient goes through life, including doctor appointments, treatments (chemotherapy, surgery, medical marijuana), and wondering what the outcome will be (not trying to scare anyone).  The film details how the case can affect the person and those close to him (friends and family) with their emotions and concerns towards the patient and the doctors.  Will Reiser, who had been diagnosed with spinal cancer in 2005, only to survive by going through a life saving surgery in order to remove the cancer, and was inspired by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to write a screenplay based on his experience, captures everything that goes on in each character's life, as well as evenly following the events throughout.  Jonathan Levine is able to find the right place and time to shoot the scenes, and he nails his part in the production.  The acting is incredible, which includes main stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, and Bruce Dallas Howard in their respective roles, and they are able to find the appropriate reactions for each scene in the film.  The film has an intelligent blend of comedy and drama, and the transition between each genre is perfect, which gives lots of laughs and emotion.  A must-see for audiences and cancer patients.",

Nice day for a jog under Lions Gate bridge. Anyways that's just me. There are couple of humorous moments along the way as Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to keep Adam's (Levitt) spirits up through his 50/50 survival rate cancer diagnosis, treatment, subsequent pot smoking and loss of his bitch of a girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard). Adam is a pretty dull, dry character, the one scene that he got me in however was right before he goes in for his surgery and he's so scared, turning to his mother for comfort. Very raw. I also liked Anna Kendrick as the bumbling therapist. 12.25.13",

Levine never let's the movie fall into generic drama tropes nor let's its heavy content tug away too much at the heart of viewer. The result is a very rewarding experience into one of the most dodgy topics in mainstream Hollywood movies.\r\n\r\nGordon-Levitt, joined by a stellar cast including Anna Kendrick, Seth Rogen, Angelica Huston and Bryce Dallas Howard, shines as the lead character of a young man dealing with the aftermath of learning he has cancer. His performance is poignant, sincere and most important of all - human.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a movie this year that will feel as genuine and thoughtful as this one, and despite a few short comings in some of its cinematography (poor lighting, interesting angles) this is definitely a dramedy worth bringing into any list regarding the best of the best in 2011.\r\n\r\nIts at times funny, at times tough to watch, and very often cathartic, especially with any audience that can relate to the subject matter. Definitely worth seeing for the journey of Gordon-Levitt's character and phenomenal performances by Angelica Huston and Seth Rogen.",

            "content": "While it could have gone the route of being maudlin and going for a cheap emotional gut punch, 50/50 is a fairly well-written, honest portrayal of someone who finds out they have cancer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a guy who \"doesn't smoke...and recycles\" but finds out that he has a rare form of spinal cancer. Together with his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and a novice therapist (Anna Kendrick), he eventually comes to terms with his condition despite the many setbacks he experiences. Chief among these is a cheating girlfriend (Dallas Bryce Howard). I mean, what girl would cheat on her boyfriend after he finds out he has cancer? That was pretty low, and made her character extremely unlikeable. Of course, most of the central cast is unlikeable in some way. Adam becomes kind of a prick once he finds out about his condition, although this is somewhat understandable. Less understandable, although it's intrinsic to the type of characters Seth Rogen usually plays, is Kyle who uses Adam's condition as a way to hook up with women. Even though I can understand that someone who finds out they have a potentially terminal illness might use it to score, actually seeing it play out in a movie was kind of crass to me. Thankfully, the film doesn't stay there. Generally speaking, the plot was rather predictable in terms of the romantic aspect. You just kind of know that after Adam breaks up with his girlfriend he'll eventually end up with his cute therapist because that's just the way things work. I can almost forgive it since Anna Kendrick played such a dorky, likeable person, but cliches are still cliches. I also didn't buy her for a second as someone working on their doctorate. Still, the performances were generally good and I couldn't really find fault with anyone. What really saved the film for me from being just a run-of-the-mill \"cancer comedy\" (kind of odd to see those two words juxtaposed) were a couple of key scenes late in the movie which provided the emotional weight needed to anchor the film and provided a counter-balance to the crude humor that one would expect from a comedy starring Seth Rogen. But even though Seth Rogen is in the film, this is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's movie all the way and he does a great job of carrying it. Overall, I liked it a little more than I thought I might at first. The plot is rather predictable and cliche at times, but there was a lot of humor and heart that lifted it beyond other similar films.",

This film has to also talk getting help from someone. Adam has cancer and go's to therapy and dumps his girlfriend for cheating on him.

            "content": "Murder by Numbers?\n\n 50/50 is a hip indie comedy drama starting Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogan, the film aims to tackle the subject of cancer, an interesting pick for any movie. But I suppose the reel question is will 50/50 be Broken or Bad?\n\n You know sometimes a film can surprise you, and sometimes it can be as obvious as they come, and some times, just sometimes a film can feel by the numbers, 50/50 does all 3.\n\n The film is an independent movie and boy does it show, the film is both themed, scripted and directed as if it's must tick every single box that an Indie film must fore fill. Two main characters, played by two sort of well-known actors? Check. A acoustic soundtrack? Check. A little to moderate amount of soul searching? Check. A amount of peril introduced early on? Check. A musical montage for the finale? Check. And so it goes on and on.\n\n However, 50/50 did surprise me, it is in fact a neat little comedy drama, both about friendship and cancer. Any film about cancer must be a hard sell to make, but somehow the film got made and the world might just be a little bit of a better place because of it. I'm not saying the film is ground breaking in anyway, however it was a pleasant surprise.\n\n In the same way as I was surprised I was also underwhelmed by it all, (I know that sounds like a contradiction but stay with me) the film has no real surprises, you could watch the first 15 minutes and accurately guess the ending of the movie. But this in its self asks the question of, why do we watch films like this? If we know the ending before we start why bother?\n\n Personally? I think it's just for the sheer enjoyment of cinema, to see those little moments you hadn't predicted on, and to view the ones you had play out on screen in front of you is the joy of a film like 50/50, it also does try and take a stab at a very difficult subject and brings it out so well.\n\n That's what I liked about 50/50 was that it felt realistic. The movie didn't come across forced or as if it was trying to impress anyone, 50/50 appears to be made so people might think differently about cancer and the people who suffer from it. For it's guts alone 50/50 deserves to be seen.\n\n To the films credit it is incredibly well acted, but I expect nothing less than perfection from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick. The film is sprinkled with a couple more familiar faces however it was interesting to watch Seth Rogan play pretty much the same roles he always plays. I can't tell if I enjoyed his performance yet or not.\n\n 50/50 does have one major drawback which should be raised. The film has a kind of morbid and nasty view on women, all of the female characters are either used or neglected. I find it difficult to accept Seth Rogan's treatment of them in particular, but maybe that's just me.\n\n 50/50 is worth the gamble of your time and effort to watch, it's a film that has the right measure of almost everything, apart from gender politics.",

The comedic aspects of the movie are funny and charismatic, and the dramatic aspects are emotionally powerful and heart wrenching.  \r\n\r\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood, and he delivers possibly his best performance in 50/50. He always brings a likable presence to his characters, even when he does things that make him come off as an asshole, you feel sympathy for him because you understand that he's been put in such an impossible situation. Seth Rogen is hilarious as always and Anna Kendrick is adorable.\r\n\r\nHaving been written by a cancer survivor, the script feels authentic and genuine. It never makes fun of having cancer, but rather it uses comedy to offset the tragedy of the situation, and reminds us to look on the brighter side of life even during the harshest of circumstances. \r\n\r\n50/50 is a wonderful film that will make you appreciate life even more and allows you to experience the heartbreak through genuine human drama. It's a realistic and intelligent approach to a comedic look at living with cancer.",

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor... He was phenomenal in Brick, awe-inspiring in 500 Days Of Summer, and incredible in Inception, Looper, and The Dark Knight Rises; but 50/50 was the film that sold me on Gordon-Levitt being a Hollywood A-lister. His performance in this film is nothing short of breathtaking. Seth Rogen was also incredible in a role somewhat outside of his comfort zone.

Immediately changes start to occur in various aspects of his life. His seemingly kind but selfish girlfriend decides to stick around but isn't so sure of what to do with the situation. His overly worrisome mother threatens to move in and increases the frequency of her calls. His sex obsessed best friend sees an opportunity to turn the illness into prime wingman material. And on top of this his newly assigned therapist is still involved with her doctorate and currently only has three patients, including him, and doesn't do a very good job of hiding her lack of experience. Through all this Adam finds it hard to know exactly how to react to his unfortunate predicament, happy to stay relatively relaxed and let time and therapy take its course. But as the chemotherapy and people around him start to take their toll, it becomes more difficult to stay cool as the foreboding reality that he may not live through this looms ever closer.\n\nOn the surface this might seem like a pretty predictable affair. A person gets some bad news about their life and they have to adapt to it while dealing with everything else going on, perhaps not quite feeling the full impact of the situation until much later. What makes 50/50 work though is that it makes us care deeply about the main character and his situation, keeping almost the entire experience firmly rooted in his shoes, so we see what he's feeling, where, when and with which people. This can more or less be laid squarely on the shoulders of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, without whom none of this would have worked. What the actor does is extremely subtle as there's nothing particularly overt about Adam; he's not very outspoken, he's quite reserved and seems to be a bit of a hypochondriac (he refuses to drive or even try for the license because of the safety risks). Yet Levitt makes him into a constantly engaging, likeable individual almost effortlessly. He's basically just a nice guy who's had some terrible news befall him, over which he has no control. Most people can relate to that. As time goes on and his situation becomes direr, he begins to reflect upon the important things and people in his life and eventually starts to realise his mortality and questions whether or not he's actually ready to accept the reality that he may not win this battle. All these struggles and emotions are plaid out in the actor's face and bodily gestures with complete conviction and many times without dialogue. There are a couple of hard hitting dramatic moments in 50/50 and it all comes from Levitt. Hard to believe this guy was once that geeky little kid next to John Lithgow in Third Rock from the Sun.\n\nThe supporting cast is short but full of talent, both old and new, and they all have interesting roles to play, while never outshining the main actor. Seth Rogan, as Adam's best friend, plays his usual foul mouthed shtick and it provides some of the film's funniest moments. Also on the comedic side are Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer who are instantly likeable as a couple of old time cancer patients. Bryce Dallas Howard isn't in the movie for too long but has a pivotal role to play as Adam's girlfriend. Angelica Huston is her usual reliable self, having to play Adam's smothering mother who while tends to worry about everything still manages to provide that supportive blanket, despite having a husband suffering from Alzheimer's and a son who hardly talks to her. Lastly there's Anna Kendrick, who plays Adam's disorganised, inexperienced therapist. Kendrick is starting to prove a considerable talent since her oh so long ago appearance in the Twilight movies. Like Levitt, her role isn't very showy but is instantly likeable because the actress is so charming and she manages to bring out the vulnerabilities in Katherine without turning her into an emotional wreck. She's not the typical love interest with emotional baggage, she's far more interesting than that and a lot of the humour in the movie comes from her trying to vainly keep a professional face and not get emotionally attached to her patient. She and Levitt also have great chemistry together.\n\nA film starring a character who is potentially heading for his death bed is not what would instantly come to mind for the idea of a comedy. But while 50/50 does contain some very real drama, it also has a light hearted edge. The main character's relatively easy going, no care at all demeanour means that the spectre of his illness is never overbearing in the first half of the movie. Life carries on for Adam and the various idiosyncrasies in his life that occur out of his situation make for quite entertaining scenarios. Whether it's using his illness to pick up girls, awkwardly interacting with his amateur therapist or exchanging witty banter between fellow cancer patients, it's all quite heart-warming while also darkly humorous. Eventually things do become grimmer, but it's not a tonal shift. While the situation for the characters may have changed, the irreverent tone still remains. Even so, what really struck me about 50/50 was how powerful it became, setting up this perfectly realistic scenario and digging deep into the humanity behind it, in all of its humour and all of its suffering. Great films pull you into the character's struggles and so we ride the same wave of emotions they do. Adam goes through a lot in this film, and so do we.\n\n50/50 has a familiar premise but an unorthodox way of presenting it. Mixing humour and terminal illness seems ill advised but when handled as well as this, it doesn't matter. Ultimately it works because the comedy is low key and comes from the character moments as they interact with the situation, rather than from the situation itself. It makes for an entertaining, thought provoking and at times an emotional experience. This is proof that serious subject material can be handled with a light touch when done carefully.",

As Adam begins to discover how hard it is to deal with his unfortunate situation, and to maintain various relationships in his life, he begins seeing a counselor who might prove to be just as helpful personally as she is professionally. The objective of the film is to remind us that friendship and love, no matter what bizarre turns they take, are the greatest healers in life and I feel like they succeeded in doing that Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a nice chemistry together.

            "content": "Dramatic Comedy is a tough genre. Sometimes they are too serious and not funny and sometimes they are too funny and it's too much of a comedy. The movie is called 50/50 but the drama to comedy ratio is more like 80/20. Joseph Gordon Levitt start as a 27 year old man who gets diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and is given a 50/50 shot of staying alive. Seth Rogan is his best friend and he is hilarious as always. Levitt goes to a treatment center and meets two older cancer patients and they are also very funny, but other than that this movie was straight up drama. \n\tIs 50/50 a good movie? Eh, yes, it has a lot of emotion and Joseph Gordon Levitt makes the character very believable. Cancer is a very hard thing to live with affecting so many people. He has a girlfriend and she eventually shows her true colors. A lot of the scenes in this movie felt real. The relationships between Levitt and other characters felt real and how he treats them was expected. He didn't want a therapist so he gives her attitude. He is sick of his overbearing mother so he ignores her. He and his girlfriend don't have the best relationship which in this situation can be expected. It was Rogan and Levitt that had the best relationship because we see Levitt's character smile and be normal. It was good for him and better for the movie.\nThe comedy came in at the right and wrong time but it really lacked. This movie straight up wasn't that funny. Rogan is the center of all the comedy, as he should have been, but I wanted to laugh more in this movie. I expected to laugh more in this movie. When the comedy was there it was hysterical. Something happens between Levitt and his girlfriend and Rogan's character is right in the middle and you can tell this scene was written by Rogan himself or completely improve. I was laughing so hard in this moment and a few others but the core of the movie is a cancer story.\nThe dramatic moments are really well done but the majority of the movie is predictable. You have seen this movie before time and time again but it is still entertaining. I expected something a little different than what I got but predictable does not always mean bad. There were a few moments and outcomes I did not see coming but the majority I could have written myself. At first Levitt hates his young therapist. He is 27 and she 24, and it is obvious they grow on each other and become a love interest in the least expected of ways. \nIn the cancer treatment center Levitt meets these two old guys who also have cancer and they are a riot. The first scene with the three of them was great. One of them gives Levitt pot cookies and that whole scene is great and hysterical. When the three of them are together it is pure entertainment, but then the drama bug comes around and kills one of them and we never see Levitt interact with the remaining one again. That was a shame but it was a big reality punch in the face. I felt really sad when he died and it hit me as hard as it hit Levitt. This movie touched me as it probably touched most people because we all know somebody who has cancer or is affected by another family member who has cancer. \nIn a more cheerful note Seth Rogan is in this movie. I love Seth Rogan, he may play the laid back pot head in every movie but he does it so well. There are few people who could pull off what he did. He made a terrible situation not as terrible. He isn't laughing at cancer or saying it isn't a big deal, but he is saying it isn't the end of the world. You may have less time than the rest of us and that is unfortunate but he tries to make the best of it for his friend. Yeah there is that one scene where they use it to get laid but come on that would probably work in real life. \nOverall 50/50 is a dramatic comedy and one of the better ones I have seen. I'm not crazy about this genre but I am crazy about any movie Seth Rogan is in. I had doubts going into this movie and as predictable and emotional as it was, I did enjoy it. I had fun with this movie through my laughs and fighting back of tears. The characters all felt real and the endgame of all of them felt real. Levitt's father in the movie has Alzheimer's disease but in all honestly I thought it was wasted. I think he was supposed to be used for comedic relief but he isn't really used. He says a few lines but other than that he stands around and looks stupid. There were a lot of things I liked and a lot I didn't but it is still a solid movie I found entertaining so it gets a very high WillyT Recommendation.",

            "content": "Inspired by a true story 50/50 takes us on the journey of Adam, your typical nice-guy who is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, that no one can pronounce. The movie takes on a light-hearted comedy vibe early, but later on the film takes a serious turn and we see how horrific the cancer is and how it is eating at Adam from the inside out.\n\nDespite the story line early on being somewhat predictable and a pair of obvious product placements, 50/50 was an enormous success, definitely being one, if not the best comedy/drama movies ever seen. The incredible directing by Jonathan Levine, gets everything right, the unexpected diagnosis, the overbearing mother, the girlfriend that will not touch him, the unexpectedly not so self-centered best friend, the cute therapist, and of course the cancer ridden protagonist. From the on-point cinematography by Terry Stacey and the realistic, depressing, yet still comedic writing of Will Reiser, to the incredible acting performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick, both of whom never cease to amaze me. It is the perfect blend of comedy and drama, with a stone-cold message about friendship and illness, but still including the comic relief that makes life tolerable.\n\n Typically I find that comedies, whether it be a TV show, a stand up comedian, or a movie are best enjoyed with friends. This movie however, exceeded my expectations and was definitely appreciated although I watched it alone, in my bedroom, on a Saturday night. This film definitely deserves much more recognition, as it is an unsung hero of the film word.\n\nThe very first thing I noticed about this film was that it was set in my hometown of Vancouver, B.C. and although it was meant to be set in Seattle, Washington I suppose we can let them go on this one. I am not however, letting them off the hook when Adam, during a nervous breakdown says \"I've never been to f*cking Canada\", seriously... this was filmed in Vancouver, CANADA.",

The writing was beautiful. It embraced every aspect to the story that even the smallest parts were as if they were the huge ones. In the scene where Joseph Gordon-Levitt has dropped off Seth Rogen at his house, Gordon-Levitt goes to the bathroom and notices that Rogen has a book called \"Facing Cancer Together\"  and when Gordon-Levitt opens up the book you see that there are sections underlined and arrows pointing to important information. 50/50 is full of scenes like this and that's what makes it so impactful and emotionally rewarding.\n50/50 probably gets a bad wrap for being the movie that makes fun of cancer, but it doesn't, not even close. It takes cancer and instead of making it dreary and somber, it becomes a film that can mask the sadness and put something incredible in its place, even beautiful.",

What we have here is one of the funniest movies of 2011 as well as one of the most heartfelt. Its sentimentality is not to a fault in this case, and the comedy workds surprisingly well. \n\nThe actors have a great chemistry all around, and the performances are rock solid from a great cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a surprisingly plausible performance. Not that he is bad, but he has become such an icon that you usually see nothing but the actor playing himself. \n\nThe movie goes back and forth between drama and comedy with wit and easy thanks to a clever script.
