    "summary": "Motion pictures may have put Broadway director Chester Kent (James Cagney) out of a job, but he quickly finds a second career producing musical sequences for the movies. Unfortunately, a cutthroat competitor keeps stealing his ideas. That cannot happen on his next commission, a rush job for a big-time theater chain. If his work impresses, it'll lead to an exclusive contract. Chester has only three days, but with the help of his smitten secretary, Nan (Joan Blondell), he just might pull it off.",

Truly a one-of-a-kind figure in Hollywood. All the regulars - Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, the fabulous Joan Blondell, and the great Jimmy Cagney doing what you don't get to see Cagney do that much - sing and dance. What a treat!",

            "content": "FOOTLIGHT PARADE (Warner Brothers, 1933), directed by Lloyd Bacon, with dance direction by Busby Berkeley, is the third of the Warner Brothers backstage musicals, following 42nd STREET and GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933, and while the plot by now is getting predictable with the show must goes on theme, the production numbers that take up the last 40 minutes of film make up for it. Movie tough guy James Cagney stars as Chester Kent, a famous director of stage musicals on Broadway, who finds he might be out of the job because of the advent of talking pictures, which is becoming big business over the now pass\u00e9' stage shows. Kent, who works for Al Frazier (Arthur Hohl) and Silas Gould (Guy Kibbee) productions, comes up with the idea of staging \"prologues,\" (musical shows that precede a feature movie), but the hardest thing for Kent to do is to think up how to have them presented. During the course of the story, Kent has female troubles: his wife, Cynthia (Renee Whitney) who wants to divorce him; Nan (Joan Blondell), his loyal secretary who secretly loves him; and Vivian (Claire Dodd), a former friend of Nan's out to gold dig on Chester, almost becoming a fly in her web. As Kent burns himself out in prologue preparation, he finds his ideas are being stolen by an employee who gives it to a rival producer; and Kent's other secretary, Bea (Ruby Keeler), a former vaudeville headliner, returns to the stage after getting groomed up from a bespectacled homely sort with close-cropped hairdo to a charming looker with liberated ideas, mainly because she now has her eye on a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Scotty (Dick Powell), who gets promoted to leading man of the Chester Kent prologues. During the dress rehearsals, songs \"Ah, the Moon is Here\" and \"Sitting on a Backyard Fence\" (written by Sammy Fain and Irving Kahal) are performed. Then with his female problems resolved, Kent succeeds into keeping his staff rehearsing day and night before the Broadway tryout night in order to prevent his ideas from ever leaving the theater.\n\nThe highlight of the movie begins with the curtain rising, followed by three lavish production numbers back to back, which gets better with each passing performance. The first prologue is the somewhat mediocre \"Honeymoon Hotel\" (written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin) with Powell and Keeler as a couple who musically encounter comedic and romantic moments while on their honeymoon in a hotel in Jersey City; \"By a Waterfall,\" (written by Fain and Kahal) the second prologue, starts with Powell and Keeler singing the tune before it changes into a lavish water ballet with hundreds of bathing beauties doing geometric patterns and perennial twisting snakes effects before forming into a human fountain. This number alone, worth the price of admission, predates the MGM/ Esther Williams swim musicals by a decade, but without going overboard. The final prologue, \"Shanghai Lil\" (written by Warren and Dubin) features Cagney (substituting for an appointed leading man who becomes drunk), as Bill in Shanghai who looks high and low for his Shanghai Lil (Keeler). After a barroom brawl, he finds her, sings the title song and goes into a tap dance number before the bugle sounds recalling all sailors to return to their ship. This is highlighted by military march formations and shot gun salute. All three prologues run about ten minutes each.\n\nWhat makes FOOTLIGHT PARADE interesting to see today is looking back at when it was made (1933), only a few years after talking pictures have taken over the screen, and how advanced the choreography has become since the 1929/30 movie musical days, thanks to Busby Berkeley. Character actors, such as Frank McHugh as the assistant dance director; Hugh Herbert and Ruth Donnelly; along with Billy Barty participating in two numbers, all do their best in the comedic moments. Inasmuch as Joan Blondell and Claire Dodd were screen beauties in their day, somehow the headdress they were presented here make them appear a bit older than their true age. And look closely in the earlier portion of the story where Cagney, Kibbee and Gordon Westcott go into a movie theater to watch the finish of a \"talking\" picture that's playing, a western featuring John Wayne, Frank McHugh and Marceline Day in THE TELEGRAPH TRAIL.\n\nThanks to frequent television and theatrical revivals over the past decades, FOOTLIGHT PARADE has, and remains, a favorite movie musical past-time.",

Footlight Parade opts for a complex web of romantic entanglements that are each barely touched on and include characters that look so similar you'll have trouble keeping them in order. The film relies on spoken word song for a surprising proportion of its numbers, and shows its age a bit more clearly than some of its contemporaries in terms of racial perceptions, popping up at unexpected moments that make you turn your head. The most redempive parts of the film are the impressive choreography (which only shows up for the final half hour) and Cagney, who displays a versatility and showmanship that you wouldn't expect based on his better -known films, apart from Yankee Doodle Dandy. If I were looking for a representative of this style of film, Footlight Parade would not be my first choice; others reach greater heights in their showmanship and have more creative stories.

            "content": "This is a fantastic film that saves its best for last.  It starts off as a good Cagney-Blondell pairing, with him playing a theater producer whose job is in trouble with the advent of \"talkies\", and her playing his hardworking, intelligent secretary.  It ends with a couple of absolutely STUNNING musical numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley - 'By a Waterfall' and 'Shanghai Lil'.   The sets are spectacular, as are the visual effects Berkeley creates with overhead camera shots - just have a look on youtube.   \n\nCagney is a delight to watch in his film, which has him in a role different from his usual gangster typecasting.  He's marvelously light on his feet, both when he shows performers how it's done early in the movie, and then later when he 'fills in' for a guy who has had too much to drink to perform 'Shanghai Lil', which is set in a Chinese den of iniquity.  The banter and comedy throughout the movie keeps it entertaining, with the exception of Hugh Herbert, who's in a whiny, annoying role.  There's also lots of 1933 eye candy here, with dancer's legs, skimpy outfits, and bathing suits abounding, helped along by the movie being pre-Code.  Related to that and as a small side note, I thought it was funny to see Claire Dodd, wide-eyed, reading a book called \"Naughty Stories\" with a vamp on the cover.\n\nAs for the other leads, Dick Powell is not my favorite but he's passable, and Ruby Keeler is a joy, playing a cute secretary who transforms into a performer.  There are some cringe-inducing moments, including Keeler as an Asian woman during 'Shanghai Lil, singing some broken English lyrics which may make you think of the clich\u00e9 'me love you long time'   (one of the actual lines: \"I miss you very much, a long time, I think that you no love me still\").  Earlier in the film, Cagney will brainstorm for themes in his musicals and hit upon one with \"African slaves\" (after other wacky ideas, e.g. \"Frankenstein\"), and later, after seeing a bunch of African-American kids playing in the water from a fire hydrant, he'll quip \"That's what [we] need - a modern waterfall splashing on beautiful white bodies.\"   You have to forgive the film for those transgressions, which are relatively small for the time period. \n\nOverall - very entertaining and an absolute blast in some places, with Cagney and Berkeley turning in outstanding work.  Great film.",

            "content": "Footlight Parade is the story of a theater producer who moves into the business of producing prologues, which apparently are short stage shows that the movie houses would present before the feature film. The greatness of this film basically begins and ends with the marvelous musical dance numbers that were choreographed by the amazing Busby Berkeley. In particular there is one routine in the water (to the tune of \"By a Waterfall\") which had me positively dumbstruck. The story of the film feels like a rather unimaginative stage play, and the way the characters interact just reinforces that feeling. In many ways this is something that could easily be pulled off in a theater production because there are limited sets, and the dialogue and overall plot would fit in with other Broadway-style musicals. But those final 3 dance numbers that we are shown are the one thing that could never have the same impact unless you see them presented on film. Perhaps that's another flaw of Footlight Parade, because it seems to imply that all these prologues are some kind of live performance, but the way it is presented would never work for an audience in a theater to see, particularly the one in the pool.\n\nTo reiterate, the music numbers were one of a kind. I only wish they were scattered throughout the picture, instead of lumped one-after-another at the end. Also when you have a truly remarkable number like \"By a Waterfall\" it should be the finale of your film, but they actually sandwich it in the middle of the three big performances. I understand why they did it story-wise, because they wanted the moment that James Cagney took the stage to be momentous and be the thing that turns the tide, but it didn't work for me as a final climax. Speaking of Cagney, I think he does good enough with what he's given. He might have an overly gruff personality for some of the more delicate moments he is given, but when he takes on his \"partners\" it is a moment that totally suits him. Joan Blondell is charming but under-utilized. I think most of the humorous moments were because of her character, and she did well with that. Honestly I didn't have any huge problems with the cast, the sets, or the cinematography. I just didn't care about the story. I was uninterested, and I genuinely think that offering those big brash musical numbers more frequently might have made the experience better.",

The obvious highlight is \"By a Waterfall\", a jaw-dropping masterpiece of both choreography and cinematography, the definitive Berkeley creation. It's stunning, breathtaking. The pieces that bookend it aren't quite as dazzling, but still loads of fun. \"Honeymoon Hotel\" is a cute and clever number with some racy suggestions (and Billy Barty!). \"Shanghai Lil\" lets Cagney show off his song & dance skills, including a terrific tap routine with Ruby Keeler. If there are minor instances of very mild racism, they're more than offset by the multi-ethnic performers, a rare occurrence at the time. All three big productions are all crammed into the end of the film, which is the film's biggest downfall. The first hour contains only one dance number (\"Sitting on a Backyard Fence\") and one song (\"Ah, the Moon Is Here\"). Although both are delightful, the movie needs a little more to break up a somewhat ho-hum plot. There's some witty dialogue, and Cagney is dynamic enough to hold your attention (though I'm not really a fan of his), but the story just seems to go around in circles, albeit at a breakneck pace. But it's all enjoyable enough, and well worth it for the \"By a Waterfall\" payoff.",

I suppose this was done once upon a time. The prologue production business, it seems, is very cutthroat and Cagney's ideas for shows are stolen and used by the competition before Cagney can even stage them - leaving Cagney at a disadvantage to sign a lucrative deal with the theater owners. \r\nBusby Berkeley's production numbers are spectacular in this. Especially the aquatic number which is a sight to see. The huge waterfall with hundreds of swimming girls - I'm sure they can assemble and disassemble that massive thing and fill it with a million gallon of water right before each and every movie show - YEAH RIGHT! I said to check your logic at the door before entering, didn't I?\r\nThis is still the pre-code era so scantily clad chorus girls are de rigueur. \r\nDidn't I mention that Cagney dances in this too? and he does...quite marvelously at that! \r\n \r\nThis is pure 1930's kitschy fun!",

The acts were a whole other story!  This movie should be seen for the water act, \"By the Waterfall\", alone!!  I simply couldn't believe the choreography involved and just when you think you've seen something amazing, another splendor splashes across the screen.  And who couldn't help but feel for Cagney's secretary, Joan Blondell, who just couldn't catch a break throughout the whole film.  That is the type of woman any man would love to have, and finally Cagney got it right... its too bad the lights went out at the end!
