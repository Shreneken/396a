    "summary": "When the tiny nation of Freedonia goes bankrupt, its wealthy benefactor, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), insists that the wacky Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) become the country's president. Sensing a weakness in leadership, the bordering nation of Sylvania sends in the spies Pinky (Harpo Marx) and Chicolini (Chico Marx) to set the stage for a revolution. As Firefly clashes with the Sylvanian ambassador (Louis Calhern), plenty of mayhem ensues, and the countries verge on all-out war.",

            "content": "This movie is wretched. I hated every moment of it almost universally. I've liked other Marx brothers films in the past, but this was profoundly upsetting. As satire goes, it feels as pointy as a sponge. The humor almost never feels like it's appropriate to the conversation or scene going on, and I literally laughed twice during the whole movie. Apparently, I'm in the minority here, but from where I'm sitting this movie blows chunks and I wish I could get the hour and change of my life I spent watching this back so I could watch paint dry, or pick lint from between my toes or do literally anything else.",

            "content": "A crescendo of madness and increasingly silly slapstick comedy.\n\nDirector Leo McCarey's slapstick war comedy Duck Soup (1933) is a real pleasure even nearly a century later. McCarey's direction delivers musical numbers, slapstick routines, and verbal satire for a delightful comedy classic. I appreciate Duck Soup more as the older I get, the more I understand and enjoy all the verbal jests. McCarey makes Duck Soup a real blitz of humor that slams its way into your heart. Duck Soup is a tight 69 minutes thanks to editor LeRoy Stone's slick cuts directly from joke to joke without missing a beat. \n\nWriters Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar, Arthur Sheekman, and Nat Perrin provide humor lambasting nationalism and blind patriotism for brilliant satire years before Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. I loved the clever verbal jokes from Groucho and Chico, especially the silent comedy from Harpo. The physical comedy and slapstick stuff still works effortlessly to get tons of laughs. Henry Sharp's cinematography has tons of wide shots with only a few select close-ups, so that we catch all the visual set-ups and gags.\n\nGroucho Marx spews out tons of witty dialogue as new leader of Freedonia Rufus T. Firefly. I like that even if a joke goes over your head, Groucho just moves onto the next gag or bit of wit without losing a step. He's excellent as the idiotic political leader. Harpo Marx is hilarious as Pinky the silent spy. His prop work, cutting things in half, and messing up is excellent mime work. Silent comedy often ages well and Harpo's visual gags had me screaming. Chico Marx is a riot as Chicolini the spy with quick wit and a neat foil for Harpo to play off. Zeppo Marx aids Groucho's humor as Firefly's secretary Lt. Bob Roland. He complements Groucho's smarter humor nicely.\n\nMargaret Dumont is great as the uproariously silly sponsor of Freedonia Mrs. Gloria Teasdale. Her jokes opposite Groucho work well. Louis Calhern is excellent opposite Groucho as the constantly insulted Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Raquel Torres is super pretty as the femme fatale Vera Marcal. I loved Edgar Kennedy's blowhard, blustery lemonade vendor. It's great that half of Duck Soup has nothing to do with politics and is just Chico and Harpo ruining a lemonade stand vendor's entire life.\n\nComposers Harry Ruby, Arthur Johnston, Bert Kalmar, and John Leipold play around with boisterous army marching orchestral music. I liked Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar's satirical patriotic songs.\n\nIn conclusion, Duck Soup is hysterical and clever for a timeless piece of satire and slapstick alike.",

            "content": "Probably the Marx Brothers' most famous comedy, \"Duck Soup\" is a hilarious and wacky slapstick comedy that even manages to take a stab at politics. Groucho plays Rufus Firefly, who is appointed the new president of Freedonia. He has a dubious stance on work ethic and attempts to cut work hours by reducing the length of employee lunch breaks.\n\nMrs. Teasdale, who has donated twenty million dollars to the failing country, becomes the object of affection for Rufus, who has to battle for her hand against Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country Sylvania. Soon their tumult escalates and war is declared between the two countries.\n\nMost people who comment on this film seem to indicate that they saw it at a very young age and have grown up with it. I can honestly say I wasn't given the opportunity to ever see it until recently, when I finally managed to watch it on Turner Classic Movies, completely uninterrupted.\n\nAlthough it is not consistently laugh-out-loud, tears-in-your-eyes hilarious, \"Duck Soup\" is very funny - and not quite as outrageous as I had expected. There's a lot going on here, aside from silly physical humor.\n\nThe Marx Brothers are great as usual and as usual Groucho steals the show.\n\nUltimately if you've never seen this, you need to go rent it out right now. If you have seen it, you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made.",

The humor is based primarily on puns and slapstick, the former provided by an inspired Groucho and the latter provided by Harpo and Chico.  The humor is truly a mixed bag and there is generally about one laugh for every ten misfires, but they come fast and furious.  The antics of Harpo and Chico get a bit tiresome, but it is all part of the package when it comes to the Marx Brothers.",

In many ways, the antiquated vernacular is part of the charm. Zeppo sticks out like a sore thumb compared to his brothers, though. (4/5)",

Firefly (Groucho Marx) is absolutely hilarious. He has quips for days and he's always doing something to liven up a scene. The other characters, while good, get lost in the greatness of his funny antics.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nNumerous setpieces abound here which keeps the movie fresh. The movies's consistent change of scenery and large visual spectacles propels Duck Soup to almost passable heights. I can appreciate a movie with a constant change of pace, especially older films.\n\nConflict: 3\nI spent a decent amount of this movie trying to figure out just what exactly was going on. The conflict never seemed strong enough for me to think the stakes were worth it. It was clear the focus was more on the comedy aspect rather than driving the story.\n\nEntertainment Value: 8\n\nMemorability: 3\n\nPace: 10\n\nPlot: 7\n\nResolution: 5\nThe ending was meh and that's me being generous. It was essentially a compounding of the story as a whole which totally lost steam for me towards the back half of the movie. it felt like, by the time we reach the end, the writer forgot what initially made the story great in the first place.\n\nOverall: 76\nWhen you don't really know what's going on right off the nose, it makes it hard to settle into the story. Duck Soup does a lot of things rights. However, a solid main character and grandiose scenes aren't quite enough to mask the fact that the movie falls just shy of being good. Not terrible, but definitely not great.",

In a play or cabaret, the rapidity is very impressive since its happening in one go. On screen it can be the result of numerous takes, and comes across as far more annoying than entertaining. It's a similar feeling I had when I watched Chaplin's Great Dictator, and the lead's constant buffoonery just got on my nerves. It was the same here, and with the endless scenes of the brothers doing nothing but fall over, knock hats off and gurn at every opportunity, I was thankful it was only 68 minutes.

This bizarre take on politics is structurally snappy and provides what is more like a string with intersections of skits and banter, sprinkled with sarcastic yet charming undertones. There is, of course, no actual deep meaning to this straight forward affair, but the almost continuous spread of warm entertainment is comfort food for the mind.",

Like any good madcap comedy, the plot in Duck Soup is merely a loose structure that is sitting there for them to fill with jokes, and this one is definitely full of them. I really love the witty dialogue that includes a lot of one-liners that effectively play on words. The jabs are coming so rapid-fire that you almost don't have time to laugh for fear you'll miss the next one. What's really great about these guys is that they aren't just good with comedic dialogue, they also nail physical comedy. There are a few scenes that are very reminiscent of Chaplin or other silent comedians, and I love them too. This is the type of movie that includes a team of people who are living in a comedy, but the rest of the world is still in a dramatic film, and that always makes me laugh. The way everyone else plays straight men to the Marx brothers comedy works brilliantly. I think some people who expect more story from their movies would find Duck Soup frustrating, because it doesn't really make sense, and jumps all over the place, but I think it works because the comedy holds it all together. My one hesitation is that they chose to include a few musical numbers. They aren't all that funny, and they don't do much to move the story forward. It just felt like everything was put on hold for the song, and then picked up again. Aside from those few strange moments, I found Duck Soup to be a delightful comedy and one I would love to watch regularly.",

            "content": "I couldn't possibly add much to the mountains that have been written about the Marx Brothers and this movie in particular.  I'll only add a few personal thoughts.\n\nThe Marx Brothers never acknowledged serious satirical intent with this movie. Groucho famously said they were just \"four Jews trying to get a laugh.\" I sincerely doubt Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar were utterly apolitical when they conceived the \"Declaration of War\" musical sequence in this movie - its intent is clearly satirical, whether the Marx Brothers thought so or not.\n\nI was in my early teens when I first saw this movie. Even before I was particularly sensitive to such cinematic factors in my movies, the final Battle Sequence from Duck Soup always seemed slapdash and insane, thrown together with massive leaps of continuity and logic. Groucho is in different costumes for each take. At first, Firefly rushes to Mrs. Teasdale's home, then Mrs. Teasdale is at the Firefly headquarters at which he started the scene. Not even the most cursory attempts at logic, unity and continuity are observed. It seemed as if the director was in a mad rush to get this movie done.\n\nBut now, the slapdash look of this movie's final scenes seem in retrospect like purposeful deconstruction. Just as war erodes civility and structure in real life, so does war erode the civility and structure in this movie. The insanity of the end of this movie is no less insane than war itself.\n\nThis sounds like pompous overanalysis; the word \"deconstruction\" didn't even exist when this movie was made. But Leo McCarey was a Hollywood veteran when he directed this movie, having directed or produced hundreds of movies. He knew perfectly well how to structure a movie. While it may be a bit pretentious calling this movie deconstructionist, one must acknowledge that at some point, McCarey decided just to throw logic out the window, just pare the movie down to a breakneck stream of gags and hurtle this film to its anarchic conclusion. \n\nThis film is an anarchic masterpiece, and anarchy is the enemy of Fascism. This film was banned by Mussolini in Italy. He certainly saw the anarchy in it.",

Harpo Marx plays an idiotic spy who doesn't talk and he brings the slapstick comedy to the mix and it works beautifully. I miss these quick paced satires with biting dialogue.

At 68 minutes, it could hardly be considered long, but if it was much longer I felt it would have worn out its welcome.  The Marx Brothers' trademark humor has aged well, but I felt that a lot of the wordplay was hit or miss.  This might be due to the rapidity with which Groucho spits out the lines, because not all of them were funny to me and quite possibly because some of them went over my head.  What I felt was the best part of the movie were the physical comedy routines.  As such, my favorite parts were a running gag in which Harpo torments a lemonade salesman, a scene involving a mirror and the final act where Groucho changes costumes in every scene.  Since the movie is one of the earlier \"talkies\", the acting is somewhat stiff/stilted (in a cinematic context, but perfectly normal in a theatrical context).  Margaret Dumont's Mrs. Teasdale is probably the best example of this, although her character was supposed to be that way.  Overall, I thought the movie was very well done, but I got the feeling that the Marx Brothers have done better.  This type of comedy mostly works for me, and I look forward to delving further into the Marx Brothers' filmography.",

There are countless puns shot off in a very compressed amount of time.  Not all of the jokes land, but it is so lightening fast paced, it is on to the next one before you can even think about acknowledging something that didn't work.  Seriously, it is so relentless in its throw-every-joke-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks style that if you blink, you are likely to miss multiple deadpan one-liners.  Even though a few jokes fall flat, what you walk away remembering is the material that works, like the ongoing feud between Harpo Marx and a lemonade vendor, and the mirror gag.

And the slapstick routines from Chico and Harpo are lifted straight out of classic Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello stuff. What a rip off! See it all before!\n\nOK. Serious review. Tried to introduce this to Hue yesterday, but it didn't quite take. She likes the Stooges more, perhaps mostly because Groucho's one-liner patter is delivered too fast for her. Personally though it's Marx Bros all the way for me. Particularly Groucho.\n\nI need to revisit a few more of their classic films in the coming months, because it's been decades since I've seen them. From memory though, I'd have to agree with Roger Ebert's assessment: some of their other films have funnier individual bits, but those other films ALSO have several tedious musical/romantic interludes away from the slapstick. \n\nDuck Soup on the other hand is the most consistently sublime. And even IT isn't perfect - the story and bland supporting cast slow things down occassionally, Zeppo is more embarrassing than useful, a couple of musical numbers (while funny) drag a bit. But this is the Marx Brothers. Beautifully anarchic political-satire, covered by a divine layer of pomposity-deflating irreverence. Chico and Harpo are both awesome, but Groucho, of course, carries the film, bouncing perfectly off his femme foil Dumont, or swapping inanities with Chico, or simply spitting eternally classic one-liners out ad nasuem. Oddly, for perhaps my favourite joke-speaking comedian, my favourite Groucho bit in Duck Soup features a missing mirror, and no dialogue at all. \n\nThe man could do it all.",

It\u00e2(TM)s a short film packed with a Hell of a lot of great comedic bits. The piece is also very well paced as well, never a dry or dull moment through this film at all, it\u00e2(TM)s just always on. The only thing that is in the slightest bit dry, it would be the musical numbers, but they don\u00e2(TM)t take away at all, and there is some great comedy in them as well.

It\u00e2(TM)s one of my favorite comedies coming from some of my favorite comedians. Really, could you expect anything less from these guys?",

Duck Soup is probably the ultimate example of the Marx brothers' brand of knockabout comedy. It's still virtually plotless, but the ideas gel together much more fluently than most, there is a perfect balance between slapstick and one liners and they managed to keep Harpo and Chico away from musical instruments meaning it keeps its momentum right til the end. Zeppo still sucks but thankfully he is hardly in it, the songs are kept to a minimum but have a large scale spectacle and funny lines and Louis Calhern as the bad guy gives it some thespian weight missing from most of the others. Highlights include Harpo's running battle with a lemonade seller that's straight out of Laurel and Hardy, Groucho's usual exasperation with Chico and the worst-spies-ever scene when they all dress up as Groucho (including the original mirror sketch). Hailed by many as the best Marx brothers film and I can't find any major reason to argue.",

The latter is so understated, however, that it never interferes with the laughs, and yet is powerfully reinforced. Just incredible!\r\nOn a side note: apparently, the Marx Brothers were delighted when Benito Mussolini banned the film in Italy.

The story and plot are silly and almost makes no sense, but I'm not too familiar with anarchic comedy, so I'm not sure how typical this film is in that aspect. The messy plot, whether intentional or not, is still distracting. And some of the jokes feel dated but it never gets too bad, and even with the haphazard plot, as long as you let loose and have fun, you will laugh your head off.",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nIf the Marx Brothers can't make you laugh, then I don't know who - or what - can. Since the beginning of time, comedy cinema has been dominated by the purely physical comics, some of whom mixed a little bit of verbal humor into their mix; the brothers were such people. While they were in their prime, they had many fine films; although I feel that \"Duck Soup\" is among the most important, if not the most important, period. Inside this delightful confectionary; you shall find some of the most relevant, hilarious commentary on politics, people, and their respective social classes alike - as well as a few of cinema's greatest sight gags and spoken insults. The film is a perfect representation of when comedy was neither too crude nor too subtle; it's funny enough to charm even the sourest, most cynical of viewers, so long as the person is open-minded to comedy that today might feel just a tad bit dated.\r\n\r\n\"Duck Soup\" is a straight-up satire of the people that might be leading our nations as we speak; it portrays the ruling class to be at the intelligence level of an underdeveloped ape. The story is simple and very easy to follow. Here's how I would put it: the nations of Freedonia and Sylvania are to wage war against one another. Or at least that's what their collective, current situations seem to suggest. Freedonia has just appointed a new dictator/ruler; by the name of Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). On first sight, Firefly is far too arrogant to run a country, and don't let that fool you; he really isn't cut out for the job.\r\n\r\nThe leader of Sylvania, Trentino (Louis Calhern), is of much higher intelligence. He is worried that Firefly will get in the way of his plans to take over the opposing country of Freedonia; and he actually believes that his wits have been matched with the newest addition to the long-running list of rulers. Of course, he is wrong; but given this is a war satire, there must be coverage of the ever-infamous paranoia of leaders and those who simply follow them. Out of his paranoia, Trentino hires two spies - Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) - neither of them consistent enough to retrieve the information from Firefly that Trentino so eagerly desires.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, \"Duck Soup\" is not a film that was remembered for its plot. It's a short movie (running at about only 70 minutes), but it makes every second count. The Marx Brothers infuse their signature wit into the story, making it worthwhile; although it's the satire and commentary that counts, not so-much the structure of the plot. You want complexity; you should look elsewhere. But why should you expect such a thing out of classic comedy? In a sense, the comedy itself is meant to have multiple layers rather than the story that contains it; which is fine by me, so long as the intent to provoke laughter is not sacrificed. \r\n\r\nWhile the characters portrayed by the Brothers and their co-stars are memorable and cleverly-written, I think what most people will take out of the movie is the plethora of memorable scenes to be unearthed when one approaches it. There are a few scenes in particular that I feel most people will not soon forget; such as one involving the spies operating a peanut vendor-stand, only to pick fights with the competition in the business, and another in which Firefly walks the premises of his home in nightgown; while the spies linger nearby, also donning similar clothes. The scene is made instantly memorable when Firefly's mirror first comes into view; Pinky (dressed as Firefly) runs into it and it breaks on contact, although when the real Firefly approaches the scene, he's able to trick him by making him think that he's seeing himself in an un-broke mirror. I suppose it proves that the dimwitted spies have one thing going for them: consistency.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there is the war scene that ends the film; a showcase of some early special effects work (such as a bullet that goes through walls, and a house that explodes), and also the home of some of the film's other scenes worth mentioning. For example: who can forget the \"help\" montage? If you've seen the film, then you know what I'm talking about; on the battlefield, Firefly calls in for assistance, and we get prolonged images of squad cars, elephants, baboons, athletic swimmers, and track runners. There's a surprising sense of relevance that this scene alone brings to the film; the kind that hasn't changed to this day. So there, you see; \"Duck Soup\" has not aged entirely. But in my opinion, \"age\" should not be a complaint of any cinephile. Greatness is forever.\r\n\r\nI loved every minute of \"Duck Soup\". You'll likely laugh until you cry when you watch it; this is a very, very funny film. From the wise-cracking Firefly to the uptight Trentino, it's filled with fun characters and humor that can range from potentially offensive (mostly to woman; not much racially or otherwise that could cause alarm) to jokes that are very easy to swallow. It's one of the best comedies reliant on what we see, hear, and feel; and I think that it broke a lot of ground for the future of comic filmmaking. And whether you acknowledge that or not is completely up to whether you buy in to the Marx Brothers' grand feathered brew.",

Anyway, I had to see it. I was very sadly disappointed. The only scene I really liked was the mirror scene which I think I've seen on TV before in my childhood because it looked so familiar. (Or maybe it's been spoofed before in other movies?) Anyway, I sat there the entire movie with a straight face, trying to see where the humor was, but I did not laugh a single time. I am definitely not a slapstick humor kind of person. I definitely have a witty sense of humor but these jokes were delivered sarcastically and dryly and were mostly insults, which is not my style. I did not think this movie was funny in any way shape or form. Pinkie was REALLY annoying and I just wanted to shove him out of the movie because he was just bothering me so much.",

The film has non-stop remarkably funny gags.  Some of these jokes can be ultimatley reguarded as some of the greatest comedy scenes of all time, like the infamous mirror scene, which has not only been reused in a million other films, but also my personal favorite part of the movie.   I was laughing out loud throughout the entire hour and eight minutes.  It made me laugh harder than most comedies that have come out recentley and I think that is saying alot.\n\nI can definetley watch this movie over and over if I had to.  What makes it work so well is not the story line, but the cleaver writing and enthusiastic performances.  For me Harpo Marx as Pinky stole the show.  Everytime he cut something in half with his sisscors it didn't feel old, it somehow managed to feel new and fresh every time.\n\nThe movie didn't really feel like a masterpiece though. Since I didn't understand what happened at the end I felt I was missing some kind of meaning or conclusion.  Due to the shortness, the movie feels like it's a bit poorly edited.  But that is just a mild critisism at the most.  This movie takes comedy over plot which is great.  And all of the things I said before this are the reasons why this is currently under the list of my favorite comedies of all time.",

Like many comedies of the era, it was comedy over substance, so it in many ways plays out like a stand-up show, one joke after the other. Don't get me wrong, the jokes are very funny indeed, and there is still a lot of physical humour (the mirror scene in particular killed me), but later comedies would become more subtle and have more to them.
