A suspicious person was found to be her husband. Yet, he doesn't seem to be involved in her disappearance. The way she has gone is not quite obvious. Gone Girl is based on the book and was directed by the well-known David Fincher. In the majority of cases, a detail might have been lost when a book is converted to film. However, once I had read the book before watching the movie, I believed that the movie still had a strong production value. The way this movie is mysteriously processed, along with the way it goes, define its identity. Besides that, how the plot twists during the movie is also compelling. Some scenes are unpredictable and also lead to psychological thrillers. It also interfered with social issues. The breathtaking atmosphere and soundtrack that encourage viewers to stay focused on the following scene are what I most admire. Similar to Rosamund Pike's character, other performers were chosen for their roles based on how well they would match the roles. Rosamund Pike is an actual actress. \nI would recommend this movie to anyone who prefers watching thrilling, mysterious investigative films. It deserves to be listed as a must-see movie.",

(spoiler alert -- don't read on if you intend to watch this movie).  Nick Dunne knew full well her horrendous capabilities and yet he stood in a shower with her.  That scene alone destroyed the entire movie because no patient would be let out of a hospital with blood still splattered all over her!! That insulted my intelligence.  My husband and I put the movie on pause and both of us were furious that the movie at that point took such a ridiculous turn!! Then the ending was so stupid -- It made absolutely no sense that: 1) a fertility clinic would release someone\u015b sperm without his approval and signature, 2) that he would stay with her after that horrendous lying scheme to get pregnant,  3) that he would stay with her after all her other horrendous actions against other men, and 4) that he would stay with her after her attempt to have him sentenced to death row for murder.  Nobody would stay married to someone that did that to them. He would be suing her!  The only thing we could think was that he stayed in it to get the publicity, the book deals, the fame, a potential movie deal, etc. -- for the money, but that was not appropriately presented as a motive either.  His premise that he felt obligated to raise the child because the court would not give him custody was also stupid because nothing would stop her in the future from killing him and claiming he raped her (like she did with the previous boyfriend) and raising the child herself.  He was a much smarter person than that throughout the movie. He would not risk his life and stay with her.  This movie with great acting, top-notch production, great directing, and a potentially great plot line went to a complete failure when it crumbled into a million ridiculous peices.",

They're a couple of self-absorbed, overeducated, glib, entirely-too-good-looking, yuppified, white jerks. Their \"meet cute\" scene at the beginning is nausea-inducing. The two are played by Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck.\n\nI thought perhaps that the author of the original book, Gillian Flynn, made the two characters  unlikeable for a reason (I haven't read it, and I probably never will). If that was Flynn's intention, filmmaker David Fincher has surely captured it in this film. \n\nSo we have a problem right from the git go: characters we can't stand. On top of that, the film's attempts at dark humor come off as unbearably smug. \n\nOne saving grace is Kim Dickens' portrayal as the world-weary detective Boney, investigating Amy's disappearance. I found myself perking up whenever she appeared in a scene. She suspects that Nick has something to do with the vanishing of his wife, and so do we. We learn that Nick has been having an affair\u2013which is, of course, requisite in all sleazy soap operas.\n\nI won't reveal the movie's big twist, in case you're one of the few people who don't already know about it. But the story is not over at that point. There's a particular event that's unbelievably cynical, and there's a gory sex / murder scene that's purely gratuitous.\n\nIn spite of its distasteful characters and their behavior, curiosity about the outcome kept me watching. But overall, \"Gone Girl\" left a bad taste in my mouth. This film is, like the Supreme Court said in the 1970's, \"utterly without socially redeeming value.\"",

Affleck and Pike are incredible leads, with Harris, Perry, and Coon also giving solid performances. The actual message of the film is a bit messy, with the final message being very questionable. The atmosphere and cinematography are all brilliant as always. Really, my only major concern is that many of the characters are such bad and unlikeable people that it's hard to side with them. I get that that is part of the story and the ending itself, however, there are many times where their deeds go unpunished. There are also many unrealistically frustrating moments that just don't seem to work (trying to avoid spoilers as much as possible lol).

            "content": "David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

In the end I simply settled on the fact that they were meant for each other. Neither spouse exemplified true character and I don't think there would be any way for them to be with anyone else while the other is alive. Obviously there was quite a bit more mental instability on the part of Pike's character, but one could argue that the grief of her ailing relationship drive her towards such measures, therefore shifting a portion of the blame to her husband. There is so much relational turmoil to unpack in this film, and I enjoyed the thought process surrounding it. Pike as a narrarator will always be a plus to me, and her explaination quickly became my favorite part. All in all, I was pleased with the movie and will certainly be watching it again.",

It is certainly violent and it has sexual content but the psychological drama side is just fantastic. I empathized with a guy that cheated on his wife because her wife is just crazy (and terrifying) and her craziness makes all the medias talking shit about him. I mean what a bad luck. He fell in love with that woman but he made mistakes and instead of just getting divorce like everyone else would, she just destroys him without any mercy and she loves being loved by the people. If there is a sociopath, it's her.\n\nSo, for the plot value, it is good but it is also sublime because of Ficher's style. I always say that David Fincher is one of my favorite directors (if not my favorite) and that's even more true after watching a film like that. The dark, stressing atmosphere with the music and the fantastic camera work.\n\nVery good",

She pretty much carries the film on her own for the most part. This film is neither feministic nor misogynistic in my opinion. I felt a bit disappointed with the climax and it's plausibility. But the film, overall, is an authentic addition to Fincher's compelling filmography and yet another proof that he's a master of the genre.",

            "content": "In a word this film is FANTASTIC. In primis I LOVE David Fincher's movie, so I decided to watch one of his best movies. I think this film is a masterpiece, the concepts are expressed in an excellent way, it has become one of my favorite films. He should have won an Oscar. \nThe intro is so significant and disturbing: \"I'd like to split her skull\" \nafter watching the movie trailer you already know what's going to happen, or at least you think you know, and Nick already starts to dislike you a little.\nThe movie starts with him going to a bar, and when he comes home, his wife is gone, so Nick calls the police. I was struck by the fact that Nick doesn't seem too upset by his wife's disappearance, I mean, he's not desperate for grief. Then, when the cops intrigue him doesn't seem to know any aspect of his wife's life, a relevant fact because thanks to this, we who look understand that they did not have a good relationship.\nThe police then set off to look for her; earlier she had left clues which when Nick finds them he does not show to the police. By doing this he shows the audience that he is somehow guilty, if he wasn't he would have had to give everything to the cops. \nTo add to the hatred we already had for Nick, we find out that he has a lover, oh God, when I found out I was shocked. I thought: \"how could you do this to Amy\" and as if that wasn't enough she was a little girl. From this last fact I felt a hatred towards Nick, I didn't justify him. On top of that there were the scenes of their relationship in the beginning and how they complemented each other, but then Nick ruined everything. \nthe director wants to make it look like Nick is the bad guy in fact who wouldn't be on Amy's side seeing those images? no one, that's who. \nAmy to get revenge for his betrayal stages her own murder. she plans it in every detail. then she runs away and takes refuge in some bad place. the feelings were almost indescribable, oh god, she didn't die, thank goodness\nIn the meantime Nick gets a lawyer because he is accused of his wife's murder. he also finds out what game Amy has him playing in. His sister has two very important terms: \"psychopath\" and \"manipulator\". After this scene I started to see Amy as a manipulator too, because on second thought that's what she is.\nShe tells the police everything and everyone believes her, except for 4 people: Nick, Margo, Nick's lawyer and the detective on duty. They don't believe her because they know what really happened. But in the end she won anyway, she fooled everyone who matters and appeared as the perfect wife who despite everything is madly in love with her husband (plus she's expecting his child without Nick touching her, now Nick is forced to stay with her forever).\nThe film finish with the intro scene, one things significative, now we now the meaning of that. \nNow let's talk about the media, they were present throughout the film, they discredited, insulted Nick and made him hated by all (they even insinuated incest), they too were fundamental for the judgment of Nick and Amy. I think with this the director shows us how much the media can influence us and make us think as they want.\nBy finishing the film we all realized how powerful women are, how she is powerful, how the power of cunning beats everything and everyone. We are all astonished because we had a thought for, and another, and another. In the end she's won everything.",

Overall, the movie makes sense and the viewers somewhat understand the motivations behind each of the characters. SPOILERS: The movie does not explain why the wife decided to kill the first lover and how the wife is able to reverse the power dynamics in the relationship (is it because of the national media attention on their marriage, forcing the husband to continue to stay in the marriage?) Additionally, although the twist of having the wife plan her faked death was interesting, I would have enjoyed an ending that took the ending a step further with possibly having the husband also fake his own death as an act of revenge against his wife for the troubles that she caused him (with the media, public relations, stress, facing criminal charges, etc.)",

Gone Girl is stylish, it's characters feel sleek, cunning and criminally cool. Rosamund Pike did a fantastic job in her role, and the tone of her acting really complemented the sharp edge of the film. Ben Affleck plays his role brilliantly as well, and it really is as if the role was written for him; He's a very human character, and he's just empathetic and charismatic enough that you still stay on his side, despite how the film tries to convince you otherwise. This brings me to my next point, which is that this is a movie that plays with your thoughts, I honestly felt manipulated watching this, and at times uneasy with how I reacted unsurely to things that I normally would've been viscerally disgusted with. I don't often find myself yelling at the screen, but this is one of those movies that made me nervously exclaim out loud, multiple times, while I was watching it.

But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous fa\u00e7ade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?\n\n\"Gone Girl\", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. \"Gone Girl\" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: \"This case is about what people think of you.\"\n\nAmy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where \"Gone Girl\" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie.\n\nBen Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is. 9.0/10",

Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.\"",

There\u2019s plot twists at every corner and it just intensifies as the film progresses. All the performances are done beautifully and Rosamund Pike was snubbed of any awards she was nominated for under this film. If you\u2019re a fan of mystery, thriller or psychological thrillers put this at the top of your movie list immediately.",

            "content": "David Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" is a dark, gripping and utterly unpredictable thriller that offers a commentary on the toxicity of modern relationships. With his tenth feature, director David Fincher has crafted an astonishing adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel. Using captivating cinematography, Fincher draws viewers into the world of a man that is suspected of his wife's murder. From intimate close-ups to tense panning shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the movie a tense and foreboding atmosphere that is reminiscent of Fincher's previous films. Gillian Flynn's script is sensational, and expertly employs narrative twists to keep viewers engaged in the story. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career as Nick Dunne. This is the actor unlike you've ever seen him before: intense, charismatic and menacing in his most complex role to date. Rosamund Pike is remarkable in the role of a manipulative woman that is unsatisfied with her marriage. With enigmatic expressions, she captures the mischief, torment and resentment of the villainous character. Although \"Gone Girl\" is undeniably riveting, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly two and a half hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. In this regard, the film may have benefitted from a tighter cut that removed unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"Gone Girl\" and so will movie-goers seeking engrossing entertainment. At a time when toxic relationships are rarely depicted in films, its a cautionary reminder of the dangers posed by psychopathic women in marriages.",

Onto the review:  \n\nWow.  This was like a modern Fatal Attraction.  Not only is 'Gone Girl' a meditation on marriage, but also a commentary on how a media narrative can be used to a malicious individual's advantage and make the public see an innocent person as guilty.  Very contemporary.  As a Fincher film, I'd put it slightly below Fight Club and Social Network, but it ranks high within his works in my opinion.  I thought the whopping 2 and a half hour run-time would be a drag, but surprisingly by the final act, I wanted it to keep going, for the sake of Nick's (Affleck) character to receive justice.  If you want a prime example of a conniving psychopaths ability to dupe others into believing their lies as irrefutable truth, through highly elaborate means, this is a great film to start with.  Dark, intriguing, illuminating, sobering and twisty, 'Gone Girl' is a psychological thriller done right.",

Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross always give a chilling and perfect score. The whole storyline of \"X Day Gone\" builds suspense, which is compounded with unreliable narrators. Rosamund Pike delivers an exceptional performance as the manipulative, conniving, and downright evil Amy Dunne. The cut to her, very much alive, over an hour into the film was stunning on first viewing and still makes me smile. There was something so unique about watching her eyes flutter by, reveling in her Welcome Home reception while sitting in the back of the police car. I also think this is one of Ben Affleck's best performances as Nick Dunne, a character we question with every scene and who is ultimately the sympathetic hero. I suppose the scores weren't higher \u2014 although 87s are nothing to shake a stick at \u2014 because of the ending? At a minimum, Amy ruined one man's life with a false rape allegation and ended another's, and she was never brought to justice. In fact, she was given the gift of a child, something she yearned for from the beginning of the movie. The supporting cast of Tyler Perry, NPH, Carrie Coon, et al., were also excellent. Of course, 100/100 for Cheeto (Bleecker), the cat. I have seen too many movies lately where horrible things happen to cats, and it was nice to see Bleecker make it until the very end.",

            "content": "I honestly HATED this film. It was so painful to watch. The protagonist played by Ben Affleck and the antagonist played by Rosamund Pike were both really, really, really, really annoying and hateful. I could not root for either of them. In fact, all of the characters aside from Tyler Perry's character in this film were irritating, especially the two lead characters Nick and Amy Dunne. Gone Girl was also a very slow and boring film. I was falling asleep during this movie.\n \nYou have a protagonist who is a pretentious manwhore who blatantly cheats on his wife and constantly has an affair with another woman while he is married. He also constantly treated his wife as if she was invisible and pretended not to notice her during their marriage. He wouldn't even sleep with her in the same room. Then after his wife ditches him and when the whole media and community turns into an annoyingly relentless frenzy gossiping and getting suspicious about the disappearance of Nick's wife, he pretends that he misses her and pretends that he has always loved her.\n\nYou have an antagonist who is a love-sick, devious, crazy, relentless sociopath who frames her cheating husband for murdering her after she had enough of him treating her like she doesn't exist by leaving a lot of false murder evidence in her husband's house. Her murder conspiracy annoyingly drags on for what feels like forever. Her revenge plan on her cheating husband is stretched and over-the-top. Explaining her whole murder conspiracy would put me too sleep.\n\nSo she is living with her old friend (played by Neil Patrick Harris) from high school whom he had a big crush on her since high school and he knows about her murder conspiracy and wants in on it and helps participate in her revenge plan on her skanky husband by letting her live with him in his house in a different state than where her skanky husband lives and keeps her presence a secret from everybody else in the world aside from the couple that bribed her earlier on in the film. So when she watches a live TV interview of her husband claiming he did not kill her and stating that he misses her, loves her, and wants her back. She buys it and then her crush tells her that she shouldn't come crawling back to him. He refused to let her go. So one night they have sex together on the bed and she suddenly murders him by stabbing him to death and he severely and quickly bleeds to death on the bed.\n\n Then she later hurts herself by cutting her own breasts and making them bleed to make it seem like she was taken hostage by him and killed him in self-defense. So she goes to the police and gets interviewed by them and lies to them that by telling them that she was kidnapped, taken hostage, and hurt by that man and killed him in self-defense. They buy it and she returns home to her skanky husband Nick. He was shocked to see her back, but was still unhappy and whispers \"you bitch\" to her while they hugging outside of their house with the neighbors from the media frenzy around them clapping and applauding them. So she later confesses to him that she killed that guy she was living with for quite a long time.\n\n He was very shocked to hear that she was a sociopathic murderer who was crazy enough to murder someone just to get back to her husband. So Amy reveals to Nick that she's pregnant and which makes him feel obligated to stay with her and not turn her into the police for manslaughter so that he would live with her to help take care of and raise their unborn child. So Nick breaks up with his girlfriend whom he had an affair with and she cries. They both get interviewed one last time by the pesky neighborhood media and then he ends up being stuck with her. What a god-awful ending!\n\n I hate to admit, but Tyler Perry's character who is the lawyer is the only likable character in the whole entire film and the only one who didn't annoy me. His acting was great and he was the only one with charisma in the entire film. You know a movie is bad when Tyler Perry ends up being the best part of it. I would not watch this film again.\n\nRating: 4.2/10",

As increasing police and media pressure mount, the facade of a loving and blissful union crumbles and amidst the lies and behavior of Nick, the question remains - did he kill her?\n\nDavid Fincher is a true master class when it comes to directing, because Gone girl is one of the best films of this year.\n\nBen Affleck was perfect for this role, because Ben Affleck through out he's career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\n\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\n\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\n\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down.\n\nOverall Gone Girl is a fantastic film.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this film as it had a premise that sounded ludicrous enough to be enjoyable and I had heard a lot of praise for the performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Sadly the film just never really worked for me as it was too arch to believably deconstruct the pain of a failing marriage and too serious to enjoy purely as a campy film noir romp. I have always found David Fincher to be more successful at putting together the technical elements of a film than creating engaging characters or settling on a consistent tone. You feel at a remove from all of the characters in the film and therefore it is hard to care about any of their problems.\n\nThe seemingly perfect Amy Dunne, Rosamund Pike, elaborately plots to fake her own death and have her husband Nick, Ben Affleck, implicated in her murder. Nick is shocked by her disappearance as he had failed to understand that she was unhappy in their marriage as they were forced to move to Missouri after his mother became sick, she invested her savings in the bar that he wanted to own and he began an affair with one of his creative writing students, the much younger Andie Fitzgerald, Emily Ratajkowski. The press and detective Rhonda Boney, Kim Dickens, attack Nick while Dunne's plan fails when she is robbed by two rednecks and forced to turn to her former stalker, Desi Collings, Neil Patrick Harris. Nick must figure out how to manipulate the press so that his name is not dragged through the mud and those who are suspicious of him do not come to believe that he is her murderer. Meanwhile Dunne considers returning to him as she realizes that Collings is predatory and she must escape him to gain freedom.\n\nWhat the film aims to be is a sharp satire on the influence of the media over current events and what sensationalism pushes the public and the figures effected by these events to do. In some ways this works as there is humor to the occasional interludes featuring holier than thou news presenter Ellen Abbott, Missi Pyle, theorizing that Nick has an incestuous relationship with his supportive sister Margot, Carrie Coon. Despite this the dialogue is overwritten and Affleck and Pike struggle to make their dialogue believable as they spit out lines that are better on the page than when delivered on film. At a party Pike deconstructs the image that her mother has built up in the \u2018Amazing Amy' books and in what could have been a scene that accurately pinpoints what drives Dunne to break free from the eerie perfection of her life we feel that we are listening to an overexcited teenager spew out everything that they learned at a creative writing course. The film wobbled right on the edge of several genres and it's refusal to commit to a satirical bent left me cold.\n\nMuch of the discussion of the film centered around the performance of Pike in the lead and I must say that I was never particularly impressed. She is an actress that has often disappointed me as while she is well cast as a brittle socialite in An Education (2009) she otherwise strains too hard for cool and detached in her other performances. She is most difficult to believe as the Dunne who is subtly angry at her husband as while Fincher's direction doesn't help her she isn't quite as tough and calculated as she needs to be. The great femme fatales, Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity (1944) and Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), are simultaneously alluring and scary. They are able to convince you of their heartbreaking vulnerability and then shock you with their triumphant response to the untimely downfall of the protagonist. This film gets something right in portraying Nick as a wayward, flawed figure not entirely deserving of sympathy but Dunne's character is lacking several vital components as we never quite understand what would push her to go as far as she does.\n\nThe film would have benefitted from leaning into its dark, film noir elements more and the performances were lacking therefore I would not recommend the film. Watch one of the classic femme fatale thrillers from the 1940s instead.",

The chemistry between Ben Affleck (Nick Dunne) and Rosamund Pike (Amy Dunne) made this film extraordinary, with a touch of psychological mystery and suspense. In particular, the introduction scene focuses on Amy Dunne's long blonde hair while her husband's hand brushes through it gentle as a playful flirtatious gesture. Where then the camera shifts to Amy's eyes, while Nick describes their falling turning point in their marriage saying \"When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling her brains trying to get answers. The primal questions of any marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?\". \nThey seem like the perfect oddly couple who devote effort to keep their marriage interesting even after fail attempts. So, why is a devoted housewife missing the day of their 5th anniversary? In this film, the struggle to find his wife makes detective Boney (Kim Dickens) hard to believe that he wasn't in any reason involved in the disappearance. The diary kept by Amy will structure flashbacks that reveals secrets never heard before. That's when Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) comes in the picture, a former boyfriend of Amy. Despite details written in the diary, characters will have to choose sides, team Nick the sweet, gorgeous, cool guy or team Amy the super intelligent, hilarious girl that doesn't mind pretending to be what she is not. \tAfter all, the primarily suspect in these types of cases is always the husband, a person that knows every step that she has taken throughout the day.

Gillian Flynn's story is disturbing and creative with a fresh perspective on the crime thriller. Fincher's direction complements her writing with his sleek, smooth camera shots of clear violence and open sexuality.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is more subdued than his work on The Social Network or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nBen Affleck is a snooze of a lead unfortunately. I never liked him as a person, nor I have ever been convinced by his acting. He is just so lazy and mundane looking. His glazed over expression carries over for most of the film. He does capture the essence of a terrible husband, unsympathetic loser, and a strange decision maker. At least, you are not supposed to like his character as he is a jerk, but Affleck pulls off unlikable with ease.\n\nRosamund Pike is the real star of Gone Girl. Her character constantly gets talked about, but once you start following her perspective, the whole film changes lens and meaning. She is chilling, yet charming. Pike deserved all the acclaim she received for Gone Girl as she is subtle and unnerving throughout Gone Girl!\n\nCarrie Coon is fantastic, likable, and sympathetic as Affleck's sister. She is very genuine and funny, while adding a dramatic depth to Affleck's side as you care about her. She gives the emotional performance he cannot.\n\nI was impressed by the dramatic turn from both comedic actors Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris. They felt completely believable as their respective characters in Gone Girl. I hope they continue down a more serious film path, but who knows.\n\nAlso, Kim Dickens is hilarious as the hard boiled detective with a witty arsenal of comebacks and remarks.\n\nLastly, I suppose I should mention supermodel Emily Ratajkowski's acting is pretty good. She out acts Affleck in her introductory scene, then proceeds to get two more memorable moments. She did alright.\n\nEveryone else is forgettable or passable in their minor roles.\n\nIn all, I'm not sure that I like Gone Girl so much as I appreciate. It's a great story told beautifully. The acting is mostly solid with a few standout roles like Rosamund Pike. I think Ben Affleck's lack of charisma or energy is what will always hold Gone Girl back for me. I'd honestly rank this as my least favorite David Fincher film, but it's still a decent film.",

Fincher flawlessly encapsulates Flynn's story, with fast paced and intense direction.

The story was obvious ripped from Scott and Lacey Peterson with a twist, which actually made it better.\n\nHowever, the dialogue was excruciatingly bad. Way too carefully constructed in a way no one talks. Like a highly choreographed tennis match with perfect call and responses, i.e. the standard overly written repartee. Part of the problem in Hollywood is that dialogue never reflect anything real. It's for the most part written like writers would like to talk like, but never how people actually talk like.\n\nThen, there was some of the situations and casting. What's with hiring foreign actors to play American parts? There are no actresses in Hollywood that can do the job? Hint, Rosamund Pike, Lola Kirk .\n\nWhen you call the cops about a potential break in or foul play, detectives don't show up. Regular cops do, but not here. The young attractive mysterious lead woman detective and the sceptic side kick with nothing to say. Did I say cliche? Cops don't interview people together, like Nick and her parents in the same room.\n\nAmy writes out her plan on postage notes and puts them on a calendar? Who on earth would do that? You have to be a complete imbecile to do that. Only in badly written movies does that happen.\n\nJust the overall behavior of everyone was totally unnatural and inauthentic. That is Fincher's fault. The accents were too over the top. Felt like they forced them too much. And Emily Ratajkowski was supposed to play a 19-20 year old? But she is 30 and she looks that. Why not get someone who IS American and actually that age.\n\nIf you are interrogated by the cops, you don't force yourself to look guilty. You do the opposite, unlike Pike, her acting was so winking into the camera it was hilarious.\n\nI wish it was better. The premise was good, just the execution and writing of it was not.",

Whenever someone goes missing, there are not ravenous mobs of people camping outside their house holding up signs like they're at some kind of concert. There are no Missing Person Groupies.\n\nAnyone outside of close family and friends sees the story on the news for a week and then forgets about it. That's how the world functions.

Like Fight Club or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it's almost as if this book was written so he could direct the adaptation. It completely plays to his strengths. He also got the best out of his leads. Ben Affleck (Nick) gives one of his best performances ever. Rosamund Pike (Amy) is the shining star and I'd say this was easily her best role. Carrie Coon (Margo), Kim Dickens (Detective Boney), Neil Patrick Harris (Desi) and even the usually maligned Tyler Perry (Tanner) were all great in their supporting roles. Nobody is wasted. Fincher expertly sets up a dark, suspenseful tone, while the score added a ton. Fincher's combination with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was once again a spectacular fit. I won't go into too much detail on the plot, because if you haven't seen it or read the book, then the twists and turns need to be experienced spoiler-free to truly appreciate them.\n\nWeaknesses: I will admit that the ending doesn't feel like it resolves much. Again, without giving too much away, people don't really end up paying for anything they've done. I liked that Nick and Amy were portrayed as deeply flawed people, who were probably absolutely right for each other, but the ending just kind of leaves things a bit flat. It's not a bad ending, just not great. After the big reveal in the middle, the film does veer off into a few things that feel too far-fetched and a bit over the top.\n\nOverall: This is a rather insane film, yet it all works very well. It's right in David Fincher's wheelhouse and he does what he does best. Great performances, a perfectly executed tone and a gripping mystery makes Gone Girl a success.",

Local Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is tracking Nick s activity and is building a case against him. There s blood on the kitchen floor and on the walls. There s Amy s insurance policy that was doubled in recent days. There s the nosey neighbor who claims Amy said the marriage was on the rocks - and Amy was pregnant. But without a corpse, there cannot be a murder. Then, Boney finds a diary where Amy lays out a story of a marriage gone bad and a husband she fears.\n\nSCOTT: As public opinion turns against Nick, he senses his imminent arrest. Wisely, he seeks the legal counsel of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who attempts to rehabilitate his public image. A big setback occurs when Nick s adulterous affair with a college girl half his age is revealed. But wait, a bigger reveal is that Amy isn t dead after all. We learn that Amy is a psychopath who has orchestrated what appears to be the perfect frame and set-up of Nick. Amy s plan is dealt a huge blow when she is robbed of all her cash and must turn to an old boyfriend (Neil Patrick Harris) for refuge.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is a great story. We re pulled in by the story of the perfect relationship. Then the relationship sours. We are lulled into the sense that Nick is the typical terrible husband. That he just might be capable of murder after all. And just when we, like everyone else in the movie, believe he is guilty - we learn that Amy isn t dead. In fact, she s setting Nick up for her own murder. This premise is easily as frightening as Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction. Nick has scorned Amy and now she uses every intimate detail she knows about Nick to implicate him in a terrible crime. It s anyone s worst nightmare - that all the secrets you share with the person closest to you can be used against you in the court of public opinion. The greatest element of this story is the turnabout of the villains. The first half of the movie sets Nick up as a dreadful man (and to a certain degree it s a deserved reputation). Then at the halfway point, the tables are turned and Nick becomes the victim to Amy s villain.\n\nSCOTT: You got that right, Greg. Gone Girl is a dark movie. It s dark in showcasing the worst of humanity and also dark in the way that darkness conceals things. There are hidden agendas of varying degrees throughout the movie, and they keep us guessing and re-guessing. This film is a chess game on steroids, with chess pieces moving methodically along the board in surprising and sinister ways. I ve never been a big fan of Ben Affleck s acting ability, but here he is a master of exuding mixed signals, rendering us uncertain of his culpability and character. Nearly all of this film s darkness emanates from the story s main malevolent character, Amazing Amy herself. For me, Amy is the most memorable female character in the movies since Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, released in 2011. Amy is sexy, smart, confident, and accomplished. We cannot even imagine her attaining the level of diabolical evil that she reaches. But reach it she does. We re left aghast and appalled while admiring her stunning, disturbing intelligence.\n\nGREG: Ben Affleck as the hero of the story is severely flawed. He is childish, a philanderer, and actually not that bright. We re given a tale of him as villain first and when the tables turn he is the victim. The story follows him center stage from beginning to end. It s his conversion from the controlling husband to the one controlled that we are witnessing. He s different from any other hero we ve studied thus far. He is transformed, but this time, not for the better. Amy is likewise a complex villain. At the start of the film she is painted as the dutiful wife who does whatever her husband wants to do. But at the halfway point we come to realize that she s the one who is controlling Nick. She becomes the villain. And again, unlike any villain we ve studied so far, she is more capable, more cunning, and more powerful than the hero of the story. She is the ultimate villain.\n\nSCOTT: Nick is not your typical hero. He s not a terrible man but he s not a good man, either. He goes through hell in this movie yet we hardly see signs of change or growth in his character. He becomes wiser but appears not to use his wisdom to better himself or the world around him. I think this is the point of the movie. We learn that dark people do dark things, and if they re smart enough, they ll get away with murder, literally. We need heroes to stop them but in Gone Girl the heroes are neither smart enough nor virtuous enough to rid the world of its darkness. I do believe that Rosamund Pike is outstanding in her role as Amy and deserves Academy Award consideration for her performance here. There is a multi-dimensionality to her acting, ranging from demure sweetness to true psychopathological rage. I agree with you, Greg, that she is the ultimate villain, making everyone around her look foolish as they try to keep up with her true motives or her next move. Amy is a force unto herself, literally; there are no henchmen or henchwomen to aid her. She is a true lone villain, perhaps the most formidable force of evil that we ve seen this year at the movies.\n\nGREG: Gone Girl clocks in at two and a half hours - and none of it was wasted. I was getting a little bored by the time we got to the midpoint where the tables are turned. Then I was riveted. This is a completely engrossing tale told spectacularly well by all members of the cast and crew. I give Gone Girl 5 out of 5 Reels. Nick is a flawed hero as we have discussed. He s not altogether bright nor altogether virtuous. He lets women mold him into whatever they want him to be (his mother, other girlfriends, then Amy). We really don t have much sympathy for him as a victim. At the end of the movie he has a way out, but he isn t strong enough to take it. This is a complex protagonist that is difficult to score on our usual scale. I give Nick a 4 out of 5 Heroes. Amy is the most manipulative, spiteful, vengeful, cunning and controlling villain we ve ever seen. If there were a Villain s Hall of Fame, I d nominate her for it. Her  unreliable first person  narration first paints her as the victim, but in the end we realize she s the one in control. I give Amy 5 Villains out of 5.  Movie:  Villains: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Gone Girl is one of the year s best movies with it s stylish portrayal of love, treachery, and murderous revenge. This film drags us through the muck of human relationships and the nadir of human conduct. I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that afterward I was left feeling alarmed and ashamed of the human race. At film s end, there are hints of a sequel, which I would dread seeing with great anticipation. While not a perfect movie by any means, it is engrossing enough to merit a full 5 Reels out of 5. The hero Nick is confident, handsome, and charismatic, but he s not terribly admirable. He blunders his way through the movie without evolving or learning from the disastrous choices he s made (and continues making). The fact that at the end he remains married to Amy is a horrifying testimony to his lack of heroism. That he even survives his arrogance and foolishness is a miracle -- or perhaps it is grist for a sequel. The near absence of heroism in this movie is unfortunate but probably necessary to drive home the film s bleak message about humanity. Generously, I award the rather hapless Nick 3 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, Greg, Amy is a force to be reckoned with, one of Hollywood s most formidable and memorable villains we ve seen in years. I believe her level of malevolence rivals that of Hannibal Lecter. I hope none of our readers take this the wrong way, but I d enjoy seeing her tear up additional flesh in future sequels. Because of her magnetism, her backstory, and her ability to surprise us with one chilling act of evil after another, I ll also award her 5 Villains out of 5. Movie: Villains:  Heroes:",

After my second, I'm still quite frustrated, but I'd have no right to deny how much skill went into every single aspect of \"Gone Girl.\"\n\nI wouldn't say I don't enjoy the film. I think I really do, with the key word there being \"think.\" It angers me immensely, but David Fincher has such a knack for guiding an audience and controlling pieces of information that I'm nothing if not fully engaged every time I watch it. And I guess I like being manipulated by movies.\n\nThe cast is stellar, the cinematography is excellent, but I think the true star is the score. It's eery and unsettling, but so excellently disciplined. I feel genuine fear every time I hear \"What Have We Done To Each Other.\" And that's not a common thing for a soundtrack piece to do.\n\nEven though I know what happens in \"Gone Girl,\" and I know how everything ends, I have this part of me that's optimistic things will go how I want them to.

When we see some relationships have their ups and downs over a lifetime or short while when we don't see eye to eye in things shallow & deep. When we recall the first time we could see eachother when we were deep in conversations and seeing what's around us that we couldn't see that we know they are great to chat with. When we see how great in going deep into other things when we see we got a good thing. When others we see we don't need to get into deeply when they know us as shallow. When getting deep into other places we need to see, we spot clues in trying to see what we are missing. When we see we are deep, to write about everything we need to see when it's what we enjoy doing when it's our profession. When others see us to point out our flaws to only see what's shallow but others we see that matter see us deeply that we marry. When seeing life in high places we see plenty of shallowness to see others are different. When others see what they don't see, they see us deep in our career to only want to keep seeing. When what others don't know, they need to see closer to question when not everything we see is what it seems when others have seen quite alot to know exploring deeper into detail is important for solving cases. When what others see we know we see it's much bigger when people can naturally get deep into trouble when exposed to something. When what others are exposed to they see they must get deep away from someplaces that they hate. When we don't see what gateways we open to that leads us to dark corners, we don't notice when we are too busy juggling life & love to notice.\n\nWhen what others see as their inspiration & favorite they need to see they are deeply in love as we are. When we see that the country is deep into recession that we can't see away out we are deep in depression. When what we see we have plenty of we see we must let go when others are deep in debt. When we see that things are going bad and we are going deeper into the unknown. When what others know they see, they make others see that they are deeply disturbed when they are a suspect. When what others see they can't fix when it's deep into impossible pasts we take the easy route with a quick fix. When what routes we see we must go to make others happy we see we venture deep into the unknown and known that we have doubts. When what others venture deep into they see it's too late when somethings can't be undone to continue. When what others see we see but don't see only when it's said that we connect all what we see that something's are ending. When what we see what others hold, is deep hatred for us when they won't give us what we want an end. When we see we have given plenty to make others happy to know others are not deep but shallow. When we need to dig deep into something's to see we go deep into dark places.\n\nWhen what others see  as misunderstood they support us when others go into deep into nothing without clear evidence. When others have poor reputations in seeing things, we don't see when they are shallow news networks. When what we don't see, we see others know when we are deep into accusations in somethings we don't see we did but facts show otherwise. When we see others are losing support to dig deep and strategize. When we see digging deep into our words and pockets we lead those to great clues we don't see why? When we see others hate us so deeply that they could see it when things go deep to shallow to know others plan why they no longer want to see us when they think we are crazy and no good. \n\nWhen we see what the future holds for us and others, to know what others get into deep with and try to escape we need to go deeper in escaping them when some ends others plan we don't give when they need another ending we deeply believe they deserve. When what others see as not a big deal, we see they  are shallow in only looking at how deep they are in, and not us, only follow us into the deep when it saves their ass. When we see we have to plan every single detail to not have time with anything shallow when we are deeper into the thick of things. When what others dig deep into they see all too often when others see troubled women in all sorts of unknown parts. When what we see we know others are no longer deeply in love with us when some actions we see are now shallow flirtations. When what others see eye to eye with us we know they are expensive but as deep into detail that they know what they are seeing is deep revenge. \n\nWhen what we need to make others see we dig deep into others past to gather others like us who are victims. When we see others in another light when they deeply go into heartbreaking & dark places when things go bad that we don't see coming. When we see that hiding something's not so deeply that others see and uncover. When we see going in deep dark places, we are bound to see dark people that land us in deep trouble. When in dark places we see we must go even deeper in the dark when we need to see others for help in desperation. When we see what others want the world to see that others are deep and innocent when we see different. When we see others are getting deeper to what they can't see is a false truth, we make them see they are on the right track. When what others see we make them see when we get in deeper we strategize our way out. When what we need to make others see, is we were deep in danger that we needed out. When we make others see our master plan to go deep into details and dig deep  to wind up not responsible. When we see we have deep fan who love us and see us as a role model to know we are see that way. When what others see right through us when they followed our deep game, to not see what else we are capable when we are capable of doing anything and getting away in what others can't see. When what we can't see is how others felt trapped with others beside us that we went deep into love with and can't get out to only make them deeply fall in love with us more but they wanted out to only trap them in places they can't see or just fall deeply for each other. When what we make others see doesn't matter when we are no longer deep in scandal to only see what we can't see ahead of us, a life together we accept or don't accept. When we see we can't live this lie to tell the truth, when we can't go deep with others no longer. When what we don't see coming, we see we are deep into whether we like or not when what the public sees and knows and what we have to live with, is enough we have to see. When what we don't see who we leave behind in deep dark places when they have to be part of this lie that we no longer like seeing but have to live with too. When we see going in deep dark places we don't know what it will bring, when some actions we see we donate reversible and unreversible that we don't see who will get hurt in the end.",

            "content": "I don't know much about the bestselling novel, which the movie was based off, so I don't know how much was retooled and edited all the way towards the big ending.\n \nBen Affleck plays Nick Dunne, an unemployed magazine writer whose wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing from their supposedly perfect marriage life.\n \nNick becomes a tortured, confused husband after he comes home one day to find his home wrecked and his wife missing. As the local police (Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit) are involved and investigates but seem skeptical about Nick's odd behavior and reaction. particularly his just too-calm aloofness  and demeanor to his wife's disappearance.\n \nSurprisingly he doesn't seem to know much about his wife personally and social ably and they seem to suspect that he is hiding something. Even Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon from HBO's Leftovers) to whom he is close to and greatly trusts, begins to have her own doubts if Nick is telling the full truth as the investigation develops on. There's a suffocation presence from investigating law enforcement, and the media tabloids that create a web of mounding pressure and confusion around a missing wife and a presumably guilty looking husband.\n \nBut there is a flip side to Nick's actions and story as piling clues and physical evidence involving Amy' disappearance is beginning to paint a completely different portrait of her husband, of a man that prone to showing signs of increasing anger, physical abuse, selfishness, and suspected infidelity, as a result the leering media spotlight gradually transforms Nick Dunne from victim to prime suspect.\n \nI admit that I had reserves about Affleck playing out this lead role, and the blank facial looks in the first half of the film starting me out wondering\nabout that (maybe that was purpose of the blanks due to his role) - but as the movie evolved and developed, his character grew on me and\neventually intrigued me, especially during in its dark humor spots and moments -.particularly his antics when he is awkwardly forced into a media interview with a controversial, exploiting TV talk show host.\n \nBut I admit that it was Rosamund Pike (as Amy Dunne)  who easily stole the show and spotlight with me in this film- In fact don't be surprised if\nshe is thought of when the Oscar Academy buzz starts up based off this very part and role as she took on a look of conveying Amy's upper-class upbringing,\nher icy demeanor, that is perceived and interpreted as being disdain. Through Amy's clues (ala her hidden journals  the character opens up to us, feeding out overflowing defining  details and auto-biographical testimonies, making us fear for her, and Rosamund Pike sells it. We see her as both a victim and suspect, both controlling and protective. But no matter what she is always composed and prepared.\n \nI was impressed with how she reveals and displays her tale and antics over time, how she makes us rethink the past and the characters and their sincerity.\n \nGone Girl is a patient and steady film, but I did that it was too long  (About two and a half hours) and overall I kinda felt it's longveitity.in the latter half.\n \nIt's a terrific whodunit suspenseful thriller  with several booby-trapped surprises that only make you dig in more. It seems like every few minutes we're learning more and more about Nick and what he's been hiding from others - the film is thought provoking and it influences you to try to figure out who is the suspect, who is the victim, who deserves justice, who deserves revenge,\n \nIt shows both questionable and involving parties using media manipulation to exploit their targets in a game of justice, deceit and revenge - and the film keeps the audience I'm part of guessing between who to root for - and who to believe -and why they should be believed..\n \nFrom top to bottom, I thought the acting and the supporting cast overall was terrific and well done in the film. Even surprisingly Tyler Perry in his appearance in a significant role as Nick's high media profile, slick-smooth defense attorney.\n \nHowever there are just a few issues I had with Gone Girl, Besides being a bit too long, I simply did not like or care for the casting of Neil Patrick Harris in it at all as I simply could not take  him serious in his character role as Amy's mystery past lover.  Maybe he is too typecast as a highly spot-lighted lead figure of  \" How I Met Your Mother \" - and maybe Harris himself simply couldn't make me convinced by his acting that he is more than just TV's \n \nI thought attempting to look past Harris' presence  was hampering my imagination, mode and mood of the movie ,and I admit that I was so ready for him to go away so I could get re-focused on the movie again,  I wished they had went a different direction - I was bothered the minute I saw him and I was nowhere near convinced with his acting role as a smothering, love-sick ex-boyfriend.\n \nBut it had more issues (than just Neil Patrick Harris) I also thought there would be another episode in the making when Amy's plans are thwarted and she is mugged and robbed - I had expected another act of revenge on her part and I would get to see her cleverness and cunning in getting back at her tormenters- but at last, it didn't happen.\n \nAs good as the plot and story write is,  as good as the camera work is,... as superb as the overall acting is, ..as good as the dark, smirking sense of humor moments were,  I had issues with the disappointing ending; Especially as much as it was build up and rolling with momentum and happenings where my anticipation was racing towards the wow- expecting climatic ending that I thought I was in for-  But without spoiling it for you , it really didn't happen.\nMore so, I was left with a  ...\" oh, what da hell? \"  impression as the ending credits began to roll. It didn't settled anything, and left me like it had surrendered and gave it up when it was apparently targeting the viewers' curiosity and anticipation to the very end. \n \nI liked the mood, dark atmosphere, and cinematography - Once it hits to Amy's diary tale - that's when I thought the movie really ante up and became extraordinarily compelling, ....that's when you should tie yourself down to your chair,... focus your eyeballs tightly to the screen ....and line up your ears to the theater speakers as closely and attentively as possible because she goes through all her dirty evidence work and antics with an amazing speed and pin-point display but it is so clever and complicated that you may be afraid that you may missed out on an very important clue.  And it is critical because it is the basic motive for the entire film.\n \nThe great twist and turn of it is it sets up the mystery of who to believe, who to root for, who to villainize and point the finger at, who is the victim, who is the suspect, and who is telling the believable truth. As it develops, it has some of the who-dunnit element and sexy seductiveness that we remember seeing from Basic Instincts.\n \n  Overall and as a whole , I thought it was a very good suspenseful thriller - and on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it 7.5 ....and 3 Tomatoes",

Gone Girl touches on marriage/relationship themes like other notable films (Revolutionary Road, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), but with deeper satire and an 'up to date' stance. Fincher has a way of reflecting the more interesting parts (and dark corners) of the collective consciousness (especially Americans) in a humorous way, sometimes veering towards an artistic activism of sorts (but its just 'entertainment' and simply pointing out issues will not magically make them go away). I wasn't sold on Rosamund Pike's performance until later in the film and it was nice to see a more raw and fanatical version of her than usual. This film's attitude and satire reminded me of films by Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), plus older films like Heathers (Michael Lehman) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone). \nGone Girl is ambitious in that it reaches for a wider audience in obvious and more subtle ways, infusing the 'law of reflection' to play with our minds (notably challenging our perception of who the antagonist is)- there are no 'winners', just human beings perceiving from their own experience (nicely balanced male and female point of view), resulting in a zero sum score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an appropriate and subtle soundtrack.",

And what can I say about Rosamund Pike? She gave life to an extremely complex character with dedication, and she ultimately outshines everyone else. An amazing screenplay, full of unexpected twists, adapted from an even more amazing novel and cleverly written dialogue, together with a fittingly dark score all add up to create an incredible picture that serves also as a commentary upon the power of media and the nature of modern marriage.",

The police investigation uncovers several strange elements and Nick's behaviour doesn't paint the image of a distraught husband. Did he kill her? The press and the public certainly think so as the story makes several completely unexpected turns as new revelations come to light. There were elements that reminded me of Fargo in this terrific movie by David Fincher, in that we have a police investigation in a small American town where everyone seems to be hiding something. There's also a dash of Fatal Attraction and a dollop of that Christie staple, the unreliable narrator. I've always found Rosamund Pike to be both interesting to watch and more than capable and here she seems to relish her complex and variable role. Ben Affleck is an affable, likeable lead who is not as meek and mild as he first seems. Everyone in this movie seems to have a skeleton or two kicking around in their closets and the plot weaves around cleverly enough to keep the viewer guessing about what will happen next.

Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",

I personally will always put Benjamin Button(2008)over his latest film.\nGone Girl is the story about Nick who comes home one day and his wife is gone without a trace,and his house is a crime scene. He is put in prison but enlists the help of a lawyer played by Tyler Perry who is willing to give him a chance by the truth of the real story to his wife's disappearance.\nEveryone was raving about this film in it's first two weeks of release,while I was busy trying to watch a set-of horror only films. I couldn't wait to see this film for two reasons,Ben Affleck and David Fincher. Ben Afflcek is one of my favorite actor/director working today and every time his name is on a film I must see it. David Fincher has made three great films I have seen my favorite being Benjamin button and Se7en, I did enjoy Zodiac but though those to be better.They both bring their \"A\" game in this movie Its Ben Afflecks best since Argo and better then Se7en.\nYou won't believe how it ends. If you love a good mystery,Gone Girl is a must for you. I give Gone Girl a four and a half out of five.",

And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\n\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\n\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\n\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down.\n\nOverall Gone Girl is a fantastic film.",

            "content": "With a variety of great films under his belt, David Fincher has risen to become one of the best directors in the Hollywood business. Coming off of the recent political drama House of Cards, Fincher has now set his sights on Gone Girl, with impressive results.\n\nGone Girl follows the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Nick arrives home one evening to find his wife gone and a series of cryptic clues and broken furniture left behind. He finds himself embroiled with both the media (personified by Missi Pyle's Ellen Abbott) and Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) in his search, but as things go along a seemingly ordinary mystery devolves into a web of lies and hidden secrets. Just as the police begin to question Nick's honesty, so too does the audience question his integrity; did he kill his wife? Or if not, why and how did she leave him? This burning debate gradually develops as the film swaps between the perspectives of Nick and his wife with flash backs whilst also bringing in new characters which have their own roles to play in the search. On top of a plot which consistently moves forward, the film weaves in detailed themes which are constantly on display; these include the difficulties of marriage, mental degeneration, keeping up appearances and the pressures from the media and other external sources. The film gets especially dark in its later act with often disturbing acts of violence permeating the haggard minds of the characters. The ultimate conclusion, however does stick out as rather confusing and maybe a little anti-climactic; I won't ruin it here but you may well leave the film expecting slightly more closure, especially to Nick's side of the story.\n\nA movie of this genre thrives on its characters and those featured in Gone Girl are both detailed and often quite relatable. Ben Affleck does a great job of conveying the sheer frustration and isolation Nick feels from being unable to find his wife and constantly being hounded by the media, allowing the audience to put themselves in his perspective. Rosamand Pike is also brilliant as Amy, putting across the character's deterioration over the course of the film. The flashbacks strewn about the film's first act give us a lot of time to get to know the two and in doing so, we're all the more curious as to what will become of their ultimate commitments to each other. The side characters in the film are also well done; Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and his lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) have important parts to play in the overall story arc and their own more light-hearted characteristics play off the main leads well. On the other hand Ellen Abbott's character is one you will love to loath time and time again thanks to her endlessly senseless accusations. Gone Girl's characters and plot stand on an equally tuned level, creating a steady level of quality across the board.\n\nGone Girl is deftly paced, intelligent and complex, making it another winner from director David Fincher. The film's slower developments and confusing resolutions may not ring true for everyone, but for those who want something beyond the usual predictable film tropes; this is most definitely one to watch.",

            "content": "Picture\nI'm going to be honest, I really liked the start of this movie, two writers falling in love in a cloud of romance couldn't be any sweeter. I spent the first twenty minutes falling in love with Amazing Amy as she tells of how she fell in love with Nick Dunne, but as the story develops cracks appear in the relationship and it's difficult to tell where our allegiance lies, which is why we get caught up in the initial media frenzy that the movie pulls off so well.\n\nAt the turning point we find Nick Dunne is just another washed up writer in a bar downtown, his relationship is under some serious stress and we wonder if these two can make it.  Then disaster strikes as Nick comes home to find a coffee table turned over in the living room. He immediately suspects something is wrong, unemployed Amy would have had all day to clean that up, best call the police.\n\nI've never had cops over to the house after I've reported someone missing but I think I'd be pretty perturbed if they suddenly left little post it notes all about the place saying 'check this shit out' 'forensics need to see this' 'definitely evidence' 'blood all over the kitchen'.\n\nNick doesn't mind though, just happy to help out as he entangles himself further by leading the police from one clue to the next. Quick interview with the prime suspect and we learn that he doesn't know his wife that well at all, how did these two ever get married? Does Nick even love Amy? Has he ever loved her?\n\nThe best part of the thriller is wondering if Nick has something to do with his wife's disappearance, but the film never really convinces us of his malice, in fact the movie lacks a real villain in that sense.\n\nBy that I mean the movie never really delivers an act of evil that we can use to identify the sinister criminal, the rat, the bad guy - we never get that feeling of fear where our skin crawls with discomfort. Instead we get a psychotic house wife, a cheating husband, a cop that can't solve a crime, a teenage girl that can't pass her exams, a sister that can't find a husband (or a friend outside of her family), a good looking rich guy who can't find a girlfriend, two parents who can't find their daughter (no not the McCanns), a lawyer who can't find a case, two mentioned marines who never find anything, a drug lord that can't find a gun, a news anchor who can't find more than the one news story, a Father who's lost his mind, and a movie that loses the run of itself.\n\nI can't understand why this movie tries to continuously get clever with itself instead of developing one plot at a time, usually a thriller tries to play mind games with the audience by slowly building cliff hangers but this is a movie too busy trying to play mind games with itself, it moves too quickly from scene to scene in an easily explained and convenient fashion, without capturing the imagination of the viewer. It mostly just gets boring and refuses to end. Alright we get it, you've had a few bad relationships, let's all just be friends again. Ultimately the film is just too Ben Afleck, sure it tries to be bold but it's just not cut throat enough to make it off the bottom shelf.\n\nSpoilers include  :\n\nWhy wait to get out of the hospital to have a shower?\n\nSurely divorce would have been a better option?\n\nWhy not get search warrants straight away?\n\nWhy is there only one suspect in a murder investigation?\nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

Fatal Attraction 2 I mean Gone Girl although, I image that this is what would have happened if Dan Gallagher and Alex Forrest would have had a daughter together then Dan was killed then Alex had to raise the little girl and got remarried sometime later, and then became a writer, and this movie was about that little girl. But where Fatal Attraction was at least a decent movie with at least redemption at the end of the movie, this movie is having none of that. \n*Spoiler alert*  The plot of the movie was over complicated, she is a psycho who wants to setup her husband for her fake murder but where there is a lot of easier ways to do that she picked the most complicated way to do so. Where there should be some likable character there are none except the sister Margo and she barely gets a pass at that. Everyone is asshole or creepy has hell, the husband hates his wife for most of the movie, the wife hates her husband for most of the movie, Wife's mother what little of her is in the movie is a bitch and the wife's dad is a little creepy pedo feeling coming from him. The cop doing the investigation was ok in the beginning then starts to become a bit of a bitch though out, the ex-boyfriend played by Neil Patrick Harris was hurt by the wife but wouldn't say what she did then he opens he's arms for her when she want to come back to him, There is no redemption for these characters the husband just become afraid of his wife at the end, the wife is still a psycho, the sister is still hates the wife and no one is better for it.  Where on paper this seems like it would be good plot for a movie for me it just falls flat.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Gone Girl ist beides: Kunst und Entertainment, ein Thriller, aber auch eine echte Aufgabe. Ein Publikumsfilm! Die Perspektiven, der Schwerpunkt wechseln so h\u00e4ufig in Gone Girl, dass es den Eindruck macht, hier w\u00fcrden mehrere Kurzfilme miteinander verbunden werden. Im Grunde aber ist es einfach nur die Geschichte eines Mannes, der einen Mord ver\u00fcbt hat - oder nicht. Gone Girl beginnt am f\u00fcnften Hochzeitstag von Nick (Ben Affleck) und Amy (Rosamund Pike). Gleichzeitig ist es der Tag von Amys r\u00e4tselhaftem Verschwinden. Zun\u00e4chst erleben wir das Geschehen aus Nicks Perspektive. Er ist ein frustrierter ehemaliger Journalist, der vor der Wirtschaftskrise nach Missouri floh. Gemeinsam mit seiner Schwester Margo (Carrie Coon) betreibt er dort eine Bar. In der K\u00fcche des Ladens finden sich Blutspuren und ein zertr\u00fcmmerter Glastisch. Indizien daf\u00fcr, dass Amy entf\u00fchrt wurde? Nick aber reagiert keineswegs ersch\u00fcttert und das macht ihn f\u00fcr Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) zum Verd\u00e4chtigen. In R\u00fcckblenden kommt parallel dazu Amy zu Wort. Aus ihrer Sicht erleben wir, wie die Beziehung erste Risse bekam nach dem Umzug in die Provinz. Schliesslich entfremdeten sich beide. Beide Perspektiven sind gegenl\u00e4ufig, ein schl\u00fcssiges Gesamtbild ergibt sich nicht. Steckt wom\u00f6glich Amy hinter der Entf\u00fchrung? Welche Meinung vertritt denn nun David Fincher? Hat er \u00fcberhaupt eine oder macht es ihm nur Spass, uns in die Irre zu f\u00fchren? Wie so viele Regisseure, die sich der \"Postmoderne\" verschrieben haben, ist Fincher ein Misanthrop.

            "content": "There's an interesting correlation that exists within David Fincher's filmography: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button aside, the more shocking and memorable a film's chief psychopath is, the better the film is as a whole. Kevin Spacey's John Doe made Se7en one of the most horrifying films of all time, and characters like Tyler Durden and Mark Zuckerberg aren't psychopaths in the same way, but both are a little twisted and most definitely unforgettable.\n\nOn the other hand, can you remember much about Stellan Skarsgard's character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Or who even played the villain in Panic Room?\n\nDiscussing Gone Girl's chief psychopath is a little complicated for a variety of reasons. For one, it would mean spoiling some of the film's best surprises (surprises that made me seek out the book before the internet spoiled the film). More interestingly, however, is the notion that the identity of a \"chief psychopath\" can vary from viewer to viewer. But this collection of psychos ranks among Fincher's most memorable, and perhaps because of that, Gone Girl ranks among the directors better films.\n\nThe film (and the book) unfolds across three very distinct acts. The first introduces us to Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and, through her diary, his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears mysteriously from their Missouri home. Signs point to a struggle, and while Nick spent a few hours of that day at the bar he co-owns with his twin sister, Margot (Carrie Coon), investigating detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are suspicious of the few hours he spent that morning alone at the beach.\n\nAs the days go on, news of Amy's disappearance goes national. She's the inspiration for a best-selling series of children's books, and as a result, she's collected a series of frightening admirers over the course of her life. But maybe none is as frightening as Nick, for the last line in her diary reads, \"This man may truly kill me.\"\n\nWhat starts as a luridly entertaining mystery becomes more layered as narrators and protagonists reveal themselves to be liars and manipulators, and anyone familiar with Gillian Flynn's novel (she also penned the screenplay here) will appreciate David Fincher's way of conveying all of this cinematically. Yes, as is almost always the case with adapted material, some context is lost in translation, but Fincher and Flynn add to the latter's text by rooting everything in a place resembling the real world. It's still wild, fantastical pulp, but Gone Girl the novel took place on another planet. By toning down all but a few exclamation point scenes, Fincher's film is more sinister and haunting.\n\nBen Affleck is perfectly used as Nick. It's not a particularly flashy performance, but neither is the role. Rosamund Pike, for all intents and purposes, gets the chance to play several different characters-all of which are done to near perfection. Like the film as a whole, she does a wonderful job of conveying all aspects of Amazing Amy while still grounding her very much in the real world-a task I thought impossible.\n\nAmong the supporting cast are a bunch of actors whose performances range from good (Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens) to great (Tyler Perry). However, one falls completely flat. Neil Patrick Harris never finds Desi Collings, which renders a few key scenes flatter than they ought to be.\n\nBut Fincher's handle on his craft is as strong as ever. Gone Girl is the best-edited film so far this year (kudos Kirk Baxter, who's won two Oscars for Fincher films and does career-best work here), and its shot by Jeff Cronenweth to perfection (suburbia has never felt so menancing). The score from usual Fincher composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is more subdued than their last few collaborations, but its startling punctuation marks are simply perfect.\n\nThe film does rely a lot on its plot machinations, but not so much that it's void of anything thematically meaningful. Maybe it's that marriage is hard work, as one character remarks. That's certainly the case, but what stuck out to me more after the lights went up was a quote from another character: \"You are the most fucked up people I've ever met.\"\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/gone-girl-review/",

Though it starts off with a great deal of traditional mystery format to it, the overlay of Amy's diary, and the revelations therein, particularly as early as they come, bends the entire thing in a way that creates copious drama and changes the entire perception of both main characters.\nWhen Nick begins to put the pieces together about what happened, the tension builds greatly and it starts to become a question of whether or not the truth is possible.  Fincher slow-plays this all tremendously, shaping the narrative and the incredible nature of the scheme through stylish visuals and sharp dialogue.\nNothing is ever what it seems in a film such as this, and the conclusion will leave your head spinning, wondering how, after all the events, it could possibly end that way.

Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? \n\nDavid Fincher\u00b4s \"Gone Girl\" digs into the dark psyche of marriage and the ideology behind this union, presenting a twisted story of the so called reported crime and the planning of it. I haven\u00b4t red Gillian Flynn\u00b4s book as I normally don\u00b4t go for bestellers, but since David Fincher is one of my favourite directors I wanted to see it. Fincher works his magic, but he still doesn\u00b4t go all the way like he did with \"Seven\" and \"Fight Club\". Ben Affleck is not too bad as Nick (yet way too one-dimensional), but fantastically upstaged by Rosamund Pike as the borderline psychotic Amy. While Neil Patrick Harris is completely miscasted as Desi Collings. The man cannot play anything else than Barney Stinson. However, despite the technical groundwork from Fincher and the excellent performance from Pike, the story has huge plot holes and the logic goes out the door the minute Amy \"disappears\". The portrait of the two sexes is so stereotypical it hurts (could write an essy on it) and to be frank quite ridiculous and there\u00b4s way too many scenes that just doesn\u00b4t add up. The end is as well mind boggling as Nick gives their marriage another chance despite murder, mayhem and full on psychotic behaviour from Amy which he is aware of. By then the film shows itself to truly not be in its own right mind.",

A lot about Desi was missing among other things.  I often find this with good books which do not transfer well to the screen, because so much is cut out due to time constraints and cutting or changing of characters.   I found the same thing with The Bone Collector, which was an excellent book but disappointing film.  People who have not read the books may still think the films are good, which they are, but when you have read them it is disappointing.  In The Bone Collector by Jeffery Deaver they changed the sex and nationality of some characters.  In Gone Girl the Tanner Bolt character was white and his wife a beautiful statuesque black woman, but she wasn't in it at all, and the same applies to Desi's mother.",

The film is both a whodunit thriller and some sort of social commentary on marriage and the media. Tonally, it swings between satire and straight drama and never quite finds its groove. The POV shifts provide the film with its major twist (arguably its greatest selling point) but also throw audience identification with the primary protagonist.\n\nAs you'd expect with a David Fincher film, production values and performances are strong. Affleck is convincing as the disaffected writer and husband. Pike is perfectly luminous and loathsome. Carrie Coon is fantastic as Nick's straight-talking sister Margo, as is Kim Dickens as the detective investigating the case, Sela Ward as a journalist and Tyler Perry as Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt.\n\nDespite all of this as the film nears closer to its very drawn out conclusion it tends to get more and more disappointing. Established narrative expectations are not delivered on. That would be fine if the direction taken made sense but you find yourself saying, 'Seriously?' Tyler Perry's character Tanner Bolt is given substantial build up before he enters the story but ultimately has a very insignificant role to play before exiting stage left. Believable character motivation flies out the window and coupled with some rather significant logic flaws the film's resolution comes across as forced commentary rather than natural conclusion.\n\nUndoubtedly the novel is able to fill in the missing character details to make more sense of where this story ends up but without them the film may start out strongly commanding intrigue and involvement but by the end its allure is simply gone.",

It had elements of mystery and drama that I've come to love in other movies similar to it. One such film I enjoyed was Side Effects starring Jude Law, which had an ending ten times better than this film.\n\nI can't go into any details without spoiling this movie for anyone willing to even read this review, but the ending made me feel like I wasted three hours of my life. It was just... horrible, in every single way. I don't just mean the dark tone of it, which coincides with the rest of the film's light, and therefore can be forgiven... sort of... but I did feel like the last twenty minutes could be cut out and we'd be given the same result. It made me feel so emotionally threadbare and hollow that it ruined my mood for the rest of the evening.\n\nUp until the ending, it was great. It was an intriguing thrill-ride that you just had to keep watching, just to see what would happen next. What you get in the end is the movie spitting in your face and leaving you dissatisfied.\n\nI can still taste its foulness even now. I wish I could unsee all of it.",

            "content": "Featuring great and outstanding performances from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike combined with intelligent storytelling and taut suspense Gone Girl is by far one of the best films to date and is also one of David Fincher's best films to date since The Social Network and his second feature film Se7en. Based on the popular Gillian Flynn novel of the same name Gone Girl deals with the story of the Dunne couple Nick and Amy who are in a rocky and troubled marriage. On the day of their anniversary Nick finds his wife has been kidnapped from their very own home and soon he decides to lead a search party with the help of a bunch of police officers as well. But soon the police are suspicious about Nick and Nick soon becomes the suspect of his wife's kidnapping and Nick also soon learns the true nature of his wife and that she's planning to have him arrested by the cops and Nick must find a way to deal with his situation before he ends up in prison. I finally had the chance to watch Gone Girl after reading the novel and of course reading all the positive reviews from critics and audiences. To my surprise, I was like wow! Gone Girl is one of the best films ever made and I truly appreciate the work done by screenwriter and novelist Gillian Flynn including some support and outstanding directing by director David Fincher. I'm seriously not kidding when I said that this is Fincher's best film to date because it really is. It is my third favorite David Fincher movie with the first being The Social Network, second is his outstanding dark crime thriller Se7en and fourth is his new adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I admit I read Dark Places first and then I watched the film adaptation of Dark Places since Dark Places is Gillian Flynn's second novel and Gone Girl is her third book and I love how it was adapted into a movie I enjoyed Dark Places whodunnit Mystery Thriller style including its grotesque and dark tone. But with Gone Girl it is a huge surprise. Like the recently released Dark Places, Gone Girl was really different. Gone Girl was different in terms of tone, themes, suspense and execution and I truly believe Fincher did it in a believable way. Anyways, let's get on with the review. What I like about Gone Girl is that this film is very intriguing from start to finish in its overall length and pacing. I was totally shocked and surprised with how the film  goes. Because in the first half it starts out as a missing person's movie until in the next half it goes into a psychological territory done in a grim and darker way because the movie will keep you guessing a lot from start to finish and it creates a lot of mysteries and it also gives the overall film a creepy vibe. One of the other things I like about Gone Girl is that this movie is also faithful to the source novel and I was pretty surprised to how faithful the movie was and it didn't disappoint at all despite a few changes from the book since there are only a few changes from the novel(a few characters missing like Desi Collings' mother, Hilary Handy and several scenes like Andie biting Nick in the neck, tensions between Amy's parents on Nick) but nevertheless the film still has the mystery and creepy feel. I also love the gorgeous settings of the film and it gives the film the feeling of how someone suffers from a bad day in their everyday life it has that sense of feeling of stress, loneliness and isolation at the same time. The other things I like about Gone Girl is that the movie is also packed with several scenes that are tense and unexpected in times even though it isn't as tense as the book(The scene where Nick shoves his wife, the motel scene where Amy gets robbed by Jeff and Greta and the super gory climax where Amy kills Desi Collings) plus I love the cinematography of Fincher collaborator Jeff Cronenweth(One Hour Photo, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) which gives the film a haunting feel at the same time. I also love the film's themes and tones and the film's tone is very haunting and dark while the themes of the film about how most evil women can be manipulative and daring towards their husbands along with husbands cheating on their wives and of course how social media threats affect a person's life makes you think about the situations that could happen in your life when you marry someone who is manipulative and very psychotic creates a sense of fear, tension and suspense and it also makes you think twice about life as well since Dark Places deals with themes about murder, troubled teens, teen pregnancy and pointing your finger at someone who you think committed the crime is very different to Gone Girl's themes and both themes are very haunting and dark because the themes in both Dark Places and Gone Girl shows the dark side of an individual's personality and how he/she can do something really bad that can cause many people to hate and point the finger at the one who is a perpetrator at first but is actually innocent in real life its by far one of the creepiest things in film history. But the film has two real main highlights. The first thing I really like about this movie is that the film's soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who are Fincher's collaborators from Fincher's The Social Network is very haunting, dark and in times dramatic as well which fits in the overall tone of the film. I love how the soundtrack range from being very light in scenes where Nick wakes up in the morning to visit his twin sister Margo to very dark when tensions surrounding Nick being the prime suspect of his wife's disappearance is absolutely amazing and in my honest opinion the soundtrack felt that it was composed more by M. Night Shyamalan's collaborator James Newton Howard because the melodic vibe of the soundtrack is so dreamy and haunting in times and it works really well. Now the acting is the second main highlight of this movie. All of the casts did a very good job with their performances in this movie from Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex boyfriend Desi Collings to Scoot McNairy as Tommy O'Hara Amy's other ex boyfriend. But out of all the casts Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are the real stars of this movie. Both of them deliver the best performances in both of their careers. They both did a very good job in portraying Nick Dunne and Amy Elliot Dunne respectively. Plus they are perfect for the two main characters in the book and they match the description of the characters of Nick and Amy in the novel and I look forward to what these two will do next. Director David Fincher did an amazing and perfect job with his work on this movie and the same can be said to screenwriter and novelist Gillian Flynn and Gillian Flynn did a very good job with adapting her third successful novel into the big screen and David Fincher managed to raise the bar up even higher by turning the screenplay into a dark, twisted and haunting movie combined with surprising performances from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and I truly can't wait to see what David Fincher will do next as well. Overall Gone Girl is a superb adaptation of Gillian Flynn's successful novel that delivers lots of haunting moments, thrills, some creepy moments and is entertaining at the same time. This movie gets a 10/10.",

Neil Patrick Harris also offers a good performance.\n\nMy only problems with Gone Girl were how I didn't really like any of the characters. It should be noted that plenty of films have unlikeable characters, but it was hard to root for anyone in this psychological thriller. This is a small nitpick though. Go see Gone Girl if you want something heavier than your normal comedy.",

Gone Girl amuses and unsettles, entertains and disturbs.

            "content": "UNRELIABLE NARRATOR. From 10/05/2014. Gracie and I went to see Gillian Flynn-written (both novel and screenplay) and David Fincher-directed \"Gone Girl\" yesterday. I recommend the film, number one in the box office this opening week. Better yet, please consider reading more about it, and I recommend rottentomatoes.com, which provides links to reviews by critics.\n \n\"Gone Girl\" is a 432-page novel (2012) and a 149-minute film (2014). It is about a couple about to celebrate their wood (fifth) wedding anniversary when the wife goes missing. It is about the relationship of a couple of unreliable narrators whose marriage seems ideal and idyllic and is anything but. It is about the media circus and us the invested spectators whose opinions on everything must count, but don't. In short, \"Gone Girl\" is a satire about our sick society. This is the world of NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) sickos, and we only live in it and are bemusedly shat at.\n\nIf newsmaking one percenters have NPD, we the 99% people have ADHD (attention deficient hyperactivity disorder). We follow the bouncing ball, entertaining the thought we need always to be in tune, without questioning who put that song we couldn't get rid of in our head. Being attuned and amused becomes more important than paying attention to what's really important.\n \nAnd, so, we read a book and watch a movie about a couple who are \"so cute I want to punch us in the face.\" When their private lives are opened for public consumption, no thanks to the media and social networks, we take sides, play the partisan game, and inform the world of our opinion as though it matters -- and we matter: NPD by osmosis.\n \nFlynn and Fincher shoehorn the narrative to fit the screen. Do we really care about the ecstasy and agony of another couple? Well, the ecstasy part, maybe in porn; but don't we have angst and anger of our own? Which, of course, we can't control. So, we check out how other people live. And we invest in their well-being. At the expense of ours. Which is more important.\n \nGeorge Orwell said: \"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\"\n \nJim Morrison: \"Whoever controls the media controls the mind.\"\n \nAllen Ginsberg: \"Whoever controls the media, the images, controls the culture.\"\n \nGary DeMar: \"Whoever controls the schools controls the world.\"\n \nAnd Chris Claremont: \"Whoever controls the narrative has the power.\"\n \nFlynn and Fincher give us the narrative. It's a matter now who has control of the discussion. Or, is our world and society so corrupted and distracted that discussion is out of the question? The reliably controlled narrative is the new normal, and we just have to live in and with it, BS and all.\n \nPlease take great care of yourself, everyone, and thank you for all you do. Love, Mel & Gracie",

            "content": "No one would blame you if you approached David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best seller Gone Girl with a bit of trepidation. In most cases a hugely successful book turned into a movie leaves its faithful audience with the feeling of \"Did they even bother to read the book?\" It is a relief to report that Gone Girl doesn't have that problem. Fused with a cinema artist's great skill and a screenplay that is as tricky and fearless as its source material, this turns out to be one of the best films of the year.\n\nIt was a difficult book to translate. Gillian Flynn concocted a brilliant and complex pot boiler that seemed to move in at least five different directions, shuffling a dozen different characters around like pieces on a chess board. In terms of narrative, it walked the knife-edge, veering close to becoming convoluted but never losing focus. The movie works just as well as the book (and in some ways better), and the fact that the author wrote the screenplay - which I always champion - is probably the reason why.\n\nGone Girl is a complex story that opens one way, and then turns another way before turning into something completely different. The story is all about perspectives sprung from the story of a marriage that never should have happened in the first place. We meet Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a college professor who, years ago, married Amy (Rosemund Pike) and was happy as long as their marriage was padded with money and hot sex. Then the recession hit and they both found themselves out of work. Without the cushion of surface comforts, it is revealed that their marriage was as joyful as a cupcake made of arsenic. The mask hiding the bitterness in their union is seen by everyone else as a match made in Heaven.\n\nThen one day Nick comes home and finds Amy missing. There some broken glass and an overturned ottoman in the living room. There's some drops of blood on the kitchen cabinet. All curious, but the cops seem more interested in Nick's demeanor - he seems more irritated than upset. The case becomes a community effort to find the young woman and then blows up into a national media frenzy. The whole country begins to wonder if Nick might be involved in her disappearance. Was he beating her? Was she pregnant? Was he cheating on her? The answers to all of these questions ultimately have at least five or six answers. Nothing in this story is ever as it seems.\n\nMore of the story I cannot reveal without giving too much away. This is a complex story despite its simple premise. It's one of those fun thrillers where you're constantly second-guessing what is happening - just when you think you've figured it out, the screenplay peels back another layer and the mystery of Amy's disappearance gets more and more bizarre. What starts as a singular idea spirals down and down and down, opening more doors yet somehow all connecting them together. This is one of the most sadistically brilliant thrillers in a long time.\n\nIt is appropriate that Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher whose films always seem be about ordinary people who, through circumstance, find themselves in the sadistic arena of inhumanity. This was the theme of Fight Club, Se7en, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Zodiac, The Game and Panic Room. Fincher never stoops to making his characters likable, and in Ben Affleck he's found the right actor to play Nick. Affleck is not afraid to look like a jerk and we admire him for that. He's cocky, yet there's something about his questionable union with Amy that gives us a measure of sympathy for him even when his guilt seems to be staring us in the face.\n\nAffleck shows the strain of a man who slowly begins to realize that he is married to a woman that he never really knew, and begins to come apart at the seams under scrutiny from the cops, his sister, the media, Amy's parents, the public, and his own attorney. Everyone has a perspective on the case; everyone has a point of view that makes Nick look guilty of something no matter whether he's done anything wrong or not.  This may be the timeliest film of the year.",

It's directed by Fincher with a rather loose hand, which allows for a certain casual ebb and flow as it works its way through the source material. The first half is set up as a mystery, while the latter half works as a thriller. All of this is a good thing in the hands of Fincher. \n\nIt is a dark and twisted story, and one that only gets seemingly more twisted as it goes on towards its unsettling conclusion. Affleck gives us another understated performance that is perfectly suited for the pace and nature of the film. He brings a layed back presence to a character that is not so much about depth as it is about embodying the twisty nature of the story itself. Pike, who plays opposite Affleck, is even more involved with her character (as the girl gone missing), and in a lot of ways the story hinges on her performance. \n\nThis is more of a directors film than it is an actors one. And I have no doubt that Affleck brought some of his perspective to the table on this end as well. And to be fair, it does take its own madness almost too far (considering where it begins as an involved mystery of who did it/what happened). When the mystery is revealed halfway through the story then has the freedom to evolve and explore different avenues of incredulity. Along the way it does elevate itself above the confines of a recognizable and realistic commentary on the romantic relationship, but it never does fall completely off the edge, coming across as more of ingenious net of complex schemes and plots rather than simply a preposterous idea regarding relationship woes.",

There's not many movies out there than can compete with all the mega blockbusters that get released, but Gone Girl hits the mark by twisting a boring disappearance scenario into a smart unpredictable surprise.

The performances here are very powerful both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are very talented actors and give us a very strong performances, Affleck played a believably accused husband who is trying to prove to everyone that he is not responsible for the disappearance of Amy and Pike truly shocked us all with her most shocking performance yet, she played a total deadly psychopath woman and convince us all she is the right actor for the role. Affleck and Pike also have a strong chemistry together like they are a real couple and make this movie work. The plot is strong as well and  it show us of how complex marriage can be, the situations here are very serious and the atmosphere is very heavy as things gets very ugly. Amy is planning her perfect plan to change Nick's mind for her by taking extreme measures, meanwhile Nick desperately try to prove his innocence as he pushes him self to the extreme. It's a mind bending psychological thriller that teaches us of how cruel relationships can be as those people put their egos more than \"we\" but in the end everything can solved if there is understanding !!!",

It is a good thriller and it is perfect in almost every possible way. I really love the female character played by Rosamund Pike. She really convinced me that she is an evil incarnate. I also love Ben Affleck and Neil Patrick's performance. This movie get me to think about the true meaning of marriage. Do you really think you know about the person who sleep beside you every night? Obviously Nick Dunne of this movie don't know all about his wife like he thinks he does. I believe they really love each other at the first several years of their marriage. But as the sweetness and passion of love wear off, they begin to realize that the person they married is not the person they used to love anymore. Amy think Nick is lazy and Nick find Amy to be mean and boring. But Nick still thinks that they can go on with their life even when there is no love between him and Amy. He is terribly wrong. After Amy finds out that he is having an affair with another woman, she become furiously angry and come up with a evil plan to fake her death and frame Nick for it. She thinks Nick deserves to go to prison for being dishonest to her. Nick, on the other hand has no idea what is waiting for him when he wakes up on their anniversary. when he come home later that day to find his wife missing, he is confused and reports Amy's disappearance to the local authority. The police come and he is very cooperative at first. But when all the evidences point to him, he finally realized that he is being framed. In my own perspective, though Nick is the victim, I think neither of them is innocent. Their irresponsible and selfish behaviors killed Desi Collings and wasted a lot police resources which could be put into good use. The ending was really shocking. I can't believe Nick still decides to live with Amy after everything. A lot of people think it is unrealistic, but I think it is also irony. It's just a movie, it doesn't have to be like real life all the time. I think the movie is just trying to tell us that in real life there are a lot of couples like Nick and Amy who go on with their marriage even when it is just full of unhappiness, dishonesty and resent.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for any mistakes in my English.",

            "content": "David Fincher's brilliant, hypnotically fascinating character study of modern love gone terribly wrong, which is based on the runaway best selling novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. It begins on the day of the fifth anniversary of a young couple, Nick and Amy Dunne. Nick, played tremendously by a superb Ben Affleck, who comes home to find the living room in disarray and his wife Amy, played by Rosemund Pike, in an amazing star-making performance, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, is missing. The mystery ignites a media frenzy and suspicion falls on Nick. The police detectives on the case, well played by Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit, are worrisome about Nick's abnormal reaction to his wife's disappearance. He doesn't seem to know much about his wife, and he seems like he's hiding something. Even Nick's twin sister Margo, played terrifically by Carrie Coon, has her doubts that Nick is telling the full truth. Amy's diary however paints a different portrait of her husband, a man prone to increasing anger, mostly stemming from the loss of his job, and a relocation from New York City to Missouri. Most of Nick's anger is focused squarely on Amy, enough that she fears for her life, and is looking to buy a gun. As various clues keep piling up and Nick's public behavior appears more and more suspicious, the media spotlight transforms him from victim to prime suspect. It soon becomes clear that not everything is as it seems, and it's probably safe to say that the story's controversial resolution will shock a large portion of the audience, and anger the rest. It is a magnificent thriller, thanks to David Fincher's meticulous direction, and the exceptional supporting performances by Neil Patrick Harris, David Clennon, Lisa Barnes, Missi Pyle, Emily Ratajowski, Sela Ward, Loia Kirke, with special kudos to Tyler Perry, for his wonderfully impressive turn as the defense lawyer Tanner Bolt. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is striking, and the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is sensational. One of the year's best and most entertaining films, a total triumphant. Highly Recommended.",

Gone Girl is enthralling for the first hour. Really well acted by Affleck and Pike and Fincher doesn't disappoint in his use of suspense. \n\nHowever, and there is a big but coming. The way the story unfolds is not only implausible but almost ludicrous. Discreet veils are drawn over several unanswered questions. Questions that would be asked and answered in the normal world.

            "content": "I'm not exactly sure what to think of David Fincher as a director. Two of his movies I thought had poor endings the first time I saw them: Fight Club and The Social Network. On second viewing I loved Fight Club, kind of giving the ending a pass, and liked Social Network the second time I gave it a chance, still unsure of the ending. Now after viewing these movies a number of times I understand the significance of these endings, but do not believe they are great resolutions. For Gone Girl, the ending left me amazed and creeped out how the Rosamund Pike character won, but it doesn't make perfect sense that she got away with murder.\n\nI think some of the writing towards the beginning of the film is a little strange; I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's something \"off\" about it. This isn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but you know how Amy's life is improved upon through her parents' book series \"Amazing Amy?\" 1) Why would a book series about such a perfect girl be so popular, and 2) What kind of parents do that? As Nick states: a**holes do that.\n\nThe dialogue before they REALLY get into the investigation of Amy's disappearance is highly based in riddles, which are included when Nick and Amy flirt in flashback sequences. I mean I get that both of them are writers, but do they really need to be that smart all the time when they talk?\n\nLet me stray from negative criticism to say the sequence which reveals the twist of the movie is among the great sequences which Fincher has directed. In this \"montage\" of sorts, the music is on- point, Amy's internal thoughts revealed in voice-over is haunting as hell, and the editing is simply perfect.\n\nThe strongest aspect of this film is the performance Rosamund Pike gives by playing Amy - one of the most maniacal psychopaths I have ever seen on film. I am so glad she got an Oscar nomination for this film since she made me hate Amy so much - it's impressive when actors can get you to feel extremity of any emotion towards their character.\n\nFlaws in her not getting caught? There were cameras all over the house of the Neil Patrick Harris character that he said were recording all the time. I get that Amy fakes getting raped for the camera cleverly by biting the man's tongue and pulling down his pants so it looks like he is cleaning up after that as he exits. And I get that she poses for a camera like she was tormented. But what about the rest of the cameras in the house? Are we to believe they are only covering the perimeter of the house? Also, I forget why they can't get Nick to wear a wire around Amy - she prevents it once by talking in the shower, but is she going to be on guard the rest of her life? Highly unlikely.\n\nThe fact that they make it very hard to determine whether Nick murdered Amy or not before the huge twist in the film is brilliant, making the end of act 1 and most of act 2 very strong, though the film has a weak opening and a flawed - but extremely creepy - ending. The mystery aspect and Pike's performance make this a very strong film, but it could have been improved if some content was cut and the film was more of a character study.",

Such a visionary whose latest film Gone Girl only elevates his position as one of the world\u00e2??s best directors. Gone Girl plays to his overriding strengths and delivers the opening and perhaps unconquerable film of the winter cinematic season.\n \nA mystery/crime film that on its own elevates itself into primarily the category of a psychological thriller. Gone Girl parades the disappearance of Amy Dunne and the catastrophic effects of this on her husband Nick Dunne who is then cast into the limelight as the perpetrator of her vanishing. It is dark and disturbing, and will leave you gasping for respite at the sickening events that unfold, as you will feel inconsolable shock that the plot\u00e2??s turn of events even occurred. Gone Girl has the best plot twist to appear on screen in a while. It takes you to the most sinister, gloomiest places of the anthropological being; and that place is an intriguing area, yet it breeds a sort of malevolence that will leave you questioning the potential of humans\u00e2?\u00a6 It is that agitating! The only other film in recent memory similar to Gone Girl is 2010\u00e2??s Shutter Island as both leave you guessing until the end, and when the end arrives you just will not expect what comes your way.\n \nThe film uses heavily the main protagonists as unreliable narrators as everything seems hollow, deceiving and meticulously planned to be one step ahead of you. You want to come to a judgement about the proceedings but you cannot prove it because in truth you do not know anything. This is because the characters appear dark and unresponsive, hiding their true persona under a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that is so sinister to even comprehend. The film\u00e2??s structure divides the plot into segments of unreliable narration creating an extremely intimate yet deceiving film. It lures you in with lies and you know that, but you cannot figure out what the purpose of Amy Dunne\u00e2??s disappearance really is for.\n \nPermeating through the structure of the film is the Fincher-esque suspense he has come to define in his own cultivated unnerving style. The suspense delivers in bucket-loads through so many different ways. Most intriguingly is the sound, which adds to the tension further that you expect at any moment for things to boil over. The sounds are eerie, heightening in volume and intensity until it mirrors your own palpitating heartbeat and suddenly cuts. Sound is presented as a cycle, intensifying until the chapter boils over giving you an interval for the next disclosure.\n \nThe themes of dishonesty, unreliability, media representation and economy are prevalent during the film thus making it more affecting as it deals with aspects of life that everyone can associate with. The overriding theme of marriage incorporates all the other themes under its name and presents marriage as a corrosive junction where two people intertwine themselves in a spiral of dishonesty and facades.\n \nLondon, Hammersmith-born Rosamund Pike makes up one half of the couple and this film marks a turn in her career as one of the freshest actresses around with a performance that will leave you mesmerised and shocked. She is not afraid to really let herself go in some scenes and therefore her character, Amy Dunne, will be one day on lists for the greatest female characters to appear on screen. Ben Affleck\u00e2??s Nick Dunne makes up the other half, and he is perfect for the role. He has a \u00e2??villainous chin\u00e2?? and a cold face that looks like he is hiding something. His character is universally presented as the person of concealment and doubt as the film\u00e2??s trailer dictates to you who you should watch out for\u00e2?\u00a6 but this could be misleading, as nothing should be trusted. You go on a journey with both the characters that your initial perception of the characters is completely abolished and transformed into sentiments so otherworldly by the conclusion of the story. In essence, Fincher presents Gone Girl as one big magic trick\u00e2?\u00a6 and boy does it amaze!\n \nGone Girl is perhaps the biggest mind-fuck of the decade. The extraordinary Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike leave you distressed and shaken at the disturbing sequence of events that unexpectedly shatters the comfort of your psyche.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        10/10",

Second, the rich bachelor and the young student stereotypes are so worn out that their characters presence is completely unnecessary.

I often wondered how we were at the climax so soon and what will they have more in store for me. You might think that the story is far fetched but it would surprise to say that I know characters (no spoilers ;-)) who would have acted in the same way if only they had the skill.\n\nOn the technical side..\nWhat really  makes the film so good is the amazing mystery story and the pace it unravels at.

Days go by and clues start to point to foul play by Nick, but who really knows? I'm not sure if it was just me, but having not read the book I was clueless as to the fate of Amazing Amy, constantly being pointed in different directions by the film. Blown around like a whirlwind on what could have possibly happened, who could have done it? The film has a slightly extended run time of 145 minutes but for the most part I was so intrigued by what was going to happen - the time flies by, especially after the introduction of the plot has passed and you are stuck in the depths of the mystery.\nThe depiction of the media was great in how it provides a bias opinion while harassing the victims of the situation. It is also really interesting to see how the plot adopts the media into becoming a key player affecting future events of the film. Most of the people in the film do pretty good jobs, even Tyler Perry, but the most outstanding was Rosamund Pike. She's of little fame besides small roles in films such as The World's End (2013), Die Another Day (2004) and Jack Reacher (2012), but Pike has finally been able to show what she can do in her role as Ben Affleck's wife, Amy Elliott Dunne. She really took the part and made it her own, so good in fact that I would nominate her for an Oscar. \nI can't see myself watching film over and over again, however the rare times I will see it again, it will be an excellent two and a half hours in which I will be lost in the mystery. The best word to describe the film is insane. I definitely recommend seeing the film as soon as possible as it is one of the best films of the year so far.

The genius provocateur has helmed such modern classics as Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Oscar nominees The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Add Gone Girl to the list. Adapting Gillian Flynn's smash best-seller, Fincher delivers Generation Y their very own Fatal Attraction, a portrait of a marriage gone horribly, horribly wrong.\n\n It's hard to write an adequate review with the film fresh in theaters as non-readers will want to avoid spoilers. NIck Dunne (Affleck) is married, mundane, and miserable in Missouri with a mistress, a deceased mother, a decaying father, a struggling business and Amy - Amazing Amy. She's a New York yuppie who's childhood was the basis for a series of best-selling children's stories. A minor celebrity and totally Type-A, Amy just can't help but expect more from Nick. But then one day, she goes missing, and he is the prime suspect in her disappearance.\n\n Fincher unfolds the twists and turns like a virtuoso with another haunting, electronica score by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and his collaborator Atticus Ross (Oscar winners for The Social Network score). Jeff Cronenweth's moody cinematography is trademark Fincher as always.\n\n Some may feel Affleck is too likable as Nick compared to the novel which the screenplay by Flynn herself does not depart from. But he delivers a great perf, one of the best of his career. And a star is born in Rosamund Pike. She makes Amy desirable, admirable and terrifying. \n\nDestined for box office sucess, the film is probably too cold-blooded to win the Oscar but it should be nominated in most major categories especially Pike who has to be the frontrunner for Best Actress for now. A competitive, exciting movie season awaits, and Gone Girl is a terrific start.",

The cinematography and editing create an expert sense of tension from beginning to end. Gillian Flynn (whose book I enjoyed tremendously) adapts her source material perfectly for the screen. She doesn't just write intriguing characters (Nick and Amy are gloriously and intelligently dysfunctional), but she also gives them rich dialogue and nifty vocabulary to work with. And finally, there's the cast. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris make for great ensemble members, and Ben Affleck is terrific as Nick. But in terms of casting, Fincher and Flynn hit cinematic gold with Rosamund Pike as Amy. She is calculating, psychotic, funny, clever, and all of those traits come accompanied with Pike's doe-eyed beauty, which proves all the more entertaining. Fans of the book will love what Fincher, Flynn and their cast have done with the movie. And those who haven't read \"Gone Girl\" (as long as no one spoils it) will love it too. It's another A-grade thriller from Fincher. What more could you ask for?",

You hate it because the film has a lot of anger and revenge. The dialogue is smart, no doubt same as for the previous Fincher films. But this film for me has no life at all. The story is 2 hours and a half, which is overlong to me. With some unnecessary scenes that needed to be cut. And it is one of those dark tone psychological dramas that has a great execution, but then it's not an easy watch for everyone. Gone Girl is not recommendable film yet Fincher wants to prove that he is one of the geniuses in film making. Here's a movie about how bloody your marriage can go. 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "No one ever said marriage was easy. But who ever said that probably wasn't married to the couple at the forefront of Gone Girl. That's not just some slogan that everyone throws around at a couple whenever things get tough, but it's also the driving force of the entire film. There are tumultuous times when two people have to want to work hard to make things work, and then there's this couple, a sure fire candidate for the worst cinematic couple of all time.\n\nIt's been a while since I was this consistently surprised, shocked and all around awe struck by a movie, but that's exactly what Gone Girl did. It's really something that needs to be seen to be believed and one should make quick haste to see it since it has one of the best twists I've ever seen. It will be hard to keep it under wraps given how social media is spoiler central.\n\nAdapted from a novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn in 2012, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is a bar owner in St. Louis who is preparing for his fifth wedding anniversary to his wife Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike). It starts off like any other day until Nick comes home to find the front door open, broken glass all over the floor and clear signs of a struggle. He can't seem to find his wife anywhere and Amy is only shown in flashbacks from her journal. But as shocking evidence turns up through a police investigation along with public and media scrutiny, Nick finds himself as the number one suspect for murdering his wife despite his constant pleas of innocence.\n\nReviewing this film is incredibly hard given how many surprises are in it, but a challenge I am more than willing to accomplish. Director David Fincher was already a legend in many people's minds and one of the best in the world at his craft with classics like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network. But here with Gone Girl, it reaches an entirely new level where his stamp clearly presents itself more so than ever. Fincher out does himself with his best film since Fight Club and one of the finest performances in any of his past films. Fincher's strong visual style, complex characters, enthralling plot and a dark satirical edge have always been standard for him. This makes all the more sense that he can adapt novels and short stories so well like Fight Club, The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. He has a great handle for the material divvying up the screen time well amongst the ensemble cast. \n\nFincher doesn't overload the viewer with information or make you feel bogged down by it all during its two and half hour running time. Everything felt liked it mattered where every nuance may reveal something about a character or the story. Even with its two and half hour running time, you want more. It's hard to leave this world that he created. Fincher is known for his brain melting twists, more so than wannabe M. Night Shyamalan, and packs in more twists that Fight Club, Seven, The Game and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo combined. How he managed to pack in so much without it turning into overkill is nothing short of unbelievable. Every twist was expertly managed to perfection where one will have to see it more than once to get that thrilling feeling again. This may be even more depressing than Seven and that's saying something given how bleak that ended. Few directors have it where seeing their films is an important event, but that's exactly what this is. It's something that you will want to tell your friends about months after it's gone.\n\nThe acting was amazing all around with every actor pulling their weight and contributing an impactful moment. Not one character felt left out or like it was on the outer rings waiting for their cue. But of course it's the leads that provide the meaty offerings and succeeding on all fronts. Ben Affleck has grown and matured in an incredibly competent actor over the years with his recent roles in The Town and Argo. But it's here as a married everyman that outshines his performances as a bank robber and CIA agent. Anyone doubting his acting abilities should eat their words if they already haven't already. With every performance, he is showing why he will make a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is more human and affable, able to relate on a more personal level. His natural charm and charisma shines through naturally. But it's his menace and dubious nature that really drive his performance home. He's a two sided coin, flip-flopping between personas showing how versatile Affleck really is. \n\nRosamind Pike on the other hand was nothing short of brilliant in one of the most shocking performances I've seen in years. It's hard to remember when I've seen a performance that dynamic and shocking with Pike quickly showing that she is a force to be reckoned with. Her narration from her diaries was incredibly well done. She has a great voice that expresses so many emotions without even having to see her face. Honestly I haven't seen her more notable performances but was aware of who she was. So I wasn't sure what I was getting with her, with Affleck I kind of knew what I was getting more or less. If she isn't nominated for a trove of awards while winning many of them come awards season, it would be one of the worst crimes in Hollywood. \n\nTogether Affleck and Pike had impeccable chemistry, acting like they really were married with every argument and declaration of love seemingly coming out of any married couple's living room. Alone they seem like generally nice people, but together you see that it's basically mixing chlorine and bleach. It's a joy to watch them go at it and I've never had so much fun peering into the intimate moments of a married couple's relationship on the brink of utter destruction. Whether they're throwing barbed wire laced insults or sharing the first romantic kiss, you don't want to look away and you don't want them to stop. Fincher has a great history of male/female tandems, most famously with The Narrator/Tyler Durden and Marla Singer in Fight Club. But Nick and Amy-Elliot Dunne is quickly becoming a classic movie couple that would terrify Sid and Nancy.\n\nThe cast was incredibly well rounded with various actors. Margo Dunn (Carrie Coon) was Nick's twin sister as well as co-owner of the bar. But quickly became more than that as the confidant to Nick during this harrowing time. Her despair while dealing with stunning revelations were real and touching, while showing she has just as much fight as Nick. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is the lead investigator on the case, showing a wise beyond her years demeanor, taking in every and all clues as they come up while holding all judgments on Nick until more substantial evidence. This runs counterpoint to her partner Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) who wants to arrest Nick outright despite having no real proof. They worked well together as a cop duo with some great work. Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) is Nick's attorney and was surprisingly good, given Perry's inclination for wacky comedies and wearing drag. He was a slick, smooth operator who knows all the tricks of The Game and how to erase doubt of even the guiltiest person. Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris), an ex-boyfriend of Amy's had some good moments too but nothing that meaningful.\n\nSome of my favorite parts were the dissection of the media, public opinion and reasonable doubt. It looks like shooting fish in a barrel but it plays an important part in the continuation of the story and toning down the overt subtitles would undermine what it's trying to say. Far too often loud mouthed, bobble head, cable TV idiot's act like the voice of reason whenever something shocking or horrible happens. They present the most outlandish scenario as truth without saying so while painting a picture of someone they don't even know. Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) and Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward) played the roles of polarizing cable TV show hosts to perfection, making you hate those types like Nancy Grace even more for even spreading that type of filth to idiots who eat it up. The circus atmosphere to hot media targets points to our inert obsession with reality figures and how our perception of them changes in an instant. It also shows that even though Amy's body was nowhere to be found and no evidence to say that he killed her, he is still pointed as the killer, by the public as well as the cops. It hardly matters to others that you're innocent until proven guilty, but just that it makes it easier to pin the blame on somebody.\n\nThe script was crackling with passion, fire and spite, all the things that make up every marriage. With something this emotionally complex, it only makes sense that the author of Gone Girl would write the script. Flynn has a deep love and understanding for the characters while giving them a believable script to take from. It was also surprisingly funny with its dark undertones and content. Fincher always has dark comedy present in his films. Sometimes you can't help but laugh at about things that you shouldn't. The views of a crumbling marriage may ring too true for couples as well as thinking about what Nick and Amy do to each other. Everything was said with such reverence and pop that gave everything a much needed feeling of stark reality. Whether it was the detectives scrounging for clues, the harried couple arguing or TV pundits debating, it was as if it was pulled from real life. Like Nick said when taken in to the police headquarters, \"This feels like an episode of Law And Order.\", then proceeds to do the classic tone.\n\nI love a good score so this was like a feast for my ears. Knowing that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross reteamed for another Fincher film made me so much happier. No one else can create these musical accompaniments like these two. And they continue their streak of Fincher scores with the best yet. It accentuated the drama, grief, excitement, and shocks like nothing else. It was equal parts haunting and beautiful where you wish it would go on for hours. It added so much depth to scenes, emotions and characters that the first kiss between Nick and Amy became so much more romantic and Nick finding out something awful that much for harrowing. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth was gorgeous as always, as it is a David Fincher film. I loved the slow, creeping camera getting closer in a shot. It paints everything like a stationary picture with figures moving in and out, creating a gloomy, creepy like atmosphere.\n\nOne of if not my favorite scene in the movie would have to be the montage halfway through the film. As a lover of montages, I would consider myself a connoisseur of sorts. With saying that, I could say that this was one of the greatest cinematic montages and sequences I have ever seen. Everything about it from the acting, direction, editing, music and cinematography was pure unabashed brilliance in the highest order. It comes out of nowhere and half way through it, I knew I was watching something special and had trouble keeping my jaw open. But everyone will be doing that the entire film. That sequence alone should be enough for Gone Girl to garner multiple awards.\n\nNot much more needs to be said about Gone Girl as it heads the awards season as the first official classic. It may be superfluous, but this is one of the most exciting, unpredictable thrillers I've seen. The ending, as is to be expected, is the most telling part. It comes full circle and ends exactly where it needs to.  There is nothing that can prepare you for the mayhem one will witness and is a ride worth taking more than once. Treated as somewhat of a horror story for those who aren't married, it captivates all those who enter while mercifully beating them into submission, refusing to release anyone from its cold, steely grip. Sometimes it's good to realize when it's really over and be single, now I see Nick and Amy wish they'd have done the same. Five spousal murders out of five.",

Gone Girl is certainly one of his darker films. The themes and plot events are twisted and effective in many ways, as the audience will most likely be uncomfortable with the images on screen. Specifically, scenes involving Rosamund Pike's character's plans and the lengths the character will go to to get what she wants. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, and although I've not read the book, he plays the role well. However, Affleck pales in comparison to Rosamund Pike's Amy Dunne, who is mesmerizing and extremely convincing in playing an insane woman. Tyler Perry surprisingly plays Tanner Bolt admirably, but the weakest link here is Neil Patrick Harris. In short, NPH's scenes are cringe-worthy, and it makes you wish for a more limited role by Harris. Overall, Gone Girl is a intense and dark tale and will affect all audiences with its gruesome plot and extended scenes of brutally real, equally frightening violence, and it's strangely enjoyable. 4.5 out of 5.",

Ben Affleck may be responsible for the disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike).  He arrives home to find the door open, some furniture over-turned, and her gone.  Of course, Affleck becomes the number one suspect (because, really, he is that type of guy).  However, if we are encouraged to consider Affleck's perspective, even in the face of possible domestic violence, are we also asked to blame the victim? Fincher seems to indulge in the same kind of shenanigans that Mamet once toyed with (in Oleanna; and perhaps Hitchcock too), getting us to identify with the probable or stereotypical guilty party. So, is it a misogynistic film, if it explores the victim's deservingness even as it raises awareness about family violence?  There is no easy answer but still I say yes.  Aside from any potential value still remaining for film to tell us how bad the media's three ring circus has become, the film serves only to reinforce some people's negative beliefs about some women   But then again it is only a film and quite gripping for most of its tawdry length.",

            "content": "I saw Gone Girl when I was home for a week last Halloween, a time during which I was watching a combination of old James Bond films and schlocky slashers like Scream (1996) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003) all films which are more cheesy than scary. During my one trip to the cinema that week, Gone Girl was the film which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a real thriller with horrifying scenes making it almost a horror film itself.\n\nI'm not going to spoil details of a plot which works best as a mystery, but the premise is that Midwestern everyman Nick Dunne (Ben Afflek) returns home one day (his fifth wedding anniversary no less) to find his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing media circus then throws Nick into suspicion.\n\nThe film's strength is its manipulation of the viewer. We follow and side with Nick initially; Ben Afflek plays him as fairly neutral, a blank slate. Maybe he's too passive in the face of his wife's disappearance. Is he guilty or does he simply not know how to react? He seems likeable enough, but there's something just behind it.\n\nDuring the first act the couple's relationship is told through flashbacks, incorporating segments of Amy's diary, and we gradually begin to side with her. These dual narrative strands are apparently from the original wildly popular novel by Gillian Flynn, who wrote the screenplay. We must be in safe hands.\n\nDavid Fincher, whose last film was the English-language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, retains something of the Nordic noir to Gone Girl. The film is full of darkness, sex and violence. Camera angles are sweeping and the scenery both bleak and beautiful. At the heart of the film is an exploration of humanity which is divisive and ambiguous.\n\nThough a long film, it is never boring. There was a point around halfway through when some kind of resolution seems to have been reached, but the film keeps going and the pace and intensity increases. Rosamund Pike's role increases as the story progresses and without giving too much away, her performance is powerful.\n\nRole and image are major themes. On some level, everyone is playing a part, deliberately projecting or hiding behind a facade. Amy has been fictionalised by her writer parents in the overblown, saccharine Amazing Amy books which she has never been able to live up to. She has a place in the public eye and this is why the press descends so rapidly on the case. \n\nAs the audience struggles to understand his psyche, Nick is struggling to appease the exploitative media. He hires Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), a lawyer specialising in image and defending suspected husbands. Perry's role is dramatic but played with a much needed balancing touch of humour. Of note too is Neil Patrick Harris's rare straight role as Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi.\n\nThe music, from serene yet ominous ambient soundscapes to throbbing electronica was composed by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and his producer Atticus Ross who have collaborated on Fincher's last two films. In keeping with the theses of this film, they have created a score which is simultaneously soothing and unnerving.\n\nI'll finish by acknowledging that there are some plot holes in the decidedly complicated narrative, particularly paper trails, alibis and the possible existence of exonerating security footage. Again, I won't go into too much detail, but at one point a detective begins to question such a hole but is quickly shot down.\n\nPresumably these details would come to light sometime later during the inevitable long investigation. The case ends far from closed. But the film is more than just the plot, which is nevertheless engaging. As a piece of film making, the themes, music and visuals remain powerful.",

On the other hand Rosamund Pike was dry and boring and she was the main character, I wasn't even concerned about her disappearance, she just didn't shine for me as a character. One flaw was after the plot was revealed it was easy to guess what would happen next. The ending however did catch me off guard. I found it to be unique but definitely not the ending I had hoped for.  \n\nNow, I am not at all saying it was a terrible film because it was great but I just wish they would've spaced it out a bit better, that's all! Overall, if you're a fan of drama and mysteries of give it a go! I did like it, hence my rating was more than half! It definitely kept me on my toes for the whole first half!

For those who read the book, it's easy to see that the film adaptation stays pretty close to the events that unfolded in print. Aside from the obvious strength of 'Girl,' being the plot, the two leads deliver award-worthy performances (Ben Affleck as confused husband Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as his missing wife, Amy). In fact, Pike was nominated for multiple awards, including an Oscar, for her portrayal of the deranged, vindictive woman at the center of a bizarre disappearance and media field day that ensues.\n\nAs we get further into 'Girl,' we get closer to the truth, but further apart at the same time. From a film perspective, some of the best scenes are those that are full of shock and surprise, but there are also some that are more subtle that really show the best parts of the story, where the human emotions that are true - and raw - are on display. Other supporting roles that are notable include Tyler Perry as Nick's defense attorney, Tanner Bolt, and Carrie Coon as Nick's trusting twin sister. Missi Pyle also does a fine job of being an annoying crime talk show host. And then in true Fincher fashion, there are lots of unique shots littered through the film. The soundtrack plays a crucial role in 'Girl,' as it has an underlying presence that makes everything seem that much more intense. Aside from the soundtrack and the acting, there are many different marks of a great piece of cinema, but again, it goes back to having a solid script and screenplay, which 'Girl' certainly does.\n\n'Gone Girl' is a great film, despite the fact that it explores some twisted, dark aspects of relationships, and will leave a lasting impression on cinematic history.",

            "content": "David Fincher has always been slightly left of centre. It's easy to see why he was so drawn to the Alien franchise in the beginning, with its gothic stylings and absolute subversion of sci-fi and horror tropes, and while Alien 3 didn't quite turn out the way anyone particularly hoped, Fincher has consistently chosen films which have found a way to play on our expectations in new and interesting ways. Se7en's finale, Fight Club's central premise, Zodiac's long and twisting narrative that just refuses to resolve itself to our timeframe; all of these and so many more examples point to exactly the kind of filmmaker that David Fincher has proven himself to be, and he revels in the chance to walk that tightrope with audiences.\n\nUp to a certain point in Gone Girl, I was initially confused by Fincher's choice of story here. It presents itself as a by the book thriller, and while it's executed in a downright pristine way with Fincher's work, it made absolutely no sense to me that the director who chose to direct The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would also choose to direct something I'd seen a hundred times before.\n\nAnd then of course he decides to rip the rug out from under everyone's feet.\n\nWhen Amy Elliott Dunne goes missing, her husband Nick is at the front of the search and the investigation, as he tries to find his wife and to keep the law from finding him guilty of her murder.\n\nIt's a twist that's not necessarily unforeseeable, but it's delivered with such relish by Fincher and the performers involved that it's difficult not to imagine them sitting amongst an audience seeing it for the first time just giggling at everyone's reactions. And it's a credit to Fincher's patience that the shock hits home as well as it does, as he calmly sets up the first third of the movie without any sort of hint of what specifically is in store for the viewer. The precision and clinical feel of Fincher's direction up to this point plays to the conventions of the genre in a way that also feels like it's really all the film has to offer. It's a clever way to set up a twist, as it has half the audience writing the film off as a by-the-numbers thriller up until a third of the way through the film. The later two-thirds feel like uncharted territory as a result, and Fincher plays with genre and their conventions in cleverly carefree ways; navigating thriller, horror, drama and comedy with the kind of ease that only a director with his kind of experience and confidence can. Every scene offers up something new and clever, and Fincher's dissection of each scene and the way he finds the layers beneath the film's outer surface brings a popcorn film up to some seriously impressive levels.\n\nThe main two characters of the film are Nick and Amy, and it's both impressive and unusual to see two characters written so well on each side of the story. Usually a villain is left too one-dimensional or a hero is just too bland for the story, but both Nick and Amy are layered, interesting characters, each of them with so much to do throughout the film's runtime. And each of them have their perfect human counterparts in Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck has been steadily building a new reputation for himself with The Town and his all conquering Argo, but both of those were directed by him as well, and it's interesting to see him in a role where he isn't directly involved in the behind the scenes processes of directing or writing on this one. He's fantastic as Nick, and not in the kind of way where you're thanking the stars that it's not another Daredevil, it's the kind of performance that demands a lot of its performer and where that performer is absolutely up to the task. Affleck is so many things in this film, often at once, and he manages to pull off the trick of being a sympathetic asshole; a man who's being slowly backed into a corner and trying desperately to avoid lashing out in case it's misinterpreted as the actions of a lunatic. You can feel the presence of electronic eyes in all of his performance, and the fact that a 24-hour news cycle can contribute to a man's innocence or guilt drives a lot of Affleck's ambiguity when it comes to pinning down just whether he's done the deed or not. The villainous chin so often referenced in the movie actually nails the idea of Affleck's character needing to be both a possible villain and a character you can root for, and Affleck nails it. But as good as his performance is, it's always going to play second fiddle to Rosamund Pike's breakout brilliance as Amy Elliott Dunne. She picked up the film's only Oscar nomination and it's no surprise, as she brings an effortless reality to a role that could so easily fall into caricature, finding humour and likeability in a role that can't have been easy to find any. She has so many different roles to play within this one character and it's fascinating to see the amount of information she can pack into one expression. There's a moment towards the end of the film when she stares down Kim Dickens' Detective which is so simple and so effective that it could be a summation of her character's entire role. But that would be limiting; her performance is so smart and has so much range that it's difficult to nail one defining moment. The supporting players elevate the performance beyond these two phenomenal leads as well, with Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon bringing brains and heart in their performances and Tyler Perry giving what is easily the best performance of his career.\n\nThe book's author Gillian Flynn adapted Gone Girl for the screenplay, and while I haven't read the book it's impressive to see the kind of detail and smarts involved in the script, as well as just how well balanced the entire movie is. It's paced perfectly, and the way it moves from section to section builds to some truly impressive scenes towards the end of the film. There are some fantastic quotes to find here and the recurring themes and quotes that Flynn plays with introduces an entirely new selection of phrases to the national lexicon. But mostly it's the way that these characters are handled and explored throughout the film that makes this screenplay so impressive.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross continue their fantastic collaboration with David Fincher and this score could be their best one yet, as they create a subtly rotting world of cotton candy in their tracks. You can feel the slight shift from normality to not quite there throughout the film and their contribution is a huge reason that the film works on these themes as well as it does.\n\nOccasionally a brilliant director can take popcorn entertainment and turn it into art. Spielberg did it with Jaws in 75 and Fincher has done it again with Gone Girl. It's a brilliant film that creates a new standard for the genre and a cultural phenomenon in the process.",

            "content": "Once disappeared. Now found. Here's my take on GONE GIRL (2014).\n\nThere have been numerous films that deal with the intricate facets of marriage; mostly set on a very positive tone. Sometimes the road leads to the unconventional yet entertaining or veers to the rudimentary yet real. But it truly fascinates me when it gears toward a sicker and more twisted approach that only exceptional directors can fully realize.\n\nOne notable example who's willing to take the driver's seat is Oscar nominee David Fincher. With the bold script from author-turned-screenwriter Gillian Flynn, Fincher takes us on a journey to the darker avenues of the so-called \"married life\".\n\nBen Affleck and Rosamund Pike play husband and wife (Nick and Amy Dunne) trapped in a life of ups and downs. Amid the game of bondage, Nick's life will turn into great degrees upon the disappearance of his better half. Trouble ensues. Deception surfaces. Madness arrives. And it gets darker from there.\n\nThis faithful adaptation of the best-selling novel stems from the team's vision of redefining everyone's thought on \"Marriage\"- IT'S NOT AS FREAKING EASY AS IT SEEMS. The film's never afraid to re-examine the very dynamics of human relationship and spew fires of the ugly truths that come with it.\n\nAffleck has greatly elevated his leading man status while Pike has finally become a household name. They are so effective that their onscreen chemistry can shift from likable to dangerous. The rest of the cast (from Neil Patrick Harris to Tyler Perry to Carrie Coon to Kim Dickens to Missi Pyle etc.) strongly supports from start to finish.\n\nWise decision indeed, Fincher relies on his highly formidable team- haunting music supplied by Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross / sharp editing maneuvered by Kirk Baxter/ and precise cinematography focused by Jeff Cronenweth- the same people who gave life to gems like \"The Social Network\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\".\n\nThis film is not to be missed. Just leave all the expectations at your door and enjoy the bumpy road ahead. Even if it means enduring a chaotic ride.\n\nSkull. Treasure Hunt. Wood. 5/5 folks",

We must bear in mind that Fincher movies are not easy to understand, therefore are not for everyone.\n\nBen Affleck is pretty convincing but nothing special, the real extraordinary fact of this picture is Rosamund Pike, definetly the best performance by an actress of 2014.\n\nThis deserves to be seen, since it makes us see that there are similar cases in real life and also makes us give us has it easy that we judge people who we don't know only by their attitudes to a camera.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but don't wait a happy ending because How many cases were completely resolved and in the right way?",

Gone Girl is a slap in the face to survivors and victims of domestic violence. This film perpetuates the narrative which abusers depend upon to control others through invalidation and gas-lighting. At its core, this film has nothing to say, nor original story it tell. By ignoring the overwhelming statistics of the number of women killed and then disappeared by their abusive spouses, Gone Girl sets the movement to end domestic violence back significantly. Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage. Both the filmmakers and actors are obviously incredibly talented, but this story is trash; boring, substanceless and offensive.",

I feel like the first act was good and the second and third act of the film were ok. Also, I didn't like the ending, I thought I could've been better. I also thought that there was too much nudity and sexual content. I'm fine with an R rated movie and I'm fine with this movie getting an R rating, it deserves it but it felt like there was too much nudity and sexual content that didn't belong in the movie.

I thought that the film presented Amy more sympathetically than the book, and Ben Affleck was Ben Affleck as usual. Amy's parents also didn't fit the picture of what the book painted in my mind's eye, nor did the sleazy couple at the cabin resort or Boney. So, I guess, overall, I was disappointed in the casting, and again, there is a certain subset of the population which would cheer on the Amy in the film, and that is not a good thing.

The tone is stylish to a fault and is entirely subversive. The intricacies and twists are unseen in any film previously and demonstrate the absolute genius of David Fincher. Ben Affleck's character became more and more relatable and enjoyable to watch. But it was Rosamund Pike who truly blew me away with her dark, twisted, sociopathic brilliance. This film is a near masterpiece, and the only thing that nags at me is I wish the ending was more straightforward.  But, perhaps thats' why it was so good.",

The movie sets itself up as a standard whodunit, with the question of whether or not the husband had anything to do with his wife's disappearance driving the narrative. The end of the movie shakes me up. And even though it's sometimes absurd, it's very well made and calculating. Overall, \"Gone girl\" is really intense and it's hard to guess what the ending was because this movie is so dramatic.\n(Perry lin)",

We can trust him now, but we used to not, so were uneasy. Rosamund who performance is fantastic. But the genius comes in the supporting characters. all the supporting characters come from TV comedies. Tyler Perry (Madea), Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother), Missi Pyle (Willy Wonka), Casey Wilson (Happy Endings), Lee Norris (Minkus from Boy Meets World), Kathleen Rose Perkins (Episodes), emily Ratajkowski (Blurred Lines), Patrick Fugit (almost famous)... too many comedy actors to be ignored. The strategy was to bombard the audience with faces they recognized and expected to like. Fincher used the audiences pre-existing relationship to make the audience expect to laugh at these people. The juxtaposition in a thriller with the continued expectation to laugh created an eerie tone. it was brilliant. It was a masterpiece of manipulation. Creating a world we think we know but continues to show us that we don't really. It continues to be slightly off from our expectations. And that off-color makes us uncomfortable.\n\nIm not david Finchers biggest fan, i generally dont like his movies. I thought this was superb. It was Fincher refined. He finally was able to get out of his own way. Still staying true to his own style, his cold and harsh style, but without throwing it in your face. He used his tools as a way to help the story. He didnt get in the way of the story by forcing style on us.",

He plays to his strengths that he honed in Seven and just keeps going.  The soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is awesome, but I'm a huge NIN fan so I am biased.  On a deeper level this story is about how two people should be in a relationship.  With every outwardly happy couple is a darker side, this just exaggerates it but I fell in love with Amy, who by her actions brought out the best/worst of Nick.

Rosamund Pike is the best she has ever been, and was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Amy in this film. Neil Patrick Harris was great, as he continues to impress me with each performance that he turns out. Tyler Perry is someone who has never impressed me with his acting but, has one of the strongest performances in this movie. This movie does a really good job of keeping you guessing and on the edge if your seat because, there are twists and turns all throughout. The film also does a great job playing up to the fact that the news media is responsible for shaping public opinion. Do be warned when watching, toward the end there is a very bloody, and violent scene that may be tough for some viewers. \"Gone Girl\" absolutely belongs in any movie lovers collection.",

            "content": "Review:\nWhat an epic but great movie! The many amazing twists throughout the film were well put together and very entertaining. Right from the\u00c2\u00a0beginning you are led to believe that Affleck killed his missing wife but when the story unfolds, it really does paint a different picture. As there might be people out there that hasn't seen he movie, I really don't want to spoil the plot for you so I will try my utmost to watch what I say. The plot is about a man whose searching for his missing wife, hence the title, but all of the clues lead to her being murdered by him. He then hires a lawyer to prove his innocence and with the help of his sister, the dark truth starts to unfold. When I saw the length of the movie, I was a bit skeptical about what to expect, but I honestly enjoyed this intriguing film which was well written, with some great performances. It shows how the media can paint a totally\u00c2\u00a0different picture than what is really going on behind closed doors and how a woman scorned can make a man's life complete hell. For such a long movie, it could have done with a bit more footage at the end so there could have been an outcome to such a dark situation, but the director chose to leave it open. Before the mystery unfolds, I really didn't know who was the bad guy and who was\u00c2\u00a0innocent so you have to put your detective hat on to piece the clues together, which was why I enjoyed the ride. I can totally understand why the critics didn't have a bad word to say about the film so it has to go down as a great watch. One not to be missed!\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nBen Affleck has redeemed his career with the Oscar winning Argo and this brilliant movie. It didn't win any major awards but it made a healthy profit at the box office and it's pushed Affleck back into the big league. Rosamund Pike also put in a great performance and the chemistry between the two main characters was intense and believable, especially towards the end. Tyler Perry was also a great choice by the director but we didn't really get to see him investigate this\u00c2\u00a0mysterious\u00c2\u00a0crime. The investigating officer, who didn't believe a word that Affleck was saying right from the beginning, fitted in well with the rest of the cast so I haven't got a bad word to say about that aspect of the film. The only person that looked a bit out of place was Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris), who was a weird choice by the director but he played if role quite good. In all I can't say a bad word about the film but I will say that it takes some time to get going.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $61million\nWorldwide Gross: $368million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their\u00c2\u00a0mysterious/thrillers/dramas\u00c2\u00a0about a man whose hunting down his missing wife with the help of a lawyer, sister and the investigating officer. 8/10",

When I heard about her casting I struggled to see her as a good fit for the character but her performance blew me away, to say why would be to reveal a major plot spoiler but she was superb.

It left so much to be desired, it left you right in the edge if your seat wanting to know if she was gonna kill him, stay with him, or is he gonna leave her.

Rosamund Pike had all the look and attitude of Amy. Neil Patrick Harris was just perfect as creepy scrawny rich-boy Desi. \n\nThe story was refreshing and the ending bold. The pacing was, however, maddeningly inconsistent. It plodded to the middle, chugged perfectly through the climax and dragged its feet to the finish. Little else though was wrong with this film with David Fincher doing inspired stylistic work as director. \n\nThe delight in this movie is the mystery, the realism, the self - awareness and the puzzle. The story convincingly takes you many different directions and hides truths within lies. It isn't afraid to deconstruct modern relationships which are too often romanticized in cinema. \n\nIt is bold filmmaking all around. And it is a must watch for all.",

I guess I'm glad he decides to improve upon/tackle the mediocre and pandering rather than re-hash the brilliant novels that every already likes. \n\nI have to admit, I didn't want to see this movie. Like every other David Fincher movie, the previews are thrown at you like the production company bought their add space at Cotsco, and are assembled as hastily (I still remember the ever blood curdling Children's choir rendition of \"Creep\" that you had to sit through every time you saw a preview for The Social Network). I've learned, at least by now, to look at the director's name, and as with this movie, I usually see David Fincher's name and hate myself for having to go see such a predictable movie. \n\nFrom the previews, here's honestly how I thought this movie was going to go: Open with press conference with grumpy female cop and smiling, dapper Ben Affleck while he effortlessly navigates the media and makes himself out to be such an obvious \"deceptively likable\" guy. Cut to flashbacks of his life together with his soon to be deceased wife where Ben Affleck has not-totally-outlandish-but-still-over-the-line interactions with his wife and yet we still encounter probably alternatives to the assumed narrative of \"Ben killed her, and it wasn't an accident\". I figured we would go back and forth between these probably alternatives and the assumed narrative and there might even be a twist at the end up we'd probably end up with \"here's exactly how and why he did it\". She'd still be the victim in the end, although we might all secretly believe that she deserved it a little bit, but still the cop is fighting for \"Justice\" and ends up cuffing him or shooting him in the end. Either in his dying breath or hist last words before being locked away forever - he'd perform some dumb \"cold logic\" speech that's supposed to get us off our moral center by how much sense it kinda actually makes (except it doesn't). \n\nI'm happy to report that this is not how the movie went. They kind of go that way for a little while but they start shaking things up pretty soon. Ben Affleck's performance is everything it needs to be (nobody is really interested in his character anyway). It's Rosamund Pike (wut..) that really steals the the spotlight (I've always wanted to say that) - her performance is like a beautiful fusion of the icy hidden intelligence of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector and the all dead inside delivery of Keanu Reeves' Mr. Anderson (My name...is Neo....). Tyler Perry shows up and doesn't put on a dress or talk about having all of these middle class marital problems, which is really everything that I can ask from Tyler Perry. \n\nAnother thing is the definitely fantastic music, again Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which ultimately is half of the brilliance of my most favorite ass-clenchingly intense murder scene of all time. \n\nSee. this. movie.",

            "content": "[2/15/15] \"Gone Girl\" is crazy! Yeah, I was totally skeptical when I saw the trailer and even once it was out in theaters. But then my sister rented it on Redbox last week and I sat down like \"surprise me...I'll wait,\" thinking that it was just an average thriller. Nope, I was completely wrong about this movie. This is a movie that gets you thinking and once you think you have it all figured out, \"Gone Girl\" gets you thinking again. The real kicker for me is I had returned home from school as my sister was finishing watching the movie, and I saw a certain throat-cutting scene. I didn't see much more because I was hungry, I had to eat dinner bla bla bla. So once my sister was done with it, I viewed the movie, and--despite having seen a bit of spoiler--\"Gone Girl\" still managed to keep my attention. Nothing about this film says 'easy to solve'--and I think a part of that has to do with the acting. Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry (I did NOT know that was him while I was watching), etc. Ben's character is the one that must have been a bit difficult to pull off because you're suspicious of this dude right away and...the truth is far more warped, you won't see it coming at all. Now I know I'm showering this film with love, but why not give it a perfect rating? Look, \"Gone Girl\" is excellent, BUT....let's be real here, if I watch this again, I won't give a shit about it. I watched \"The Sixth Sense\" recently and, yes I've seen it hundreds of times, but I had to be honest. 'Plot twist movies' [specifically] of the drama genre only work when you don't know what's going to happen. And the 2 hour and a half running time works against the film's strengths, but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't recommend it. \"Gone Girl\" deserves its hype, many awards, and all that good stuff [except for any nominations that concern its score, like no, \"Gone Girl\" should not be winning anything for its music. It's a score that fits the movie that it's meant to accompany, but that's it.]",

            "content": "It's gonna be one of the great injustices in life if Rosamund Pike does not win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in this film.  Let's just say that this Amy, Pike's character, I wouldn't necessarily call her a villain.  I think that's much too simple a word to describe this evil, conniving, manipulative, lying, psychopathic witch.  And even those words cannot fully grasp how detestable this character truly is.  She is truly the worst of the worst that humanity has to offer.  A person that would do absolutely anything to ruin a person's life once they set their mind on it.  And boy, let me tell you does Amy sure try her hardest to ruin everyone's life.  Well those that she can ruin at least.  This is a film of two halves, the first half, it seems pretty obvious that Nick had something to do with her disappearance, due to how everything was playing out in the story.  With all the hints and the clues that Amy was leaving.  But the film, smartly, manages to incorporate a current affairs program, very obviously influenced by Nancy Grace's show.  What the incorporation of this fake program does is highlight a real problem in the mainstream media, particularly shows like Nancy Grace's, and that is the fact that, in order to put on an entertaining show, they cast doubt and immediately start to blame the leading suspect even having all of the evidence that is available.  They proclaim Amy to be an angel when she's missing.  This isn't a condemnation of mainstream media coverage looking for ratings instead of the truth, it's also a condemnation of people who watch these shows, eating up the sensationalism because it's more entertaining than the truth.  We tend to do this more than we care to admit, but we always seem to blame someone because a story might be particularly juicier, whether they are guilty or not.  The truth is not as important to some people as it is blaming the person THEY think did it.  This film captures that perfectly, to be honest.  Some great social commentary, honestly.  The second half of the film involves seeing how Amy planned out her own death to frame her own husband and everything she did in order to make her story believable when she did finally make her return home.  It's quite expertly done as the film is incredibly well-written.  I've not read the book yet, but I'm certainly motivated to see what changed from book to big screen.  The cinematography is, as usual in Fincher films, excellent.  It's just beautiful to look at even if you're looking at horrific things happening on screen.  Not horrific as in violent, though there's one really nasty scene, just horrific as to how far some people would go in order to gain back the person they married.  Because that is what, essentially, Amy was trying to do with her plan.  She was trying to get back the man that she \"loved\" and married.  It doesn't matter that he's pretending to be the man she used to love and he's actually miserable, Amy notices all of this, she just wants to get her way.  It's all about her and her needs and wants.  Nobody else matters.  I have no doubt that Amy would kill Nick if she felt the urge to and craft an extravagant story that everyone would buy about how Nick's behavior was increasingly violent and how she feared for her life.  This doesn't happen in the film, or in the book, I'm assuming, but it wouldn't surprise me if she did.  The film is well-paced and you're invested and into the story right from the start, so it never feels like it's almost 150 minutes long.  It's not a flawless film by any means, but its length was never an issue for me.  This is an excellent movie and, by far, one of Affleck's best performances.  I would definitely recommend this film just on Pike's performance alone.  The story is very-well told and will draw you in, but Rosamund Pike simply steals the show.  She is incredible.  Great movie.",

El filme creo que es superior, ya que la trama tiene ciertos elementos que son mejor asimilados y/o disfrutados en el relativo \"poco tiempo\" de 2 horas y 29 minutos del filme versus el tiempo que puedan invertirle a leer la novela que ciertamente le tomar\u00e1 varios d\u00edas poder leerla toda (por esos peque\u00f1as limitaciones humanas de comer y dormir). Y ciertamente ayuda que la autora del libro, Gillian Flynn, es quien tuvo la tarea de montar el guion para la presentaci\u00f3n en la gran pantalla. El director David Fincher (Seven, The Fight Club, The Social Network) nuevamente demuestra que sabe como manejar a la perfecci\u00f3n complejas historias que impactan al expectador. Rosamund Pike demuestra la gran actriz que es con este papel demandante en la cinta, y aunque no se hable mucho del rol de Ben Affleck, creo que este tipo de historias son \"tangos\" en donde se necesitan dos para que funcione, y es que realmente si la parte de Affleck, e incluso la precisa y brillante elecci\u00f3n de este particular actor, creo que la cinta no hubiera funcionado igual. A ellos se les une un elenco entre estrellas conocidas como Neil Patrick Harris y Tyler Perry, as\u00ed como los desconocidos Carrie Coon y Kim Dickens, pero donde todos cumplen a cabalidad sus roles y todos suman a la genialidad de este absorbente filme de suspenso, que si Hitchcock hubiera seguido vivo, no dudo que hubiera hecho igual que con \"Psycho\" y tratar de comprar todas las copias del libro para guardar el \"gran secreto\" lo m\u00e1s oculto posible, pero claro, eran otros tiempos y todav\u00eda era concebible lograr eso. Pero ya sea que hayas le\u00eddo el libro o no, estoy seguro que disfrutar\u00e1n plenamente de esta brillante pel\u00edcula que si tuviera que criticar algo es la falta de una banda sonora m\u00e1s ambiciosa que le aportara una personalidad propia m\u00e1s identificable que a la posteridad la volviera un \"cl\u00e1sico\" de forma m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida, pero aun as\u00ed no dudo que as\u00ed se volver\u00e1 esta cinta.",

But when Gillian Flynn's 2012 mystery novel landed on his desk, he found his next film, and it's a great film, summing up the hardships of marriage. On July 5th 2012, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, and judging by the scene in the living room, there was a violent struggle. There is an immediate media frenzy where the press are quick to pick up on Nick's unusual behaviour, and his every move ends up being watched. His twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) stands up for him, but it puts a strain on them. Plus, it comes out that all was not happy in Nick and Amy's marriage, and it turns out she's left clues around their house and town, which piques the interest of everyone, but there's something Nick or the police don't know... It's great to have Fincher back making films, and he's picked a source material that's ideal in his hands, he gets the best out of Affleck, who seems to be finally finding his feet. It's a film with a lot of twists and surprises. It's a hard film to review too, as there's spoilers galore. Go and see it, you'll get the hype once you do.",

The film is long but never flat. It's slowly building up and you are always interested as a viewer. I really like it, even if the last part is not as good as I was hoping for. I would not say it's especially predictable or typical, but it's not serving you mind-blowing twists and it will never stand out as a original piece of art.\n\nA very decent mystery thriller that's failing a bit when it comes to let us know what it's message really is - it's a bit unclear at this part, but I'm left with a feeling that it really tries. I dig open films where you can decide purposes, but it's not like that.\n\nNon the less a great film that surely is fishing for some Oscars. I hope it get's a couple.\n\n8 out of 10 diary entries.",

David Fincher brings the extra muscle to keep this one out of straight-to-DVD territory. Whether or not the script works or doesn't work is rendered irrelevant by Fincher's deft hand, slick editing, a truly excellent and menacing score from Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, and a pitch perfect cast top to bottom (even Tyler Perry!

Both fall out from there initial phase get bored with their routine life, Nick the Husband searches for new excitement in the form of younger woman and spends on gadget toys.

Along the way a few hiccups changes her plan and what unfolds is quite interesting.\n\nSome woman may find this flick misogynistic and misanthropic or even misandry, but truly the theme is psychopathy, like the director David Fincher's many other movies.\n\nWould this flick get an award, I doubt it, the director played with a misunderstood theme, notwithstanding choose to embed certain micro elements into the scene which is very politically sensitive.\n\nIf you consider acting Rosamund Pike was excellent and pulled the movie along to its enjoyable levels.

It had a foreboding atmosphere that left me in knots by the end of it. The story is totally compelling (and surprising) and Fincher really knows how to build tension. I especially like how his films tend to depict the \"Battle of Wits\" and this is no exception. It feels very similar to Zodiac, Seven and even, The Social Network. \n\nThe performances are all strong here, with Rosamund Pike being especially...polarizing. The film is a bit long but very well paced and genuinely surprised. It's dark, full of important themes like media bias, gender relations, sociopathy, the presumption of innocence and so on. A heavy movie, but a GREAT one.  Some of it is a bit implausible, but damn was it effective.",

There are generally no likable characters (Margo Dunne, the twin sister of Ben Affleck's Nick Dunne, is a notable exception), though the viewer is often misled for a time to like certain characters before their flaws are revealed.\n\nI found it difficult to understand the motivations of Amy Dunne. She seems to be reflecting the questions the movie asks, rather than standing alone as a character. Yet Rosamund Pike does find ways to ground her, in a strong performance. Ben Affleck is also very good as a man who doesn't seem to be reacting quite the way he should to the disappearance of his beloved wife.\n\nThe movie is full of twists and turns, and I think I liked this the most.

Then you will absolutely love David Fincher's latest, \"Gone Girl\". They couldn't have picked a better director. Fincher's gifts make slimy stories watchable. And the slime is up to the ceiling in Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name.\nI can't say enough good things about Gillian's screenplay. The road in \"Gone Girl\" is paved with dirt and lies and more dirt upon that, but the road is so ever curvy and goes up and down so many times, you will never see what's coming. Until it hits you.\nI promise no spoilers, but this movie WILL hit you, no, BLUDGEON you several times and you will beg for more. Maybe there's something wrong with ME, the fact that I loved this movie so much. I questioned what I would do in this situation, and Ben Affleck does a lot of the stupid things I could see myself doing. But I don't want to ruin anything for you, so I won't tell you too much more about the plot.\nI will say that even though this is a very dark film, it is hauntingly beautiful. Jeff Cronenweth, no stranger to working with dark material (\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"Fight Club\", \"One Hour Photo\"), paints a bleak psychological portrait of a failing marriage through a stark canvas that you just can't turn away from. Like a car crash on the side of the road, you won't be able to stop craning your neck for a better view, even as it horrifies you.\nAdded to this is a surreal texture-filled score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. And you thought Trent Reznor could only bring his form of tonal darkness to Nine Inch Nails? His creepy, mind-bending music in \"Gone Girl\" is perfectly suited to this tale of madness.\nAnd at the heart of this madness- Miss Rosamud Pike. Her performance as Ben Affleck's missing wife (partially told through flashbacks) is a revelation. Watching this movie all I could think was \"Bitch be crazy!!!\". And yet, I feel like I've met a few girls like her. (As a man, I have to think that women are bat-sh*t crazy, otherwise WE'RE the crazy ones, and I just can't admit to that.)\nFor all it's greatness, the movie isn't perfect. There is a character development late in the film by Nick Dunne (Affleck) that I had a VERY hard time believing. Again- no spoilers, but I just wanted to slap the guy. So frustrating.\nOther than that the movie was a nail-biter, and the misguided ending is NOT a deal-breaker by any means. This movie deserved a Best Picture nomination...and then some. I hope this movie gets the audience it deserves on Blu-ray and DVD. Highly recommended!",

Then one by one Fincher puts a piece to it and every time a piece of the movie was handed down to you it just blows your mind..It's like he is building a bomb and then later in the film it will explode..The first half of the film are filled with twist and turns, like I said, putting together piece by piece, now that's suspense..every character has a perspective and you do not know what to believe or who to believe in this movie..What I like about the first half of the movie is that you get to see the perspective of the \"victim\" which gives you so much intense..then there is the turning point at the start of the other half of the film which will blow your mind away and just let David Fincher lay it all to you because you are tired of thinking what would happen next..I love the execution of the characters in this movie; Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens..Mark my word on it you will love how all the characters portrayed in this film..Fincher gives us a very intelligent film yet keeping the realism intact to its content..Gone Girl is definitely one of the best films in 2014 and whoever doubt the film, I say this: Watch it and let your MIND savor the pleasure!",

The lead characters (played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are relatively early into their marriage, yet are facing a relationship on the brink due their personal insecurities.  \n\nThe movie illustrates how without a strong sense of self the boundaries of a marriage can unravel to a point where you become someone you hardly recognize but commit to in an effort to physically and emotionally survive.  I would classify this as a haunting psychological thriller with more than one unexpected twist.  What will happen next?\n\nThere are strong acting performances by Affleck as an unlikeable scumbag whose best days seem behind him and by Pike as a complicated wife with a social elite background.  Tyler Perry's performance must also be noted as he is perfectly cast as the fast-talking, high-profile attorney. \n\nThis is one of those movies that stays with you a few days ... and even leaves you looking at your spouse/partner in perhaps not the same way you did before the film.  :-)",

The movie, based on a best selling novel by Gillian Flynn, stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunn and tells an engrossing tale of deception and intrigue based around the sudden disappearance of Amy from the family home in small town Missouri.\n\n In short YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! It's THE best psychological thriller I have seen since something like The Usual Suspects or American Psycho. Affleck and Pike are stellar together and the entire cast surrounding them is equally impressive (yes, even Tyler Perry). This movie is like an onion with layers that keep you on edge and wondering what's going to happen next minute after minute. The movie is over 2 hours and it still had me wondering, \"WHAT'S NEXT?!\" like I said, you have to see this movie! It's skyrocketed to the top of my must see list for this year and it'll probably be something I'll be looking to see again. Gone Girl gets to coveted 5... out of 5.",

On the surface Gone Girl is an effective mystery-thriller, a nightmarish odyssey ferrying viewers through the crucible of disparate character arcs combining to bludgeon the myth of marital stability.  The journey makes for an equally haunting, hypnotic, disturbing, twisted and fascinating ride. Delve into the picture's deeper subtext, however, and you just might be able to see through the ultimately subversive genre trappings to discover a pitch black satire on marriage, its modern conventions, public discourse and humanity--all presented through a type of Sartrean 'No Exit' filter. Indeed, I have to confess a shutter and wince on more than one occasion as the film's grand design grew increasingly more discernible. It's one of Fincher's most effective and affective hatchet jobs. ... \n\nAccordingly, the cast is uniformly fantastic, particularly Rosamund Pike who delivers a performance that will chill viewers for years. Another absolutely stunning score by Reznor and Ross accents the picture impeccably and reminds viewers once more that if a perfect marriage does exist, then Fincher's marriage with these two creative dynamos could present a strong case.  But the real star of Gone Girl is David Fincher himself, for the film illustrates a filmmaker at the peak of his powers imparting his greatest pleasure: the destruction of ideals.",

Het mindere aan deze film vind ik het einde; maar dat kan persoonlijk zijn, zonder al te veel te spoilen. Ook jammer vond ik de heisa rondom deze film.

I wish I hadn't read the book first so I could have been surprised by things. I was more anxious because I knew what was coming already and couldn't stop it. Very well acted though. As far as newcomers go, I liked the actresses who played Margo and Detective Boney. I don't know that I would have cast Rosamund Pike as Amy. I would have chosen someone who looks and sounds more innocent. She was a good actress, but I definitely had trouble picturing her as Amy even while watching it. Ben Affleck was great though. \nI reviewed the book about two years ago over at The Book Chick, if you want to see my thoughts on that and my casting ideas: http://book-chic.blogspot.com/2013/02/review-gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn-by.html",

I'd heard the ending was disappointing, and, to an extent, it was.  Cinematically, Fincher does a flawless job delivering the intensity of the twists and turns \"Gone Girl\" takes.

It's intelligently devised, has strong acting performances, and the dialogue is something to put on a pedestal and fawn over. The biggest drawback unfortunately is that it's biggest strength is also it's worst weakness. The transformation of how we perceive Amy is so shocking, and yet beautifully done both by script and actress Rosamund Pike, that it creates a new story that emerges from the old discarded one it pretends to be. Here's where the drawback comes in, we don't actually get a look into the truth's of real marriage - and learn something about it - but simply delve deeper into insanity and psychopathy. Which isn't to say it's an entirely unwelcomed story to watch unfold - it is done exceptionally well -  but it is unexpected and depending on what you want out of it, can be a gratifying experience or one that is unavaible to deliever on what it seemed to have promised earlier.  Either way, it has to be said it feels like much like a hitchcock film, and that type of delievery on suspense and thriller is hard to come by these days. Well worth the watch.",

            "content": "Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, and adapted for the screen by its author, David Fincher's Gone Girl is one of the most thrilling rides you will go on in a movie theatre this year. Starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunne, two too-cute-for-their-own-good Manhattanite writers living the dream in the Big Apple, or at least until their entire world begins to crumble around them amid the economic collapse at the turn of the 21st century, that is, Fincher's new film is about the sorts of fabrications that we create for and about ourselves, and how flimsy those sorts of subjective fictions can turn out to be, especially when they begin to collide with the opposing planets of those who are the most near and dear to us, signaling a complete and total cosmic collapse of the self. Without giving away too much of the plot, Gone Girl, at its core, is about the charade of marriage, the sanctity of the private life in a world encroached upon by the 24 hour news cycle, and how both of these forces can combine to create a self-imprisoning fiction that proves to be all too easy to begin to believe in, even trust. The film starts out as a simple murder mystery, with Affleck's Nick in the hot seat, suspected of murdering his seemingly perfect wife, case closed, no questions asked. As the film progresses, however, the story becomes more confused and opaque, leaving the viewer reveling in the various lies and deceptions employed on all sides of the case, until the final reveal at the film's end, giving you exactly what you wanted, only this time the portraiture of domestic bliss is all too true, without even a veneer of romantic playacting, the players revealed for who and what they really are.\n\nLike the novel, Flynn's screenplay for Fincher's film employs the deceptive narrative device of the unreliable narrator in order to create the aura of mystery and intrigue that is so central to the novel's character and form, presenting two protagonists who are in a near constant state of re-invention and outright fabrication, each lie disguised as truth, and each truth seemingly a lie. Remarkably, the malleable nature of the novel's plot is adapted impeccably well to the screen, with each lie made all the more terrifying when aided by Fincher's cunning point of view, compelling the viewer to sit back and watch as Fincher's characters lie, contort, and fabricate each and every step of the way in full view, making their deceptions all the more disturbing and cinematically compelling, akin to live theatre in the immediate nature of each character's chameleon-like ability to adapt to each twist and turn of the film's plot. At first glance, Amy is the perfect little Stepford Wife, willing to play the \"Cool Girl\" to Nick's gallivanting brohemian life style, aiming to let her \"dancing monkey\" off the leash, in order to appear to seem less controlling and shrewish. As the film continues to unravel such orchestrations of character, however, Amy trades places with Nick, and begins to create her very own Stepford Husband, belying the inherent misogyny in the very conception of the \"Cool Girl\" aesthetic as it plays out across various male character types, an individually tailored Manic Pixie Dream Girl for every boy. Throughout Fincher's film, Nick and Amy Dunne are constantly out of reach, impalpable to our touch, cold and distant, ephemeral in character, allowing for the reality of the film to become all the more willing to bend on cue into either dark nightmare or domestic pastoral, depending on the needs of the current fiction being entertained by the film's characters.\n\nDepending on their moods, Nick and Amy are in love, or not, rendering their marriage a darkly satirical farce, the players made into world class thespians, adaptable to the vicious nature of the private life within a very public world. The public world in Fincher's film is personified in the 24 hours news cycle, populated by Fox News predators, CNN story spinners, and TV personality lawyers, all eager to devour their very own convenient truths, true or not, so long as it makes for a good story. Thus, Nick and Amy Dunne are outright encouraged by those around them to trade off their roles multiple times over the course of the film's impeccably paced and remarkably punchy 149 minute run time, the abuser and the abused one minute, the mouse and the cat the next. As their roles go under their many stages of metamorphosis over the course of the film's construction of the perfect domestic fable, the world of the film grows colder and harsher, Nick and Amy becoming victims to the very falsehoods they once held up only for themselves now held up to the eye of a public eager to project their own desires into the mix. Instead of playing the Stepford Couple only for themselves, by the end of Fincher's film Nick and Amy Dunne are playing for the entire world, performing a dirge of a marriage that once was, within a prison of the self that no longer feels so familiar.\n\nGillian Flynn has done the near impossible in her adaptation of what was a particularly remarkable novel for the screen, and David Fincher has proven the ideal co-creator in Flynn's prosaic narrative on love and marriage in modern times, delivering a film that is shocking in its dark satire, and disturbingly comforting in its capitulations to the form of marriage as an ideal. With all of the various indictments and irregularities that Fincher's film raises about marriage between two people living on their own subjective planets of selfhood, the universe that surrounds these two planets of self-image proves to be the true menace, encroaching upon the privacy of the soul with wanton abandon and an insatiable appetite to be entertained by our own projected fantasies. What's more, in engaging with the film as a viewer, the act of our own voyeurism must be reckoned with in order to watch the film as entertainment, implicating the viewer in the larger evils of Fincher's cinematic dialogue, making CNN news anchors and Bill O'Reilly's of us all. Possibly the most frightening thing about Gone Girl is its insistence on the need for the types of orchestrated realities that we see on the news everyday, as they serve to placate a sub-conscious desire to be informed, outraged, and complacent to let things run their course, for the sake of the most convenient of truths. We don't really want to upset the convenient idealism inherent in our various constructions of our private and public selves, willing ourselves to be entertained by the drama inherent to our everyday lives, true or not, so long as it's entertaining, and we each get to go home to our very own Stepford Husbands and Wives at the end of the day, a new American Pastoral for everyone, domestic bliss be damned.",

If that tells you anything? - then you can expect that Gone Girl is also a rollercoaster of 'WTF'. And it is.\n\n'Se7en' was a dark and clever crime thriller that did not end happy, but still needs to be seen.\n'Fight Club' was a dark and clever descent into madness that ended...well, the ending is a classic mind f*ck that absolutely needs to be seen :)\n\nwe can now add 'Gone Girl' to that list. :)\n\nDark and clever, intelligent and twisty. A damnable indictment on what goes on behind the curtain of a perfect relationship: of trust, of loyalty, of infidelity, and all the other dirty little malcontents that exist in the darker parts of marriage. And oh man, the ending needs to be seen! But thats not fair to say. The beginning, the middle, the twists... it ALL needs to be seen - and some parts are entirely Jaw-Dropping.\n\n'Gone Girl' doesn't actually 'end', but rather leaves us all wondering 'WTF will happen next!?'  we still are not EXACTLY sure who is to blame for the whole mess! Who is really at fault? Who do we hate? Who do we feel sorry for? Was it bad Wife or discontent Husband? What is the redeeming value here?? lol not gonna spoil it for ya ;)\n\nThe acting is A+ all around - but I have to mention that the musical score really sets the moods - gets under your skin, plays with your mind, and leaves you feeling all sorts of icky ways. \n\nAll said and done, 'Gone Girl' is a superbly effective movie that leaves a chill up your spine, a bad taste in your mouth, and STILL wanting more. I Love it :)",

Essa miss\u00e3o corre-lhe bem durante mais ou menos uma hora, em que \"Gone Girl\" aproveita o ritmo \"toca-e-foge\" dos cr\u00e9ditos iniciais (maravilhas \u00e0 parte na filmografia de Fincher) para montar uma fascinante intriga recorrendo a uma progress\u00e3o que a maioria das pessoas sentir\u00e3o na pulsa\u00e7\u00e3o (o que \u00e9 \u00f3ptimo como experi\u00eancia). Todo o mecanismo do suspense funciona impecavelmente at\u00e9 ao momento em que Fincher - cedo demais - come\u00e7a a tirar coelhos da cartola a torto e a direito. A partir da\u00ed \"Gone Girl\" transforma-se num festival de twists e contra-twists com uma abund\u00e2ncia indesej\u00e1vel de cenas-chave tantas vezes mais reveladoras do que o desej\u00e1vel. Recordemos que a m\u00e1xima efici\u00eancia obtida por \"Seven\", enquanto sufocante thriller de tonalidade noir, passava por retardar o aparecimento do psicopata at\u00e9 ao momento em que o filme se aproxima da esquina que o levar\u00e1 \u00e0 recta final. Por sua vez \"Gone Girl\" consegue o mais dif\u00edcil - capturar-nos no seu feiti\u00e7o suburbano - e cai por terra da maneira mais f\u00e1cil: pretende \u00e0 for\u00e7a que acompanhemos numa dan\u00e7a louca de guinadas e solavancos narrativos, e que nos deixemos convencer pelo exagero e escassa plausibilidade de cenas como aquela em que  a desaparecida Amy \u00e9 aprisionada pelo seu f\u00e3 riquinho (um Neil Patrick Harris que \u00e9 assustador s\u00f3 de olhar para ele). Sobra a ideia de que David Fincher  tinha a mira bem apontada ao que podia ser um dos seus melhores filmes (ao lado \"Seven\" e \"Panic Room\"), mas perdeu-o de vista ao ceder \u00e0 tenta\u00e7\u00e3o muito actual de querer dar muito em muito pouco tempo.  \"Gone Girl\" \u00e9 uma miragem com enorme potencial para provocar congest\u00f5es.",

            "content": "Cinedulcorar\nDavid Fincher se luce con \"Perdida\"\n\nPor Rafael R. Deust\u00faa\n\nA veces yo mismo me canso de especificar que el libreto de una pel\u00edcula es \"simple\" o \"sencillo\", pero \u00faltimamente muchos guiones ameritan \u00e9sa descripci\u00f3n. No es de extra\u00f1ar, cuando uno trabaja con cientos de personas para rodar una pel\u00edcula es mejor algo sencillo pero muy bien hecho, que algo complejo que si sale bien quiz\u00e1 sea mal recibido por las audiencias. David Fincher se luce al presentar una gran pel\u00edcula con una historia muy dif\u00edcil.\n\nEn su quinto aniversario de bodas Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) llama a la polic\u00eda, su esposa Amy (Rosamund Pike) desapareci\u00f3 y el sospecha que algo malo pudo ocurrirle. Sin embargo, conforme la detective Boney (Kim Dickens) avanza en su investigaci\u00f3n, cada pista de la desaparici\u00f3n apunta a que Nick est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s del cr\u00edmen.\n\nFincher establece una narrativa que se alterna entre el presente y el pasado, por un lado nos muestra el desarrollo de la investigaci\u00f3n, por otro c\u00f3mo empez\u00f3 la relaci\u00f3n entre Amy y Nick bas\u00e1ndose en el diario de ella. Eso nos permite obtener una visi\u00f3n con profundidad de los personajes y su relaci\u00f3n, semejante a la de muchos en cuanto a sus lados buenos y malos. Esos vistazos a pasado nos presentan a Amy y cimentan el suspenso por su desaparici\u00f3n.\n\nEn muchas pel\u00edculas, tras el vistazo inicial, el director deja los personajes como est\u00e1n y la trama sigue un camino lineal, no es el caso de \"Perdida\", pues seguimos adentr\u00e1ndonos en Nick y Amy, en su relaci\u00f3n y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de \u00e9sta. El m\u00e9rito de Fincher es que conforme avanzamos los personajes cambian pero no se distorcionan, s\u00f3lo se enriquecen y se convierte la historia en un bizarro juego psicol\u00f3gico.\n\nEl precio que paga Fincher por tan buena pel\u00edcula es un desarrollo muy lento en una cinta de casi tres horas -a veces parece m\u00e1s que eso-, adem\u00e1s de una densidad psicol\u00f3gica excelente para el filme, pero dura de digerir.\n\nBen Affleck trabaja bien, aunque Fincher le ayuda con su direcci\u00f3n, Rosamund Pike se lleva de calle el filme y tenemos un excelente trabajo de los secundarios Dickens, Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Fugit, David Clennon y Lisa Banes, poco conocidos pero con gran calidad.\n\nLa fotograf\u00eda de Jeff Cronenweth y la direcci\u00f3n de arte se combinan muy bien para expresar tensi\u00f3n, suspenso, alegr\u00eda, romanticismo, seg\u00fan amerite el momento y parecen decir: \"\u00bfQui\u00e9n necesita efectos digitales para que una pel\u00edcula luzca bien?\"\n\nPara qui\u00e9n ley\u00f3 la novela de Gillian Flynn en que se basa: el final es distinto. Para todos, \u00e9sta es de las mejores pel\u00edculas ultimamente.",

And it is one of those dark tone psychological dramas that has a great execution, but then it's not an easy watch for everyone.

I've always liked him, but I feel for a Fincher film, in which he could probably cast anyone he wants, there would be quite a few better choices of actor. But, in retrospect, it's kind of PERFECT casting. With all of the media parodying, I feel it had to be intentional that Fincher wanted all of Affleck's past media coverage to be a sort of meta-commentary on the film. There's a few comments in the movie from Affleck's character commentating on the media coverage of his situation that felt like they could have been directly from the actor during the height of \"anti-Affleck\" media coverage that he went through in past years. Affleck gives a great performance on his own merits as well. And Rosamund Pike, wow; she does a phenomenal job with such a great role. That bedroom scene between her and Doogie has got to be one of the best shot and edited (and scored) scenes of the year. Great film.",

Gone Girl has more focus on the suspect of the crime and its reaction of all the criticism he or she gets from relatives, media and people. It's truly something unique and fascinating about it, and I really enjoy watching it. \n\nIt surpassed my expectations and it really is a great movie. I never felt bored at all and I was constantly focused on the movie. One of the main aspects that I really love about Gone Girl is that the structure is nonlinear, it keeps jumping back and forward in time and it gives the movie tempo and depth. It's the same with the story. There's much focus on the perfect relationship and what that means and what disadvantages that results into. When it comes to the actors are they are superb, especially Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne. Her character is so fake but at the same time a champion when it comes to lying. It's her greatest performance to date. Ben Affleck plays a more innocent character and he really fits that role. The first act is amazing. It's so mysterious and it feels much more like a crime movie. But the second act lost all that, which I don't like at all. \n\nThis is a highly exciting and mysterious movie. \n\nGone Girl gets a 7.5/10.",

The extent people are willing to go, in order to present a perfect version of ourselves to the world and to hide our ugly truths. Yes, i'm sure we are all guilty in doing this, Social Networking sites for example; very few of us share the bad things that are going on in our lives, understandably. However, Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel, which the story is closely based on, surely goes one step further and delves into a darker, deeper side to the human need for social approval, love and the degree one may go to have it.\nDavid Fincher does a good job in building admiration for couple Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike), two writers with great chemistry. They seem to have a fun and engaging marriage... until we discover Amy has gone missing all of a sudden and Nick doesn't know where she has gone, nor does he seem too bothered or at least behaves as if so. This is where the supposedly blissful relationship takes a turn for a murderous and soul-destroying showdown.\nWe warm towards Amy through most of the film as she narrates her diary entries, and she conveys herself as the only victim and Nick comes across a little suspicious. Other love interests get thrown in the mix when we discover Nick is having an affair and Amy misleads, and manipulates a secret admirer who she uses in her vengeance plan, and then brutally kills off. It is her intelligently crafted revenge plan and ruthless attitude that shows us how extreme and seriously dangerous she actually is! I sure would NOT want to be messing with her! #CRAZY Lol!\nAs their story is front page news and the talk of the town, more facades and lies are created to deceive family, friends, neighbours, the media and the detectives involved. They both go to great lengths to win the hearts of everyone, playing with each other's minds, faking events and emotions and they both play the game well... Too well that in the end, they live a lie and are forced to suffer by upholding a pretend happy marriage when really, they probably both lock their bedroom doors at night fearing that they may be killed off by the other! FORGET.THAT! So folks, i'm just saying, you think you know someone...you don't...especially if you're rubbing them up the wrong way, don't do it! Lol!\nI really enjoyed watching this film. It was hair-raising and kept me curious from start to finish. Would definitely recommend this one guys! (3 ^^^)\nhttp://youtu.be/esGn-xKFZdU",

            "content": "Gone Girl\nThere was a large amount of buzz surrounding this film, already it has won a plethora of awards with more to come this year.   Is the film worthy of so many nominations? Perhaps, it all depends on what you want from your films I guess.  I guess we have all heard the joke when someone does or say something negative towards their married life \"I'd only get 20 years for murder yet I've got a life sentence with them\"  This movie is pretty much that jest put to film.\nNick and Amy Dunne are due to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.  Nick gets home to find that Amy is gone.  Amy is somewhat of a minor celebrity due to her parents writing a series of books based around her younger life called \"The Amazing Amy\", due to this a lot of news reporters ascend on the small town determine to help find Amy.  Nick is quickly determined to be the main suspect but without a body the police and services can only accuse him and hope he confesses.   A large scale missing persons hunt is arranged, everyone on the lookout for the missing body presumed that Amy has come to her husband's killer hands.  As the investigation goes on more and more is discovered about the so called happy couple, more and more it's apparent Nick is guilty but how will the authorities actually catch him out.\nThe screen writer for Gone Girl is actually the same person who wrote the novel Gillian Flynn so you wouldn't expect too much of a difference between the two, but that's actually not the case.  There are a lot of things that were in the book that was missed in the film adaption wether that was the directors idea David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club) or Gillian just decided they were unnecessary is unknown, either way the film still works for what it is.  The film stars Ben Affleck (Jersey Girl, Good Will Hunting) as Nick Dunne the man/husband accused, who actually does a decent job portraying his character.  Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher, Wrath of the Titans) plays the missing victim Amy Dunne and by far is the standout of the film, she is very convincing in her role.  Neil Patrick Harris (How I met your Mother, Starship Troopers) plays Desi Collings one of Amy's ex partners for his small amount for screen time his performance is quite memorable. Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) plays Margo Dunne Nicks sister and again is very good in her role.  David Fincher is definitely up there as one of my favourite directors directing some of my favourite films over his career and again I can now add this to my list as another job done well.  He has a fantastic eye for details and knows how to get the best out of everyone he works with.\nGone Girl is a film you can only really see once to enjoy it in its entirety.  A second viewing will always be on the cards but there are no more surprises unfortunately so the second viewing is more to pick up their pieces you missed first time around.  I can understand why a few people didn't enjoy the film but I think you need to look at it as a whole picture not just segments.  There a lot of flash backs which keep you wanting and needing more, there is enough here to keep all thrill seekers happy.\nGone Girl again isn't one for the kids due to some very violent and quite disturbing scenes.  It is a great film though and deserves a watch at least once.",

Not a favorite Fincher flick however, it does maintain a feeling of helplessness in a superficial world and Pike's performance is impressive.",

There's no question David Fincher is a great director, and Gone Girl looks slick and contains plenty of suspense.  The performances are also fantastic, with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike at the top of their game, along with some inspired supporting casting choices.  All my issues are with the script, written by Gillian Flynn and based on her book.  What starts as a plausible murder mystery just gets dumber and more unbelievable as time goes on.  After 150 minutes, the ending I witnessed left me with a strong desire to extend my middle finger at the TV.

With the police checking his every move, his demeanour is analysed by all around him as we uncover some home truths about his \"perfect\" marriage and with clues piling against him - from suspicious credit card purchases to extra-marital dalliances - Fincher points the camera at Affleck as his life spirals out of control. \n\nAn impressive Tyler Perry acts as Nick's lawyer as Affleck begins to put some interesting puzzle pieces together in the hope of finding the truth.  Ben Affleck shows that his acting chops in Argo and The Town weren't a recent fluke but the outstanding performance is Rosamund Pike who holds the film together with a multi-faceted and multi-faced performance. Saying too much would spoil the story surprises but as we uncover the truth about everyone's past, the audience are struck with a conundrum between people's public persona versus their very much private performances. A few rug-pulls are obvious from the outset but Fincher is never boring, keeping the narrative strands moving forward but allowing space for characters to develop and expand. \n\nA mystery and thesis in one, Gone Girl uses a simple set up to tackle thorny issues of marriage and relationships and throws in some absurdly murky twists and turns along the journey. \n\nA sinister 7.5/10 \nMidlands Movies Mike",

This is where I'd like to thank Rosamund Pike though for her magnetic performance and how she carried herself as she allowed Amy to \"unspool her brains\" during the remaining two hours.\nThe \"gone girl\" mystery though is just a \"facade\" (pun intended) to a host of meaty themes -- most relevant perhaps of which are the American media (Fox, CNN, et al) with their 24-hour coverage of cases like this; how overrated \"feminism\" is; and how delicate cases can be ruthlessly played at by the media and be swayed merely by misinformed popular opinion.\nNoteworthy performance from Tyler Perry and  Carrie Coon. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and the sound mixing folks are demigods in what they do as confirmed by their outstanding contribution to this movie.\n\nGone Girl is a solid reason why movies are made.",

            "content": "\"Gone Girl\" is brilliant.  David Fincher uses his unique talent of creating films that are disturbing while remaining very entertaining to create a film experience that you will never forget.  He seems to be comfortable working in many different genres, from \"Se7en\" (crime thriller) to \"Fight Club\" (action) to \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" (fantasy) to \"The Social Network\" (drama) and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (mystery).  This time, he has managed to create the \"Basic Instinct\" for the next generation.  I never thought that anybody could surpass Sharon Stone's psychopathic character, but Rosamund Pike may have earned an Oscar with this performance.  She makes your craziest ex-girlfriend look like a walk in the park.  It is difficult to discuss this film without giving away the amazing surprises, so I will be vague.  The majority of the story takes place in flashback, showing the deterioration of a marriage and the suspicions that result when Pike disappears.  The script does a great job of revealing new information at precisely the right time, toying with our brains, luring us into a false sense of security, and then turning our world upside down.  The story is shocking, not because it is scary, but because it is completely unpredictable.  I generally do not like Ben Affleck and this film is no exception.  His acting is far too emotionless to play this character that requires so much empathy from the audience.  Aside from Affleck, all of the acting is great.  Neil Patrick Harris has a small role but plays it memorably, and Tyler Perry shows that he can do a lot more than Madea.  The rest of the cast is generally composed of no-names who play the \"townspeople\" role in a way that makes us feel like one of them, observing and forming our own opinions about Affleck's guilt.  My largest complaint about the film is the overt sexuality that defines Pike's character and makes for an uncomfortable date-night movie.  I may not enjoy watching it, but can concede that it really elevates her character to the next level.  \"Gone Girl\" works because it is an emotionally engaging film.  You will find yourself angry and frustrated with the characters because they are simply so well written and executed.  The ending is the toughest pill to swallow, but that's what makes it so awesome.  I hope to see \"Gone Girl\" on the Oscar ballot, particularly Fincher and Pike whose work deserves to be acknowledged by the entire film community.  Don't miss out on this one!",

Rosamund Pike gives an Oscar worthy performance and after watching this I'm almost not upset that Ben Affleck is going to be batman. NPH was really good in a strange roll for him and for the first time ever I will say something I never thought I would be saying... Tyler Perry was really good. The twists and turns that this film takes are utterly stunning i felt on edge for the entire movie, i just didnt know what was gonna happen next. I also really like the dark comedic undertone of Gone Girl that a lot of people didn't seem to notice, its brilliant, i never felt bored or lost my attention even for 1 second. This movie was utterly robbed at the academy awards it truly made me feel disgusted just as i did for Nightcrawler and Whiplash, i cant understand how these movies were so overlooked by the academy.\n8.75/10 almost perfect, thank you Mr.Fincher.",

I guess my rating reflects the plot of the book too. This is largely personal preference and won't bother most people I suspect. For the most part it's a wonderfully well crafted, acted and directed piece with great pacing as the viewer gradually finds out how deep the lies and betrayals go.

Fincher has outdone himself on this one, creating a masterful adaptation, and an incredible film.",

I have not read the novel by Gillian Flynn, but her screenplay is beautifully crafted, as if she has been doing this for ages.\n\nDavid Fincher has had his cult following pretty much since he started directing. I haven't always been a fan of his movies, but considering the nature of this story, he is exactly on point here.\n\nThe cinematography has that detached, clinical feel that Fincher's films often do. But, it works better here than usual. The film score by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Raznor is more tonalities than music, but it works for its purpose here.\n\nBeside the primary missing spouse storyline, there is a lot of biting satire about the viciousness of TV pundits and how they so enjoy tearing people apart.\n\nThe performances are excellent across the board! Even Tyler Perry is good, for heaven's sake!\n\nBut, at the end of the day, is it enjoyable as entertainment? No, absolutely not! It's more like a psychological ordeal to endure. I admire it for what it is, including the f**ked up ending that fits perfectly with this f**ked up movie! Regardless, it's more about experiencing this movie once, then wanting to get away from it as quickly as possible!\n\n[MAJOR SPOILERS] Wow! Rosamund Pike creates probably the most loathsome, full-on sociopath ever on film! And, the fact that she enlists the help of a stalker like Neil Patrick Harris, who is almost as creepy as she is, is very freaky. The way their \"relationship\" ends, in an incredible geyser of blood, certainly seemed appropriate! [END SPOILERS]",

To much detail that will make you think and if you miss one even Sherlock would think you are bad analizing things and never paid attention to anything (Sorry for using that detective, but came to my head since this movie has something of it...wonder if the one who wrote the book this film was based on got inspired by Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie?). The acting of Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris & Rosamund Pike were brilliant & stunning! Loved them! The music score was creepy as hell and it helped along the way! Superb! So yes, 4 & a half of 5 stars for this wonderful yet psyco film. Must read the book now ;D Enjoy. - December 30, 2014 review. Happy NEW YEAR!",

I'm not sure that is the template, but  \"Gone Girl\" feels to me like  another very well done 21st century re-imagining for 21st century culture and sensibilities. i.e. \"Risky Business\" -> \"The Girl Next Door\", \"The Princess Bride\" -> \"Your Highness\"  This is in no way a rap.  Formula done well can be worth seeing in a theater.  \"Gone Girl\" is worth seeing in a theater.\n\nOne reason to read the book... Did they really get their FBI guys straight out of central casting--arrogant and dismissive of the plucky local cop's salient question or are the just afraid of bucking the evolving TV narrative?",

In typical Fincher fashion, every scene is impeccably acted (a byproduct of his notorious multiple takes) and feels completely necessary, and Trent Reznor (with Atticus Ross) keeps making leaps forward in his brilliant evolution as a film scorer. If everyone had the regular collaborators that Fincher has the pleasure to work with film in and film out, there would probably be a lot less \"Certified POS\" films cluttering up the box office these days. Okay, probably not, but one can still dream.\n\nI am told that it is incredibly faithful to the book, which is not surprising since Flynn herself wrote the screenplay. So the primary things that I would say should lure those unfamiliar with the book would be:\n1.) the desire for a great mystery with a few unexpected twists\n2.) the chance to see Tyler Perry in a role that isn't annoying\n3.) technically dazzling film-making at its finest, which is present in every Fincher film",

This is because Affleck/Pike appear to have ZERO chemistry as actors but, at the one-hour mark, it becomes clear there is a purpose to this disjointed dynamic. As the plot further unfolds, we are treated to the attention-grabbing, star-making turn of Rosamund Pike that, quite frankly, I've been waiting for since her role as a Bond girl in 2002's Die Another Day. Tense, moody, well-directed and ably supported by a strong supporting cast (which greatly helps to overcome Affleck's inherent weaknesses as a leading man), Gone Girl is one of the best films of 2014.

Butt the reality (at least in this film) is not that simple, soo Amy knows that her husband having an affair and get jealous and also i think she's fed up with him for not being a person he used to be before they're married, so she's decided to planning on something to make her husband go to jail for what he did to her, but then because Nick (Ben Affleck) realize what really is going on he play with it (read: media, Amy's game) and successfully make Amy come back home.

            "content": "Not only is Gone Girl as good as you've heard, it's better!\n\nDirected by David Fincher (The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and based on a popular novel by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl is the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who discovers on the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has disappeared. As police begin to investigate her disappearance, it becomes clear that their marriage is not as it seemed and soon after the media descends on his home to cover the salacious story. Seedy details about Nick's personal life emerge and his strange behavior only serves to fuel suspicion. As lies are uncovered and secrets are revealed, inevitably the police, the media and the public arrive at the same conclusion: Nick Dunne murdered his wife.\n\nI loved just about everything about this movie; whether it's the creepy score, it's consistent suspenseful tone or it's scathing critique on marriage and the dangers of \"keeping up of appearances\". At first the film goes where you might expect; you'll laugh at the silly moments of their courtship, you'll fawn over their romance as the story of their relationship is retold leading up to her disappearance. But marriages are not often as they seem and neither is this film; you'll recoil as events unfurl (for the sake of not spoiling this for anyone, I won't say any more than that). Let's just say this film has a few scenes that will shock and stay with you! It was very unpredictable and had a few turns that had me gasping out loud. \n\nThere's also some obvious, but still really interesting commentary on public perception, the power of the media and it's ability to drive narrative (I found this to be a pretty sobering and relevant analogy given current events and how the US media has portrayed them). The film also cleverly plays on gender stereotypes and uses them to effectively drive home it's message. At times this felt like an unconventional horror film (I might even say it's a modern day take on Psycho), but it also has some elements of Fatal Attraction.\n\nWhile I thought Ben Affleck's performance was nothing to really get excited about (he does have a few strong scenes), what really stands out here is Rosamund Pike (Barney's Version, An Education). Her performance as Amy is simply incredible! As the snobby film critics would say, this is a \"Tour De Force\" kind of performance. She really takes over this film and delivers work that you can't help but get immersed in. If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination, it will be a travesty because this was an unforgettable performance and I can't think of a better performance I've seen this year to date. Yes, it's THAT good. \n\nThe last 15 minutes may leave you a little puzzled (characters make decisions I can only describe as incredibly strange), lead to a few questions and will spark debate. I'm usually never a fan of \"I need to spend an hour on the IMDb Message Boards so I can full understand this\" kind of ending, but it does seem somewhat appropriate given the tone of this film. This is also definitely the kind of film that requires multiple viewings to grasp all of it's themes and I will certainly oblige as I found this completely engrossing.\n\nThoroughly entertaining from start to finish, this really is a brilliant film and easily one of the best of the year. Do yourself a favor and find a way see this, you won't regret it.",

        {
            "content": "As usual, I experienced a little bit of detachment when watching this since I read the book pretty recently; nothing was really surprising since I knew where it was all going. But I still definitely experienced great tension while watching it, and it was still fascinating, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it four stars - especially since I know I'd definitely be floored if I watched it without having read the book first.\n\nOddly, the things I liked about the book were often missing from the movie, and the things I liked about the movie were absent from the book. Let me go through each of them.\n\nOne of the things inherently missing from the movie is the full psychological depths that the novel travels to. The book is undeniably more complex, with so many other factors missing from the movie - like Nick's complete resentment of his wife, and Amy's resentment of her parents. In the first half of the movie, Nick comes across as a dumb but misunderstood guy; there isn't as much of a cause for fear, because he never shows himself to really hate her much in the movie. (Well, he does, but it doesn't completely explore why.) As a result, the movie version of Nick isn't as frightening, at least for me. Part of the reason I liked the book so much was Nick's unreliable narrator in the first half, and that's reduced in the film. Then again, the plot twist in the book understandably let you down if you were hoping the unreliable narrating would reveal Nick as the evil one, so I didn't feel that same disappointment in the movie. Still, generally, you get to know the characters a lot more in the book, and there's more complexity.\n\nBut part of what I liked about the movie was that there wasn't as much complexity, oddly enough. Though I generally liked the ending of the book, I was a little let down by the lack of explosive finish, even if it was appropriately haunting and dark anyway. But the movie somehow makes that darkness more powerful and satisfying, for reasons I don't quite understand. Maybe it is partly just that I've had time to digest the ending more, and appreciated it more the second time around. But in the book, while I understood the basic reason behind Nick's resignation, it still felt a little too soon. The movie made me really buy it, somehow, probably because of the added scene at the end (the \"I'm the cunt you married\" scene). That's a great scene, and it's not in the book, and it underlines the themes of the story in a way that might be a little reductive but also makes the story more palatable and satisfying.\n\nA lot of people will prefer Amy from the book, and I felt the same way throughout the first half - I was craving to see a bubbly, dorky Amy that would do a complete 180 halfway through, but in the movie, Amy is shown as a bit cold and calculated even throughout her diary entries (the 'cool girl' speech, as a result, is a little lackluster compared to in the book, in which her diary entries really embodied that stereotype). Still, once that halfway point did hit, I started to love Rosamund Pike, and she was wonderful for the rest of the movie, flitting between the evil vengeful genius, the feminist antihero, and the simply batshit insane woman. That scene with her killing Desi was just a thing of beauty, though that has a lot to do with the direction and a LOT to do with the score. The score was so wonderful and haunting throughout, and it really kicked into gear during that scene; it also improves the ending, underscoring how dark it is.\n\nPretty much all the casting was great aside from Pike, too. Ben Affleck naturally appears a bit smug, so he was a natural fit for the role, and I actually really liked Carrie Coon as the crass, funny, and caring Margo. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry were both unexpected picks that worked really well. Desi was less creepy in the movie, with only subtle hints of possessiveness, but that was fine. Cutting the scenes with his mother made sense, as did a lot of the scenes with Nick's parents. In general, as with most adaptations, the plot was compressed into fewer scenes, but that makes it a little tenser (one of the reasons The Silence of the Lambs probably works for people better as a film), and there's no real reason to keep a lot of the scenes from the novel since the movie doesn't have the advantage of hearing the characters' thoughts.\n\nActually, one of the most impressive parts of the movie is how well it's able to attain a level of complexity and character development without hearing almost any narration (aside from the opening/closing lines with Nick and Amy's diary monologues). I expected more voiceover from Ben Affleck, to make him more menacing or even just to explain exposition, but the movie accomplished that nicely through dialogue and subtle facial expressions. From reading the book, it seemed like there were so many disparate threads that would be difficult to explain and follow up on in the film, but they juggled the various obstacles nicely (dealing with Andie, getting a lawyer, maintaining relationships, explaining the financial issues, etc.). The movie might not go as deep as the novel does, but it still retains an admirable level of complexity while being more focused and more satisfying.",

            "content": "I'm gonna start this review off by saying that David Fincher is tied with Christopher Nolan for first place as my all-time favorite director, so I'm more than a tad bit biased.  That being said, \"Gone Girl\" is easily one of his best titles to date.  Fincher once again proves that he is a master of his craft when it comes to dark and moody, and \"Gone Girl\" fits right in there with \"Se7en\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\".  I'm not a huge reader, but when Gillian Flynn's novel began to receive such acclaim, I finally gave in and picked up a copy.  Then I found out Fincher would be adapting it as his next movie.  This put me in a tight spot, forcing me to choose between reading the book beforehand and spoiling the twists and turns, or waiting to see my idol's next masterpiece.  I decided to wait for the movie, and I realize some (if not most) of you are probably thinking I should've read the book first, but I am a movie freak above all, and I wanted to be blown away by this movie.  I was not disappointed.  I have seen the movie many times now and I have also read the book, and I loved them both equally.  As with \"Dragon Tattoo\", Fincher has made some adjustments to the novel, but seeing as how Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay, I think it's safe to say that she approved of the minor changes they both felt it necessary to make.  This movie is absolutely phenomenal in every aspect.  The story, the performances, the cinematography, the score,...EVERYTHING!!  I could go on and on about how much I loved this movie.  Definitely a top contender for Best Movie for 2014.  It remains to be seen if the AMPAS feels the same way, but I think it's odds are pretty damn good.  Stop reading reviews and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!  NOW!!!",

Seven and Zodiac both make it on my personal top ten and while I've had some issues with some of his movies (Panic Room and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo come to mind as well as Alien3, a movie I still desperately want to like) i can safely say i've enjoyed every Fincher movie i watched. This one... might be one of the best. I still don't get the same kicks i get out of Zodiac and it still isn't the cinematography and sound masterpiece that Seven is but... god damn, Gone Girl is fantastic. From start to finish, through every performance (yes, even Madea's) this is a weird, wonderful, bone chilling foray into marriage and madness. Starring a top-game Affleck a bedazzling Rosamund pike and a coterie of expertly crafted supporting characters Gone Girl delivers an impeccably paced story that does not feel its length at all and leaves you wanting more and more. There's little to say that isn't classic Fincher praise: long, dwelling but flawlessly paced shots, great use of sound and silence, some shots that will stick with you for years and a full cinematic experience that doesn't feel jagged, from frame to story arc. Most surprising of all, past the twists and turns and violent fortune reversals is the spirit of the movie: the greatest murderer, the greatest villain in this movie... is marriage.\n\nWatch it.

            "content": "David Fincher is a master director-since Aliens 3, all his movies have been critically appreciated. He pays attention to the smallest of things, and his movies have this very distinct visual style, through which you know it is directed by Fincher, and his attention to visual detail certainly helps in building up the mood of the movie. Almost all of Fincher's movies are dark, and that is very clearly shown by his visual style.\n Gone Girl is adapted from Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, and has a well put cast. The story at its centre is a mystery involving a missing wife-Amy[Pike], a husband whom you can't help but not suspect, and a town where all the news media are making the disappearance of Amy almost like some new reality show, where everyone involved has to keep appearances. What works here is the tension Nick faces due to how his reactions are to news channels, and the fact that he does have somethings about his past that lead an arrow of suspicion towards him. The fact that he religiously hates his wife only makes his case worse.\n While Affleck plays the part of a husband who is a good guy but an asshole really well, Pike may just receive an Oscar nod for her performance. Tyler Perry as Nick's lawyer is something else-it may not be a groundbreaking performance, but nobody expected it to be that good of a performance as well. While some feel that Neil Patrick Harris was miscast as Desi-Amy's stalker ex, I really did not mind his presence. Carrie Coon also gives a great performance as Nick's twin Margo, trying to help Nick and sharing the hatred for his wife. However, she is probably the more rational one among the two, and helps Nick to come out of all the media ruckus he has created himself.\n This movie is at the end a mystery-there is nothing groundbreaking or relatively new about it. But the way the news angle is shown in the movie is really well done-and at the end of the day, it is a Fincher movie, and it is the direction that stands out. The movie sure as hell is a bit longer than required-about 15 minutes towards the end could have been left on the editing floor. But that is just one gripe in an otherwise really well done movie-Gone Girl is a treat for Fincher fans and for those who just love mysteries with good attention to detail.",

All these questions and many more are answered by David Fincher in this beautifully narrated thriller. Do you know that your marriage can make or break you? But you are still going to take your chances, isn't it?\n\nDavid Fincher paints a decent picture of a marriage gone wrong but with his own unique style. He does it with a thriller. We all know that females are psychologically control freaks at home. But the extent is unpredictable. It grows from none to some and later some to boom. It is an intrinsic character of a female to practice such an art for a prolonged period of time. Some keep it just enough to lead a peaceful life but some exaggerates to spice up the things. In our thriller, Amy (Rosamund Pike) does exactly the same thing. Personally, I had experienced such a girl in my life but my pre-judgment helped me to never get involved with that girl. And I fear the very institution of marriage because of the said reason. I know marriage is a heavenly thing for most of us and it is about finding a soul mate. But this beautiful and real world is mostly about compromises and passion. The balance between both is mandatory.\n\nGone Girl explores a situation when it becomes difficult to decide whether you are trapped in a relationship or cruising ahead. I hope that the content of the movie is inspired by some careful study of the most lovable couple. Even the most lovable couple have domestic fights or difference of opinion. But not every time it leads to a situation where a Gone Girl can be conceived. And I still hope that marriage works when both participants excite each other.\n\nThe movie ends with a note that when you are completely trapped in a relationship, you are left with no choice but to enjoy the bumpy ride. I hope that's not your story.",

The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror.\n\nAs if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature. \n\nProfiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as Pride & Prejudice\", Wrath of the Titans\" or Jack Reacher\"). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood\") to be written down. \n\nVisually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, Gone Girl\" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty.\n\nThe themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis.",

Starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Film's premier was held at New York Film Festival. \n\nAs of 22nd December 2014, film has earned total domestic of $165,287,903 (US$349.3) on budget of US$61 million. Gone Girl was nominated for Best Director, and Best Actress for Golden Globe awards.\n\nSynopsis: Ben Affleck is gradually held responsible for kidnapping and murder of his wife (Rosamund - a renowned writer in the town) - as the film is narrated, we come to know that Rosamund, had in fact fabricated all lies to indict her husband. \n\nDavid Fincher's signature style of mystery and crime drama unfolds twisting nature of the story. Gone Girl plays with sensationalising music-score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Jeff Cronenweth's photography elevates the coldness of film's mysteriously sinister plot. \n\n(Spoiler-Alert)\n\nFilm's shocking ending has left some audience to question the morale-lesson from it. In some way, this ending becomes questionable -- for which the author of the novel \"Gillian Flynn\" says in her interview...\"Well, what did you want to have happen?\" And it's like, \"I wanted justice!\" I promise you, I just don't think you'd find it satisfying for Amy to end up in a prison cell just sitting in a little box.\"",

But the couple here: Nick, played by Ben Affleck and Amy, played by the former bond girl, Rosamund Pike, have all but separated; instilling hostile feeling towards one another. The movie shows us the ramifications of the failure of marriage and not being able to comprehend the personality of your partner. There is a sense of foreboding and mystery throughout and an editing rhythm that compels the viewer to hold in their pee till the very last moments of the almost 2 and a half hour film.\n\nFor an extensive review: http://anaesthetician.com/gonegirl.html",

I was on the edge of my seat for the whole duration because I simply could not wait to know how things would go down. As I was watching it, I realized simply how good David Fincher is. When the police enter Nick's house for the first time there is a scene where they start discussing particulars and it was stunning to see how Fincher managed to create tension in that situation with just a few details. By the way, performances across the board are great. Even Tyler Perry is great! I have been a big critic of Ben Afleck as an actor in the past, but here he gives what might be the best performance of his career, he plays the part perfectly and the point that proves it is the fact that you don't notice it. What can I say of Rosamund Pike's performance that hasn't been said before? She totally transforms and the by the end of the movie I was creep-ed and terrified by just her face, great work! Fincher is one of my favourite directors, I love every one of his movies and even like Alien3. But, with the exception of Zodiac, which is his favourite of mine, I have never jumped up and down for his movies, I really love them but they just don't make it up to a 9 for me. I can't put my finger on why, but I'll just say that they don't make me leave the theater shaking.\n\nI still love this movie as much as all of his others, it is a clear fit in his filmography and I recommend for everyone to see it and have a blast at watching perfect filmaking.",

            "content": "A bit over the top but Fincher handles it like a boss!\n\nGone Girl is one wild ride. The ending itself was kind of absurd and hard to digest at first. But then I realized that I had forgotten what an experience it was. Its portrayal of the extent to which some people go to make sure it is they who are always right is horrifying. David Fincher has be among my top favorite directors ever since I first saw The Social Network. Have seen Se7en and Fight Club apart from that, all three outstanding films. Gone girl is another feather in his cap.\n\nOn their fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing from his home. There isn't much to see at the first look of the crime scene except a glass table broken. Nick is asked questions about Amy and her life. It seems like he doesn't know her that much well despite 5 years of marriage. We then move back in time and hear Amy narrating the story with a diary of how she and Nick met and got close. Amy's parents are writers and creators of a famous character called 'Amazing Amy'. 'Amazing Amy' is based on their daughters real life thus making their daughter Amy herself very popular. Now the missing of Amy becomes a very hot topic and suspicions begin to arise about Nick too, who seems quite absent and casual. This is not even 10% of what actually happened and there is a big twist at the half point. Telling about it will spoil your first view.\n\nThe atmosphere created by the movie has a dark tone thanks to haunting score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor who definitely will get another Oscar nomination. The film is also visually splendid especially in the first part in New York where Nick and Amy first meet. I have not read the book but Gillian Flynn's story feels a bit unrealistic at times but the way it is told by the atmosphere created and direction of Fincher you are pulled deep into the movie. There is also a tone of dark-comedy to it at times making it refreshing. The best thing though is the acting. I haven't seen much of Ben Affleck, his first for me and he was very good. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry have a smaller role, both did a fine job. Its Rosamund Pike though who gives a fantastic performance as Amy which might give a Oscar win as well. You must see the movie to understand me though. Its difficult to review it without spoiling anything.\n\nDespite its positives Gone Girl still has flaws and maybe even plot holes. Some things make you ask how, which will make you think a lot. At the end it would good to have our own interpretation. David Fincher is yet to disappoint. This.This one is may not be his best but definitely among the top movies of the year.\n\nRATING: [4/5]",

I never read the book, and somehow managed to stay away from spoilers, and that made this all the better to watch.  If you know nothing about this movie, then that is awesome!  Just know this is one of the best movies of the year and has 2 amazing performances.  Ben Afflect is phenomenal, and anyone who thinks he isn't a good actor is crazy!!  Rosamund Pike is riveting, and probably the best female performance of the year.  She will get an Oscar nod for sure, and will hopefully win.  I don't want to get into the actual movie, because I don't want to ruin this for anyone who has no clue like I did.  Just know, this is a great drama/thriller, and one of David Fincher's best.  He is one of my top 5 favorite directors, and I will watch anything he makes.  This just reaffirms that notion.  Great movie, check it out, and watch with your spouse and just be thankful you don't have this relationship;-)",

        {
            "content": "David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's suburban crime thriller is a suspenseful piece of work.  Amy Dunne disappears not entirely without a trace, and her husband, Nick, becomes the prime suspect.  The atmosphere gets more and more stifling as the days tick by, and the culture of media vultures is cleverly satirized with casserole-toting trophy wives clamoring for selfies with the handsome though seemingly brutish potential wife-killer.  The costume/props departments don't skimp on \"oh my god\" moments either (like Desi's mid-coital demise and Amy's Carrie-like visage afterwards), and the bookend shots of the back of Amy's head present a creepy, cryptic visual riddle.\n\nThat's where my accolades stop though because by the end of the movie, I couldn't make heads or tails of it (or the book it's based on, which I haven't read but hear is remarkably similar).  With the incredible (both extraordinary and unbelievable) power imbalance at the end, I didn't know what to take away besides confusion over the zeitgeist appeal of such a misogynistic story.  We have a pretty basic portrayal of a sadistic femme fatale - the crazy woman who will ruin a man's life.  As such, I find the message of the movie irresponsible at best and reprehensible at worst.  \n\nFans of book and film would counter that the story is a feminist satire on marriage with a brilliant, psychopathic genius who comes out on top.  To the \"brilliant, psychopathic genius\" part, I have to say from a narrative standpoint that Amy is not that brilliant, and it's the filmmakers' machinations that make her seem otherwise.  If she WERE such a genius, she wouldn't have brought ALL the money she had in the world in a loosely clipped fanny pack to mini golfing where shady neighbors could see and covet.  If the movie weren't pulling the strings, Amy's headshot would have been flashed all over the evening news, and trashy neighbor would have seen through the insultingly easy Clark-Kent-glasses-disguise, perhaps leading Amy to get the hell out before she stupidly answered the door when aforementioned covetous and violent neighbors came a-calling.  But of course, all that needed to happen in order for Desi's romantic hostage plot to occur.  \n\nThe movie also deliberately makes everyone else dumber.  Nick should have notified Boney when he found that the scavenger hunt led to the yardbarn of goodies.  He was already going to come forward with the affair, so he had nothing to lose on that front.  Also, the products were clearly mint, and the clue cards and Punch and Judy puppets with the missing blackjack are too cooked to have been Nick's plan all along.  And it's rather farfetched that Margo didn't realize Amy had been stashing stuff in her shed for years.  After Amy's bloody homecoming, Nick should have bugged the house before she returned from the police station because even that little pre-shower exchange of her being suspicious of a bug is incriminating enough.  He has proven to be pretty savvy with his television interview, and Tanner Bolt, the lawyer who's well-versed in subterfuge, could have at least thought of that too.  The third-act must-happens just require too much suspension of disbelief.\n\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, I disagree that the story is a feminist satire on marriage and relationships.  Amy claims that men want the \"Cool Girl\" - a common societal problem, sure - so she put on the \"Cool Girl\" costume in order to reel Nick in.  The problem is there really is no \"Cool Girl\" in the movie, at least in the romantic options.  Amy is urbane and posh, not down-to-earth or low maintenance.  Neither is bubbly and capricious other-woman Andie.  The only arguable Cool Girl (sans demanding physical requirements) is sister Margo, whom Nick has (seemingly) no choice but to reject, proving Amy's satirical point moot.  \n\nAmy's misanthropic speech on how marriage is two people eventually killing each other with vitriol and manipulations is also too much too late.  It's dark and hip to inject nihilistic philosophy into the movie, but it's also too easy and not entirely true.  There is no real refutation that holds a mirror up to society to show us our faults, nor is their a nod or wink to the intended satire, which makes all this a base revenge fantasy. The most effective satires aren't revenge fantasies.  Even in movies with devilish female characters, they eventually reveal their true solutions to societal problems by the end (like Evelyn does in \"The Shape of Things\"), or they eventually recognize the absurdity of events leading up to this Mexican stand-off (like in \"Closer\" or \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\").  The solution in \"Gone Girl\" is to beat one's spouse into submission through murder and mayhem.  If the movie is actually winking at us and saying, \"No, that's just an extreme; we don't actually want you to do that,\" then Amy shouldn't \"win\" in the end.  Both Nick and Amy should end up dazed and confused at the prospect of having to spend the rest of their miserable lives together just to save each other's hides.  Hatred layered on top of hatred is a simplistic plot device.  Hatred layered on top of love?  Now THAT'S marriage.\n\nIn \"If U Seek Amy: the Grim Grossness of David Fincher's 'Gone Girl,'\" writer Wesley Morris claims that Amy's \"greatest power is to cry wolf,\" and since I've enumerated the ways in which she's NOT a diabolical genius, I have to agree.  Amy is a dangerous character to champion in this day and age of rape apologists and friendzoned men who think many more women cry wolf and put men in the friendzone than are \"legitimately raped\" or truly just friends.  Amy displays a history of sexually deviant behavior that started long before Nick.  Some may claim that she has always been put into a box, what with her mother's Amazing Amy book series, but \"mommy issues\" seem like an easy scapegoat for such an extreme pattern of sociopathic self-abuse and emotional manipulation - harming herself to pin rape on that one guy and continually putting Desi on the hook, expecting him to save her when she needs it but then disposing of him when the plan fails.\n\nAmy's lies and machinations eventually lead to the undermining of the only two female characters who have any substance at all:  Margo and Boney.  All the other women are either annoying or flat:  the thief is a duplicitous vagrant; the neighbor is meddling and dumb; the casserole woman is obsessed with fame; the bouncy co-ed is needy and totally not cool.  Margo, the one person who has any kind of emotional intelligence, begs tearfully for Nick's reconsideration, but he won't/can't. He essentially breaks up with his own sister, leaving her heartbroken. Boney, who up to this point has been a one-note lady-cop, knows something is fishy with Amy's story, but she is cut off by an older male detective who probably knows enough from sensitivity training classes to say the right thing to a rape victim, \"Don't blame yourself,\" but he's actually the one being hoodwinked!  Amy's undetected deception may reaffirm rape apologist's preconceived notions of the friendzoning, heartless woman, \"Oh women can be abusers too!\"  When media focuses on female perpetrators of domestic abuse, the public then latches onto it and thinks the ratio of female to male perpetrators is equal when it's not.\n\nAnother insidious affirmation is Amy's reclamation of cunt: \"The only time you ever liked yourself was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like.\"  Like with the controversial piece in \"The Vagina Monologues,\" Amy's hella empowered in that moment, but she's still fetishizing the word (making it simultaneously dirty and sexy), which might make some viewers (of any gender) think it's okay to call others (of any gender) that word because it's not so insulting anymore if a woman identifies herself as such.\n\nIn the end, the one woman we are left to admire is a brilliant psychopath (arguably), the witchy woman, the ice cold manipulative harpy, and that's a weak support for feminism. She's the femme fatale, and that's still a type - one that there are plenty enough of, from \"Fatal Attraction\" to \"Basic Instinct\" to \"The Last Seduction.\" Woman has been painted as temptress of Man since the original Eve. The movie upholds the stereotype of the evil woman who will ruin a man's life. That's not to mean all female characters should subscribe to the tenets of the Eternal Feminine. That'd just be the virgin/whore dichotomy all over again. We can have a strong and complex female character with flaws, but Amy is larger than life. If she has flaws, they don't figure into the plot because she lives outside the morals of the \"normal world.\" She wins, but does she really? Is this really a win for feminism?\n\nTodd VanDerWerff in his article, \"Gone Girl is the Most Feminist Mainstream Film in Years,\" claims that Amy is a \"Frankenstein's Monster,\" cobbled out of all the oppressive societal expectations for women, and that the film is feminist because by the end, she relegates Nick to the very type of supportive wife character that women are called on to play in scads of male-centric stories.  (Sidebar: Is this a female-centric movie after all?  Only Ben Affleck appears on the poster, and he's the one most sympathetically portrayed throughout the film.  Any character who is kind to an animal pretty much gets an automatic pass.)  However, I'm afraid that assessment gives exactly the wrong impression of feminism that most feminists seem to argue for. Many males and females alike already think feminism is about hating men and overpowering them. If feminism is really equalism, then my aforementioned ending of them both being stuck and unhappy would be a fairer representation of what happens after the facades fall. The power imbalance clearly tips toward Amy, so if the film IS feminist, it's a very radical, unequal feminism.\n\nThis echoes the privilege issue of why many activists say Men's Rights can't exist or White Pride or Straight Pride can't exist. The systems in power can't \"rise up\" any higher than they are; they are the ones oppressing minorities, whether or not they know it. They are recognized as the default...even though minorities strive to rid that rhetoric of \"default\" or \"normal.\" But then where does the cycle of victimhood stop? Is it fair to cheer for this woman beating a man because women currently have less power than men? Is that justice or revenge? If we cheer more for a woman's victory over a man, aren't we still underselling women by thinking it's so impressive and out of the ordinary to beat a man? The double standard still exists, like with any multitude of sins that one gender can commit but is frowned upon if another gender does (in the vacuum of a two-gender world, of course).  \n\nAll in all, \"Gone Girl\" is taut and suspenseful with some sick twists and turns, but it's not particularly smart in its characterization or plotting, nor is it vanguard when viewed through critical lenses.  It lacks the emotional vulnerability and true social satire of effective domestic dramas that came before, and it only shines when it's exercising (instead of exorcising - zing!) every incredulously negative behavior of the femme fatale trope.",

What a magnificent surprise indeed, when it turns out Amy Dunne is a complete psycho. I suppose she represents a dark fantasy that the majority of us would never want to, let alone dream of acting out. She's turned into my new favourite antihero and she joins the hall of fame for bad ass betches like regina george from mean girls, Sarah michelle geller's character in Cruel intentions, emily/miranda priestley from the devil wears prada, to name a few.\nOk back to the rest of the film - Grippingly good from start to finish,,,BUT I felt that final police Q&A at the hospital with Amy was a complete let down. It didn't tie up the loose ends nicely as Amy slips up too many times - too absurd, not believable that she recovered from her slip ups.

Rosemund Pike was excellent in the movie as she gave the best performance of her career. Ben Affleck was also really good. This movie had a dark element to it that fits the story quite well. The film explores media biased and how society view men in the relationship. Halfway through the movie, the twist really caught me off guard. The twist was done well enough to a point where if you had a theory about what really happened one the day of Amy's disappearance, you might be right. I don't think anyone else other than David Fincher can direct this film and make it as good as it is. One problem I had with the movie is that you really have to suspend your disbelief for how the cops act in the movie. You know what I'm talking about once you see it for yourself. Overall, Gone Girl is intense, though provoking, and stylish as it made for a great drama.\nScore: 4.75/5",

The movie is wound up with drama and tension from start to finish, the product of an impressive Fincher mind trip that makes most of the movie a guessing game and offers up several fantastic plot twists. Pike is magnificent in what is easily her defining role. Her cold, diabolical attitude completely makes the film. The supporting cast is strong, with Perry, Coon and Harris all really putting on good performances and Harris delivering an especially frightening show. The lone dark spot on this otherwise fantastic movie is Affleck, who manages to look both disinterested and ignorant at the same time. I honestly think, based on watching real world interviews, that Affleck is simply unintelligent, with complex plot lines such as the one found in Gone Girl just going over his head. Thankfully, his attitude plays nicely into the films plot (Fincher has played his cards perfectly) and the role is, to a great degree, constructed around him, saving the movie the embarrassment of being the next Argo. I will say as well that Gone Girl pales in comparison to Interstellar, the real star of this year's movie line up. Nevertheless, Fincher's film is excellent and I highly recommend for anyone looking for a top notch drama.",

Early twists and turns are predictable but as the movie goes on, you gradually start shifting from a thriller story to the complex dark side of a marriage and it forces you to think about that.. It gives you a short ride of that phase of marriage which every couples go through once in a lifetime and they have this sort of complex imaginations on their 'beloved'.. The conclusion part (after she comes back) is just fantastic and nothing could suit better for this story.. Its definitely a one time must-watch for every couples..

            "content": "Hey, I am wrong, happily wrong. In my review of \"Jack Reacher\", I made the following comment on Rosamund Pike: \"Rosamund Pike might have one of the most beautiful and cinematic faces I have ever seen, what a pity that she only possesses a mediocre level of facial acting skill, which will never be able to elevate her to the rank of A-level stars.\" This was my observation after watching numerous roles of Rosamund Pike, always being amazed by her bright shining smile but at the same time disappointed by her \"woodenness\" (fun fact: Pike's application was rejected in all acting schools so she ultimately chose to study English Literature at ... Oxford instead). But finally, finally, a director can realize that \"impossible task\" - bringing the best out of her and elevating her to the spot light that she deserves - and that director is no less than the ever dependable David Fincher. Hey, and I am totally happy being wrong about Pike, because I always admire her beauty, and watching such beauty accompanied by impressive acting is a great pleasure. Not that I do not believe her talent or something (she is an Oxonian by all means!), but her wooden face really limits her emotional expressions. [SPOILER, MANY SPOILERS AHEAD] But with this role of the day-dreaming yet utterly cold-blooded Amy Dunne, Pike finally has a character suitable for her weakness. Amy has always been a day-dreaming woman, who wants to be the centre of the world with all the men orbiting around her, behaving the way she wants them to behave. And when they cannot, or do not want to behave like that, she would use her supreme imagination to punish them, to get rid of them. And the laid-back (lazy actually), simple, quite stupid (and even daring to be unfaithful to her!) husband of Amy, Mr. Nick Dunne (the ever awkwardness in front of the camera of Ben Affleck is somehow very, very appropriate for this role, kudos to Mr. Fincher and his casting director!), is no different. Throughout the film we observe Amy's superb ability of manipulating the men around him, from framing her husband to death row, to outright murdering her naive ex-boyfriend (the \"womanizer\" Mr. Barney seems to be the weakest link of the whole cast, he was colourless throughout the whole film and even appeared strained during the sex scenes - really, what kind of womanizer is that?) without being caught. As such, the whole film is a string of twist-and-turns that reminds me of Fincher's most entertaining film (in my opinion) to date - \"The Game\". Thanks to a very well-written script and masterful \"Fincher-esque\" direction, the twist-and-turns and climaxes are laid out evenly throughout the film and thus keep the high tempo and rushing adrenaline of the beginning continuing to the very end. Of course here and there there are plot-holes, disconnections between plot elements and unbelievable \"coincidences\", but Fincher kept the tempo of the film so well that the audience can hardly feel such \"irregularities\", except for, maybe, the camp-ground sequences. Again, Pike was the best choice for the role - she appears superbly gorgeous when she needs to (in front of the media or the men that she wants to seduce) and equally unrecognizable (despite her very apparent beauty!) when she wants to \"lay low\". The supporting cast (except for \"Mr. Barney\" Neil Patrick Harris) also did their job very well to serve the plot development while creating their own role and image in the big picture, painted by no other than Mrs. Amy Dunne, of course. This is a very, very entertaining film to watch, and moreover, an intelligently entertaining one. I love the way David Fincher quickly unfolding the first twist-and-turn just to slapping another one to the audience's face, until the very last minutes. I love the way he keeps his style by choosing filming frames that are equally tight like the plot and resemble a \"cage\" for his characters (and for Amy's men, of course) and by using his distinctive sepia tone throughout the film. Yes, maybe this is not a film full of philosophical thoughts and does not need after-watch contemplation (except for the feminists and unfaithful husbands, of course) but this is a joy to watch -, a film to admire the talent of Fincher in every aspects of the film production. Maybe asking Fincher back to \"Seven\" or \"Fight Club\" is a little bit too much. Maybe we should sit down and enjoy the magical touches of Fincher in making such beautiful films with amazing characters like Amy. I really hope Pike will get at least an Oscar nomination for this role.",

From start to end this film did its job in keeping me on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, something not too many films have done this year. Although i noticed that after the half way point it felt like a different but equally as interesting film that could have been approached differently and would have fit more with the original tone. Rosamund Pike puts in an Oscar worthy performance and leads the race for the award. She is definitely the most interesting and compelling character of the film but still doesn't take too much away from the other great performances. It was a fitting ending i felt for the film although it left me wanting a little more. Despite the slight dip in execution after the half way mark and the slightly rushed ending it didn't affect the overall quality too much as this is still a must watch film for the year of 2014. - 9.3",

Nowadays if you pitch an 'adult drama' to the studios it better have guns, explosions, car chases and big f*ck-off robots beating the sh*t out of each other if you want to get a big budget, otherwise you're relegated to 'indie-adult-drama.'\n\nThe guy who brought us Zodiac, The Social Network and the U.S. version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (yes I know he made Se7en and Fight Club) still makes quality adult dramas with a solid budget, and Gone Girl is no different. Based on the 2012 bestseller, the film stars Ben Affleck as a bar owner whose wife goes missing, and as the film progresses he is put under severe scrutiny by the public, the police and the media over his involvement in the case. Telling you anymore would be spoiling things.\nThe narrative is non-linear at the start and this has been done deliberately to cleverly reveal things to us as the audience. As the film moves along you begin questioning which characters to side with and sometimes whose story is more believable. The film shifts focus between characters throughout the runtime and helps to keep the film engaging but most importantly keeps you on your toes.\n\nTo read the full review click on the link below:\nhttp://tiny.cc/6s4tqx",

Not that he fell short in the acting department). What if it was all about a women getting even (and yes with the death penalty included) and not letting her husband get away with infidelity? Hats off to Rosamund Spike for playing the role of the wronged woman to perfection. The director, the scriptwriter could have left the audience with a moral dilemma, which would have made taking sides difficult for us (maybe just all us women, who have at least once being similarly scorned in this lifetime). Amy had me rooting for her character almost through to the midway of the movie before things took a turn for the worse. She was made out of the crazy person who has done similar crazy things before. Voila! There you go the scriptwriter has solved the dilemma for you. And if that was not enough to separate the black from white, Amy also turned into a stone cold murder. Thus leaving no room for ambivalence of emotions, no lingering thoughts about whether revenge gives you better closure than bawling your eyes out and several weekly visits to the shrink. Nonetheless, Rosamund Spike breathed elegance and class into her character, a psychopath that may be. No matter how the story panned out, you can't take that away from her.",

Which is not without some irony in that while this in many ways is ultimately Fincher's film, it is undoubtedly his most mainstream. He shows great restraint, but there are parts that almost scream for a little more provocation. \nWhen he gets to unleash in a couple of brilliantly executed set pieces, you almost crave for more.\n\nIts here where there is a slight feeling Gone Girl has been a little too critically lauded, but there is no doubting this is still spectacular filmmaking from Fincher and an excellent adaptation from Flynn combined to make for one very entertaining, often amusing cinema experiences.",

If you have not seen this film, you may skip to the bottom for the summary.)\n\nDirected by the brilliant David Fincher (The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fight Club, Alien) with the screenplay written by Gillian Flynn herself (the author of the novel the film is based on), Gone Girl is perhaps the most entertaining marriage breakdown thriller film ever. How often do we get to say that? Almost never. The story starts off with the mysterious disappearance of Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), on their fifth wedding anniversary. Flashbacks show how the couple met and had an apparently perfect relationship before going through a rough patch.\n\nNick soon becomes a target suspect when the media turn their attention towards his unacceptably laid back behaviour. It is also later revealed that Nick has been having an affair with his college student Andie (Emily Ratajkowski). He must have murdered his wife, or did he? Only his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) believes he didn't, but he lies to her as well. Even if the audience already knew that Nick's innocent, the story has a strong compelling hook that keeps the film thoroughly intriguing with twists and turns while it gets more disturbingly creepy and darkly humourous at the same time. The story also subtly but intelligently explores the realistic themes of dishonesty, economy, society stereotyping and media influence, all of which that lead to the cause and effect of Nick and Amy.\n\nYes, Nick is an unfaithful husband, but Amy's the ultimate villain of the story. Rosamund Pike (The World's End, Jack Reacher) gave the performance of her career as the scary psychopathic type-A crazy bitch who plots to frame Nick for her apparent death by staging a fake crime scene and placing false evidence for the police to discover. Ben Affleck's (Runner, Runner, Argo) portrayal of the spontaneously laid back Nick, who gradually becomes frustrated and in fear, is so natural and real that I could feel myself behaving like him if I was in his shoes. Then there's also the most creepy Neil Patrick Harris performance ever, as Desi, Amy's wealthy but obsessed ex-boyfriend who wants to possess her.\n\nRead full review on ColourlessOpinions.com",

Si un libro/caso policial es complejo, probablemente Fincher estara en su adaptacion hollywoodeense (gone girl, la chica del dragon tatuado, zodiaco, 7 pecados capitales). Buena adaptacion del libro, aunque siempre habran cosas menos claro. Pero la mayoria de las ideas esenciales estan bien llevadas a pantalla grande. Sera pq la misma autora del libro hizo el screenplay. Bien la musica de Reznor y Ross, sigue creando tension y ambiente, pero siento que ha decaido un poco con respecto a social network (Oscar incluido) y dragon tatuado.",

Finish with a twist.\n\nVoila!

Director David Fincher (Fight Club and The Social Network) returns to the big screen in roaring fashion, sending chills down couple's spine.\n\nFincher finally takes on Gillian Flynn's 2012 bestselling novel, Gone Girl, giving us a date movie to die for ... literally. The script also written by Flynn who shows us an almost depleted marriage of a husband and wife (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) who want to not only destroy the heart of their marriage but each other. From the start, Fincher never leaves any breathing room and goes right for the throat. His craftsmanship has significantly improved over the years and he proves his point here even more. On top of the eerie writing and vivid direction is the film's lead actors (Affleck and Pike), who are the root of this film success. \n\nAffleck has never been better and Pike is finally at the top of her game. Nick Dunne (Affleck) is a New York Journalist who is out of work and out of luck. That is, until he crawls back to his hometown in Missouri where he opens up a local bar with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon, outstanding). His wife Amy (Pike) is a trust-fund baby, Amazing Amy, also out of a recent writing career and wants nothing to do with 'Nick's Missouri.' Flynn, also a writer who was laid off from her job by Entertainment Weekly, knows a thing or too about out-of-work writers. This hardship and experience is what inspired her to explore the psychology and dynamics of long term-relationships for her book. After that, the couple's marriage starts to show signs of trouble and continues to rot, that is, until all hell breaks loose on the Dunne's fifth anniversary. Nick comes home from work to find a break in and a bloody struggle throughout the house, but Amy is nowhere to be found. Nick ends up becoming a person of interest in the suspected murder of his missing, pregnant wife. \n\nSpoilers are a bitch and would kill the suspense and mystery of this film. So you'll have to see it for yourself and let the mysteries pour out in front of you. Unless, you're one of the six million who've read the book. What I will tell is that Gone Girl does live up to the hype and then some. Fincher hits all the right notes with every scary, suspenseful and seductive scene. It's twistedly dark and will send couple's running for the hills if they think marriage is all butterflies and lollipops. Affleck gives us one of his most intriguing performances of his career. He's come a long way from the god-awful performance of Captain Rafe McCawley, Pearl Harbor, to the captivating performance of Tony Mendez, Argo. Now, he gives us a soulless and shallow low-life known as Nick Dunne. Is he a sociopath? Or is he innocent? \n\nPike's performance on the other hand is a career breakthrough for her. Having been in smaller roles (Pride & Prejudice and An Education) in the past, Pike finally gets her moment to wickedly shine as the morally corrupt wife. In addition, other actors (Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris) are a knockout throughout the film. Perry is smart and riveting as Nick's know-it-all lawyer. Dickens is astonishing as the obsessed cop who wants to find out all the answers and will not stop until she does. Finally, there's Harris who breaks away from his usual comedic role to a much more darker role ... he's a stalker from Amy's past. Harris is cunning with every move he makes or line he says. He'll send shivers tingling down your spine. \n\nOn top of that, Fincher brings in his veteran's cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, editor Kirk Baxter and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to help artfully craft the film, while also adding in more tension to the viewers experience. Gone Girl is stylish to a fault, but damn Fincher knows how to vividly bring a novel to life right before our very eyes. He's always ahead of the game continually throwing punches at you until you're morally and physically exhausted. Gone Girl is not a light film as you can tell, but its one to obsess over for a while. Its going to get a lot of Oscar buzz this holiday season will continue to be talked about years down the road. It rightfully has a spot at one of the best films of the year. It receives the highest of highs ... five out of five stars. \n\n\"When I think of my wife, I always think of the back of her head. I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling her brain, trying to get answers. The primal questions of a marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other? What will we do?\" ... that's marriage for ya folks.",

Is it a replica of what the Coen Brothers might have done if they had the opportunity to do it? These questions plagued me as I tried desperately to get through the first half hour. Then it became more exciting when they introduced elements to let you know it was a puzzle. I thought the cast quite talented, but the film noir delivery did not always work. I did get caught up in the mystery of Amy's disappearance. No spoilers here--but I will say that at times I felt I was watching a Black Swan retread. It is plain creepy. The film's message looks at the artifice of not only marriage, but the artifice of media relations with the common people. It even spoofs those CNN news shows hosted by Nancy Grace. There is so much B.S. slung around by everyone that it makes you want to bitchslap someone. Rosamund Pike is way over the top, but captures an aspect that reminds you of Bette Davis.  The person I loved the most was Kim Dickens as the detective who is up to the challenge to solve the case. Oscar buzz included Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris; ladies of the jury, they are fun in their parts, but they certainly do not warrant an Oscar. Well, Neil could get the award for Best Gusher and that is far as I will go. Needless to say it grabbed me, but bothered me. And it was way too long for a thriller. David Fincher, thrillers are meant to be a bit shorter. This is a love/hate movie and will be spoofed in the near future.",

It begins well enough; the first hour is appropriately eerie, unsettling, and mysterious (largely thanks to Trent Reznor's and Atticus Ross' \"spooky with a capital S\" score). Rosamund Pike is chilly and weird, Ben Affleck is dopey and suspicious, and David Fincher shoots the whole thing stylishly and efficiently. It's unfortunate, then, that the plot very quickly twists (in a not so unexpected way), the cards are on the table, and the film devolves into either a heavy-handed, perhaps-misogynistic-but-definitely-ridiculous examination of marriage or a camp thriller with no self-awareness. If you can stomach this and find something to latch onto in Fincher's latest (and meanest) look at awful people being awful to each other, you'll probably dig this. For me, I'm waiting for this talented director to start exploring another facet of humanity other than an unrelenting constancy of douchiness.",

A stylish, idealistic thriller with a gritty storyline and deluding motives for the disappearance of the intoxicating Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike).

Twists and turns and truly gawping moments are stuffed into the thriller, although with the end you're waiting for the climax ending which never comes and you realise that's the better, realistic ending. I do think that Neil Patrick Harris was extremely miscast for the role of Desi Collings as in the book he's meant to be tall, handsome and welcoming; but with Harris's Desi you get arrogant, obsessive and rude.

Director David Fincher's signature dark tone and icy, low-key score work well here.\n\nI love how the movie serves as a searing examination of media and public sensationalism in criminal cases where no one has full command of the facts.  It's a sad commentary on how these cases become a contest of public image rather than a thorough examination of the available facts and evidence.  The movie also examines the nature of marriage and having children, and how pointless it all is.  It critiques how we all put on a facade to fit social norms and expectations that are as arbitrary as they are unquestioned.\n\nI thought the reveal of Amy's true story took place a little too soon in the movie, but it still worked.\n\nThe movie does start to take a steady nosedive after Amy comes back home.  It feels more pointless, like, what do we have to care about now?  And does Amy really get anywhere in the end?  I thought she wanted Nick to die, but at the end she's still stuck with him.  I guess she somehow fell back in love with him (or a certain version of him, anyway), but there's little sign of him wanting to accommodate her desires going forward.

Basically, the plot centers around the mysterious disappearance of a writer named Amy (Pike) and how the events surrounding her absence affects her husband, Nick (Affleck). From the get-go, this movie is just so intense and mysterious that you'll be surprised at every turn. The atmosphere and mood of the movie just felt so penetrating and creepy the entire duration of the film. There's also so many what-the-fuck moments that will have you gasping and speechless and almost falling out of your seat. Fincher is a master of cinematography and he does such a great job of building tension in all his scenes and reveals, even in scenes where there's only exposition or dialogue. Affleck and Pike are both at the top of their acting game too. Even Tyler Perry is pretty damn good too. I also really enjoyed the social commentary this film suggests about how modern day relationships have their foundations built on expectations and forgery rather that on genuineness and intimacy. This movie really makes you think about a ton of deep stuff and is not just another cheap mystery movie.

This is what really made Gone Girl so good, because to be honest, I didn't think the story was that surprising or unpredictable - perhaps parts of it, but not in its entirety. Instead this film relied on creating so much more than just a curious plotline. The acting was superb with Affleck and Pike perfectly cast and then followed up by perfect deliverance of their roles. The cinematics of the whole film are perfect, balancing elegance and style with the dark and twisty, that will have you engaged end-to-end.",

            "content": "Recently Released\nGone Girl\nYou Go Girl! Fincher Does Its Again\nYoung Critic\n10/31/2014 (Happy Halloween!)\nThere are few directors that can play with an audience's mind with as much skill as David Fincher. He is part of the breed of storytellers that create extremely high expectations with every movie that they premiere. If the expectations are not met, then their careers could suffer fatally. However, Fincher's latest film Gone Girl, already in some dangerous heights, passed the test and even heightened Fincher's reputation.\n \nFincher's greatest achievement for this film was getting Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn to adapt the book for the screen. The greatest sin of book to film adaptations is that much of the story is dropped in the transition. Some directors try to solve such a problem by hiring the author of the original book to be the screenwriter, but almost always the problem is that authors don't know how to write a script, they're novelists! I don't know how Flynn did it, but she seemed to have an expert hand with her book adaptation, and part of the blame must go to Fincher who almost always co-writes on his films. But then again we mustn't underappreciate Flynn's skill; she might be one of the few authors that actually knows her book. It is because of this that the film is able to cut parts from the book that the reading audience is able to accept; it helps the story take on a cinematic look with a smooth narration. And this smoothness makes the twists and jerks in the story feel more violent and deep.\n \nGone Girl tells the story of Nick and Amy Dunne. They are a married couple whom were once successful New York authors, but the recent economic recession forced them to relocate in Nick's hometown in Mississippi. On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, Amy (Rosamund Pike) disappears. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes back home to an overturned table and a blood-specked kitchen. Nick calls the police who launch an investigation, headed by Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens). The audience is left completely in the dark. We see two conflicting stories of Amy and Nick's relationship. Amy speaks through her diary, and we hear Nick's account at the police station. Both the police and the audience are in such suspicion that we begin to fear whether Nick is responsible of his wife's disappearance. Nick is forced to hire lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), as things begin to snarl up: Amy's old friends begin to appear (Neil Patrick Harris among the most dodgy), and no one has any idea who did what.\n \nThe film's best aspect is undoubtedly its story; Flynn does an Oscar-worthy job. The jumps between Nick and Amy's narrative are flawless, and the leaps from the past to the present of Nick and Amy's history never lose us.\n \nFincher's direction is spectacular; his way to reveal the story's twists and turns, and connect them all with his logic is only something that the greats do. Fincher's handling of the script, actors, and camera works in such a way that Gone Girl competes against Fincher's best film Fight Club for the best set of images this auteur has given us.\n \nAs for the acting, who could guess that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike had this in them? Affleck is in his best role in years, he masterfully handles the threats and desperation that his character feels as the tension surmounts, probably since Affleck might be able to relate to his character. Affleck suffered greatly from drug use in the 90s and had tabloids dismembering him, his relationships were quick and crippling and the actor was on the verge of total anguish. His renaissance after meeting and marrying Jennifer Garner has led him to rise back through the Hollywood ranks to the point of winning an Oscar for his film Argo in 2012. Now his acting capabilities have been reestablished and his star power is once again glowing. Pike reminds me of Bruce Dern's career turn last year in Nebraska. Dern and Pike were both actors that were constantly shunned to the side and always played the protagonist's friend or the evil henchman (or henchwoman). When both Dern and Pike were given a chance to take on a titular role, they both devoured their character and exploded on screen with such a presence that it made all the other directors who had cast them down to look down in shame. Pike plays Amy in the flashbacks and her cool voice showers over us from her diary. The two actors meld spectacularly so that they truly become the Dunnes. There are meanwhile some very smart performances from Kim Dickens, who plays Detective Rholand with a witty snappiness and whipping observation. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry both shine as well as they take on much darker characters than their usual comedic ones; they clearly show us through this their true acting capabilities, it might be time to give them a titular role as well.\n \nThe technical aspects are all pristine, the cinematography is dominating; the sound mixing is captivating; and the costume and production design is just the right amount of spooky. But certainly the one aspect that I don't want to leave unnoticed is the music. Well, it can be argued that it isn't music at all, rather more of a spa-like tingling of instruments. And you know this movie is a Fincher film when the spa music does anything but relax you.   \n \nGone Girl might turn out to be the film of the year; it will undoubtedly be on the Oscar radar. As for the twisted ending I will say this: you will never see it coming.",

Fincher masterfully navigates the audience through a complicated a non-linear plot which while it would be an overstatement to say keeps the audience guessing certainly has its surprises in this thriller. What makes the film most appealing to me is the main characters,  neither of whom being particularly likeable leading the film to lack a protagonist. However this is refreshing, as we delve into the couple's past we learn that Amy is fiendishly manipulating while Nick is distant from his wife, unsympathetic due to his affair and contempt for his wife. The lack of sympathy the audience feels for the characters somehow perversely makes their fates all the more interesting as we wish to see just how far one character can take the other. It should be mentioned that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike put in stellar performances to bring these characters to life; it feels by no means a stretch to see Affleck as the most hated man in America while Pike's emotive narration makes her apathetic face all the more curious.\nFor me Fincher hits a real high note for the thriller genre. The violent scenes have the audience squinting through grimaced cringes while deeply wishing to see more. There is a pervasive sense of suspense throughout the film, which is intensified by Trent Reznor's fantastic soundtrack.\nI would highly recommend Gone Girl, it is one of the best thrillers of recent years.",

Gone Girl is almost like a combination of all that with motives behind the wife killing, with the personal identity of the characters and who they really are, and once the twist and turns hit reality definitely comes crashing down. Another great element to the movie without giving away too much is the script goes in a very old classic original direction which is from the core of some very twisted Bette Davis films. A lot of people have compared it to that of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane but to be honest that would be too broad of a direction Gone Girl takes itself in. The direction is more of those from a hand full of twisted Bette Davis movies. Unfortunately I am stuck in trying to identify which movies those are but than again if I said what they were it may lead to spoiling too much of the movie. Acting wise Ben Affleck is f**king great and f**k those who have issues with him being the next Batman lol hadda let that out. Rosamund Pike was great as well with out giving away too much of the movie. Also quite a comic relief Tyler Perry. Never thought from the mood this movie had set that his lines would have me out of my seat laughing but they did. Also this was quite refreshing to see him in after witnessing his uncomfortable performance in Alex Cross. Is this a Best Picture? If it won I would have no objections but for me this one of those movies that brings out my passion good old twisted classic movies and reminds me why I loved those movies back then.",

            "content": "David Fincher is still at the top of his game. He knows his strengths well, and chooses his stories appropriately. Here, Gillian Flynn's writing and David Fincher's storytelling style are made for each other; it's a sickly brilliant combination. Fincher brings out the best from all his actors, especially Rosamund Pike, who steals the show with her riveting performance.\n\nThe movie is about an upscale (late suburban) couple, Nick and Amy Dunne; both of them are writers. It exposes the secrets at the heart of this modern marriage, and how recession plays a role in leading them there. The story begins with the disappearance of Amy on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. We get to hear both the partners' versions of their marriage - we get an idea of the setting, and everything around, but we don't know whose version to believe; this is done with the help of unreliable narration, like in the novel. Due to this, and other twists, proper amount of suspense is maintained throughout the film.\n\nThe movie also highlights the media and public's frenzy and fascination for such 'Missing' or 'Murder' stories, and how they are quick to pass their judgments even before the case goes to trial. It wittily pokes fun at public's collective obsession of social media and reality television. Other than this, the story portrays marriage as the biggest villain, which is quite true; people portray their best selves when they're dating someone, but often fail to cope with their partner's true nature once they're in a committed relationship or marriage. Our very human nature to lie and hide things is the biggest reason for most complications in a marriage.\n\nI do agree with some of the viewers who said that the film sympathizes a little more with the male lead by omitting few complexities of the female lead (or rushing through them) and making her appear more antagonistic. It's just by a little margin though, otherwise the balance is quite proper in the storytelling.\n\nThe crisp cinematography and captivating soundtrack sets proper mood for the story to unravel. The ending might not satisfy half of the viewers, but with the central theme it's exploring, it's the most appropriate and thought-provoking one.",

I went in fresh to the theater not knowing how anything would turn out and, to say the least, I wasn't disappointed until the credits started rolling.  My only nitpick was the last 30 minutes felt rushed compared to the nice pacing of background and storytelling we got in the first 90 minutes, but nothing was left out.\n\nBen Affleck scores again with another studly effort.  However, he's not who you need to see this movie for.  Rosamund Pike makes you believe she's the reason men should never marry crazy.  Subtle yet it builds and then explodes.  Great support work from Tyler Perry in a role suited for him...not a role he's in a fat suit.  Even though you find out the kind of guy NPH's character is, he still does such a great job making you feel for his character.  \n\nIt feels like nothing was left out in terms of the plot and with the ending coming as a surprise to the audience, as long as you haven't read the book or had it spoiled, what makes it even better is the ending surprises the characters in the film as well.",

It's more than just some film about a mysterious disappearance, but it's also a slick and compelling commentary on sensationalizing things like murders and disappearances, the inevitable shitstorms the families and loved ones get caught in such situations, and a number of other things.\n\nOne day, after some bitterness with his wife, Amy, over a touchy marital issue, Nick Dunne goes a bar early in the day to have a discussion with his sister and have a drink to get his mind off the various stresses going on in his marriage and life.\n\nWhen he returns home, however, he can't find his wife and there's a glass table that's been shattered. He notifies the police about his wife's disappearance, and they immediately become suspicious of him when they find tiny blood droplets, are suspicious the scene that looks like a staged robbery, and continue to be suspicious of him when he goes back to the police station and seems to know nothing about his wife's life like what she does on a day-to-day basis or whether or not she has any friends.\n\nThings only get worse for Nick when the media gets wind of Amy's disappearance, especially as she was the inspiration for her mother's Amazing Amy books, which are beloved by many. Now, the search is on for Amazing Amy, and with Nick under careful scrutiny by the authorities and the media, his life soon turns into a living hell with all the speculations and suspicions surrounding him. Even his smallest errors in judgment lead people to believe that he's a murderer.\n\nNow, Nick has to figure out what really happened to his wife, while also trying to deal with the media frenzy and his own secrets which threaten to not just ruin his life, but also send him to death throw if he gets convicted of murder.\n\nThe story is filled with a lot of twists and turns, and paints a realistic portrait of how the media reacts to such sensational stories, especially if they get to make premature judgments about potential suspects (I especially enjoyed the satirical interpretation of that awful hag, Nancy Grace, and people like her). The characters are all very deep and very fascinating, especially as the couple's secrets are revealed. There's a lot for a viewer to sink their teeth into and it's very thought-provoking with all the things it has to say.\n\nThe acting is superb, especially with Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy. Each of these characters had a lot of secrets and it was also interesting to explore their marriage from the happy times to the terribly troubled times. These actors make their characters feel real and believable, and also terrifying at times as their dark secrets and true natures came into light. I also enjoyed Tyler Perry's performance as Nick's attorney, Tanner Bolt, as well as Carrie Coon as Nick's feisty sister, Margo. \n\nThe film is chock full of mystery, some suspense, sex, dark humor, and interesting satire all mixed into one delicious combination. It's certainly not dull, but it's pulse-pounding and thoroughly engaging as it deconstructs media sensationalism and the dark secrets of its troubled characters. It's a great slow-burn thriller that unravels its secrets carefully, but it shocks and intrigues even more with each passing twist. \n\nGone Girl is one of the best films of the year, no question. With its story that covers a variety of themes and topics, superb acting, suspense, and plenty of twists and turns, it will have no trouble pleasing fans of mystery thrillers.",

Even with Fincher's presence aside, I do love to see Rosamund Pike act and hear Trent Reznor scores, so I already felt the good here outweighing my assumed bad. It doesn't hurt of course that Gone Girl has an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIt's hard to talk too much about Gone Girl without hitting spoiler territory very quickly, and that's not what I do here (I may post a spoiler-y entry about it at a later date.). I will say that I enjoyed Gone Girl, it is certainly nowhere near my favourite David Fincher film, I might even go so far as to say that it's overrated, but I did at the very least enjoy it. (If I do end up posting that spoilertalk, I'll let you know why I was certain about how the disappearance of Rosamund Pike went down a few seconds before it was even revealed she was missing, which is another thing that probably hampered my enjoyment of the movie. \n\nThat said, when I got to the end of movie I found myself thinking \"Hm, that's a fair enough ending. Seems like there are a number of plot threads that never got tied up but I can see how people enjoyed that.\" I waited around for a five minute stinger that I thought was probably coming. Sure enough it did, still lots of unresolved things, but the big looming central plot was resolved. Then, turns out that firstly; this was quick wrapup, and secondly; I had not seen the end of the movie. I had seen the first act and this \"five minute stinger\" I was expecting was the next hour and a half of the film. \n\nNow I love long movies, and I totally get the switch in dynamic that took place here, but I just didn't walk out getting the feeling I had seen a truly masterful piece of cinema. Gone Girl is definitely good, don't me wrong, maybe even nudging at \"great\" but I think it suffers a little under the weight of its own hype. As much as I try to go into a movie without expectation, there's only so much we can do in that department, and Gone Girl was simply not the revelation I had been told it would be.\n\nAs a sidenote though, I'm starting to see the physicality in Affleck, and thinking maybe he really can pull off Batman in 2016.\n\n74%\n\n-Gimly",

When he returns home, he finds his cat outside, signs of a struggle inside and his wife Amy(Rosamund Pike) missing.  As Officer Gilpin(Patrick Fugit) and Detective Boney(Kim Dickens) begin to investigate, they find the clues that Amy left for Nick on the occasion of their anniversary.  Even though their marriage would eventually sour, it started well enough in New York, as Amy was initially attracted to Nick's good lucks, charm, intelligence and willingness to go down on her.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" is one half of a good movie in the form of an intriguing mystery that expertly interweaves two separate points of view.  Helping matters immensely is Carrie Coon who is excellent in proving here that her virtuoso work on \"The Leftovers\" was no fluke.  That's not to mention the very capable support from Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris and Kim Dickens.  And you have to admire Red Sox fan Ben Affleck's dedication to his craft when he wears a Mets cap in one scene.\n\nBut once \"Gone Girl\" gets to the halfway point, it makes about the second or third worst mistake a movie can make, namely fully resolving its central mystery without an accompanying cliffhanger.  It's not that the movie has nowhere to go after that.  Quite the opposite in fact, as the movie drags like nobody's business, leading to a critical strain of credibility in the process.  I don't know how much of that is due to Rosamund Pike's lackluster performance because Amy is pretty much an impossible role but I am sure a lot of the fault for the movie's failure should go to director David Fincher who plays it agonizingly straight, literalizing every last detail.(Oh, the fun either Gregg Araki or Mary Harron could have had with this material.)

            "content": "Another dark, entertaining, well-crafted film from David Fincher, and another bone-chilling soundtrack from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. This movie is very good for a number of reasons. The commendable acting of Ben Affleck and especially Rosamund Pike is certainly worth a mention. One great thing about it is its ability to lure the viewer into its plot and successfully keep the viewer engaged for the entire 2 1/2 hour run time; this movie doesn't feel anywhere near that long. Even more impressive is the film's ability to hold the viewer's attention amidst all the different layers in the plot. The best thing about the film is that it is so much more than what the trailer makes it out to be. The trailer shows it as a basic wife-goes-missing, husband's-the-prime-suspect, suspicions-of-murder, mystery movie when, in its entirety, the story grows much more complex and reveals multiple layers of character development in a meticulous, and sinister plot that slowly unravels piece by piece while suspending the viewers in a state of grueling suspense. My personal favorite detail is the placement of a single shot at the beginning and at the end of the film--a very minor detail indeed but it so perfectly illustrates the idea that a person's perspective of someone can change over time (the feelings the viewer has when shown the shot at the beginning of the film are very different from the feelings the viewer has when shown the same shot again at the end of the film), much like what can happen in a real marriage or relationship in general. This is definitely a movie worth seeing and one that may require repeated viewings to catch all the small details--not a problem for me because I will definitely be seeing this delightfully twisted movie more than once.",

Michael Douglas would have been great in this movie or an actor with his acting chops would have made this movie so much better for me. I like Ben Affleck as a person, as an actor, not so much.\n\nMichael Douglas has a way about him, he carries himself as an intelligent and capable man however he has weaknesses, especially for beautiful blonds. Yes, that's what I am  saying, they should have casted Michael Douglas or someone like him for this movie.\n\nRosamund Pike was amazing, she is very convincing as a diabolical, jaded, and manipulative-psycho b*tch.  I'm scared to sleep next to her because she's a vengeful femme fatale. It kind of helps that she has red hot sex appeal to lure in the men who admire her, it's all part of the web she weaves.\n\nThere were well placed comedic relief by Margo, Nick's twin sister. Humor always seem to make a doomed situation more tolerable. \n\nAll in all, the suspense and mystery drew me in but the ending fell flat on it's face because the director didn't make it believable or plausible to me.",

A lot of people dislike him as an actor or hollywood personality, but in this film all this hate is drain into a character how apparently is the main responsible of his wife gone missing.\n\nWith a witty language from most of the characters, the script encapsulate the biggest fears for a marriage couple, the death of a family member, in laws relationship, intimacy, hopes, dreams, aspirations, sacrifice for the greater good, fidelity and trust.\n\nOn the technical aspects the editing is well crafted, a very slow story, flow with an outstanding and out of place pace and rhythm, in a way seems to be in sync with the music score, made by the same team from Girl with The Drago Tattoo and Social Network (Trent Reznor Atticus Ross) The cinematography is pretty sharp and clean, the yellows and dark tones preserve the mystery of this thriller.\n\nThe most outstanding of this film is that you can see David Fincher at its best on every scene.

            "content": "David Fincher's new film \"Gone Girl\" is a faithful adaptation of the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, which earned the former Entertainment Weekly writer almost universal kudos for her smartly crafted thriller. Luckily for Flynn, the screenplay (which she adapted herself) wound up in the capable hands of director Fincher, who gives \"Gone Girl\" the same exacting treatment as his other recent films. I say luckily, because in the hands of a lesser director, \"Gone Girl\" could easily have come off as pandering as the Fox News sensationalism it employs as a target of mockery.\n\nEven as \"Gone Girl\" poked fun at the American public's tabloid tastes, the novel's success hinged on delivering exactly the same kind of rewards as those \"Kidnapped Coed\" headlines the news media so dearly loves: Sex, shock, betrayal!  However cleverly the titillations were clothed in the book behind spunky post-modern prose, stripped down as a film, \"Gone Girl\" could have unraveled into the kind of potboiler that comes and goes without leaving much of an imprint beyond the smiles on a few studio accountants' faces.\n\nThat is why putting a cool operator like David Fincher, with his dissection-lab sense of aesthetics, at the helm of the movie was either a stroke of genius or tremendous luck; I can think of no other working director who could have more nimbly prevented \"Gone Girl\" from becoming a trashy film version of a pseudo-trashy book (The novel, perhaps tellingly, battled it out for supremacy on the New York Times best-seller list with \"50 Shades of Gray\").\n\nI hardly want to delve into the plot of \"Gone Girl\" as the slightest giveaway will have filmgoers hurling \"spoiler\" epithets in my direction. In a nutshell, when unemployed writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck, looking suitably booze-bloated for the role) returns home to find his beautiful ice queen of a wife, Amy, missing (Rosamund Pike in an appropriately pitched performance), a media feeding frenzy ensues. Headed by a Fox News-Nancy Grace caricature (Missi Pyle), the war tom-toms soon lead everyone to suspect Nick as his wife's slayer. But his devoted twin sister (Carrie Coon) and his thousand-dollar-suited lawyer (stubble-coiffed Tyler Perry) see otherwise - and soon the audience does, as well.\n\nThe film's advertising touts the story as an examination of the deception that lies behind everyday marriage when, in fact, it feels more like what lies behind the doors of the C.S.I writers' room. Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\" it is not. Hardly subtle, it is pleasingly tabloid, but luckily that is where Fincher stepped in.\n\nFincher is the new Truman Capote of the cinema, an artist who has perfected a balance of blending truth and fiction so seamlessly that something entirely new is born of the merger. What Capote called his \"non-fiction novel,\" Fincher has reversed, creating something along the lines of \"non-dramatic movies.\" That's not to say Fincher makes dull films, far from it. But for all their brilliance, there is nothing overtly theatrical about Fincher's recent films.\n\nDispensing with showy direction, he never uses his tools to emotionalize material and wrest a response out of the audience. Instead, his films tick neatly and precisely along as the Swiss chapter of Eurorail, with nearly the same dramatic weight being given to moments of epiphany as to moments of minutiae. He's like a bastard child of Hollywood and Lar Von Triers' Dogme 95 - a group of aesthete Danish filmmakers who have vowed to put aside special effects and melodramatic flourishes in the pursuit of a purer cinema. Unlike the Dogme 95 adherents, Fincher moves his camera and actors with studio perfectionism (and cuts equally immaculately), but tone of his films embrace the kind of kind naturalism that the restrained Danes admire.\n\nFincher never over-varnishes a scene with emotion, never lingers on a moment longer than is required. He's so deft as a director that he's  nearly invisible, moving through commercial thrillers like \"Zodiac\" as subtly as a documentarian. In comparison to flamboyant stylists like Wes (or Paul Thomas) Anderson and hyper-visualists like Kubrick, Fincher is a Shaker-furniture maker - keeping his films religiously simple, but honing them with such master-craftsman precision that he makes even a straight line feels exquisitely wrought.\n\nOne gets the sense that Fincher is first and foremost concerned with the structure of his films. He is superb at the logic of storytelling which, in filmmaking, generally means rigidly adhering to a script. (\"Gone Girl\" is being called Fincher's \"Hitchcock\" film, and Hitchcock was notably famous for the vast amount of time he spent mapping out his scripts and storyboards with wife Alma Reville; so much so that the shooting process itself was almost perfunctory).\n\nThat may explain why Fincher's films come off so intelligently on the screen: Fincher is a craftsman of story, rather than hyperbolic visuals. And that's likely the reason why a garish tale like \"Gone Girl\" works so well under his control. \"Gone Girl\" was praised as a novel for rising above its potboiler storyline through clever writing, but normally there's no hiding behind prose at the cinema. Take, for instance, Faulkner's books adapted for Hollywood. With the poetry of their corn-whiskey patois stripped away, classics like \"The Sound and the Fury\" felt like little more than steamy southern gothics.\n\nFincher's literary rendering of \"Gone Girl\" manages to capture the smarty-pants tone of Flynn's novel which is vital, because without that tone the guilty pleasures of plot twists and slain lovers meant to satisfy the thriller-reading public would have sunk the film.  Consequently, \"Gone Girl\" is probably one of the luckiest collaborations to come to the screen in a long time, especially for  Flynn, whose tale was spared combustion under the xenon arc lights by Fincher's cool-headed read. There's no need to worry about Fincher going up in flames, because it's always those thoughtful craftsmen who labor well into their golden years, and just keep getting better at it.",

            "content": "Adapting novels into screenplays is tough: not only does the writer have to pack 400+ pages of backstory, characterization and plot into 100-120 pages of script, but the director is forced to make important choices about where within those pages to point his or her camera. They have to decide what the story is actually about and discriminatingly pluck snippets from the source material to tell it effectively, all while staying true to the author's intent. Luckily for David Fincher and his latest film, Gone Girl, he had Gillian Flynn-the author of the New York Times bestseller of the same name-manning the typewriter. While many will still prefer Flynn's original hardcover to its adaptation (myself included), the Fincher/Flynn tandem spawned a darkly intoxicating film riddled with its fair share of surprises and hilarity, even for those familiar with the story. It's safe to say that if you're planning on seeing 10 movies this year, Gone Girl should be near the top of the list.\n\nThe film is about Nick and Amy Dunne, a married New York couple in their mid-thirties who lose their print magazine jobs at the height of the recent recession and are forced to move back to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri after his mother is diagnosed with breast cancer. Through a series of rosy flashbacks, we catch glimpses of what used to be Nick and Amy's life together in New York: the night they met at a party in Brooklyn, the night Nick proposed at the release party for Amy's parents' most recent childrens book (Amazing Amy and the Big Day-based on their daughter), and the first few years of their blissful marriage. Subtract two jobs and one Manhattan loft, add a substantial loan to Amy's parents from her trust fund and multiply it all by Amy's reluctance to leave the East coast and shack up in a McMansion along the Mississippi River, and it becomes quite clear that the Dunne union has seen better days. Then on their fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears. The local police scour Nick's house where there are clear signs of a struggle, as well as a letter from Amy: the first clue for the treasure hunt she plans for Nick every year on their anniversary. Gradually, the national media spotlight descends on the small Missouri town and the public turns on Nick when he's suspected for having something to do with his wife's disappearance. As the police investigation develops and the noose continues to tighten around Nick, everyone is left wondering one question: where is Amy Dunne?\n\nHowever, the question Fincher would rather the audience ask themselves is \"Who is Amy Dunne?\" To be sure, there is a reason Flynn's novel has sold over 8.5 million copies. It's a thrilling murder mystery that tantalizes us with many of the familiar concepts we've come to expect from both Hollywood and the serial dramas of the small screen, which seem to be more and more concerned about killing than the people doing the killing or trying to stop it (there is even a show called The Killing that ironically, as Grantland's Andy Greenwald laments, just won't die). But Gone Girl avoids the missteps of its peers and provides the audience with considerably more existential questions than what happened to its title character. Fincher, working off of Flynn's themes, crafts his film around the most salient elements of the story that leaves the audience feeling at once shocked by its absurdity and terrified by its implications. At its core, Gone Girl is about serious relationships and the importunate questions that almost always hover above them. Who Amy and Nick are-as individuals and as a couple-prior to the former's disappearance is just as important to Fincher as what happens to Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick (Ben Affleck) in the film.\n\nAffleck turns in his finest performance to date as the people-pleasing, unintentionally smug Nick Dunne, opting for downplayed, restrained acting choices much like Christian Bale's subtly scintillating role in last year's American Hustle. Surely a number of other actors could have shined in Gone Girl, but Affleck's dopey charm and topsy-turvy career arc truly resonate with the character.  \n\nWhile staying true to the general ethos of the novel is admirable, actually augmenting the material in some respects is downright impressive, and not many directors can do it. One of Fincher's greatest gifts is his mastery of light and shadow, so much so that there is something definitively and obviously congruent about all of his work, and specific minutia stand out: the perpetually-stormy, decaying city streets of Seven; the organic, filthiness of Tyler Durden's house in Fight Club; the moody, gloomy halls of Harvard in The Social Network. In Gone Girl, it happens to be from a scene in the trailer where Nick Dunne is standing in the gazebo with the spotlight all over him at a vigil for Amy, explaining to the hundreds of skeptical mourners and reporters that he's innocent. It's a scene that recapitulates Flynn's prose regarding the proliferation of mass media celebrity culture and the gotcha journalism that promotes the sexiest story over the legitimate one. And while chastising the news media is nothing new in film (e.g. Natural Born Killers (1994), Network (1976), and the upcoming Nightcrawler it would appear to a certain extent), there is something simultaneously intimate and surreal about watching Nick and Amy's story unfold, as if we're watching a reality TV show about people we know personally.  \n\nThere are at least another dozen scenes that gracefully sew the story together, which is no small task given the manner in which Flynn wrote the book, vacillating between Nick's account of the investigation and Amy's old diary entries, which serve as a flashback mechanism. One scene as reimagined by Fincher evoked literal gasps from the entire theater, while Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' haunting soundtrack had people squirming in their seats. It's why we pay to go to the movies.\n\nREAD ALL MY REVIEWS AT justintimereviews.tumblr.com/",

The very idea of having to keep up an appearance with the person you are supposed to love and trust is exhausting. But then, perhaps that's what Gone Girl is getting at.\n\nEither way, there hasn't been a more perfect role for Ben Affleck in some time - his personal life and relationship with the media actually adds to the dimensions of the character as does Rosamund Pike who until now has always played the good woman and here those rolls seem to hide the terror just below the surface. \n\nTechnically Gone Girl is a great achievement but its themes are complicated and I can't say I really enjoyed watching the movie. That said, this is the perfect mix for Fincher - mixing both the glossiness of The Game and the crime/procedurals he loves so much. Yes, Zodiac.\n\nBig fan.",

Fincher adds lots of darkness and little touches of satire.

In the movie, both plot and character are a little rushed, especially when telling Amy's side of the story - how truly awful her parents are, how the naive rich girl gets robbed by low-lifes, and how Amy decides to use Desi to solve her problem.",

This film consists of so many twists and turns that really make the film into a complex picture filled with morally questionable characters and witty macabre humour. Ben Affleck continues to prove his detractors wrong with his amazing performance but Rosamund Pike is definitely the star here as the missing wife. This is definitely a film that left me pondering what had happened even as I left the cinema which is what really makes for a terrific movie for me.

            "content": "With a month to go until the awards season gets into full swing, Gone Girl becomes the clear front runner in filmgoers' minds as submission for nominations draws near. The impeccably-witty script, good performances by the cast and twist-after-twist-after-twist plotline makes it a serious contender for nominations in the picture, acting, and writing categories. \n\nThe plotline is simple. The disappearance of Elliot-Dune (Rosamund Pike) on the fifth wedding anniversary to husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) creates a media frenzy. The abrupt disappearance or abduction of Amy with no trace becomes national headlines as she is the basis for the famed fictional \"Amazing Amy\" children's book series. Suspicions soon follow that Affleck's character may have had something to do with the disappearance of Amy as a series of unusual coincidences follow as police begin their investigations. It is later revealed to the audience that Amy has faked her death and set up clues to frame her husband.\n\nWhat I found compelling about this picture is that it's a genius hustle attempt to get back at your cheating, controlling man. However, this isn't simply a man-hating film. True, Affleck's character has cheated on his wife with a much younger model (a student in fact) as a result of his wife's descending into a mental breakdown and social reclusiveness. This is no way an excuse, but sets the tone for how they're relationship will fan out throughout the film and why it has become so fractured. \nThe overarching theme of the picture is pursuing control or the lack of it. Amy's story has been written for her her whole life. She is synonymous with the \"goody-goody, wholesome\" image her parents created from her as the \"ideal little girl\" everyone wants in the Amazing Amy stories. When Amy feels entombed by the pretend character based on her life, she ensues in wanting to take \"Amazing Amy\" into a new direction and tell her own story. Her own destiny. Her way. \n\nAlthough clearly going about it the wrong way, Amy finally closes off the final chapter of the series. She is no longer perfect. She and her family have been through an awful experience and she is no longer \"Amazing Amy\".\n\nYou begin to follow the protagonist on her dark journey to self-proclamation. Albeit, the plotline is highly unrealistic, but it's also meant to be a thriller! And more importantly, it's a movie! It does what a thriller is supposed to do: enthral the audience to keep watching, and honestly, you can't stop watching. Director David Fincher's direction of the film leads us to a series of plot twists, confusion, and disbelief. But more importantly, we are lead to almost sympathise with Amy. She is damaged, she is hurt, she is a little crazy but should she be forgiven? By the end of the film, the world seems to have.\n\nRosamund Pike's incredible versatility is on true display as we are introduce the \"cool, collected\" Amy: a successful, strong-minded, independent businesswomen. But when the dawns of reality set knocking on her suburban door, she descends into a mental state of completely anarchy and irrationality. It's almost like Pike is essentially playing two entirely different characters in the film who are parallels apart in terms of mind-set, and her transition from one frame of mind to another is almost missable as she gradually transforms the poised businesswoman we see in New York to a frantic housewife pulling on the nation's heartstrings in the midst her disappearance. \n\nThere isn't a bad performance in this picture generally. The star of the picture is Affleck, but the stand out performance of the picture is Pike. The ability to go from stable, serene, frantic, crazy, delusional and pitiful in the space of two hours is very impressive and more importantly, it's genuinely believable. However, I did feel the performance of Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-lover who eventually saves her from being left penniless whilst on the run, added no value to the picture. He was not able to display the type of dominance or sense of control Affleck and Pike displayed so clearly throughout. Stick to the musicals and comedies, Neil! And dare I say it, I thought Tyler Perry's performance was almost a step back for improving the position of ethnic minorities in the film industry. It's almost as if they've hired a black actor to just provide a few comedic laughs in what is a dark, mysterious thriller. I'm not really sure where I stand on his performance, but I'll leave it at that. \n\nHowever, there is a disappointment to the film: the ending is bad. In fact, it's annoying. A general consensus amongst those I spoke to after the viewing. Both parties involved how clearly wronged each other, but Amy has deceived to the extent she has completely manipulated the mind of not only her husband, family and the media, but the theatre audience as a whole. Although we begin to sympathise with Amy's situation as the bored housewife, trapped and treated badly by her husband. Our shift in sympathy moves towards Affleck's character. He is trapped for the rest of his life by this manipulative woman and ultimately learns a sad lesson due to the consequences of his infidelity.",

The aftermath of this trendsetting thriller can impact abidingly on one's memory not only for its plot twist but also a brave ending which dares to defy the accepted mode of \"perpetrator gets punished in the end\", and intrigues viewers to inspect our own quotidian bearings and give an inscrutable glimpse to our partner.  \n\nAdapted from Gillian Flynn's bestseller of the same name, who is also the sole person credited for the screenplay here, so it secures there is no creative discordance as far as the storyline is concerned. GONE GIRL is already Fincher's highest grossing film in North America, surpasses THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008, 7/10)'s $127 millions record. It is also Fincher's third collaboration with Trent Reznor (from Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Boss, after THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010, 9/10) and THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011, 8/10). Prominently the duo's droning score conjures up an underplayed perturbing ambience which sits perfectly along Fincher's aloof palette and the central performances from Affleck and Pike. \n\ncontinue reading my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1FX",

I read the book, so I knew what was going to happen, but this movie was so well done that I wish I went in cold. \"Gone Girl\" is an intense psychological thriller with a pretty sarcastic and, I would say, cynical edge. At the very least, it's a great popcorn nailbiter and one loves seeing the devious villain's (who is it?!) scheme come to fruition. At its apex, dissects the notion of marriage and its relationship to social pressures. Couples are pushed to always display a happy face, and this is especially true in the hypersocial Facebook world we live in now, which actually plays quite a big part in the movie. What is love in a world where a couple doesn't just have a relationship with each other, but with everyone? In terms of its cinematic adaptation, I absolutely loved the use of color in the movie. Notice the use of blue and its association between Amy and control. Blue was present in love scenes, past scenes, and showed up constantly in the scenes where Amy's influence was playing an explicit or implicit role. I absolutely loved this visual contrast in the movie. Blue was used so g complexly - representing love and security, but also control and delusion. Maybe that's what love is? A mixture of control and delusion? How dark! In any case, \"Gone Girl\" was absolutely a delight to watch.",

Starring two major underrated stars, Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck (well not so much) and a strong supporting cast including Kim Dickens, Tyler Perry (just wait) and Neil Patrick Harris among others, the film has been both a commercial and critical success.\nThe film tells the story of how Nick Dunne (Affleck) got stuck in a messy situation on the search for his wife, Amy Dunne (Pike). Through a series of flashbacks and a string of events in the present day, the film slowly opens up about Nick and Amy's troubled relationship, that included Nick cheating on Amy, got fired, beaten down by the media and got suspected as the murderer. Now, this hasn't even got to the 1 hour mark, and that's just Nick's part of the story.\nHalfway through the film, the film made one of the most unexpected twists of the year, turning the narration into the hands of Amy. Turns out, Amy didn't get kidnapped or killed. She was alive and well (not necessarily that well). Amy, growing distressed of Nick's lazy lifestyle and unsatisfied of their misfired marriage, faked her own death in a carefully thought out plan which included: befriending the neighborhood's moron, orchestrating a fake crime scene, fake pregnancy, a game of Anniversary Treasure Hunt and a bloody disgusting pool of blood. So, 1 hour in the film, we had Amy called by the entire audience (this is the truth) a bitch. After getting robbed, Amy turned to her ex: Desi (Harris), which she claimed to have harrased and stalked her. Now I won't tell the rest of the film cause this is where it gets complicated and you would really want to watch it to believe it.\nIn my overall opinion, this is a flawless film. It had a great script, great score, brilliant acting, superb casting choices and David Fincher. It's basically Fight Club with an over obsessive and bitchy female character. The impressive thing is, it really managed to give each and every characters their own moment to develop and introduce themselves. Heck, even Tyler Perry was great as Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt (really). David Fincher did an amazing job in executing the book's parallel situations and hardcore sickness (which resembles Amy), partly because he had the writer of the book, Gillian Flynn as the writer of the film. \nHowever, the most amazing part in the film, would absolutely be Rosamund Pike. Being able to switch and portray a diversive and multi personality character is a hard thing to execute completely (unless you're Edward Norton, who couldn't get his sh*t completely together, as shown in Primal Fear and Fight Club). But Rosamund did a wonderful job in capturing the character's bitchy side and fully develop h? talent to 11. She gave her career best performance, and therefore, would be a fierce contender for an Oscar\nBest film of the year, yet. 100/100",

            "content": "Possibly, the most compelling reason to watch 'Gone Girl' in all its seriousness as a murder mystery is how it plays with your mind while being something else too. This isn't a reflection of today's society nor is it a thesis on failed marriages. Based on Gillian Flynn's popular novel and mostly adapted to screen by herself, this contemporary thriller is powered by a dueling narrative that doesn't permit the viewer to take sides for half the movie. Flynn's cinematic adaptation is smart and twisted enough for director David Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room', 'Girl with the Dragon tattoo') to delineate his nimble ability with dark thrillers. He then uses his experience of 'The Social Network' and 'House of Cards' to provide a riveting drama that revolves around some powerful characters who face precarious and changing circumstances, neither of which are favorable to them. \n\n\tOn the morning of their 5th anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home after sharing his sob story of a struggling marriage with his sister at their bar, only to learn of his wife Amy's (Rosamund Pike) mysterious disappearance. The lead detective's initial suspicions as well as the media's overbearing judgements quickly turn Nick into America's most hated man while he is still coming to term's with her disappearance. This is where the narrative draws excitement with its dual points of view. Nick's deeds and misdeeds provide one angle of what happens in the present while Amy's diary provides insight into their relationship and possibly, motive for her husband to have malcontent.\nThe element of intrigue generated by these parallel points of view is certainly a result of the synergies between Flynn and Fincher. As guilt, suspicion and negligence become matters of public opinion, media toys with their presentation just as the film's characters, the writer and director tend to manipulate with your interpretation of what really occurs. \nThe attitude of media and public might be the American way which seems overblown sometimes but the film doesn't propose absolute seriousness in that aspect anyway. Make no mistake, this is a commercial thriller and therefore, it does offer some cliches and some exaggerations. \n\n\tHurt by the recession and with their recent move to a small town from NYC, the Dunnes are having more than just financial struggles. Nick's inability to turnaround his career's slide frustrates Amy whereas the constant nagging by her draws him further away from their relationship. With his wife's disappearance, Nick's life not only takes a shocking turn but the constant limelight by the media and public makes it tremendously challenging for him to move on. However, Ben Affleck's brilliant performance doesn't let you determine Nick's sincerity in the scenario. Underneath all the charm and innocence, is there truly a motivated killer or is there another side to the story? \nAmy's sincere narrative quickly draws the viewer's empathy and Rosamund Pike's sincere portrayal of this smart and beautiful writer is delightful to watch. She undergoes transitions both emotionally and physically through the storyline which is yet another portrayal of her commitment to the character. \nThe supporting cast has some notable performances which include that of Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy first boyfriend, Carrie Coon as Nick's extremely supportive twin and Kim Dickens as the lead detective whose systematic approach to the case requires her to be stern yet thoughtful as the mystery unravels. \nBut with a commanding portrayal of the central character, Rosamund Pike leaves the lasting impression of surprise and delight about such underrated talent. \n\n\tApart from being a psychologically manipulative thriller, 'Gone Girl' is actually quite an entertainer. There are amusing moments that play in satirical fashion especially when the media and public are overly concerned about missing Amy and how soon they begin to judge Nick's involvement in the disappearance. Then there's Pike's performance that showcases Amy's quick-wit that gently leads to dark humor. While the film maybe a tad bit long, it doesn't lose its grip over your intrigue and that must be attributed to the adroitly written novel and screenplay by Gillian Flynn. 'Gone Girl' may not be an Academy Award contender nor will it make superhero kind of money at the box-office but after a long time, it will be the movie that thoroughly entertained with its darkness, wit and sincere performances. \n\n\t- 8.232 on a scale of 1-10.",

Many book to movie transitions do not work particularly well, and I actually believe that to some extent, this could be one of them. The novel was a fantastic read, and one that I managed to finish soon after starting it. Its layout and tension made it unique and exciting, but at the same ensured that nothing would be a surprise when I came to watch the film. If I were to reverse the order in which I read/ watched 'Gone Girl', my review may have been different.\n\nThe two sided diary arrangement to the movie was portrayed relatively well, although seemed to miss chunks of the book, despite being considerably lengthy. Each of Amy's clues and games could have been developed better, as it didn't come across quite as clever and twisted as it did in the book. We also have little exposure to two of the storyline's key characters - Boney and Gilpin. They should have been much more instrumental in the overall plot, undermining almost everything Nick said, whilst becoming genuinely troubled by the case that they were responsible for.\n\nThe dramatic twist was still managed to shock me. Artistic shots make this revelation attractive, as we delve into the second half of this arguably very two-sided arrangement. The film improves once this occurs, as the true state of Nick and Amy's relationship is fully revealed.\n\nThe ending is suitably creepy and mysterious, just as the book left it. I thoroughly enjoyed the ending, and appreciated the author's decision not to bow down to the pressure for a climatic ending. 'Gone Girl' remains an enjoyable and well directed watch, and I foresee people enjoying it more, should they not have read the book.",

Though Gone Girl has a completely different plot than Argo (2012) and Ben Affleck only stars in it didn't direct it I was a little hesitant to see the film due to the fact that I'm not really a fan of Ben Affleck and his work. I eventually just decided to rent the film and I am seriously happy I did. \n\nGone Girl is a dark, bizarre, and suspenseful film that takes the mystery genre to a whole new level. Gone Girl is a film that starts out kind of slow but as the film progresses you just can't help but watch. Ben Affleck actually really shines in this film as Nick Dunne, and though I'm not an Affleck fan I think its safe to say that they couldn't have picked a better person for the part. However though Affleck was amazing in the film the true star of the film was Rosamund Pike's performance as Amy, she absolutely blew me away, I've seen a lot of films before but let me tell you I don't think I've ever seen a performance by an actress that was as good as this one. Rosamund Pike will absolutely terrify you in this film as her performance as Amy, in my opinion she should have totally won an Oscar for her performance in this film. \n\nGone Girl is a breath of fresh air in the mystery genre, you will have so many questions through the entire film, and what I love about this movie is that all of your questions end up being answered. Another great thing about the film is that it goes in a completely different direction than you think its going in. Gone Girl is just a flat out breath taking film thats lead out by an excellent cast and amazing film director. I've always been a fan of David Fincher his films are just great and with Gone Girl he crafts one of his best films he's made, I can't wait to see what other films Fincher has coming up in the near future. However Gone Girl isn't for everyone, though the films great its still very disturbing and extremely bizarre, if you aren't fine with that stuff than the film isn't for you. But if you are fine with that and are tired of the same old cliche mystery film than watch Gone Girl, you will not be disappointed at all.",

            "content": "Gone Girl, a novel that has been adapted to film and is considered a well made date night thriller movie, is in theaters now.  The literature was published in June 2012 and was written and adapted by Gillian Flynn for the film, which was directed admirably by David Fincher.  The mystery and suspense in the book comes from the main protagonist, Nick Dunne and his involvement or not in the disappearance and possible murder of his wife, Amy Dunne.  Both main characters are out-of-work writers, which Flynn identified with due to her experience of being laid off from her job as a writer for one of the more popular entertainment magazines.\nThe novel tells a story of the marriage between Nick and Amy Dunne and the reasons for the difficulties they have experienced and why it appears to be falling apart.  The beginning of the book is told alternately by both Nick and Amy and in first person.  Amy's version deals with the past in her journal entries, while Nick's is told in the present. Their stories are different with Amy's account making her appear happier and easier to live with and shows Nick as more aggressive than he says he is.  Nick's version, however, talks about her as being stubborn and unfriendly, while he is not. After Nick loses his job, they move from New York City to his hometown of North Carthage, Missouri where they can help to care for his sick and dying mother.  Opening a bar with the last of his wife's trust fund, running it with his twin sister Margo, it offers a decent living for the three of them, but Nick and Amy's marriage falls apart more quickly.  Amy, unfortunately, hates living in Missouri preferring to have the life she lived in New York City.\nNick becomes the prime suspect in her disappearance.  He used her money, increased her life insurance policy, and comes across as very unemotional in the news; plus, boxes are found of pornography in his woodshed that helps the police to suspect him even further. In the next section of the novel, we find out more about each of them.  Nick has been having an affair and Amy, presumed dead, is alive and in hiding, while she is trying to frame Nick for her demise.  Her diary found by the police is a fake and written exclusively to implicate Nick to them.  The reader learns that Amy is robbed by guests in the motel that she is hiding in and she is left without any money.  She elicits help from a previous boyfriend, Desi, who hides her, but entraps her in his house as he becomes more possessive.  Unable to deal with him and his behavior, she murders Desi and returns home to her husband, telling the public and police that she had been kidnapped by Desi.  Nick believes and is certain that Amy is a killer, but he remains in the marriage because she announces that she is pregnant with his child.  The ending of the novel shows the reader Amy writing that she is about to give birth to her son, and has written a book about her abduction and imprisonment.  Nick had also begun to write his book exposing Amy's lies, but decided against it when Amy revealed that she was pregnant and he wanted a child.\nRecognizable in the literature which was carried over into the film are the themes of dishonesty, media misrepresentation, appearances, and the economy's effects on marriage.\nThe film stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, Rosemont Pike as Amy Dunne, with Neil Patrick Harris as Desi Collings, Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt (Nick's attorney), and Carrie Coon as Margo Dunne, Nick's twin sister.  Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Casey Wilson, Missy Pyle, Seal Ward, Emily Ratajkowski, Kathleen Perkins, Lisa Banes, and David Clennon round out the admirable supporting cast. \nThe film is a close adaptation of the literature where most if not all the story elements have been kept in the movie, which opens on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary, where Nick comes home finding that his wife is missing.  Suspicions arise that Nick has murdered her and his behavior in the media is misinterpreted.  We learn that their marriage has fallen apart with both of them losing their jobs due to the recession and have had to move from New York City to Missouri to look after Nick's dying mother.  Desponded, Nick has become lazy, distant, and unfaithful.  The lead detective, Rhonda Boney, uncovers evidence that point to financial troubles, domestic arguments, and a report where Amy wanted to buy a gun.  We learn as with the book that Amy has faked her death, framing Nick for his infidelity.  She changes her appearance and hides at a campground where she is robbed of all her money forcing her to contact her wealthy former boyfriend Desi to come save her.  She convinces Desi that she fears for her life from Nick and he decides to hide her in his lake house, in essence, trapping her there for his own needs.\nNick hires Tanner Bolt to help improve his public image.  Andie, Nick's student and mistress, reveals their affair at a press conference. Then Nick appears on a talk show and apologizes for his failures as husband, but he is not a murderer.  This appearance improves his image and somehow rekindles Amy's feelings for him.  She seduces Desi, slices his throat and returns home covered in blood, claiming that Desi kidnapped and raped her, clearing Nick of any and all suspicion in her disappearance.  It is here that she tells him the truth and that she wants him back.  Nick tells the detective, the attorney and his sister, but he has no way to prove Amy's guilt. Planning to leave her and exposing her crimes, she tells him that she is pregnant.  He becomes violent, but feels responsible for the child.  He decides to remain with Amy and they announce to the world via a television interview that they are expecting a child.\nI love a film adaptation that stays so true to the literature's themes, storyline, plot, characters and dialog which this movie does and does very well that all the essential narrative and core elements are successful interpreted for the viewing pleasure of the audience it is intended for.  The visual elements incorporated in this film are used to highlight the story and plot and are used wonderfully.  The overall cinematography (the film was primarily shot in Missouri) handled by Jeff Cronenweth, was done well and complimented the theme of the recession in Middle America.  Fincher's use of close-ups were expertly handled emphasizing the emotional drama of the story.  He started the film with the same scene that he ended the movie which tied the entire film together.  The framing, editing (by Kirk Baxter), dialog, music (by Reznor and Ross), and acting were all well done. \nThis is a well made movie, and I recommend it not as a date night movie, but as a well constructed mystery/thriller for anyone who enjoys that particular genre.  Kudos to Reese Witherspoon and her production company for bringing this book to the screen.",

            "content": "For more reviews, visit www.bemovieseemovie.com.\n\nDavid Fincher is one of the most talented and stylized directors working today. His movies, no matter the subject matter, elevate whatever source material Fincher is given with technical excellence. Ben Affleck smartly left the direction of Gone Girl to Fincher, who, like the main couple in the story, seems a little too perfect for the part. Gone Girl in the wrong hands would be a cheap whodunit, but in Fincher's, it is a dark, haunting tale that punches viewers in the gut. Especially anyone on the Eagle Forum.\n\nI'd go into Gone Girl cold, so SPOILER ALERT AHEAD if you plan on seeing it. On paper, Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne are a run of the mill happy couple. Until the 5th of July, when Nick returns home to find Amy missing. Nick calls the police, and detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) immediately start to see some issues with Nick's story. Why does Nick not know if his wife has friends? Why is blood left around the house in weird spots? In addition, Amy's public past leads the press to jump all over the story, leading Nick into being the fall guy. With nowhere else to go, Nick moves in with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) to try to clean up this mess and figure out what the hell happened to his wife.\n\nFincher's handprints are all over Gone Girl, even though Gillian Flynn adopted her own novel. The sets all feel like dream sequences. Perfect house. Perfect kitchen. Perfect bedsheets. However, Fincher shoots a look of peek around doorway shots, and coupled with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score, Gone Girl feels off and disquiet. Early on, Fincher establishes that these two are writers, and gives us hints of their inner monologues. Smartly, the voice overs have this artificial quality, as if their words don't quite match the story they are telling; when the real world comes crashing back in, the voices go back to normal. These little touches subtly compound to immerse Gone Girl in unease and unreliability, even before the story kicks in.\n\nGillian Foley's screenplay of her book contains a strong combination of pointed commentary and zig-zag storytelling. The central mystery of Amy's disappearance gets solved about an hour in, but that hour spends its time using media and well-conceived perception to paint a picture of how events went down and who is to blame for the disappearance. Gone Girl then goes on for another hour and a half, but that time is used by letting the reverberations of the big reveal force the main characters to reshape the story to gain the upper hand and find a way out of the precarious situation they all find themselves in. Using media to change a narrative gives Gone Girl a freshness and relevant take on the thriller.\n\nBen Affleck had me worried for a second. Acting isn't his best profession in the movies (Writer/Director better suit him), and he has every right to coast on his Oscar and Batman moniker. However, Affleck inhabits the everyman Nick Dunne quite smoothly. With all due respect to the new Caped Crusader, Rosamund Pike is the best masked figure. Pike gives Amy an ephemeral quality in every scene she is in; at any point I had no idea where her head was and what Amy's endgame was going to be. Pike effortlessly transitions between sexpot, forlorn wife, and D-lister which Gone Girl requires her to play. Tyler Perry gets to take off a wig and elevate the material as a high powered lawyer of Nick's. Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon, and Kim Dickens are also very good in supporting roles.\n\nGone Girl is NOT a date movie. The story is pretty dark and out on the pains of being married. Mental and physical infidelity is everywhere. And nihilism and self-interest permeate through David Fincher's direction. If any of you who went on a first date to see Fincher's Social Network, make sure you pick another Fincher movie to propose at.",

            "content": "I like David Fincher a lot and he's made some brilliant films over his career, including some of my personal favourites (Zodiac) and I was looking forward to seeing Gone Girl for a long time.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. \n\nThis isn't Fincher's best by a long way, but I don't think that's his fault, as he does his job as a filmmaker as well as he normally does. It's the source material that I didn't like.  Now, admittedly, I haven't read the novel this is based on, so perhaps the filmmakers took some creative license and changed a lot of things in terms of the areas of the story I didn't like, so if that's the case, the blame lies with them.  However since I don't know either way, I'm going to have to assume the narrative of the novel wasn't altered too much. \n\nAs you'd expect from a David Fincher film, it looks great, the cast does a good job overall and it holds your attention pretty effortlessly. Unfortunately I only liked half of this film. \n\nThe first half was engrossing!  I was invested in the mystery and the portrayal of media sensationalism around the case was brilliantly done. In fact, that was the thing I liked about the movie the most, how the news media and bias, agenda driven panel shows turn real life cases into personal witch hunts. Yet, when the twist is revealed halfway through, I pretty much lost interest because the focus of the story switched massively to something that didn't excite me.\n\nPersonally, I found the whole thing too far fetched and the downward spiral of a second half was very disappointing.  It turns into a bit of a character study of someone who, shall we say, is a few puppets short of a Punch & Judy set.  There's a few cliches and a couple of \"Oh come onnnn\" moan and groan moments.  This may be entertaining and attractive who live for \"head fucks\" in films, but I've seen a few too many similar things before and feel a bit ripped off with how the film drew to a close.  For what it's worth though, the first half of the film is excellent.   \n\nOverall, Fincher hasn't hurt his film-making reputation as all of his strengths are there, but the story really let me down in the second half as the attention shifted too far away from the element that was grabbing me.\n\nI wanted to like it more, but I felt a bit empty by the end.",

            "content": "We get caught up in the whole idea of thrill rides when we talk about the soundbites that come from merchandising films, especially in the last decade or so. We're promised a roller coaster, but we get the usual, mundane drive to work that we've seen time and again. In Gone Girl we get the opposite. What starts out as your typical Lifetime movie fodder suddenly slams on the brakes and becomes something original in that it takes our emotions on the thrill ride that we're always promised, but rarely receive.\n\nNick Dunne (Ben Affleck) leads a mundane life with his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) in South Eastern Missouri. After a pedestrian encounter with his twin sister (Carrie Coon) discussing the chore that going thru the game that has become their anniversary has become, Nick returns home to find his wife missing and the signs of something being afoot. Cue the impending investigation, the secrets that Nick and his wife hold close to their chest, and the transformation from helpless victim to heinous villain and back again. \n\nGone Girl is a difficult movie to discuss with someone who hasn't seen the film because you lose the central pivot of the film that everything is centered on. Just as with his previous work, David Fincher has chosen to take us on a ride where we think we know where the hell we're going, but the bus took a right instead of a left and takes us to a shocking new direction that delights us because we just don't know what's going to happen next. That's what makes a movie great- it takes us somewhere we've never been before.\n\nAnother aspect of Gone Girl is the way it manipulates the audience and the commentary that this makes with society today, in particular reality television. I can't really call it a commentary. It's more like a metaphysical conversation with the way people turn on a dime emotionally on the screen and the way our emotions as an audience are twisted. You will wonder how gullible these people are, being told how to feel by the talking heads on the television, all the while you're making your decisions on how you feel about the characters based on what you see on the screen. Your feelings for these characters will change more than once as the movie progresses and it's great. It's wonderful to have a film that doesn't have characters that fit right into their cookie cutter positions. It's even better when they can't figure out which little slot they belong in, either.\n\nDavid Fincher has delivered another masterpiece that can be considered a thrill ride. The audience is emotionally whipped around on his Gone Girl roller coaster, the main difference being that you don't see the curves coming or the big drops that cause our hearts to race and adrenaline to flow. They're just dropped on you. It's like a sunny day after a week of rain. You've almost forgotten what a great film looks like.",

This time it's a story of the disappearance of Ben Affleck's wife and whether he was responsible...a typical cop drama plot.  Of course, all is not as it seems and Fincher takes us on a journey, slowly peeling back the dirty layers of the two main characters.  The actors do a good job, the writing is mostly sharp with subtle dark humour.  The first 2/3s of the movie are fascinating then things go a bit off-kilter...stretching believability.  Other problems include twists that we're all getting used to from most TV cop shows.  Not one of Fincher's strongest efforts but still worth a look.",

It's undeniably entertaining to see a craftsman such as Fincher explore Flynn's thesis by way of rollicking popcorn cinema. Superbly cast from the two at the top to the smallest speaking parts, impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to within an inch of its life, Gone Girl shows the remarkable things that can happen when filmmaker and material are this well matched. Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, Gone Girl plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Gone Girl is not Fincher's best film, nor is it the most conventionally satisfying of them, but it feels like this is a movie that represents the very best that Hollywood craft can offer at the moment. The editing, with so many twists and turns and so many supporting characters needing their due, is without hiccups. And thankfully, there's plenty of dark humor. A sharply made, perfectly cast and unfailingly absorbing melodrama. But, like the director's adaptation of another publishing phenomenon, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, three years ago, it leaves you with a quietly lingering feeling of: \"Is that all there is?\"\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent... (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

So, for first intention, you may want to absorb all kind of details, clues, create your version, but you want to be surprised...and you wont feel dissapointed. So, what it comes to mind, the film is set you as crime story but the movie goes on and on and you're are fascinated for the turning points. At the end you'll have the sensation, the film is much more than a crime scene, a thriller or a drama. It's a cojunction of the three, the film wants to show more that meets the eye. It's a meditation of a way of living, a description of our current society. Full of fake designers, full of epicene versions of life. The movie wants you to know a radical case of how the choose in our lives can takes us to horrible experiences.\n\nNow, talking about  technnical aspects; the direction by David Fincher is absolutely great,  he really get you inside the head of the characters and masterfully put in the same room, a big bunch of elements to get an story than maybe is simple in the surface, but it becomes deep in the subtext. These also is well achieved by the genious edtion that always show the audiences the essential to be more involved in the story.

            "content": "David Fincher's Gone Girl is a brilliant piece of filmmaking that boasts a stunning story with an exceptional performance by Ben Affleck. What is great is that Affleck in the last few years is really delivering some solid performances, but in Gone Girl, he delivers his finest performance yet. Gone Girl is a vivid, thrilling drama that is both poignant and riveting from start to finish. The film's plot steadily unfolds in a way that you are slowly sucked into the web of tension that Fincher brilliantly unfolds. I love his work, and I would say that this is his finest film since Zodiac. Here he directs a film that is unlike any other film in his filmography. This picture grabs your attention, and doesn't let go until the final visceral frame. With a steady vibe of tension that really keeps you engaged into the film. Brilliant acted and directed, Gone Girl is one is one of the year's finest pictures, and with that being said, I would go to say that Gone is among my favorites this year, and that's saying a lot considering there has been so many great films, but Gone Girl is a film that really struck a nerve to the point where you're speechless at what you're seeing in front of you. Fincher directs this film as if he is directing a riot, what I mean by that is, is that the film feels like controlled chaos and in that regard, the film is a prime example of an unflinching masterwork that just stays with you long after the credits roll. David Fincher has made great films during his career, but Gone Girl is most likely going to be seen as one of his finest. Brilliantly acted, directed and constructed in terms of sheer mystery and thrills, this is one of the most engaging thrillers of the year, if not the genre.",

He changes in every scene (this is to supposedly keep us off balance - what it is, is a truly hack trick so that we won't know what's going on). Ahhh, but we do what is going on...the film is trying to trick us into what we think is going on. OOOHH...at one moment it's a LIFETIME movie about scummy men who eventually get their come-uppance....then it's a social satire on our ridiculous obsession with the media and the crimes they cover...and then, 2 HOURS and 45 MINUTES later....it's what we knew all along. Everybody is screwed up. Some more than others. What starts out as Affleck hiding all of his emotions, ends up with us realizing he is overhamming his part and overplaying his hand (dealt to him by the screenplay, no doubt).  There is no subtlety here. Only confusion. Like...how did the \"missing\" wife gain 30 lbs in 5 days and then lose it all back in another 30? But, more importantly, how is this film even getting 88/90% good feedback on Rotten Tomatoes? There were a lot of disgruntled patrons in the shitter at my local theater. Maybe, I am wrong. Or maybe, Rotten Tomatoes is pumping the numbers up for America's reborn thesbian. Welcome Back Affleck! You're not in Argo of The Town, anymore! Granted, in those places you, at least, had a script to work with. This is now, officially, one of two movies that has compelled me to flip off the movie screen as credits rolled. The other being, A Separation, the Iranian film that won the Best Oscar for foreign film in 2012. Both movies are a bigger Turd than Bono. And that is 14 courics.",

The girl can act and gave a brilliant performance in a movie that demanded so much from its lead actress.  Now to Ben Affleck, what can I say, it was another Affleck performance.  I mean no matter what kind of performance or emotions the part requires, you can guarantee that Ben Affleck will deliver the same exact reaction that he does in all his movie, the same old I don't know if Ben is happy, sad, mad or what...How do you like them apples.  OK I promised, enough about how terrible of an actor Affleck is and the fact that I want to kill myself every time Affleck is mentioned as the NEW Batman, I wanted to point out that even with Affleck's expected horrible performance, Gone Girl is a good flick to catch.  Rosamund Pike's performance was brilliant, surprising and to the point and David Fincher delivers as always.  I will say, Gone Girl is not Fincher's best work (I thought Fight Club, Seven, Benjamin Button and Social Network was much better) but Gone Girl is still good and is worth being checked out.

David Fincher has crafted a grasping and intelligent film that truly defies most films of the same genre. With a great performance from Ben Affleck the idea of the reality of the American Family and also in portraying the media's fixation on blood and murder, Gone Girl succeeds, story and visually wise, in nearly every way. However to me the most demanding and evidently perfect piece of this film was Rosamund Pike's truly gripping performance and the films ability to twist this films from being a mystery to a full on dramatic thriller. Without allowing for spoilers, Pike performance comes completely out of the blue and shatters the audiences first impressions of the character to the point where mouths will open in gasps at her characters actions and Pikes perfected delivery. While the duration may run too long, Gone Girl can truly change the common mystery genre as Gillian Flynn's screenplay presents beautiful dialogue, development and most importantly twists and turns making Gone Girl one of the most inviting and groundbreaking thrillers yet!",

            "content": "Gone Girl is a beautifully filmed movie.  The atmosphere of most scenes seem to line up perfectly with David Fincher's style.  Frankly, if you've seen other Fincher movies you know what to expect here in both atmosphere and tone.  Ben Affleck was allowed to basically play another version of Ben Affleck, so his lack of acting talent didn't detract from the story most of the time.  Rosamund Pike is beautiful and perfectly executes her role.  Easily, the biggest surprises were Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry.  NPH only reminded me of Barney (from How I Met Your Mother) for a few moments, otherwise he had this really unsettling aura that caused him to steal every scene he appeared in.  And who would have thought there would be a film where I actually liked Tyler Perry?  He was charming, witty, and I couldn't get enough of his character.  So I loved the cast, I loved the cinematography, what caused my rating to be so mediocre?  Well, that's all story-related, and I can't talk about that without hitting on some major spoilers...\n\nI didn't know the entire plot going into this film, so I was surprised a couple times, but I had heard someone describe Rosamund Pike's character as \"evil\" and that one word was enough to kind of ruin the ride for me.  Not for one moment was I convinced that Nick was guilty, because I knew she was doing something nasty to him.  Instead I just labored through the story waiting for the truth to be revealed.  Luckily that was about halfway through the film, so it wasn't like someone spoiling the Sixth Sense, there was still some movie left to enjoy.  And the story did continue to take more jarring twists, and it kept me guessing.  What I struggled with was the story structure.  It felt like there were so many details (to the point of being overkill) that they included to point the finger at Nick.  It's as if the writer and director had a checklist, as long as Amy had in the movie, of all these points they had to establish.  So we had to keep bouncing from one scene to the next, just piling on all these little details that make him look more and more guilty.  It made the film seem excessively long and I kept wanting to look at the clock to see how much longer it would go on.\n\nThen there was the strange editing of the film.  There were a couple of moments that appeared to be spliced together in the wrong order.  The most blatant was the scene where Tanner Bolt advises Nick that he needs to tell the police about his affair and the items in the shed.  Yet many scenes pass and then later the police find out about these things on their own.  If the editor had just put the reveal scenes of these facts closer to the moment when Nick was given the advice it would feel like Nick was just too late, instead it feels like they ignored Bolt's advice.  But, by far, the biggest issue I have with this film is the ending.  I cannot fathom the final state of affairs as they are presented to us.  They never for a moment establish Nick as someone who would enjoy this artificial relationship.  They go out of the way to make us first question him, but then totally sympathize with him.  Then in the closing scenes he becomes this strange mutant that is incomprehensibly unsympathetic.  What we are left with are 2 primary characters that defy all human logic and feel like they were grown in some type of alien pod.\n\nDespite all this negative stuff I've spelled out, I can't help giving Gone Girl some credit.  For at least an hour afterwards my wife and I were discussing the details of the story.  Any film that has a plot with that much intrigue, which keeps my mind engaged long after I walk out of the theater at least has something positive going for it.  I might not have enjoyed all the details, but there was enough in there that I was compelled to write one of my longest reviews ever.",

            "content": "Over the last two decades, David Fincher has directed what I consider to be three modern classics - 'Fight Club', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' and 'The Social Network'. Yet, unless he changes direction significantly, he will probably be remembered for the dark, sleek thrillers that he seems to be able to produce at will. And what a filmography he has amassed in the genre - 'The Game', 'Se7en', 'Panic Room', 'Zodiac', and 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' all rank among the best suspense films to come out of mainstream Hollywood in recent years.\n\nNow we have another excellent addition to that catalog. The wicked 'Gone Girl' is a delicious missing-persons mystery based on the best-seller by Gillian Flynn of the same name. I haven't read the much-praised source novel, but I imagine that having Flynn adapt her own work for the screen has led to a faithful adaptation. Her screenplay does an excellent job of running a gauntlet of twists while still maintaining plausibility. Under Fincher's masterful eye, it is transformed into an atmospheric and enticing ride.\n\nThe acting must also be praised. Ben Affleck, now uniformly respected as a director, seems to be on a mission here to regain his acting cred. I suspect this was a shrewd bit of casting - the woodenness that Affleck has so often been blasted for works as a blessing here, in a role defined by its striking ambiguity - a man who may or may not be involved with his wife's disappearance. The film constantly asks us to guess the truth that lies underneath that smooth face. When called upon to disrupt that brooding smoothness, Affleck more than delivers, showing flashes of intensity that should go some way towards allaying fears about his ability to play his, ahem, next major film role. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Carrie Coon in particular doing a tremendous job as Ben Affleck's twin sister. But of course, 'Gone Girl' wouldn't work without the Girl, and Rosemund Pike is a revelation as the woman at the center of it all. Ever since she became a Bond girl, she has been stuck with a succession of eye-candy gigs, and I'd never have pegged her for a role like this one. Hopefully, Gone Girl will Go places now.",

And believe me, these are all good things. This is a conversation starter, one that can and will last for hours on end.\n\nFirst, the story. In short, expect the unexpected. Fincher provides a style of thriller that you will not find anywhere else. Quite frankly, I wish to see more films like this: twisted and fun. The ending will leave many viewers unsatisfied, but I see it as a the best of both worlds, leaving some holes for the audience to fill.\n\nNext the acting performances. Ben Affleck plays an excellent spurned husband, but Rosamund Pike is the shining star in what is a mostly dark and gloomy film. Her voiceover and her transformations drive the change throughout the plot, and anything less would ruin the success of the film. It is a bravura performance that should be remembered. The supporting performances from a varied group - including a delightful Tyler Perry - are also very strong, and complete a very well rounded cast. \n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the soundtrack. Ever since The Social Network, I have followed the musical pairing of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and they do an equally wonderful job on Gone Girl. Ethereal but striking when necessary, it pairs the action wonderfully. Unlike the marriage depicted onscreen, the film is made up of many great pairings: Fincher and Flynn, music and story, style and substance.",

All of the acting is absolutely brilliant. This movie grabs your attention in every way imaginable. As a matter of fact the very first line Ben Affleck had to say intrigues you. The best part of this movie is David Fincher. He once again made a movie where you can just put your eyes on one screen for 2 hr 25 min. I mean again with this freaking guy. This movie to me anyway had no draggy moments. Your watching it and you want nothing to distract you. But I can't give all the credit to David. The acting is incredible. But I gotta say don't going into it expecting a Ben Affleck movie. No no... This is Rosamund Pike's movie from start to finish. Her character was so twisted but so interesting at the same time. And Rosamund Pike was perfect for the role. She honestly delivers an Oscar worthy performance. The movie keeps taking you on directions you don't expect to happen at all. Several time actually. And it could get annoying but the way this movie was written made it extremely interesting to watch. \n\n  The only problem I had with this movie was Neil Patrick Harris.

It's perhaps the best movie I've seen this year.\n\nFifteen minutes into the movie I thought it was going to be just another crime thriller with some clever twists and surprises, but which would never get us deep into the minds of the characters. I was wrong. The movie started becoming more and more, taking us into the minds of the main characters, and taking into its scope subjects like domestic violence, marriage, class, the city/rural divide, mass media, and law enforcement. \n\nBut while the movie takes us into the minds of the characters, it's hard for us to sympathise with them. They are not rounded, multi-faceted, realistic human beings. They have rather bizarre thoughts and are motivated by bizarre desires that we cannot really make sense of. (The girl seems to be motivated by some vague desire to control and punish, while the guy was so naive and yielding it's hard to understand why.) This must take away from the movie's value somewhat.\n\nBut I don't think the movie aims to be realistic. The movie doesn't try to observe or illuminate as much as to satirise. First it satirises types of people - like rich white American parents using their kids as their own publicity platform. But it also pokes at some social norms - e.g. the practice of having relatives of crime victims make emotional speeches at police press conferences, society's weak spot with pregnant women and rape victims, the bizarre enormous influence of TV show hosts, the role of lawyers as personal lobbyists and spin doctors. It does all this without dropping its dark, serious tone.\n\nOverall, an excellent movie (8/10). I do recommend it.",

Oh, we're chess pieces...pieces in a intricate game planned from the outset by two master players. Director David Fincher knows how to frame a thrilling Who-Done-It, building suspense in slow burn reveals through steady tracking shots and tight editing. Here, however, he relies strictly on these substantive devices without the stylistic tics evident in his other dark mysteries, Se7en and The Girl on the Dragon Tattoo. As always, his film boasts some downright amazing photography. Teetering between a romantic shadowy glow and sobering white light, Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography beautifully betrays a contrast between the loving and loathing days of a marriage gone wrong. It comes down to story. In adapting her bestselling novel, Gillian Flynn retains some intriguingly complex characters while maintaining the narrative tension.\n\nIn this R-rated mystery, a husband (Affleck) sees the media circus spotlight shift to him when its suspected that he might be a player in his wife's (Pike) disappearance. \n\nThankfully, Fincher chose two brilliant actors in Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike to realize Flynn's flawed, unreliable, and, at times, highly unlikeable characters. Then, there's supporting players Neil Patrick Harris, Casey Wilson, and Tyler Perry. Sure it's stunt casting, but its really GREAT stunt casting that informs the story's dark corners. If only all of these great choices amounted to more reward than remorse. The end of the novel takes a definite stand; the end of the film leaves it up to the audience. It's a smart choice but doesn't make the conclusion any less of a bummer. \n\nBottom line: Good Will Stumping",

This is probably the best mystery/drama/suspense movie that I've seen in the past few years. Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies of 2014.",

Plus, it's a David Fincher film, who is my all-time favorite director, so there was no way I was going to miss it. And once again, he doesn't disappoint. This is one of the best suspense thriller/mysteries I have ever seen. Fincher is a master filmmaker, a true legend in his own time, he is such a great storyteller and all of his films are impeccably made. The film has his signature style and dark tone AND has a fantastic story at its base, so it's the perfect storm of film: both entertaining and beautiful. Rosamund Pike is getting high praise for her performance in this movie, and I can see why, she is mesmerizing in this role. The supporting cast is great too, and even Ben Affleck turns in a solid performance (I only noticed his Affleckery a few times), though I think casting him in this part was a bit of a misstep, he's just too likeable for this character. Anyway, it's how the mystery unfolds that is what makes this movie so good. The story is told so precisely, revealing just enough new information at regular intervals to keep you completely engrossed from start to finish. And what a finish it is, it's completely unexpected and leaves you feeling... well I won't say. No spoilers! Suffice it to say that all I could do when the credits rolled was keep repeating \"That is fucked up.\" This film is haunting, twisted, funny, super smart, and deeply unsettling on many levels.... and is one of the best films of the year. Score another one for the Finch! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for him at the Oscars this year...",

This cast should definitely win the SAG other Academy's Best Ensemble award. This movie is fantastic in all aspects. It is fun, dark, hilarious and often very sadistic and cynical. I liked Social Network, really liked Dragon Tattoo and Benjamin Button was ok but this is Fincher's best film since Fight Club, easy. I have long believed Ben Affleck was better than the criticism he receives. It seemed it took the world forever to get over Bennifer and the train wreck that was Gigli and he may have made a few bad choices in the scripts he chose, but he has steadily been building his cred back up starting, in my opinion, with Hollywoodland. An excellent performance playing the man who played Superman, George Reeves and then went on to direct 3 critically lauded films with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and Best Picture winner Argo. He belongs behind the camera but that doesn't mean he can't act. He's still wonderful at that too. Rosamund Pike has been teetering on the edge of stardom for about 10 years now. She works often but nobody really knows her name even if they know her angelic face. Anonymity is no longer an option for you, Ms Pike, however that angelic face makes your performance in this flick that much more haunting. She is terrific. There is almost two movies here, like his and hers towels, but it's not so much told from one perspective than the other, it's more than that. The entire supporting cast is wonderful especially Carrie Coon and NPH but the standout to me was Tyler Perry as charismatic lawyer Tanner Bolt. I confess I have not seen much of Tyler Perry's stuff but I haven't been much of a fan of what I have seen. However, he upped his cool points by being in Star Trek and now I am a fan of his acting. I loved this movie. Guadians, Apes and Gone Girl are my favorite movies this year but Gone Girl is my early pick for Best Picture at the Oscars.",

Whether it is a story about a man with split personalities (\"Fight Club\")  or the  creator of a daily computer application  (\"The Social Network\")  or a stupid room to hide from some dim-witted thieves (\"Panic Room\"),  Fincher has not steered me wrong yet. \n\"Gone Girl,\" Fincher stated, delves into a best-seller by Gillian Flynn as the main thrust of the story.  First off, I did not read the book.  \nAny movie, however, should stand on its own two feet.\nThe storyline centers on a caring husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck, (\"Good Will Hunting,\" \"Argo\") who is looking for his missing wife Amy (Rosamund Pike, \"Die Another Day,\" \"Jack Reacher\").  \nThe consensus is that he killed her and hid the body.\nBoth Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) of  (\"Hollow Man,\" \"Mercury Rising\") and Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) (\"Almost Famous,\" \"We Bought a Zoo\") are assigned to the case of  Dunne and the missing wife.  \nBoney thinks he is guilty as all get out while Fugit's officer Gilpin emigrates toward reasonable doubt.  This aspect takes part of center stage for a little bit, but then Fincher turns the flick into a giant shuffleboard table.\nIn an odd casting twist, Tyler Perry is an attorney who only takes on the big, high-profile litigations.  Think back to the day of Johnny Cochran and the O.J. Simpson trial where the football player was accused of murdering his then wife.\nPerry, better known as the Madea persona from a slew of his feel-good family flicks has a whole new identity as attorney Tanner Bolt.  Like his forgettable turn as the title character in \"Alex Cross,\" Perry exudes the hard-nosed lawyer through and through.\nNeil Patrick Harris has a significant supporting role as Desi \nCollings, an old on-again off-again squeeze of Amy's. He has an elaborate plan for keeping her safe.\nThis one has an interesting twist a la an old school femme fatale element thrown into the stew.  \nI, of course, am talking about Amy Dunne, who turns out to be a real witch in the end game.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrade:  B-",

I'm not kidding. I have no clue what BIG twists and turns anyone is referring to - where were they? The characters themselves bore little resemblance to any real character types. Toward the end, a main character is drenched in blood and somehow is checked in then out of a hospital with not an ounce of that blood having been wiped away so that the blood would be available to heighten the next scene - like any very bad B-movie.

Her husband of five years (Ben Affleck) seems to be genuinely confused and concerned, but in this day and age of 24-hour news coverage, you know that every secret and speck of dirt is going to be scrutinized and presented to the public.  This is based on a very popular book that I still have to pick up; it's been universally praised, and if it reads anything like this twisty screenplay, I can totally see why.  Now I do NOT want to be the one that spoils anything about this; so much of the enjoyment comes from you building your own case as the clues are presented to you, so I will steer clear of specifics.  You do your own detective work to solve this mystery, and this is the type of material that director David Fincher is a master at handling.  It is in the same vein of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Zodiac, but I would say he outdoes those movies, and I would even go so far to say that this is his fourth best film overall.  That's how good of a filmmaker he is; his fourth best movie is a shoo-in to be in my top five for the year, if not top three.  He's just so good at crafting movies, and if you're the kind of person that seeks out critically-acclaimed Oscar films, you don't need to wait for the nominations to be released, you can just go ahead and buy your ticket.  Even the simple camera shots are stellar and you can tell that a lot of care went into every single piece of this film.  The editing does a great job at balancing the present media circus with the past diary entries, and you quickly find out that there is a lot more going on here than meets the eye; the more facts and details get presented, the more difficult it gets to remain objective, and when you get to the reveal, it is as effective as can be.  It's almost like this is two movies for the price of one; when I watched this and got to that aforementioned reveal, my fianc\u00e9 glanced at her phone, leaned over and whispered to me, \"There's still an hour left.\"  It really could have ended right there and it would have been completely satisfying.  However, there's much more story to tell, and being that I was so into it, I'm glad it continued on because I wanted to see more.  While I personally appreciate the following, you may want to be aware of this going in: it gets overwhelming.  The situation itself keeps snowballing, getting worse and worse, and it's a similar sensation to watching Gabriel Byrne in Miller's Crossing; the deck is stacked against this guy so much, you have no idea how it's going to be possible for him to keep his head above water.  That said, it's not all like that, and you do get well placed moments of humor to give you relief from all the tension.  The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is very effective (I don't think they outdo the Social Network, though).  It's so tight that you don't feel the length... well, for the most part; I started to feel it when it started entering the final epilogue chapter, but that may be because my bladder was about to burst, as I didn't want to miss a moment of this.  This is dark, brooding, and skillfully crafted, features biting commentary on today's obsessive media coverage and succeeds at every turn.",

            "content": "Gone Girl is the latest film from David Fincher who's made such movies as Se7en and Fight Club. It's been one of the most anticipated films of the year and has been quite a success already. The popularity of the book it's based on is the primary reason for all the anticipation.\n\nBen Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a man who lets you know right at the beginning of the film that he's not happy about his relationship with his wife at all. But one day he comes home to find out she's gone missing. Detectives hop on the scene to find out if she's just missing or in fact dead. And it doesn't take very long for them to start wondering if Nick actually killed his wife himself. The problems with their marriage and the high amount of money the wife is worth give Nick enough of a motive to be considered a primary suspect.\n\nI recalled hearing the story has a big twist, which I assumed to be at the end of the film. The main twist, or at least the answer to what happened to the wife, is actually revealed about halfway through. So once that is shown, you wonder what else the film has left to offer or surprise you with. Well I can't say I was very satisfied with the note it does end on. The movie is well-made and all the actors are terrific in it though. It's an intriguing premise and Ben Affleck certainly carries most of the scenes as he struggles with not only what's happened with his wife but also all the media attention and scrutiny aimed at him due to it becoming a high-profile national case. Supporting roles by Neil Patrick Harris as a former lover of the wife and Tyler Perry as Nick's Johnny Cochran-like lawyer are especially good. The same goes for Rosamund Pike as the wife herself.\n\nBut ultimately once all is done and explained, the details are a bit implausible and it's hard to imagine everything really being pulled off that occurs in the film. Basically, it's a suspenseful film throughout but leaves you feeling kind of empty inside. It could be a case of not living up to the hype, but this is more about not having a satisfying conclusion to an otherwise solid film. Once you've been taken for the ride, you may wonder if it was worth it all. The overwhelmingly positive reviews suggest yes, but there were also people who booed at the end in the theatre I saw it in. I'm kind of in the middle. The whole was not greater than the sum of its parts.",

            "content": "Hollywood's thriller maestro David Fincher became a phenomenon in the late 90's with such genre-redefining works as \"Se7en,\" \"The Game\" and \"Fight Club\". Then he seemed to falter a bit by abandoning the unique, edgy psychology of his breakthrough works for a more traditionally stylish and obviously commercial tone.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" has been hailed as his return to form. The author-adapted screenplay based on Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name resembles Fincher's most beloved movies, equaling the upgraded ambition of the directing. This is hugely entertaining, modern noir storytelling, as well as commendably brainy.\n\nSeveral critics seem to have made the choice of writing both spoiler-free and more in-depth reviews on the film, or at least specifying which kind theirs is. There are often revelations, twists and game changers in good thrillers, and \"Gone Girl\" might have particularly dramatic ones. Nothing \"Fight Club\" grade, though. It's true that some of the most central and fascinating themes and conclusions can't be properly commented on without significant spoilers. I'll exercise restraint and try to be as general as possible.\n\nThe movie begins on the fifth anniversary of married couple Nick Dunne and Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck). The opening notes are of disappointment; we meet Nick who is complaining to his sister about the state of his marriage in a bar they keep together. The anniversary seems to be an uneasy reminder of something no longer alive.\n\nWe follow Nick to his house, where he immediately notices the absence of his wife. There are signs of struggle in the living room. Nick calls the police and a search begins. We begin following Nick on his new mission to find Amy. At the same time we see dramatized sequences from Amy's diary that illuminate the history of the couple. Their relationship gets dissected in a way that's at least as thrilling as the way the mysterious disappearance is peeled open.\n\nAmy and Nick are a superficially perfect couple: ridiculously attractive, creative and successful. Nick is down-to-Earth, charming and kind. Amy is classy, witty and ethereal. In the diary scenes they communicate, give each other space. Then the financial crisis takes both of their jobs and makes Nick completely reliant on his wife's family money. They move from hip New York to tend to Nick's mother in Missouri. Somewhere along these times something seemingly unbreakable will shatter. How and with what consequences connects to the disappearance.\n\nThe most obvious presence in \"Gone Girl\" is that of the media. They are present from moment one in the investigation, following Nick's every move, scripting a dramatic, ever changing story for him to inhabit. An easy string of adjectives tells the audience who to love and who to hate any given day. The film gets satirical on several occasions with its sometimes over-the-top plot developments, but especially when it shows the media. It quite sharply demonstrates the cold manner in which the media tries to manufacture oversimplified narratives both generally and particularly when it comes to violence against women. Amy's apparently violent disappearance is handled as a symbol of all such violence but used exploitatively, with superficial urgency but in a tone that's almost pornographic in its details.\n\nHere we get into the other main part of the movie's thematic plane, namely gender. Nick and Amy seem like perfectly modern people with minimum gender bias. Amy is the head of the house and in charge of their common finances. There is no obvious hierarchy between them, no infuriating clich\u00e9s of indifferent husbands and nagging wives. But Nick comes from a family where the mother was abused. He is haunted by his father's attitudes. Almost unnoticeable hints of indirect aggression are apparent in his ever courteous, even submissive manners. In a moment of weakness he lashes out to his sister about always being pushed around by women. It becomes clear in the diary sequences that the marriage between these two intellectuals was very much gendered. The people in the marriage dealt badly with this, were entrapped by it, but it is something that marriage itself easily forces upon individuals.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" has been criticized for pushing the misogynist narrative. I can see where the accusation comes from, and I was myself feeling uncomfortable with such an interpretation while watching the story unfold. But I dare argue that this particular interpretation is just the immediate, surface level one, and that the film both invites and deserves a deeper reading of its layers. Absorbing male chauvinism from this one is as lazy as doing the same with Lars Von Trier's \"Antichrist,\" a different but similarly ambivalent work. Fincher's movies do tend to have a male perspective, but I think similar surface level interpretations that have stemmed criticism for his \"Fight Club\" are being applied again.\n\nIndirectness is in general \"Gone Girl's\" greatest strength but also its weakness. The unreliability of different points of view has been accomplished with the expense of relatability in the characters. Author/writer Gillian Flynn has talked a lot about how she has wanted to challenge the requirement of likability in her characters, especially the female ones, to create deep, complex players that one is forced to understand if still distain. Cinematic presentation may be just inferior to literary one in this difficult equation, as the characters seem a bit too elusive. Or maybe it's just that usually stories deconstructing a relationship do so through direct character interaction and the indirect, implicit analysis is just something I'm not accustomed to. One at least has to respect the fact that a tale handling misleading appearances, I:s hiding behind me:s and the elusiveness of identity hides its characters just as they themselves do onscreen.\n\nThe actors do pretty well, compensating for the detachment I mentioned above. It's become clear in recent years that Ben Affleck- as ridiculously gorgeous as he still is- does better work behind the camera than in front of it. I don't think he's a failure as an actor, but he is a boring, predictable case. I don't ever remember seeing him transcend in any way, even if he has obviously grown over the years. As everyman Nick he does well in presenting isolation and subtle passive-aggressiveness, but he is so clearly inferior to phenomenal Rosamund Pike in their scenes together that it actually breaks the cinematic spell a bit. So it's not so much that Affleck is bad, Pike is just so exceptionally good. Carrie Coon is also perfectly cast as Nick's sister Margot as is Kim Dickens as Detective Rhonda Boney who investigates Amy's case.\n\nAs far as the production goes, Fincher keeps you completely hooked through the whole two and a half hour run of the flick. This is addictive viewing every minute, both through the mysterious plot and the scene-by-scene drama. I dare join the choir: the master is back in his game. As a whole, \"Gone Girl\" might not be a masterpiece, but it's still accomplished, uniquely engaging, compelling and most importantly has a feel of its own, which is the most obvious indication of an exceptional filmmaker behind the wheel.",

The biggest disappointment of the film is that the resolution feels slightly uneventful, leaving you expecting something more hard-hitting as the credits roll.

            "content": "Those who know me will know that I am not one to jump on the bandwagon when it comes to a film or a director. Therefore, I hope this will carry some considerable weight: I predict that, much in the way that critics today refer to works as \"Orwellian\" or \"Hitchcockian,\" the critics of the future will refer to movies and books as \"Fincheresque.\" That's right-- our lord David Fincher has yet to disappoint (come on, it's not like Alien 3 was his fault) after Gone Girl, one of the best films of both Fincher's career and of 2014. This is not a movie that is shaken off easily. Even if you forget parts of the plot after leaving the theater, the aura it casts will stay with you for some time. Individual shots will stick in your mind for weeks to come. It's quite an experience; one that truly gets in your head.\n \nGone Girl is based off of the novel by Gillian Flynn (who also penned the screenplay), and is directed by God David Fincher.  Fincher is known for past ventures into serial killer stories with films such as Zodiac, Se7en, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and certainly has a presence in his films. He is a director who truly knows how to get the most out of his actors, all while cramming his stories with suspense. Therefore, he's more than well-matched to this material. Gone Girl is the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who comes home one morning to find that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing. However, as circumstantial evidence mounts against him, both the characters in the film and the audience watching it are forced to wonder whether or not Dunne murdered his wife.\n \nThe difficult thing about writing a review for a film like this is that it's impossible to break down what makes the film good without spoiling it. And this is a movie that, if spoiled, loses a lot of its edge. So really, all I can say about the plot is that it does exactly what a suspense thriller should do, and does it very well. The movie is not scary, not even particularly intense-- but it has an undeniable sinister quality to it that keeps the audience's adrenaline pumping consistently, even in the most innocuous scenes. However, at the end of the day, the film's big twist takes place about an hour into it, and if you didn't see it coming, well, you're not a particularly observant person. Don't get me wrong, though. The film has far more to offer than just random plot twists.\n \nThis movie is a tour de force from all perspectives. Fincher is at his best, as always. The way he frames his shots, coupled with his usage of music to add to the tenseness of a scene, is utterly intoxicating. He has very little flourish in his direction (if you're looking for style over substance, I recommend Zack Snyder), but what he does have is an abundance of talent that he uses in very precise ways. Namely, getting a good performance out of Ben Affleck. No, not a good one-- a great one. Affleck has a serious shot at Best Actor this year, and even more shocking is the fact that he might actually deserve it. His disingenuous and smarmy style of acting works here, because the character he's playing isn't supposed to be particularly likable or believable. He completely owns this role. In past performances, Affleck has just been a mediocre actor who happened to be cast in a great movie (which is why he's so often lauded), but here... man oh man, he deserves every bit of acclaim he gets. Meanwhile, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris deliver powerhouse performances, another surprising development, as their latest efforts include Alex Cross and the How I Met Your Mother series finale, respectively. They're just two more fine examples of how well an actor can do when correctly matched with a character.\n \nThe film is a mystery/thriller first and foremost, but its best moments stem from its social commentary. Much like 2012's The Hunt, this movie isn't remotely afraid of getting into the ickiness of media politics. As soon as Dunne's story is picked up by the media, everyone in the country, from platinum-blonde FOX News anchors to his own sister, thinks that he's guilty. And after all, why shouldn't they? As the film progresses, it becomes less of a mystery and more of a cautionary tale about the dangers of coming to a group consensus without having all the information. The social commentary in this movie is shrewd and unwavering, but Fincher knows not to cram his film too full of rhetoric (you don't want to bludgeon your audience over their heads with your message... *cough cough* Requiem for a Dream). \n\nFinal Score for Gone Girl: 9/10 stars. Dethroning The Grand Budapest Hotel for my second-favorite film of the year is no easy task, but this movie managed to do it with its engrossing story and darkly comic themes. Audiences will undoubtedly love taking sick pleasure in watching this well-crafted film unfold before them. Everything here works like a Swiss watch-- there's not a boring moment in the whole movie. I've been waiting for Fincher to top himself after his latest efforts, but he's succeeded again and again. After this movie, I don't know what he'll do for an encore, but if the past is any indication, it'll be spectacular.",
