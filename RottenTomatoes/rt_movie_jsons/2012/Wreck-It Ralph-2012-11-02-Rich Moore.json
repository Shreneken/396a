    "summary": "Arcade-game character Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) is tired of always being the \"bad guy\" and losing to his \"good guy\" opponent, Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer). Finally, after decades of seeing all the glory go to Felix, Ralph decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets off on a game-hopping trip to prove that he has what it takes to be a hero. However, while on his quest, Ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade.",

Bison\nRalph wants to break the status quo and be the hero for a change; along the way he comes across a small girl named Vanelope von Schweetz \nShe's feisty and curious but suffers from a glitch that occurs making her stand out from her own world of Sugar Rush \nBut teaming up with Ralph they might just find out how special they both are \nA parallel I didn't draw before with Vanelope is that her glitch could be a metaphor for having epilepsy; she's got a defect in her gaming code much like certain humans with our genetic code \nSo that element makes the film very contemporary \nUnfortunately because Ralph left his game it creates a problem being that if he doesn't come back his game will be unplugged forever \nFelix has to go find him and he runs into Sergeant Calhoun from Hero's Duty \nI thought this was good not great; yet it managed to actually focus on a simple story of a video game character not wanting to be labeled the bad guy even though that's his assigned role \nGlad it focuses on the video game culture without messing with their source material in the process \nTerrific voice acting from John C. Reily, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman\nLots of fun pop cultural references and sharp, colorful animation \nThe creators took the time to make everything very video-game esque from the pixelizations to the score synthesizer to the 8-bit graphics \nEven rules are established that if characters leave their games with the power shut off they can't regenerate \nThere's even a cool twist in here \nIt's true to not like your job when everyone else hates you for it, we can't mess with the system but can we change it?, those of us born with abnormalities can't be told we weren't meant to not exist but to embrace it, there's no one we would rather be than ourselves, we all deserve some recognition \nThis could be called the Roger Rabbit of video game movies with really good themes and at one point they address the generational gap \nA complicated story but still explainable while also embracing the gaming world \nA lot of nice in-jokes keep things balanced with the laughs and heartwarming bits \nBoth Ralph and Vanelope are polar opposites that learn to come together from their own environments and see something worth of value \nThis is amazing for hardcore video game fans that can spot their favorite characters from hundreds of titles with dozens of Easter eggs \nCould've been greater and the climax can have some more variety with less over-abundance of ideas but this story is intricate enough with video game characters you connect with they struggle for freedom and acceptance\nLots of spoofing and nostalgia for anyone who grew up loving video games from the 1980s \nFor a non-PIXAR Disney film this is loads of good gaming bits",

            "content": "I think 2012 has been a very good, even great, year for animation in that I don't think I have seen an animated film I've disliked. Wreck It Ralph for me was the best animated film from 2012(although it only came out yesterday in the UK I still class it as a 2012 film), tying with Tangled as the best Disney has done since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It has something for children and adults alike, and I don't think you have to be a video game fan to like it(I'm not exactly, more of Disney myself, but am very familiar with them through my brother). The animation is wonderful, the characters move with no problem at all, the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are detailed, very like the very best of Pixar actually. The music, right from the tempos, rhythms, melodies, chord progressions and instrumentation, is full of energy and the songs are incredibly catchy. The writing is a perfect blend of humour and heart, the film is often hilarious and witty as well as heartfelt and touching in equal measures and the story is fast-paced and much more original than you'd think complete with energetic-but not too frantic- action. I like the Be Youself message, it is an important one and I personally didn't think it was heavy-handed. And of course any video game fan will love spotting the video game characters and references, there's plenty of them and all are colourfully evoked. I found it very easy to relate to Ralph, Fix-it Felix Jr is an amusing character and Vanellope is cute without being annoying or mawkish. The voice work is terrific, with the standout being the gruff vulnerability that John C Reilly brings to Ralph. In conclusion, a wonderful film and the best animated film of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Ralph, the 'bad guy' in the game 'Fix-it Felix Jr', is treated as such even when the arcade shuts down for the day, and the characters inside the arcade are brought to life in their own environment. It's a clever spin on the original Toy Story idea of toys coming to life, but choosing to shift the location to the inner world of a video arcade leads to some glorious cameos from characters you will recognise, and some you will be thrilled to meet for the first time. Although the initial thrill of exploring the world and its characters in the first half of the film does fade as the adventure fully gets going, Wreck-It Ralph is certainly one of Pixar's better films, and considering they've made very few that aren't excellent, that's high praise indeed.",

And I know this is supposed to be for the children who are unable to raise their intelligence but that doesn't mean that the concept actually makes sense. In fact, no one's ever questioned the logic of why the arcade games plugged into the server are basically complete and different universes with everything being interactive for no reason at all, why code can directly infect another game after parting from its own, and why the game characters are separate code. And the message isn't conveyed logically because of that, since they're GAME CHARACTERS, they're programmed to play a role and shouldn't deviate from it because they can't, they were made for what they do. The basic \"Be yourself\" moral could not be conveyed in a worse way than this film. And never mind that, the soundtrack is faux-retro than actual retro. It's basically pop-retro over and over with the occasional Disney orchestral that has little weight because THE PREMISE IS ARCADE GAME CHARACTERS! If they're experiencing a misfortune, recall that they don't actually exist as people, were written for a string of events, and can't even leave the universe of technology itself because they would die trying to. Wreck-It Ralph is just gamer fan service for Disney and they know it, but they audience sure doesn't, and it's the only thing it actually succeeds in. Of course, because it is gamer fan service, that's where it has its entertainment value that actually can remain, unlike everything else that makes so little logical sense in hindsight that the audience won't even bother with it.",

I didn't know the name of the movie and we didn't have an internet back then, so I could neither ask anyone nor look it up. The trailer showing Bowser and Eggman were just enough to have me sold. Then when the movie released I saw its name in the newspaper, but within the next week it was taken off (probably it didn't earn much here). So ever since then I wanted to watch it. I finally watched it in 2018 and I'm really glad I could.\n\nWreck-It Ralph is the story of a videogame villain who wants to be a hero, but he can't do it because of how much he's used to being the bad guy. After he meets Vanellope, they both embark on an adventure to help Ralph get a medal which Vanellope had otherwise given away as a prize in her own game Sugar Rush. There are many fun characters like Fix-It Felix, Calhoun and King Candy. There is even a cameo appearance of Sonic, which is like a dream come true for a huge Sonic fan like me.\n\nThe story is great for children, the visuals are phenomenal like all Disney animated movies, the voice actors are decent, the comic timing is hilarious and unexpected (the Oreo march, Felix fixing the prison bars while trying to hammer them, Ralph running around in Calhoun's game etc). I'm pretty sure if I was a kid and I had watched it, I'd have been completely blown away by it and it would have become my favourite movie. I watched it when I was 19, and yet I really enjoyed it (the rating is from that time so I have written this review from that perspective). For the veteran gamers there are a lot of hidden jokes, easter eggs and references scattered around everywhere.\n\nI really want this franchise to expand even more. Ralph has come as a playable character in Sonic and SEGA All Star Racing Transformed. I mean, this is a movie about a game character. It would really be injustice if we don't get Sugar Rush in real life, or Fix-It Felix for mobile phones. The movie was pretty good, since it established all the ideas not even the sequel could ruin. Definitely a watch if you're a gamer and have a family.",

Listen, just because you've had a 10+ year affair with a computer app under the same avatar doesn't make you able to navigate information better, it means you're having an emotional affair with your phone, and now you're blaming the bots for tampering with something you thought was real and it is all fiction. You are yelling into a bot about bots yelling into you, and it is all very funny to me when people choose these virtual interactions. \n\nSo, invite Ralph to your Disney parties, but don't censor Ralph or any destroyer, it will only be Game Over. From what I can see, everyone wants Fix it Felix to come, but, they aren't giving any attention to lonely hero sitting in the junk yard who keeps their fun wheel spinning, and I like that this film points at him and goes; He's a hero too, y'know...",

Ralph, the quintessential unappreciated essential worker without whose efforts his video game world would fall apart, lives in the dump while the hero Felix and other generic snooty assholes live in the penthouse apartments.  This goes on for 30 years.  These generic snooty assholes treat him like crap throughout the film and never apologize for it even after realizing that he is in essence more important than they are, and that they've been treating him like crap for 30 years.  After all, if one of these mob characters disappeared then no one would notice.  Ralph is only gone for about 20 seconds, before the video game is about to be shipped out to be demolished.  Furthermore, Ralph is treated as being unforgivably selfish for wanting to improve his standing in life, causing him to abandon his 'duty' to the other characters in his video game to pursue a Hero's medal.  I'm not sure how much loyalty he should feel to people who had been treating him like crap for 30 years, and if I'd written this script I'd have had him say that to them.  The movie ends with Ralph still living in the dump, while these generic snooty assholes continue to live in the penthouse apartments.  They may appreciate him more, but at the end of the day he is still getting thrown into a pile of mud every day and sleeping in the dump at night.  Frankly, I think this sends the message that upward mobility is selfish, and that you should know your place and try to be content with it no matter how shitty it is.  Frankly, I reject this message and think everyone else should as well.",

            "content": "I watched this movie in theaters when I was 7 1/2 years old. As a kid, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. And now, 8 years later, I may love it even more. The reason why I believe this movie is done so well is that it was made before Disney had complete control over all of our beloved franchises (Marvel and Star Wars). With the second Wreck-It Ralph, Disney used their brands and internet references to cover up their mediocre storyline. They don't do that in this movie. Their main purpose is to tell an entertaining story. A story about a fictional video game character that never existed (unfortunately). And...they sure did accomplish their mission. Everything about this movie is great. The score is phenomenal. The animation is absolutely stellar. The voice cast does an outstanding job. The jokes still make me laugh. The villain is written so well. Our side characters actually help advance the plot. But the thing that stands out the most is our lead characters Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Their chemistry together is such a joy to watch on screen. And their similar backgrounds allow for some emotional moments between them as well. I've said in some of my other reviews that a harmonic balance between humor and emotion is a difficult thing to do (successfully at least). Animation companies like DreamWorks and Illumination have tried this, but it often drags their movies down as they progress (with a few exceptions like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon). Wreck-It Ralph finds the perfect balance between these two elements and allows for some genuine, heartfelt moments all throughout the film, all leading to quite a satisfying conclusion. This film doesn't feel dated at all. Even after watching it in 2020, it still feels fresh, if you understand what I mean. I would highly recommend this film, especially if you love video games. A lot of the references in this movie are clever as well as hilarious. This movie truly shows what Disney is capable of if they genuinely put effort into a story.",

Disney has shown time and time again how they can take such a simple, kindergarten level message (don't judge a book by its cover, treat others the way you want to be treated, etc.) and not only teach it to children but re-teach it to adults.

However, pleasingly, it does its own thing as it gives a positive message and has more than satisfactory humour.\n\nI'm never been a proper gamer, at least not in the sphere of games used here, but I still got a load of the little references. I also like how the world is built, it's silly sure but it's still pretty neat how they tie it all together.\n\nJohn C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are excellent in their roles as Ralph and Vanellope. It's very easy to care for those two characters, with both having meaningful stories. Jane Lynch (Calhoun), Jack McBrayer (Felix) and Alan Tudyk (Candy) add to the film with their characters - it's clear to see the ode (copy?) to Ed Wynn and his Mad Hatter for Tudyk's role.\n\nThe animation is nice, while the music - though not memorable at all - is rather catchy and suits the Sugar Rush surroundings in particular. Give it a watch.",

The icons being in an arcade was awesome, but I feel that those games wouldn't have been as tolerated in the game center as what they are. Maybe if this was made ten years ago it would've been good. Most gaming systems are just for decoration. Everyone has the games on consoles or computers. Anyways, the movie is actually good. All the characters are funny, all the icons from Street Fighter, Tapper, the Konami code, Sonic, Q-bert, Mortal Kombat. Dig dug. Pac-man. It was awesome. The two leads of Ralph and Venellope are hilarious to watch and also Felix Jr. and Calhoun. Even some that was like a fresh air of relief in combining both old and new games. It absolutely worked. The ending was surprisingly honest and it hinted at trying to overcome ambition from being like a bad guy to be a 'good guy'. It has a sense of being an AA meeting at that point that adults get and goes completely over the heads of kids. The film's bad guy inched along to being a real surprise at the end. Don't know why, but I didn't see it coming. This is a nostalgia trip with all generations of kids who played games and those who love animation. I highly recommend seeing this movie. It is well loved by adults and kids for a retro quality that I highly recommend seeing.",

            "content": "Trying to prove his worth, star video game bad guy Ralph (John C. Reilly) goes on a quest to earn a medal and show the world he's actually good.\n\nActing: 10\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe intro is everything you want for the start of a movie. It builds a beautiful world while getting you immersed in it at the same time. I loved how the characters are introduced in true video game style fashion. By the time you see the characters ending their shift and stepping out of their games to go home, you already feel like you are a part of the world. The Bad Guys Anonymous meeting Ralph attends is easily one of my favorite scenes done in a movie. Just seeing the characters from my childhood talking about what it was like being a bad guy just puts a smile on my face everytime I watch it.\n\nCharacters: 10\nRalph is someone you can easily sympathize with as he really doesn't seem like that bad of a guy. He's gotten a bad rap because of his job but you watch him giving away fruit to lesser characters whose games have been unplugged and you can't help but like the guy. Outside of Ralph, the sheer number of video game characters they were able to include was just plain amazing. It's eye candy for both older and newer generations. The supporting cast will keep you entertained as well from Fix-it Felix (Jack McBrayer) who is a stickler for doing the right thing to Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a crazy game glitch that's also on a quest to earn a medal. There is no shortage of depth or originality.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\n\nConflict: 10\n\nGenre: 10\nI'll stand by this statement and I'll fight anyone on it: Because of it's originality, visuals, and message, Wreck-it Ralph is not only one of the greatest animated films of all time, but one of the greatest films of all time. Period. It sets a new bar for animated movies from top to bottom. Every single time i watch it, I find something different to appreciate.\n\nMemorability: 10\nIn one scene, Ralph finds himself in the middle of a Starship Trooper-esque battle fighting alien bugs and trying to make it to the top of a tower.  It's such an amazing scene to watch and one of my favorites\u00e2\u00a6until, that is, I make it to the next scene where that one becomes my favorite. From one wild ride to the next, no moment is wasted in this movie. Neither is one easily forgotten. The movie also packs a beautiful message about embracing who you are in spite of your weaknesses.\n\nPace: 10\nAs I mentioned earlier, the movie makes full use of its time as it moves quickly from one scene to the next, never lingering. Where I find myself saying \"Get to the point already\" when I watch a lot of movies, director Rich More manages the pace excellently. Even during slower moments where Ralph and Vanellope are bantering back and forth, the movie forces you to have a good time.\n\nPlot: 10\nVideo game stories are typically very linear but that isn't a problem in the least with Wreck-it Ralph. There are enough twists and turns to renew your interest and keep you entertained. Each character was handled perfectly, given just enough screen time to impact the movie in their own way. Each piece of story is carefully crafted and never breaks the laws of the world in which the story takes place.\n\nResolution: 10\n\nOverall: 100\nWhat can I say? Some reviewers give perfect scores to Citizen Kane. I give them to movies like Wreck-it Ralph, movies that remind us of what watching movies is all about: Escape and having fun. Wreck-it Ralph will wow you, make you cheer, and leave you with enough memories to last ages.",

The animation was not unique since they have to remake most of the game characters from there design so people won't go \"Hey, who's that blue hedgehog?\", but instead, say \"that's sonic!\". The dialogue was fine and the choice of actors to voice was amazing and fit their role. I would like to see more Nintendo characters but Nintendo are very picky where they place their characters. The puns were cringy but funny. This movie had a good moral and I would also recommend this. I would age this PG for spooky scenes, mild violence and slapstick comedy.

The animation isn't anything too incredible, but it's still good. \nI think the concept of having 2 plots worked pretty well in this film, and both plots intertwined naturally in the end. \nWhen Ralph is falling down to the volcano and is giving the monologue about how he is a bad guy, but he is still good, it kind of contradicts itself since he says \"I will never be good and that's not bad\" but he is in the middle of doing something really good. It seemed like a cheesy way to get an emotional reaction, however this film is still a great one, and very possibly will go down as a Disney Classic.",

Easily one of the best Disney films of the 21st century and also one of the most heart-warming. Many Disney films, and to an even greater extent Pixar films, that have come out since the naughties began have gone by a cheaply emotionally manipulative formula that doesn't actually work for all of the tears they get. This film is different. It's emotions feel real, and it owes it all to it's lovable cast. The titular anti-hero, and his candy coated buddy are some of the most memorable and honest characters ever written by the studio. This films also managed to stick in my mind due to it's stunning visuals that, unlike other Disney films, push big exaggerated shapes and strong silhouettes allowing the films to stand out among a generic crowd.",

This Disney movie is pretty entertaining. Thanks to its detailed animation, video game references and heartwarming message about two outcasts who challenge the status quo of their environments, Wreck-It Ralph won't cause you to wreck things in a fit of rage. Whilst I had some problems with the character of Vanellope von Schweetz, Sarah Silverman's charming vocal performance makes the character likable and helps the audience root for her whilst John C. Reilly is charming as the titular character who has accepted his life for the past 30 years but wants to show the Nicelanders from Fix-It Felix Jr. that he's not as bad as his coding makes him out to be. Even the credits are fun to watch with an Owl City song I really liked back when the movie came out. And Henry Jackman's score is amazing with a big thumbs up from me for his score in the Hero's Duty action sequence. The \"B\" story manages to be charming as well. What do you get when you put in likable characters, detailed animation, cute visual gags and a valuable message to audiences young and old? A very good animated movie that pays great homage to video games without ending up like every video game movie that has come out so far. Remember: video game movies and movies about video games, documentary or a movie with fictional characters and storyline, are different. This one manages to be a little bit of both and is an entertaining movie. Tons of great stuff here.",

When we see that we can come back from places to change more than what people see, when it's a hero they can see we are and celebrate. When we see we are in a different place we font belong to see people we don't normally see. When we see we got in without being seen to see we remain and hide. When all we wished to see ourselves in is a winner when we see don't belong and not wanted that prevents us from seeing that. When what we need to see we need to get rid when others don't want to see it here.\n\nWhen what we need to see through we agree. When we see others whom dont belong have made away home and unseen when they are able be part of game without anyone seeing it differently. When we created a system to see for us, when we can't allow anything else from entering and seeing their way into places they don't belong.  When what we see we duplicate and add ourselves to be seen when it's the only way for everyone to see us.\n\nWhen we see we are all full things we wished to see ourselves in to see to it we are. When we see don't belong in some places, when we are created differently to not belong in what others whom created this world to see. When we need to save those whom we want to continue seeing we do when we like seeing them. When we see that we must crush some people's dreams to see they listen and stay. When we see we are all part of a greater plan and program to see we belong and others dont, to know where we go safely and others get lost. When we see that some glitches are welcome when they are programed in, when others are not. When we see we are stuck in some places to see another way out. When all we wish to see and be is seen as a good guy and friend in someone's eyes to see that all matters. When we see eye to eye with some people we wished to see to save them. When we see whom some people really are when we see right through them to see we are good friends.When we see our ways in how we see and treat people wrong to see we too change our ways. When we see we got it good after all when we like seeing what we see when we are finally seen.",

But anyhow... the movie started a long tradition of 'de-vilifying' misunderstood and often times tragic history characters with a couple of flaws and even showcased one of the 'last deaths' of a Disney villain in an animated movie(if you think I'm joking, here are the animated tales which followed: Monster's University, Planes, Frozen, Big Hero 6, The Tinker Bell Franchise, Inside Out, The good Dinosaur, Zootopia, Finding Dory and Moana; yeah not a single villain death sequence).",

Finally, after decades of seeing all the glory go to Felix, Ralph decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets off on a game-hopping trip to prove he has what it takes to be a hero. However, while on his quest, Ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade.\n\nThis new animated masterpiece from Walt Disney Animation Studios is charming and full of heart! The idea itself is magnificent, the characters are relatable, the voice cast is impeccable, and the story is timely and wonderful! I'm really impressed with the creative resurgence Disney Animation is seeing with Disney's recent purchase of Pixar. John Lasseter, who was Pixar CEO, now oversees both animation divisions.

            "content": "Though Disney owns Pixar, the two animation studios work autonomously, and the latter has simply dominated the former over the last decade or so. Wreck-It Ralph-Disney's latest-represents a giant, candy-colored momentum swing back toward Mickey Mouse and company. Disney still isn't winning the battle; Pixar's track record is just too strong. But compare Wreck-It Ralph to Brave-hell, compare Wreck-It Ralph to any animated film since Toy Story 3-and you'll recognize what a grand accomplishment it is.\n\nThe title character (voice of John C. Reilly) is, by profession, a \"bad guy\" inside the world of the fictional arcade game Fix-It Felix, Jr. He wrecks things; Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) fixes them. As a result, Felix gets a gold medal every day from the citizens of Niceland, while Ralph gets thrown off a building into a puddle of mud.\n\nHe attends meetings with fellow \"bad guys,\" but that's not enough for Ralph. He yearns for acceptance, but he fumbles the ball when given an opportunity. So a Nicelander gives him a challenge: Earn a medal and Ralph can move into the penthouse of their building. But only good guys can win medals, so Ralph needs a miracle to change his life.\n\nDirector Rich Moore (best known for directing episodes of The Simpsons and Futurama) takes us into other enthralling video game worlds including Hero's Duty-where intergalactic soldiers fight vicious space bugs to win a Hero's Medal-and Sugar Rush-where young girls and their King Candy (voice of Alan Tudyk) race go-karts around a world made entirely of sweets. We also get glimpses at \"Game Central Station,\" the hub where every game in the arcade meets.\n\nThese places are visually stunning and supremely clever. Sonic, Pac-Man, and Qbert make cameos, and we're also introduced to fully fleshed-out new characters including Ralph, Felix, Vanellope Von Sweetums (a shunned Sugar Rush racer with a tendency to \"glitch\"), and Calhoun (the not-quite-but-almost-fearless leader of the Hero's Duty squadron).\n\nThe animation-style fully embraces the film's fun premise. It's a little choppy, very blocky, but in a retro, Space Invaders-like way. Characters skip and jump like they would in Super Mario Bros. A little more consistency would have worked the film wonders; It's a little distracting when characters from the same game look and behave in such different ways. By and large, though, Wreck-It Ralph is one of the brightest, fastest, and most visually interesting films of the year.\n\nBonus: The film extra sweet. Not in a candy way, though God knows there's more than enough candy on display here. Rather, the relationship between Ralph and Vanellope will tickle your heart, despite the latter being just the slightest bit irritating. One gets the same feeling when it comes to the relationship between Felix and Calhoun, just to a lesser degree. It's played more for comic relief than anything else, but because Calhoun was programmed with \"the saddest backstory ever,\" it sticks emotionally, as well.\n\nWreck-It Ralph won't be in the running for a screenplay nod this Oscar season, but it should be. Its premise is ingenious-something you'd expect only Pixar could dream up-and it lives up to its promise with near-perfect execution. It runs a little long and has a few too many loose ends to keep track of, but Wreck-It Ralph is simply overflowing with charm.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/wreck-it-ralph-review/",

Felix (protagonist in the same game), notices that Ralph is gone and goes to search for Ralph.

Sonic, rather, gives crucial advice about what happens when one video game character ventures into another video game other than their own.\n\nI really must applaud Disney for making a excellent video game movie, showing it can be done. I remember watching a video on YouTube talking about why video game movies are, generally, bad, and the answer was because video game movies take away from the experience of the player having to \"choose their own adventure\" and become the hero. The fact that Disney created their own video game character that no one has played as before was just brilliant. I found it rather odd that this movie was not made with Pixar's help. All in all, Wreck-It Ralph is a classic and I cannot wait for its' sequel (I heard another famous video game character, surprisingly absent from the this film, might make its' way into the sequel.)",

He takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a game-hopping journey across the arcade through every generation of video games to prove he's got what it takes to be a hero. On his quest, he meets the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) from the first-person action game Hero's Duty. But it's the feisty misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from the candy-coated cart racing game, Sugar Rush, whose world is threatened when Ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade.

One is, what everyone that likes the film loves, is the nostalgia with the memorable video game characters. Pac-Man, Bowser, Sonic, and many more to recognize. The other thing that stands out of the movie for me is the creativity. So much creativity was put into this movie with the story, Ralph's video game, and, the most creative part of the movie, Sugar Rush. The characters are also characters that I can relate with.  Overall, this is my favorite disney movie, and it is a great movie to show your kids.",
