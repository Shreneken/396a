Isabella travels to an Italian hospital for the criminally insane -- where Maria is locked away -- to find out whether her mother is mentally ill or demonically possessed. With the help of two young exorcists (Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth), Isabella tries to cure Maria -- and engages four demons in a battle for her mother's soul.",

I was annoyed by the misinformation of unbaptized babies going to hell. The Magisterium used to hold that such babies ended up in limbo (not hell), but this changed with the Second Vatican Council. The 1992 Catechism teaches that unbaptized babies are left to the mercy of God. The current understanding is that babies\u2014whether baptized or not\u2014-go to Heaven.\nAnd then we have the terrible, abrupt ending and the instruction to seek more information at the given website. So. Bad. It's just as bad as waking up and seeing it was all a dream.\nAdvice: don't watch this drivel.",

It's yet another in the long line of films desperately trying to imitate 'The Exorcist', and as with nearly all before them, fails yet again.  That film is brilliant becuase of the plot and the characterisation, not just because a little girl swears, pukes up green soup and spins her head around.  This film treats the exorcism like a fairground ride, in fact it loves them so much we have at least 3 that I counted including one in a car (JAZZ HANDS!).  Notable other failures of this film are the found footage angle (this has never worked since the 'Blair Witch Project', give it up) and easily one of the top 5 worst endings to a movie I've ever seen.

            "content": "The Devil Inside is directed and co-written by William Brent Bell, and it stars Fernanda Andrade and Simon Quarterman in a found-footage film about a daughter that wants to film all of it so that she can see how her mom is doing as she has been possessed by a demon and is in a mental institution. I was thinking to myself about what bad film I should rent and watch, while renting other films that I have seen, but haven't reviewed. So I was about to get this and The Apparation, but I rented too much films, and so I got rid of the later one. So with my mindset going on the fact that I wanted to be hilariously bad, I can say that I didn't hate it as much as I did the first time I watched The Devil Inside, but I still thought it's a piece of crap. The good things about the film are that the premise could've been interesting as it's different than what you typically see from an exorcism film, and the acting is decent at best, with some actors being creepy, and some being dull and meh. There are some points that I get why it's being filmed, and that's all I can think of. So let's get this started. Most of the time, I had no idea why it's being filmed, and when you start to realize why later on, you wouldn't care about it because the story that they have in this is uninteresting. The characters are two-dimensional as you see what the characters' role is, and what their motivations are. Other then that, there's no character that you really would root for. The scares in this are not effective, and they don't progress much through the story. There are some silly moments that are suppose to be scary, but come off as unintentionally funny and silly. Now let's talk about the ending, cause that's what the film is well known for. When things finally start to happen in the climax, the movie decided to end so abruptly, and it gives off a link afterwards that supposedly tells us more information, even though it doesn't work since this movie is years old. So I agree that the ending is probably one of the worst that I've seen, but at least it spawn a hilarious reaction video on YouTube. The Devil Inside is a terrible movie that I couldn't say is one of the worst horror films that I've seen after rewatching this, but it was kind of close there.",

            "content": "The Devil Inside is one of those rare horror films (mainly found-footage) that brings absolute nothings new to the table. It relies on the cheap found-footage gimmicks that gets old real fast.\n\nIn 1989, emergency responders received a 9-1-1 call from Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) condessing that she had brutally killed three people. Twenty years later, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), who is her daughter, seeks to understand the truth about what happened that night (um...why?) She travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother has been locked away to determine if her mother is mentally ill or possessed by the Devil. When Isabella recuits two young exorcists (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) to cure her mother using unconventional methods combining both science and religion, they come face-to-face with pure evil in the form of four powerful demons possessing Maria.\n\nThe Devil Inside is one of the most cynical projects in recent memory. It devoids any kind of creativity, originality, and scares. Speaking of scares, it is not remotely scary. It relies of cheap jump-scares with horror film relies nowadays. And that is sad because back then horror films did not relies on them. And yes, it borrows from other horror films such as The Exorcist and Paranormal Activity (which are better films by the way).\n\nAnd no, I really didn't care about any of the characters. They have motivations that are beyond me (in other words stupid). Okay it leaves me some questions: 1) if the methods they are using are illegal, why the exorcists are performing the exorcism(s)? and 2) why the people involve in this agree to do a documentary (if you want to call it that)?\n\nThe most important thing I want to talk is the ending. It is one of the worst endings in recent years. It is an ending so bad that anyone could have come up a better ending than the director, writer, or anyone else in this movie. And adding insult to injury, the credits has to be the slowest credits ever. No wonder it has a \"F\" on CinemaScore.\n\nWhat to say about The Devil Inside? It is one of the worst horror flicks in recent years. It is total waste of time. The Devil Inside was bad that I prefer to be possessed by the Devil for eighty-three straight minutes. I pretty sure that will be more fun than watching this movie.\n\nStay far away from The Devil Inside! Like I said before, it is a total waste of time. I highly recommend you watch the films that this film borrows from: The Exorcist (which is one of the best horror films ever) and Paranormal Activity (although I am not a fan).",

The issue with the acting is the line delivery, enthusiasm is sapped out and almost every serious line is delivered in slow monotone which really does slow the pace down, The Devil Inside feels remarkably long winded despite it running in at only 90 minutes. This film didn't deserve the critical bashing it received, it has some worthy moments and they are the exorcism scenes. Bones crack, blood seeps, eyes invert and strange markings appear on the bodies of the victims, the camerawork here hides behind character shoulders as if it's too scared to go near the possessed and the tightly packed close ups genuinely stir an atmosphere. The performances do actually liven up here at the most critical point, and I thought the scene where Isabella Rossi meets her Mum was pretty tense, I had no clue what she would do, and the \"connect the cuts\" line is weird. It's no master in horror but the exorcism scenes are where it's strong points are, just don't expect to be scared silly.",

            "content": "So lets talk about trends really fast. When something is popular, people imitate it with new execution, and when those things become good, we have a trend. Movies seem to have all sorts of trends whether it be zombie movies, parody movies, the current comic book movie blowout, or whatever. And trends usually happen until people get sick of them, and whatever is the new opposite and contrast to those trends will feel like a breathe of fresh air, and become the new trend. Two of these trends in movies are the possession movies, where a girl gets possessed, and there's exorcisms. (It's always a girl for some reason, they just have to imitate the Exorcist I guess) And there is also the shaky cam cheap budget first person trend, started by Paranormal Activity. And I don't mind trends, or hate movies that follow them, if I did I'd hate a lot of movies. I actually love the first person thing when it's done right. But the Devil Inside combines both of them. It's about a girl's mother who went bat shit crazy and killed a bunch of people really long ago, and the daughter recently found out it was because of an exorcism and is apparently getting so far into it she decides to make a documentary about it. (I think) And that's my first point, the first person thing is so unneeded. The camera guy is hardly ever shown, they make little reference to him being there, and wanting to film this is a complete coincidence. It was a huge excuse that felt unnatural. And he's shaking it at some of the worst times. Not saying the camera was bad all the time, but at least movies like Chronicle and Paranormal Activity make it fun. And to be honest, the first time I watched this I was miserable. Let's just say it was an uncomfortable experience where I had to watch it with a religious person, and I couldn't turn the volume down, and it was awkward. This time, not nearly as bad, I could turn the volume down when the girl tried sucking the priest's dick... yeah, that probably sounded weird if you didn't see the movie. Anyway,  let's talk about all the exorcisms scenes. They were very over the top, but not as much as I thought the first time. Power of volume ladies and gentlemen. They're creepy shit, they give you that little chill up your spine. But yeah, other than a couple of moments like that, this movie has nothing really going for it at all. The characters are the most wooden I've seen in awhile, and even the main chick who feels interesting, her every emotion is random. And it's a horror flick, the characters aren't suppose to hold the movie, but what is holding this movie up? The exorcism scenes. I might have gotten a little edge on my seat, but nothing past that. And at parts the movie gets pretty stupid. The story isn't very good, and the ending is complete shit. Like one of the worst endings I've seen in awhile. And to be honest the first time I watched it I was actually so happy, because it just ended. And the movie had no real substance, and when there's high entertainment value, that's not a problem. But this isn't really entertaining. It's hardly worth a first watch, let alone two. It really just feels like a cheap cash grab, and honestly, that's probably all it is. The actors I don't feel were bad, the dialogue wasn't bad, just the pacing and execution. And to be honest, this movie had some hype, a lot of people were probably disappointed. I mean, the movie is almost treating itself like it's smarter than other possession movies. At one point it's like, \"Science can only go so far, religion at points are the only way.\" But yeah, it was like trying to scare people who were atheists I think with their found footage bullshit, and they completely failed. That or they were trying to stir some religion vs. science commentary that they forgot to follow up on. It's not a good movie by any stretch, but not exactly bad either. I could see somebody going in liking it, but you'd really have to fall for it's bullshit. And nobody is with these movies anymore, another reason why the trend is pretty much dead. In the end, just not a good movie.",

So the mother had the four demons removed from her.... and then what? What happened to her? Then one of the priests have this ongoing fear of being excommunicated, but hadn't they said their work was condemned by the church as it was? Four demons right, so where's the last one?

The film was very dull except for a few scenes. The acting was actually good for what the movie was, the shaky camera got annoying but with this movie it's the noises that really count the most. I recall there was 2 different \"wtf\" moments but other than that the film was.....forgettable. Not really any jump scenes either just scary images. I would not watch this again. Unrecommended",

            "content": "One sentence summary:  The Exorcist descends into a Blair Witch style pseudo-documentary.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    The opening snippet was from 30oct1989 detailing a 911 call.  The caller, Maria Rossi, claims to have killed three people.\n    We jump the shark immediately thereafter.  The next part of the film is 'found footage' or whatever nice phrase one uses to describe Blair Witch style worse-than-useless camera work.  Someone follows the cops around the crime scene.\n    Priest in the kitchen with the monkey wrench to the head.  Nun bludgeoned in the basement with something.  Priest hung in the basement with the rope.  Signs that a chair was used to restrain a subject.\n    The daughter, Isabella Rossi does a film (oi, film within a film) to help Isabella understand what went on with her mother.  This film is not very good either.  It's sort of better than the police mess, but not by that much.\n    The interleaved television station news footage also sucked rocks.  The main part of the narrative (outside experts who are not in Isabella's film) is recorded in a fourth style, which looks quite competent.  The many cuts among these styles makes the film look like a hodge-podge of nonsense circling the bowl after flushing.\n    After being found not guilty by reason of insanity, Maria was committed to the South Hartford State Asylum.  A bit later, Maria is transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.  This is curious.  One hopes for future exposition of motivation.  Some facts came to Isabella in May of 2009 from her father.  Maria was the restrained subject in the room; the two priests and the nun were performing an exorcism on Maria.  The father died three days later.\n    Eight minutes in.  I hate this movie.  Isabella's film is so badly made it hurts to watch it.\n    Isabella contacts the exorcism school, and they allow her to conduct interviews and to film classes and the like.  Nice of them; of course, they have been doing who knows what to Maria for 20 years.\n    The video of the possessed patients that is shown in the school is of a fifth style, which is the worst of them all: grey on grey, low contrast, small images, iffy sound.\n    The admission to Centrino was described to Isabella's father by the Church as an act of forgiveness.  Perhaps the Church was asking for forgiveness from him for what they did to his wife.\n    Isabella's film traces her route into Centrino, then her discussion with the chief medic, then the first visit with Maria.  Maria is largely non-responsive.  Maria keeps saying connect the cuts for a while.  She does not recognize Isabella or the likelihood of her being her daughter.  She tells Isabella that she should not have killed her child, then goes off the deep end.\n    She meets with two of the exorcists, Ben Rawlings and David Keane, and shows them the interviews.  Isabella and the exorcists delve into what's legal and not regarding exorcisms post 1999, when the Church changed the rules on the subject.  They convince Isabella and crew to witness one of their off-the-books exorcisms.\n    That involved quite a performance by Bonnie Morgan.\n    Isabella, Keane, and Rawlings discuss what, if anything, they can do for Isabella's mother Maria.\n    They finagle getting into Centrino and seeing Maria semi-privately with Maria in a highly medicated state.  Maria goes to sleep on them, which is a sign that they are barking up the wrong tree.  The Maria goes off on them, screaming with eyes widely dilated, and then proceeding to say all sorts of nasty things, in German and English.\n    The hospital staff intervene.  No surprise there.\n    They consider options; they could approach the Church with the new video, or they could use Doctor Costa's recommendation might get a transfer back to the States.\n    Things start to fall apart toward the end.  The camera man, the exorcists, and Isabella are all upset and on edge.  The Church is investigating the incident at Centrino, for one thing, and Michael is feeling massively unappreciated.  David nearly drowns a baby that he was baptizing.  Things get worse after that.\n\n---------Scores---------\n\n\n    Cinematography: 0/10  Uses many styles, most of which are terrible to look at.\n\n    Sound: 6/10 Uneven.\n\n    Acting: 8/10 The actors are fairly good at faking documentary style. The contortionist Bonnie Morgan was impressive as Rosa Sorlini.\n\n    Screenplay: 8/10 Reasonably good for clear narrative and exposition of motivations. I would have rated this four stars if the camera work had been competent.",

Also, when did the demons get such a potty mouth? Taking a page from The Exorcist? The film does copy off of previous possession films which makes it not as original. The characters are unbelievable and not sympathetic so you don't care about what happens to them. There are some good little scares with the mother who the film is somewhat centered around with her possession, what a chilling performance. However with a horrible ending, the movie is just ruined. The audience comes wanting to be entertained, not feel like they just got slapped in the face as the director is counting their money laughing to the bank.",
