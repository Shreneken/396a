Though they may bend the rules, their honor and dedication to the job are unquestioned. Taylor and Zavala always have each other's back, even if Taylor's surreptitious filming of their daily activities for a college course is a bit ill-advised. All hell breaks loose for the officers when they run afoul of a vicious Mexican cartel.",

Gyllenhaal is good, as always.  After that you have the stock Mexican-American character aptly filled in by Pena, although not much to work with.  Anna Kendrick does what she does best; filling in a cardboard cutout of a pretty girl next door cop wife who looks good in a dress and cries a little.  A big waste of time and the shakycam found footage aspect is annoying (someone asked me if we needed to reset my router to improve the streaming quality).",

Kendrick does well in the few scenes that she has and really builds a strong relationship with the main character. The film mainly focuses on procedure and the daily beat of the main men, but provides action in an effective manner. The events leading up to the climax are muddled, but the final scenes pack a real punch. The muddle comes from the existence of a few stock antagonists that contrast in colour and depth to the the complicated and fleshed main pair. This leads, ultimately, to a film where the police force is almost canonised in favour of tackling the unnuanced ugliness of their surroundings. While putting the focus upon the human sides of police officers is by no means a negative objective, one cannot help but feel that the interchangeability and randomness of the main physical conflict detracts from what still is an immensely serviceable cop action-drama.",

            "content": "Ride of a Lifetime: Review of End of Watch\n\tAction packed and a mix of emotions, \"End of Watch\" keeps the audience on their toes at all times. This eye catching movie makes it hard to stop watching even for a second. As we dive into the movie, we experience up close the day in the life of two LAPD gang department officers, Miguel Zavala and Brian Taylor. This duo has their own take on a typical day policing their assigned neighborhoods, and Taylor does not hold back on giving the inside scoop of everything as he films various encounters for his film class. \nThe main thing that sets this movie aside from so many others is the way in which it was filmed. Instead of a typical relaxed, steady film, we have scenes that jump from one to another without leaving any gaps in between for anything. Zavala and Taylor will be at their morning meeting one second and will be knocking doors over and discovering gruesome crime scenes within seconds apart! The jumps from one scene to another works in favor of the film since it presents it in a way that the viewer feels that they too are living in this hectic police officer type of day when one second you can be cruising and everything is fine, and the second you can be part of a wild goose chase with a guy who just ran a red light. \n\tOfficers Zavala and Taylor's work is not only action packed police calls most street cops would never go to throughout their whole career; it is also a ride of a lifetime which ultimately determines the fate of both cops. This duo goes above and beyond their job requirements, they look further into cases and ‚Äònormal' traffic stops which earns them great recognition and they search for any slight clue that might bring them closer to make the neighborhood a safer place. \n\tThese longtime partners go through everything together and do basically everything together ranging from Quinceaneras to weddings, all the way to responding to calls in one of Los Angeles' most dangerous cities. These officers are not afraid to bend the rules slightly in order to do the best that they can to protect the people in their city, so much so that when one of them runs into a burning house on fire, the other one goes right behind him as if there's no tomorrow without a second guess as to why they are running into the house instead of waiting for the firefighters. \n\tThe emotional connection that this movie draws between the audience and the storyline is much to real to ignore. This movie feels like it can be relatable to many different people whether you are thinking of joining the police force or not. This movie shows just how genuine a friendship can be and how strong a partnership can and should be as well. Throughout the movie there are many instances that may foreshadow events that may happen in the near future, some good and some that are not the very best. This movie is important because the meaning of it and the message taken out of it is so increbibely enriching that it is not easy to forget about afterwards. \n\tOverall, this movie was beyond a feather of doubt jam packed with everything that a five star movie should include and should display throughout itself. The emotion packed into each and every scene transforms this movie from a typical Hollywood movie into a jumpy and vlog style type film which is extremely lively and exciting to watch. The dramatically different style of film depicted the hectic type of lifestyle that comes with being a law enforcement officer. Also, the amount of dedication shown for the job by both officers is immaculate. I believe that this movie was made specifically for people that needed that extra push and that extra motivation in order to be the best version of themselves possible. The tragic and extreme twist at the end of the story is a huge eye opener, not only to the characters in the movie, but also to the audience that has been following along with the police officer's daily assignments and phone calls.",

            "content": "If you ever want to watch a cop movie then this should be the first one you watch or show to someone. It's such a raw and powerful movie. Some people may not like how it's filmed but I love it. It's shot documentary style but by doing that it brings you in with our lead two characters so much more. The whole film is based around them and their day to day life on the beat in a really dodgy L.A. neighbourhood. What these two see and have to go through each day is tough on anyone and they both show a ton of restraint and resiliency that I'm sure most people would wish that cops in the real world would show as well. \n\nThis film is really a character study on officers Taylor and Zavala. We get really close and personal with them and get to see how tight they are as friends and not just partners. They basically share their lives together and go through some of their toughest moments together. Despite going through some horrible things the one thing that is never questioned is their friendship. This in a way is the ultimate buddy cop film. It only makes what happens during the events of the movie more gut wrenching. It's also a testament to how great the performances of both Gyllenhaal and Pena are. Pena in particular I've never seen in such a great role. We are really drawn to both these characters and as an audience are emotionally invested in their fates. \n\nWith everything going on in the world at the moment cops get a tough time. Some obviously deserve it but this film shows that some are good people and heroes as well. This movie just feels so realistic and it's refreshing to see. It doesn't need the big budget and ridiculous stunts and cheesy back and forth. It feels like a real friendship and real scenarios that could happen. You're invested from minute one up until the last moment. \n\nOne thing I will say is that if you don't like a tough watch emotionally this may not be for you. If you fancy a good cry though then this is definitely the film for you. End Of Watch is a phenomenal movie and it's inclusion on this list was never in doubt in my mind. Director David Ayer absolutely nailed the presentation and the performances speak for themselves. This film is an absolute necessity. \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

You can tell in several instances that the developers of this film were trying to provide something impactful and hard-hitting but it's because of my aforementioned gripes that this film did the opposite of what they intended to do. The handheld, \"Cloverfield-esque\" filming style is a plus, given the fact that the characters have body cams and camcorders to add different points of view between characters--but it seems unrealistic in some scenes. Are we expected to believe that cops are filming themselves with handheld cameras during a shootout? Please...how can you even attempt to make a realistic film when a large percentage of it is the opposite? To conclude, this film could've done more but it seems that the writer, director and other developers settled for less.",

The conclusion of this movie was the best part, and it was perfectly scripted and executed by the cast. The only critic I would make of this movie is that the plot was unclear until the end, which left the audience confused at the beginning.

            "content": "'End of Watch' (2012)\n\"Longtime LAPD partners and friends, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pe√±a) patrol one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Though they may bend the rules, their honor and dedication to the job are unquestioned. Taylor and Zavala always have each other's back, even if Taylor's surreptitious filming of their daily activities for a college course is a bit ill-advised. All hell breaks loose for the officers when they run afoul of a vicious Mexican cartel.\" 'End of Watch' is a raw and realistic take on the found-footage and crime/drama genre. It blends comedic and everyday situations into some gritty underworld scenarios that we find our two leads in throughout the events of the film. This really serves as a testament to law enforcement, the brutal realities and highs-and-lows that they can face. Pretty much all of the cast does excellent jobs here, coming off perfectly authentic and believable for the purpose of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as always, Frank Grillo, Anna Kendrick, and David Harbour are also exceptionally real here; although the big surprise for me was Michael Pe√±a. I was never a very big fan of him as an actor, but I can easily say this is his best role and he really brought a lot to this film. As far as more of the technicalities go, it's shot in very true-to-life fashion. The cinematography overall is good and much it is actually shot in dash-cam or POV camera style, which adds to the authenticity. It can however at times feel a bit too jarring for its own good. There's also quite a bit of shaky cam when it comes to the action, even when it's not shot from POV perspective, and that was pretty disorienting as well, but I admit it still suited the nature of the movie. Its depiction of everyday life for law enforcement, as well as its dark and light contrasts was really captivating and portrayed respectably. It takes you on an emotional rollercoaster of laughter, sadness, anxiety, and even some gruesome and mortifying moments. My only real quarrels with 'End of Watch' involves much of the lesser cast and supporting characters. A lot of their acting just didn't come off convincing, perhaps even trying a bit too hard at times. Also the plot really doesn't have a set path, it seems to meander and deviate into a lot of very separate events, which some may ultimately see as having lacked focus. I'm a bit in the middle when it comes to the storyline, I enjoyed the random everyday events that our leads find themselves caught up in, but I also tend to prefer a concise and set plot-line for films. There isn't a whole lot more I can delve into without entering spoiler-territory, so if you're a fan of the found-footage genre, or just looking for a solid crime/drama blended with comedy, then you will certainly like this one.\n\nMy Rating - 7/10",

Their chemistry was the star of the film. Anna Kendrick (Janet Taylor) was great as always, while Natalie Martinez (Gabby Zavala) was a strong supporting character. Director David Ayer gets how to do cop movies and this is some of his best work. Opting to have some of the scenes shot from Go Pro style cameras being used by the officers made for a unique experience. The film is ripe with tense and emotional moments all throughout. It's one of the more memorable police dramas I can ever recall. The closing scene is unforgettable and blew me away, taking turns I never expected or saw coming.\n\nWeaknesses: As cool as I felt the handheld camera stuff worked in some cases, it felt overused. There were times we saw it when it wasn't really needed. Though the movie doesn't even reach two hours, a handful of scenes feel like they're just there to fill time. As great as the closing action scene is, the way the movie cuts back for the very final scene feels odd. It just shows a moment of friendship between Brian and Miguel. It's nice, but it doesn't add much to the characters or their relationship and seems like a lesser note to finish it on.\n\nOverall: The movie ends on a weird note and has some moments that don't quite click. That still doesn't keep it from being a great film. The two leads worked extremely well together and there were so many emotional moments that you can't help but be captivated.",

David Ayer's smart concept to project it through each perspective is admirable but unfortunately doesn't go as anticipated because of its wafer thin script and undercooked characters (not the lead ones). Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are brilliant in their parallel lead role and so is Anna Kendrick in a supporting role although she doesn't have much to factor in, among with other cast. End Of Watch has its strength (the chemistry between the lead actors) and moments (the burning house sequence) where the audience cannot not be moved by it, but the series of events feels redundant in the end as it fails to bind it all.",

But regardless this film has many problems. The acting of the supporting cast is just awful (it feels like they waste their budget on getting Pe√±a, Gyllenhaal and Kendrick so they only managed to get cheap actors for the rest of the cast), it has tonal issues as you can literally go from our two lead laughing and hanging out to LA violence, the story comes off as rushed as many of its scenes don't feel intertwined and the editing doesn't help either (while I respect the fact that Ayer tried to go the opposite direction of the corrupt cops from \"Training Day\", this script is just poorly written and more than predictable), and its directing style comes off as obnoxious very often. Granted it works in the action sequences when there is shaky cam or you cut from a handheld shot to an average shot scene (where the camera is placed correctly) it disorients you. \n\n\"End of Watch\" is an interesting failure that while I give full props for trying to tell a grounded story of the LAPD in the most realistic way possible, it still has a rushed story and its directing style doesn't completely work and will take you out of the film in more than one occasion. Nice try Ayer but not nice enough as other than the two leads and the found footage like style there isn't much to say about this film.",

I truly mean that and the proof is all of his performances. He's been in so many amazing films in the past few years and has excelled in all of them. The way he's able to take on so many different roles makes him a quadruple threat and this is yet another impressive film to add to his resume. His chemistry with Michael Pena is fantastic and I hope they come together on another film. It's always a treat when you see a pair, or group of actors work so well together. They build off each other to deliver this natural script that feels very real and their performances are something to behold.\n\nDavid Ayer has created a couple of real gritty movies in \"End of Watch\" and \"Fury\", giving you a realistic and ugly visual treat. He doesn't hold back on content in this film and although it's not filled with disturbing pictures around every corner, there's no doubt that it's in here. He shows that the drug cartel is not one to be messed with and a lot of messed up stuff happens. He manages to deliver a great story and some memorable moments. \n\nOne thing Ayer seems to struggle with is making relatable and likable characters. He often goes for a more realistic depiction which works, but there are a couple moments where you look at his characters and just consider them to be plain asshol*s. \"Fury\" is a great example of that and in both films, the redemption often comes from the climax or the action, so I hope to see a better characters in future Ayer films.\n\nThis is also one of the best found footage movies I have ever seen. The entire movie isn't found footage per say, but it's shot like one. The camera angle on screen isn't always someone holding the camera, which I actually like. It still looks like found footage without all of the awkward and awful camera angles. It's a great mix between found footage and actual footage, while all keeping the style of a found footage movie. Their excuse to film is not so original but either way, it made for a realistic and unique experience that not many cop films can offer.\n\nIn the end, this is another fantastic film starring my favorite actor, and even though I admire him, that doesn't stop me from giving my honest opinion about the movie. This is an excellent, well made film that deserves all the praise it gets and I'm proud to own it on blu ray.",

I mean these guys are totally charming and you can tell they're having a blast. Throw in a little Anna Kendrick and I am a happy camper, even if she did feel a bit out of place in this movie. There's nothing wrong with showing the day-to-day adventures of cops in a dangerous city, and most of the things they did in this movie came across as extremely authentic (as if a police consultant was always right next to them every moment, showing them how it's done.) There's just 2 faults that I found in the film that make it one that I will probably never watch again, and one that I can't rate higher. First is a pet peeve of mine that I know others don't mind as much as me, but I prefer a better narrative structure that connects one scene to the next. The movie feels very choppy as it bounces from one night to a different night that could be a week or month later with no warning. The movie lacks some cohesion in my opinion because of the choices they make in how to tell the story.\n\nThe second, and easily the biggest flaw I find in End of Watch, is that it's a stupid found-footage film!! I'm sorry, I know there are people who might enjoy that, but it is an awful way of making movies. They never have a logical explanation for all the shots, so I'm constantly asking myself \"Well, who put a camera there?\" or \"Why would anyone film this?\" Then there is the constant need for people to reference the camera's presence with phrases like \"Get that camera out of my face!\" or \"You can't film this.\" Naturally there are excuses for why people have cameras that is written into the script in some ham-fisted way, but it never makes sense. I want to appreciate the positives in this movie but I'm constantly annoyed, distracted, and even a little bit nauseated by the shaking camera. There is nothing about this film that is made better by the found-footage/documentary style of presentation. It's a shame because there are moments that could be brilliant, and I can't say I was ever bored by End of Watch, but I'll gladly never watch it again.",

Some 'found footage' technique is used here, but there also is some work done with an auctual film crew. The movie is great, it got me hooked on I the two relatable and well developed characters and the ending was just simply incredible. There is a lot of disturbing imagery and the film gets very dark and gritty the more you watch it.

It strays a lot from the usual path these kind of movies take and it's genuinely shocking and sad. Also what bothered me was that half the movie is shot like a found-footage movie, but then there's also scenes where it isn't shot like one. I found it very confusing and it's much better if you stick to just one style of filmmaking. All in all, a pretty damn great movie with brilliant performances, but a rather familiar story that is only special for its ending. I would recommend checking the movie out!",

            "content": "Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel Zavala (Michael Pe√±a) are close friends and partners in the Newton Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in South Central Los Angeles. Taylor, a former Marine, is recording their police activities for a film project. Upon responding to a public disturbance call, Tre, a Bloods gang member, yells racist insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a fight. Zavala beats and arrests him, but wins Tre's respect for not charging him with assault. Later that night, Tre and his fellow Bloods gang members are attacked by a group of Sure√±os in a drive-by shooting and one of Tre's friends is killed. The next day, the officers respond to a noise complaint at a house party full of Sure√±os, where Taylor encounters a gang member named Big Evil, whose truck he later finds is filled with ornately-decorated firearms and a large amount of money.Taylor and Zavala are awarded the Medal of Valor after rescuing two children from a house fire. Upon further investigating a house, they arrest a man who is also in possession of several ornate firearms, and is guarding a cell full of human trafficking victims. When ICE agents arrive, one agent informs the officers that the house is tied to the Sinaloa Cartel, and strongly urges them to \"lay low\" due to possible reprisals. Unfortunately, the Sinaloa Cartel is not impressed by Taylor and Zavala¬¥s constant interfering with their criminal activities so they orders their deaths... \n\nWriter/Director David Ayer is a master of \"realistic\" and gritty violent dramas often putting you more or less in the line of fire together with the actors. \"End Of Watch\" is another great example from Ayer shot in a Cin√©ma v√©rit√© style. The film was shot in a combination of found footage style and traditional photography. Most scenes were captured by four cameras simultaneously these included a handheld camera operated by Gyllenhaal, cameras clipped to Gyllenhaal and Pe√±a's vests, and dashboard footage from their patrol car. Some scenes were shot entirely by Gyllenhaal. This creates such a dynamic and \"alive\" production with a feeling of a FPS game as well. The \"authenticity\" is for sure upgraded due to the fact that as part of their training, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a spent five months doing 12-hour ride-alongs with on-duty LAPD officers. Unlike many other cop dramas, \"End of Watch\" addresses the daily challenges of patrolling the mean streets of South Central and the comradery between the main characters. Initially the film is a bit disjointed and \"messy\" due to the conceptual camera work, but once you have gotten used to the this cinematic method, it truly fits this sort of film. The performances from all involved are strong and you truly believe in the bond and friendship between Taylor and Zavala. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it \"one of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action\", and went on to name the film the fourth best of 2012. Entertainment Weekly¬¥s Lisa Schwarzbaum, who gave the film an A-, described it as \"one of the best American cop movies I've seen in a long time [and] also one of the few I've seen that pay serious attention to what cop life feels like, both on and off duty\". \"End Of Watch\" is dark, brutally violent, and carries strong emotional scenes with impact. The film has its flaws with some clich√©s and racially stereotypical characters, but that doesn¬¥t create an unbalance in my point of view.",

This film is one of the best films I've seen about police men patrolling a very tough area, in this case South Central Los Angeles.  Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena give great performance as two police men who never know what they will find and each day could be their last.  If you haven't seen this movie, you should.

            "content": "There's a gritty authentic feel to this movie. The audience is treated as actual witnesses to what happens on screen. This was established early on with how cameras play into the story. Someone in the movie was almost always holding a camera, driving home the feeling that we are simply observing things. It's not a found-footage movie; most of the time, the perspective isn't from someone filming in the plot. This is good because it allowed much more creative cinematography and kept everything from appearing low-budget. It was nice from time to time to get a 1st-person view from a character.\n\nThe whole success of the movie relied on how good the relationship between the stars was. It was fortunately excellent, another aspect giving this a great authentic feel. They behaved exactly like a pair of best friends. They acted comfortably and natural around one another. They teased one another, got annoyed, got into deep conversations, and enjoyed each other's company. Pe√±a and Gyllenhaal gave a couple star performances bringing these two to life. I get very invested in the well-being of them both.\n\nOne thing that I wish was a little less authentic is how some of the gang members spoke. It annoyed me how much they said \"fuck\". I'm sure there are people who talk like that in real life, especially criminals, but it got stale fast. It irritated me and it was used so much that I got numb to the vulgarity, making it essentially pointless. Not having characters drop the F-bomb every 3 words would not have ruined the experience in any way.\n\nThe story is told in a rather unconventional way. It felt like a highlight reel to me at points. This was actually good in my opinion. There was no unnecessary filler or fodder, still offering a complete and coherent story. The order of events and transitions between moments all make perfect sense without everything feeling as though they're put together too well, too cut and dry. I am a fan of this style. The ending is also very unconventional, even making a time jump backward, and it is a perfect final moment.",

First and foremost the way this movie is shot just doesn't work. It's a part found footage movie, and part flat out poorly shot, because unlike the footage filmed in a horror found footage movie in which all the characters really have to do is film, scream, hide, run away etc, but if you're a cop there's quite a lot you can't film because you're way too busy doing your job, so who  films all that stuff? Well I'm guessing that a ghost of a dead amateur cameraman or something follows the two lead cops around, and occasionally a group of very poorly written street thugs, which partly explains some of the awful camera movements which lets be clear on this are only there to make this feel \"edgy\" and \"real\", despite the fact that the star of the show is an A-list Hollywood actor and this is no more of a real cop movie than say \"Die hard\", or \"Lethal weapon\". And lastly on the subject, no cop would be given permission to film themselves in this way, because it's dangerous, unlawful, and unprofessional, and why the gangs members are also filming themselves is even more nonsensical as there is zero reason behind them doing it. This really wanted to be an overall insight into police life, so there's aimless banter between characters, they bend the rules at times, there's paper work, shoot-outs, boring jobs to do, weddings, births, wives, etc but the fact is that we already know all this stuff, so there really is no insight to anything shown here. It's just a badly shot generic cop movie with a better cast than the material deserves.",

The range of emotion this movie caused me to feel, went from the lowest lows to the highest highs, and everything in between. A nearly perfect blend of comedy/drama/suspense/thriller/action. The cruiser scenes brought back memories of driving around with friends in high school; bantering back and forth about life, laughing non-stop like a cult of cackling coons. Every action scene had my heart pounding louder then any movie I've seen before. It was intense. One last note, the finale had me choking back tears as best I could. (No, I did NOT cry, but the eyes were watery, and it took awhile to dislodge Kermit from the back of my throat). \nAnywhoozles, I just found a new favorite movie.

            "content": "David Ayer certainly does love his cop films, as does Michael Pe√±a because he has played quite a lot of cops in his career and with Pe√±a paired up with Jake Gyllenhaal, these three do wonders.\n\nRight from the very start, the film is interesting and engaging. The film sets up how it means to go on with a camera in the windshield like you'd see on any given cop show, which is done incredibly well, and a majority of it filmed by a handheld camera and I thought it was filmed well actually. Seeing some comments about this being a found footage film moments before I was ready to watch it had me worried but it is done differently and definitely isn't what you think it will be when you hear the words 'found footage'. It looks absolutely beautiful and for what it is trying to do, it works, but it did feel a little strange as with some scenes you would see a character filming scenarios with a camera they are holding but in another scene they would just be walking around without using a camera but are still being filmed. Most of the time you'd hear a character say, 'hey, turn off that camera', so why even have that gimmick in there? It took me out of it for a little bit. But hey, experiment, because that is what film is all about. However, unlike Sabotage, the pov shots of the guns weren't terrible. The soundtrack is also fantastic, using mostly pre-existing songs, it fits the setting very well. \n\nThe key factor in making all of this work, even if the way it was filmed did put you off, is the acting. Like everyone else has already said, this is some of the best on screen chemistry between actors in a film for some time. You really do believe these two care about each other and have been friends long before the film ever started. I read somewhere that most of it was adlibbed and that would make sense just because of how natural all the conversations flow and how funny it all is, the film does have great sense of humor when it needs it, 'Go do your white boy shit', and it all helps to get to know them and follow their story. Some of the other actors here are some from Training Day and its nice to see them in something again and it also features a kick ass debut from Yahira Garcia.\n\nSpeaking of the story though, it isn't a typical three act structure. The film is a slow burner and just shows us their lives that has elements of what is to come in bits and pieces throughout and it flows into that ending so smoothly that it all just feels like one big experience. For its quite short length, it is a long film and not in a bad way, there is just quite a lot of content here for its running time and you get your moneys worth, I'll say that much. The only problem with the whole thing that I had was there was a very dark scene that happened and was a major point in the film, you could see that it was starting to get to one of the characters and it was affecting them quite a bit and the very next scene is a party and that just sort of took me out of it for a bit, again,  just a little bit though! But it just got my attention and made me think about the editor.\n\nThe general consensus on this film is clearly positive although I have heard some people say it is a little fake at parts but at least to me, from the way everything is filmed and how it all plays out, you'd think it was based on a true story. Given how unconventional the ending is, it seemed like it could only be based on a true story. I was loving the film quite a lot but when that ending happened, I loved it all the more, it'd have been more hard hitting if what happened did indeed happen to both but still, the fact that an ending like that is what we got, I'll happily take it, I'm glad it wasn't a 'cop out' as it were. With attention to detail to the paperwork side of being a cop coupled with excellent acting and an engaging story, End of Watch is a fantastic cop drama done right. I will be watching this again often in the future, it is quite excellent.",

Ayer didn't just write this one, he was in the director's seat as well.\n\nThe story tells the tale of two So. Central L.A. cops, Brian (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Michael Pena), who are not just partners in the LAPD, but best friends as well. We get to meet them and their private live as well as see their work, which includes busting crime and navigating the gang landscape of South Central Los Angeles. As they progress in life and in their work, they get a little too close to cartel business and this brings a new set of problems. The movie shows a delicate balance between caring humanity and the edge of police brutality. The mix works well here in building believable characters.\n\nAyer paces the movie well and mixes 'found footage' techniques with standard camerawork and blends them in a way that seems natural. The story is told slowly, with enough attention to detail. It makes the characters come to life. Gyllenhaal and Pena have a really good chemistry, which makes this movie a breeze to watch. They portray friendship and fun in a bleak world.\n\nEven though there's enough comedy here to balance most of the drama, don't expect the movie to be your typical cop buddy film.

This is Los Angeles.  These are police.  So, naturally after 87 movies about corrupt policemen in Los Angeles, there are certain preconceptions.  However, outside of Taylor and Zavala being a tad aggressive, they come off as reasonable, especially in Taylor seeking a mate who he can talk to which he possibly finds in Janet(Anna Kendrick).\r\n\r\nBut where \"End of Watch\" misses a valuable opportunity is that instead of the realistic laid back day to day routine of these characters, we instead get the episodic cartoonish version.  Basically, Zavala and Taylor stumble across every huge bust and rescue situation in Los Angeles over the period of a year.  Yes, the movie does sort of point out the ridiculousness of this but that's really not enough here.",

The film, which was helmed by David Ayer, is unique in that it relies heavily on handheld camcorders used by the officers and others, and police cruiser dash cams. This gives 'Watch' a somewhat voyeuristic feel, but there's nothing creepy about it. While the plot is pretty benign (two officers stumble into a web of Mexican drug cartels that are bent on seeking revenge after some of their activities are thwarted), the film's main strengths lie in the chemistry between Gyllenhaal's and Pena's characters, as they refer to each other as \"brother\" on more than one occasion, and share a lot of life's major events, including weddings and the births of children. As expected, 'Watch' is chock-full of gritty elements, from disturbing, grisly images related to crimes committed to more F-words than one person could utter in six hours, but they make everything seem that much more real for the viewing experience. While 'End of Watch' is not a happy film by any stretch, it still does enough to make a semblance of a connection with the audience, and for that reason, it exceeds other police dramas that came before it, as well as a few that have followed it.",

Written and directed by David Ayer improvising his character with Jake Gyllenhaal as cop Brian Taylor wanting to do a film project of some sort without the viewers fully understanding for what.  With a considerable amount of footage focusing on his long time partner Mike Zavala played by Michael Pe√±a showcasing what Brian does as an active police officer, and it's often by spouting out plenty of cursed words, particularly the \"f\" word.  And because I know a few cops myself, since some of them are people I physically went to high school with, it tends to lose credibility when majority of them speak with dirty filthy mouths.  Therefore, I'm unable to relate to any of the characters shown here.   I'm just saying that the cops that I know are mostly courteous, even when they do the wrong thing since it's also supposed to be part of their demeanor.  The other thing I had trouble with are the camera angles where the camera is supposed to be focusing on one person speaking, and then for some reason without any other cameras around shows the other guy talking as well on a rhythm like they're three to four cameras, and they're really supposed to be just two.  And the cartel thing is probably the most confusing, which centers on a planned hit planned by the cartels on officers Brian and Mike since they had a habit of stumbling onto their secret housing units, and viewers are never informed about other cops informing them of their lives can possibly be in danger.   Which that entire experience alone reminded me like a bunch of actual newspaper clippings with the worst ones put together using only the two main characters of Brian and Mike going through all of them in a spawn of a few months, and to me the odds of that happening is like when seeing pigs fly.

I wasn't sure how I would react to it because often times police type movies get twisted with a negative spin. Although this movie did have some odd parts to it, all in all I was glad that I took the time to watch it. I think sometimes that what police do may seem odd and maybe even insincere to the average civilian, but that is usually because the average person does not understand the intricacies and stresses of the job. Now I am not saying that this is how all police officers act, but I think it helps to understand just how stressful and dangerous this job really is; especially in certain areas. The movie does a really good job of portraying why some of these actions take place and I hope it helps us all understand a bit better what this job entails. This is certainly not a show for the light hearted, but some of the goriness is actually reality. Hiding from it doesn't change that fact of life. The main acting duo does a tremendous job of portraying both the on-duty times and the off-duty times. Police officers are normal people off duty just trying to have a normal life like us all, but when they are on duty they only have themselves and their partners and coworkers for survival. This is probably a movie everyone should watch just to get a better understanding of the people in blue. I know I will probably end up watching it again as well.",

They make some lucky and high-profile arrests and get some notoriety.  They also attract the attention of a Mexican drug kingpin.\n\n    There are some great arrests, as well as significant arrests foiled by federal agencies, plus loss of colleagues.  Taylor's wedding to Janet was quite a talk fest, but was reasonably written and acted.  The rotten camera work, throughout, just put a damper on everything.\n\n    They find more horrible things during routine investigations.  They learn from an informant that there is a paid hit out with their names on it.\n\n    The Mexican gang lures them into a trap and attacks with heavy weaponry. They get a message out calling for backup, which seems dreadfully slow in coming.  Taylor takes one in the hand and later one in the chest.  While Zavala tries to revive Taylor, he is surrounded by gang members who unload dozens of rounds into him.\n\n    Backup arrives and a fire fight immediately ensues.  The assassins are mostly killed.  There is a huge police event afterward for Zavalos, whose body shielded Taylor.\n\n    The last segment, shown after Taylor struggles to say what he feels at Zavala's ceremony, was perhaps the best segment of the film.  This was not so much for the content of their conversation, but for the evident bond between brothers-in-arms.\n\n------Scores-------\n\n    Cinematography: 0/10 The film used button cams, security footage, and various hand-held cameras to give a deeply incompetent presentation.\n\n    Sound: 8/10 Fairly good considering the video.\n\n    Acting: 6/10 Who can tell what the actors are doing when the cameras are out of control?  Gyllenhaal and Pena were great, despite the director's contempt for the viewer; otherwise I would give this category a zero.\n\n    Screenplay: 5/10 Way, way, way too many abrupt cuts.  The thing looks like a quilt made from left over cloth pieces put together with duct tape.",

The cinematography composed of found-footage sequences is effective, but look for no originality here. The true heart of the film actually lies in the direction and the screenplay. David Ayer knows how to use the camera effectively and also knows how to write practically. He squeezes depth out of every moment in the film.

Using some handheld camera footage, the film cleverly switches to an omniscient camera using the same style at specific points, we see the two swapping from the routine vehicle violations to the gruesome discovery of human trafficking as well as getting mixed up in gang violence and its aggressive repercussions. Gyllenhaal and Pe√±a have a believable chemistry which is crucial in such a \"buddy\" movie and there are genuine moments of tension and friction all filmed with an authentic reality in the heat of Los Angeles. A few of the plot points are a bit convoluted but it could be argued that it reflects the haphazard nature of the policeman's job and it hits the obligatory home life signposts that are all too clich√©d in this type of story (new born baby, conflict with girlfriend, job versus family occasion scene) but the film attempts to move forward quickly from these to get us back in the action as soon as it can.

            "content": "Movie Review for \"End of Watch\"\nBeing a police officer is not an easy job, but being a police officer in the streets of Las Angeles, California can be even a tougher job. In the movie \"End of Watch\", two police officers named Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel Zavala (Michael Pe√±a) are committed to keeping crime off the streets and making it safer. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a's acting not only allows you to relate to the movie, but it also keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.\n\t\"End of Watch\" is not your typical action movie. The movie is mostly filmed by Officer Brian Taylors's video camera which allows you to feel more involved in the movie's plot. David Ayer does a good job of introducing us to the plot by starting the movie with the cops fighting crime, but then as the movie goes on showing the dangerous things that cops have to experience sometimes. The most dangerous thing in the movie that the officers have to face is the Mexican drug cartels. The plot of the movie keeps you interested throughout the movie because as time goes on, the two officers have closer encounters with the drug cartels. David Ayer uses the rivalry between the drug cartels and the police officers to not only develop the plot, but keep us interested on what's going to happen next. \n\tThe acting by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a as the two officers is phenomenal. The movie introduces the officers as partners, but throughout the movie you realize it is much more than just partners. The two officers throughout the movie develop a friendship that makes us wonder if these two actors are actual best friends. David Ayer does a good job throughout the movie showing us the friendship of the officers by having good dialogue and comedic conversations. For instance, the two officers would always talk about one another's life, family, and struggles while driving around the streets. Another way good acting is portrayed in the movie is when the two officers are being shot at by the drug cartels. The two actors make it seem believable that they are in actual danger by their emotions and dialogue. For example, Officer Taylor's emotions can be seen when he says to his partner in a brave but concerned voice, \"Look at me. On three, dude, you're gonna empty your mag and run.\" The overall acting in the movie is outstanding and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a do a superb job of presenting the challenges officers encounter every day.\n\tMost people can relate to the movie when it comes to trying to start or raising a family, but still having to go to your every day job. Officer Miguel Zavala says \"Marriage is forever, it's a promise before god.\" This quote represents society's outlook on marriage and marriage is also a stepping stone to starting a family. In the movie the officers are both married and trying to have kids, but at the same time working at the police station. People can relate to this because most people want to have a family and a descent job they are proud of doing. The two officers obviously know the dangers of being a police officer, which is also another reason some people can relate to the movie. For example, some people have jobs that don't always guarantee they will be home that night. \"End of Watch\" represents how some people can relate to the movie by showing the importance of friendship, relationships, or even the positives of raising a family.     \n\t\"End of Watch\" shows the struggles and benefits police officers face every day. David Ayer does an excellent job of not making this a typical cop movie. \"End of Watch\" is a must see movie that wont have you disappointed. Overall the movie is an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie.",

That being said, End of Watch is the best police film I've seen since Training Day, which comes to no surprise that Training Day's writer is also End of Watch's writer/director. The chemistry between the two leads is what really sells this picture, without that it would be dead. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena should have been considered for an Oscar nomination last year and the found footage never really got in the way since the whole movie is handheld. Only two things annoyed me in this film: the high rate of dangerous situations these two self proclaimed ghetto cops get into, and that in certain crazy dangerous situations, the two cops and/or the gangsters chasing them are still holding a camcorder. Slightly idiotic. That aside, End of Watch is an emotionally charged, dark and powerful cop thriller with plenty of action. Wish I had seen this earlier.",

In other words, I went to see the movie having pretty high expectations for actors as well as over all work of director. Usually movies don't really come close to the expectations (because trailers make movies seem so amazing, while in reality it may not even be worth watching), but \"The End of Watch\" exceeded my expectations. At first it was a little hard to get used to the portable camera and crooked movie shots, but at the same time, it made it seem more realistic that if the movie shots would have been positioned perfectly. Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena did a great job by embodying their roles as well as making the audience feel that they were actual cops. Film \"The End of Watch\" shows what a real friendship is, it also shows the dedication, and struggles that police officers face from all over the world. I would rate this movie 5 stars.",

            "content": "(If you haven't watched this movie yet and want to, this review contains major spoilers): Top critics have been rating this film in the four and five star boundaries and I simply do not understand why; it did not exceed my expectations. Immediately upon seeing what the movie was called, I knew that there had to be a death at the end of the movie and the character to die had to be a protagonist. So, no brownie points for David Ayer, the writer/director of this movie, as its ending at face value is pretty predictable. It's a cop-flick. \n\nFurthermore, I was confused whether or not this was a handheld movie or a fly-on-the-wall movie. I appreciate that Ayer was trying to be original and go with a \"found footage\" style, similar to Cloverfield, but there were so many camera angle pitfalls. Who was recording the Brian and Janet love scenes? Who was recording the prank that Brian and Mike pulled off in the police station? A \"found footage\" film should only be recorded with a handheld camera! I lost count at the amount of times I rolled my eyes. \n\nAnother bad thing about this movie was that it took so much time to get started and went with a very clich√©d introduction. Brian introducing himself with a handheld camera in a locker room is somewhat similar to the Paranormal Activity introductions, am I right? \n\nAlso, I found that I got bored once I reached the middle of the movie. This was because the film shone too much light upon the protagonists' relationships with their partners and simply trailed off. It was only towards the end that things got exciting, thanks to some very suspenseful scenes. To name a few, Brian and Mike enter a bungalow to find dead bodies and also have to fight their way out of an apartment complex after being ambushed by Latino gang members. I know, it's very seen-it-all-before stuff, but these scenes make the film dramatically intense and cleverly show the dangers involved by being an LA police officer. \n\nFor the suspenseful scenes, I give one star. The other star I give to Gyllenhaal and Pena and their outstanding performances throughout the movie. They made their characters unutterably believable and didn't overdo it with the comedy, which the absolutely awful cop-flick Bad Boys does. Half a star goes to the dialogue, which wasn't too bad despite swearing being used where unnecessary. \n\nOverall, this is a watchable film but average. The villians could have been slightly more realistic and less clich√© and the story could have been put together a little better. On the bright side, at least Ayer's story in End of Watch is far better than the tedious story he made up for Training Day.",

Once it picked up though, David Ayer's vision came into focus and the story picked up substantially, which is strange considering Ayer's track record in movies is poor to say the least. This movie is carried by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena's performances, which are both spectacular. The story, though interesting, is surface deep and the gang they face off against isn't exactly believable. In addition to that, half of the decisions Gyllenhaal and Pena make are pretty irrational and at times plain stupid. I genuinely hope that there performances are not factual representation of any police department. The half-and-half found footage/normal cinematography occasionally detracts from the drama and is confusing for the audience at times, but overall I thought they handled it well. I cannot stress enough how the two lead performances single handedly made this film what it is. Bottom line, this is an innovative, stylish look at an old story, and is a very solid movie.

However, this blatant disregard for cinematic protocol comes with a major upside, which was taken advantage of to the fullest: Intimacy. The use of camcorders made the fourth wall seem like a thin layer of drywall that your neighbors can hear you whisper through. Intimacy breeds familiarity, making it much, much easier to love the characters. That is why this movie works. Characterization is the highest law in storytelling.

And this is where the film thrives, in it's characters, and how they develop throughout time.\n\nBut there are problems. The story, although interesting, is slightly generic in some respects- as the villains are as cliche as they come. As with all the other characters you get such realism and interesting back stories etc. With the gang, there is no depth, but just aggressive people who like to shoot people... because they're aggressive.\n\nYou would think that this would lower the score more, but actually their particular story doesn't develop until that much later in the film, and it doesn't affect the film that much. They are just something that affects their relationship, to see an effect on the two cops- and to be honest I think the film would have been just as entertaining, without the threat and the different gangs, but just to see the day to day life of these characters.\n\nAn interesting watch and insight into how the L.A.P.D. works, but is let down slightly by some cliche characters.",

However, it still gets what it wants by being a true to life buddy cop film with a ridiculous amount of intensity. End of Watch looks pretty simple as a crime thriller, but everything is actually brilliant. The crimes are grim and the action is a load of thrills. But what really makes this film so appealing is the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a. Their bromantic moments keeps the entire film so charming. The rest of End of Watch is engaging and interestingly gripping.\n\nThe story is about the lives of the lead pair. As these police officers patrol around the streets, they spend their time talking and joking around until they see something going on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe√±a brings it to life. Their chemistry is the magic of this film. When it gets serious it becomes really intense, makes you wish both of them are safe on their dangerous jobs. The common elements of cop movies are explosions and stylish gunfights, but this film is all about tension and momentum.\n\nThe found-footage style is as messy as what the recent found-footage film, Chronicle, did. Which falls into being unnecessary. It sometimes gets shots that aren't filmed on any hand-held cameras. The camera-work is still well shot and serves a different experience, but it could have been something like what action directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor(strangely has the same name of the main character), do. Shaking the camera ridiculously without calling it a found-footage film. If you ignore the style, it would be cool. The quality of the film is being realistic and there it succeeds. They left the impossibly cool police movie stuff behind and instead make them simply scrutinize, arrest, and watch the streets.\n\nEnd of Watch doesn't have much of a concept but to depict the credible lives of these hero cops. While the lead stars shine on their beautiful down-to-earth bromance, there's a grim reality about to affect their lives thus makes this an indeed so compelling film. Still, it could have been a Crank like film than a found-footage. The crazy cam is a great effect, but not the characters holding the camera. Aside from that, it's a top notch thriller that is easy enough to enjoy. Worth a ride and recommended.",

Plenty of laughs add to the overall brilliant film that mostly overcomes the drawback of handheld style that I hate. It works for the vast majority of the film and the addition of regular camera work helped but some scenes i would have preferred more stationary cameras to capture more performance, but this is a small defect in a otherwise incredibly moving film.",

The villains earned every bit of your spite, showing \"gangsters\" for the poser punks they are while not making caricatures of them. The supporting characters supported without necessarily having a big plot tie-in. The law enforcement situations might not have been entirely typical (they only show the nerve-wracking calls), but I loved the fact that they didn't focus on ONE scenario. Kind of made it feel like 20 movies in one. I was never bored watching and I get sick to death of watching action movies with the same plot. Really does justice to the dangers those in law enforcement make. Overall, the film makers lived up to what they were aiming for - making it all seem REAL. Outstanding acting from entire cast. Still reminding myself those \"gangsters\" were just paid actors.",

David Ayer supposedly spent only six days writing the script and it shows, merely creating the basic elements of a safe, cohesive, and marketable plot. Ayers, known for his shrill, marketable approach to filmmaking, chose the trendy documentary-style cinematography, which is supposed to increase the realism or believability of the \"footage.\" Here, it consistently does the opposite and ends up a jumbled mess of first-person and third-person perspectives. Ayers needed a reason why our protagonist cop is carrying a camera, and conveniently has him enrolled in a film class. Are the gang bangers in film class, too? One of the them films themselves and the crew in the car as they heatedly argue -- with guns pointed at each other -- over plans to kill police officers. The other kicker is that the gang's leader yells to get the camera out of his face, while little does he know there are at least 3 more in the car that none of them are even aware of. Yes, Ayers betrays his own movie, as not only does the \"amateur\" footage look produced, but the majority of the movie is in 3rd person with cameras not present in the story. All that is really accomplished here is 10 minutes of the movie filled with characters complaining about being filmed. Readers would be better served watching any two episodes of The Wire, even if they've already been seen.",

Anna Kendrick is sweet, as always and although her role was under-used, she still made an impact.

They're not squeaky clean, but they're confident and maintain a levity that is refreshing, especially when things get heavy.  The climax is tough, but I so appreciate that the filmmakers decided not to simply beat us over the head and walk away.  They could have left us broken, but that wasn't the point of this film.",
