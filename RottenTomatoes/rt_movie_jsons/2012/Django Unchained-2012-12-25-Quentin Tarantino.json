This is a perfect 10/10 movie, it doesn't get better than taking down some racists in a comical, gruesome way. The dark horror  is-amazing as well as some accurate depictions of what happened to African-Americans in the 1800s, I'm not saying all of it was accurate but you get the point. The acting doesn't get any better and Tarantino killed the cinematography category. The only thing I felt was missing was 17 screens so I could watch the beauty of this movie play out 17 times in front of me, one might say that's a user error though, idk.",

            "content": "Muy buena película, de mis favoritas de Quentin Tarantino. Sin duda lo mejor de esta película esta en la connotación racista de la misma. Se encarga de dejar la acción en un segundo plano y primero centrarse en profundizar la historia, para después terminar elevándola con escenas de acción simplemente increíbles. Demostrando mas en esta película que en otras cintas del director en des glorificar la violencia. Da pie a diálogos y escenas de acción simplemente épicos. Me gusta mucho como muestra la transformación de los personajes, y en su ideología y porque \"creen\" tener la razón y sobre todo mostrando las diferentes perspectivas de los personajes, pudiendo profundizar aún mas la historia y a los personajes. A todo este se le añade una actuación casi perfecta de todos los actores involucrados; tanto Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson y sobre todo Leonardo DiCaprio. Otra cosa que me encantó de la película fue el uso de acción que tiene la misma; siempre teniendo un propósito y nunca cortando la trama. Tiene como base la típica formula que ya le conocemos a Tarantino; una violencia en muchos casos llegando al gore y hasta pareciendo una parodia por el abuso de la sangre. Creo que no es una película para todo el mundo, pero el que la logra disfrutar le va a parecer una obra maestra y la va a recordar muy bien. En conclusión, me parece una película excelente, con un guion muy bueno, personajes muy memorables, escenas de acción impresionantes y una trama entretenida. Muy recomendada.",

Django Unchained has some gorgeous cinematography and sound design, combine that with beautiful production design and costumes and you get a visually pleasing movie. Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson and Leonardo Di Caprio are all academy nominated level good, they all have their own scenes to shine in. The thing that took me out of the movie sometimes, was the use of modern music, sometimes it worked, however most of the time it definitely didnt. The thing I probaly most like about Django Unchained, is it use of style. Tarentino is not afraid to heavily zoom in or use stylish blood, which makes the movie so much more interesting to look at.",

As you'd expect from Tarantino, it is beautifully shot, intelligently written with plenty of memorable dialogue, and is filled with interesting characters.  As you'd also expect from Tarantino, it's filled with ridiculous excesses.  Clocking in at almost three hours, the final thirty minutes is filled with absurd violence that detracts from everything that came before it.

This movie is wild as most of Tarantino's work and it clearly is a revenge story of a black slave getting back on the white slaveholders a topic he sort of addresses in Hateful Eight. Jamie Fox and Waltz are an incredible duo with great chemistry as they around killing people left and right, of course Waltz's presence is strong with his signature charisma. Leonardo Dicaprio dazzles as Candy a white sophisticated slave holder who plays good manors until he reveals the darker side of himself and is terryfing. This movie is fun even as it offends with the repeated use of the n word, and gory violence. Django is a likeable character and we cheer for him as he sets out on his journey. I cannot forget to mention the smaller but significant role of Sam Jackson as a slave serving Candie who's actually in support of slavery and racist himself and hates Django, a cringy role but one where Jackson delivers in a memorable performance. An academy award winning screenplay with great performances and great direction by Tarantino this might be one of my favorite tarantino films.",

From the cinematography to the slight comedic relief at times, I knew this film wasn't going to have the typical slave narrative we've been accustomed to. The film did a decent job at touching on the dynamic between white and Black people during the 1800's. The first scene between Django and Dr. Schultz, with Dr. Schultz buying Django from the slave owner, we see the beginning of what seems to be another \"white savior\" narrative. I was quickly mistaken when realizing that throughout the movie Dr. Schultz might've played the role as someone \"saving\" Django, but ultimately only served as a catalyst in Dango's journey to save his lover. The relationship between the two characters is mutual in that Dr. Schultz uses Django to find the Brittle Brothers and Django uses Dr. Schultz to find his way back to his love, Broomhilda. One character that stood out to me the most was Sheba. She's a Black woman in Mr. Candie's home. Unlike the other Black women/salves, she's bejeweled from head to toe, dressed in elaborately rich clothing, all while sipping  alcohol from the upstairs bar. Her name, Sheba, is a reference to the Queen of Sheba from the Old Testament in the Bible. Sheba means \"is very rich\" and stood out to me because it's also a reference to Ethiopian literature. Additionally, throughout the film we see the cinematography used when zooming into characters from a wide angle and quickly into a close shot, we also follow the character arc of Django who was once a slave, soon become a free man, and later save his love all while defying the odds of what it meant to be a Black man at the time.",

            "content": "My first time watching Django Unchained was last week. The movie deals with a lot of different issues such as slavery, gruesome violence, and race for example. When I first watched it, there were some scenes that I found to be disturbing. I find that Tarantino over-use of the n-word in his films, and not just this particular film, can come off as offensive for some. But within this particular film, because of the historical time-period the movie was set in, the use of the n-word was said on a daily basis. Reminds me that there are certain people that can't say the word in today's society.  Freedom here is a major theme. In my opinion, the theme of being a white savior was also present in the film. It is this false belief or implying that African-Americans need white people to \"save them\" or to \"rescue them\" in order for them to have a better life. In my opinion, the character Dr. King Schultz played that role a little bit when he freed Django. Towards the end of the movie, we see that Django has gained the knowledge and skills that were taught by Schultz once he died, to go rescue his wife and Django being able to live as a a man without Schultz. There are a few things I think the film does well on and what the film doesn't do so well. One strength of the film is that the cinematography was so captivating and every little detailed was seen. There was a scene where one of the slave owners was shot by Django and we see the slave owners blood splattered onto the white cotton. This movie reminded me of a slave getting revenge on their slave owners and taking back their freedom. One weakness I thought the film could have done better was the way Broomhilda's character was portrayed. She was more of a physical entity as we can see from her being abused and sexually assaulted. There were other woman character's that had a different role, but I do wonder if she wasn't Django's wife, would Broomhilda still have gone through what she went through? Overall, I would recommend to watch this movie to others.",

Though a western film, Django isn't a cowboy hero, rather a free slave anti-hero. He's neither good nor bad, but is a steadfast individual who ends up learning a whole lot from the German bounty hunter who freed him. The only thing he wants back is his beloved wife, but ends up facing brutal violence, harsh negotiating, and formidable plantation owners. The fiery revenge in Django's attitude throughout the film gives the feeling that he might explode at any given second, yet he somehow fastens it to a leash. He is an attentive, patient, yet zealous man slowly making his way from the bottom to the top. The use of wide angle filming in this movie captures every bit of vivid landscape imaginable in 19th century Texas, giving the viewers a deeper appreciation for Tarantino's masterful filming in which he habitually displays. Really can't say much more than this. Just watch it now.",

One of the things is how the director used old legends to foreshadow the events that eventually unfolded at the end of the film. This happens when the german dentist told Django the story of Broomhilda, which is a character in the most popular old German legend. \nAnother thing that makes the movie amazing is the beautiful cinematography along with the music. It immerses the audience and makes them feel like they are part of the adventures of Django. The movie also has an interesting take on the social commentary as it highlights the issue of slavery. It does this not only by portraying the mistreatment of African Americans but also by showing that some slaves like being obedient to a master or \"the white man\" because it has been embedded in their minds that slavery is something that can not go away and is here to stay. This gives rise to an interesting argument about the character of Samuel L Jackson. It makes the audience question whether the character is mistreating Django because he has been washed by the system or is he just an evil character. \n\tFinally, the film takes an interesting take on who the antagonist is. This is because unlike other films(such as Inglourious Basterds which is also directed by Tarantino) where the whole movie from the beginning to the end builds up to fight the antagonist, as this movie progresses, the antagonist changes, and Django finds himself fighting new enemies. Overall, I would give this film a 5 out of 5 stars.",

Not the words I thought I'd ever use to describe a movie with slavery, violence, gore, and nudity, but Quentin Tarantino has without a doubt made one of the best movies of the decade with Django Unchained. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a daring ex-slave, who teams up with a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, played by Christopher Waltz, to rescue his enslaved wife. First off, I have to say that I have never seen Jamie Foxx this charismatic in any role prior or since, he hits every note of his character perfectly, Django is tough and gritty, rash but methodical, smart but inexperienced. And every aspect of that character shows in Foxx's flawless performance. Christopher Waltz, as well, is incredibly charming, and downright loveable as the lethal but principled German doctor/bounty hunter. Leonardo DiCaprio as the plantation owner Calvin Candie manages to perform his heart out in what should've been an Oscar nomination, I mean that whole bit about Frenology was hands down brilliant. The fact is, it is Tarantino's ability to not only write his characters with remarkable depth, but also give the actors the freedom to perform to their heart's content, that fleshes out and completes many facets of the film that would be otherwise empty. Tarantino can be, as usual, a bit overindulgent, there are a number of scenes not relevant to the plot that if deleted, would have ended about ~30-40 minutes earlier. However, I'd also argue that the extra runtime grants each actor more time to shine and by proxy make the overall film better. \nSpeaking of indulgent, the classic Tarantino violence is just as prevalent in Django Unchained, revolver shots blow body parts off and launch people into the air with spectacular blood, smoke and sound. Yet the violence in this film is also more restrained, more conservative and less gratuitous than many of Tarantino's other movies, likely because he smartly sticks with the use of simple handheld revolvers and pistols for the most part. With Tarantino's signature R-rated style, some of the best performances by the best actors of the decade, and a classic (yet new) Western plot that does not hold back even a drop of blood and sweat, Django Unchained is a downright brilliant film, and one of Tarantino's absolute best. It 100% deserves to be seen again, and again, and again.",

Demostrando mas en esta película que en otras de Quentin Tarantino en des glorificar la violencia. Dando pie a diálogos y escenas de acción simplemente épicos. Y teniendo un uso magistral de personajes grises en conforme se desarrolla la historia;  Mostrando la transformación de los personajes y en su ideología y en porque \"Creen\" tener la razón y sobre todo mostrando las diferentes perspectivas de los personajes; para profundizar aún mas la historia y a los personajes; Donde ninguno esta exento en esta película. Añadiéndole una actuación casi perfecta de todos los involucrados; Claro sobresaltando a Leonardo DiCaprio. Otra cosa que me encantó de la película fue el uso de acción que tiene la misma; Siempre teniendo un propósito y nunca cortando la trama. La acción en esta película es simplemente magnifica. Teniendo como base la típica formula que ya le conocemos a Tarantino; Violencia en muchos casos llegando al gore; Pero siempre con un propósito. Y en eso radica la perfección de esta película; Mostrar una Película con un desarrollo crudo pero siempre \"Tapado\" con un guion casi perfecto, un guion que siempre le da un peso a cada acción de la película. Esta película no es para todo mundo, pero sin duda es una película que al día de hoy ya transcendió al estatus de leyenda.",

Another reason why the duration never drags is because at the end of the day Django Unchained (2012) covers many different genres and offers up avenues for different audiences to enjoy.

Foxx and Waltz carry this film, though DiCaprio, Johnson, and L. Jackson are also absolutely fantastic in their roles. I feel like the film is unnecessarily over-the-top in terms of its violence, depicting an unbelievably high amount of blood and gore that just does not seem needed. I can also see some people getting offended by the insanely high amounts of racial slurs against African Americans said in this film, though it does have a positive message about equality in it. In the end, I really loved \"Django Unchained\" because of how much fun the entire film is, having a surprisingly large amount of very dark humor that keeps the film from being too serious.",

            "content": "To me a Django Unchained seemed like an already amazing movie, combining the Western with Quentin Tarantino's film-making, and I was right. The movie is classic of Tarantino, violent and edging onto humorous. The trouble with this one is that it had to carefully cover the theme with slavery which it did fairly well. The movie followed Django, a slave, killing various white slave owners as a bounty hunter by the side of a German outlaw to eventually reunite with his wife, still trapped as a slave. What stands out in this movie was the characters as most of them were unique and well-acted. Christopher Waltz was funny and drove the movie for me and the villain of Leonardo DiCaprio was similarly amusing. The action throughout the movie was in classic Tarantino fashion, over the top to the extent of it being laughable, exactly what I was expecting and it fitted fairly well into the revisionist frame. I feel what the movie occasionally struggled with was the development of its lead, Django played by Jamie Foxx. Foxx is a great actor but I feel like his character wasn't fleshed out at all, and his portrayal in the movie was more as a simple man looking for revenge. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if this was so directly addressed by the direction but it became a hinderance when compared with the other characters, instead serving as some kind of stark contrast of characters which arguably could have worked well. Overall, I think this movie fits well into the revisionist Western sub-genre and serves as a great addition to Tarantino's collection of great movies. If you're a fan of Westerns you should probably watch this, and if you're a fan of Tarantino, even more so.",

When you watch Django, you feel for the two protagonists while hating the antagonists. The line is strictly drawn in this film between good and bad which makes for a hard watch at times.

He doesn't just want to rescue his wife, he also wants to treat badly the people who treats badly the blacks. We see how he wants to take a revenge on the people that harmed her wife, but also many other black people. Also, it's a real Tarantino work and you can see it. There is violence, but the violent scenes are really well-done except you can't eat in front of them. The blood is everywhere. The camera work is extraordinary. It is well-filmed and the zooms are unusual, but extremely efficient. The cast is monstrous and they play as well as you expect them to do. The twists are awesome. A really good film!",

After watching this film I definitely agree with him.\nHe showed all his ability to tell American history in a grotesque way that hits everyone who's wathcing the film. He received tons of critics due the extreme violence which is present in the entire film. I love that instead. I think that's necessary for the film, it wouldn't be that impressive otherwise. But let's introduce the plot. Basically the movie deals with the story of a slave, called Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), who got saved by the doctor King Schuktz (Christopher Waltz), a German bounty hunter, then they started to work together and they also became friends. They became so close that Schultz accepted to help Django to save his wife, Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). She was a slave who worked in Candyland, property of Calvin J. Candy ( Leonardo Di Caprio), a freak who forced his slaves in brutal deadly fights. Schultz and Django made up a scam to liberate Broomhilda, but Mr. Candy wasn't that stupid. Earlier I talked about Tarantino's great skills but I said nothing about the actors, so I'm gonna do it right now. Jamie Foxx's such a badass and he's perfect in Django's role. Leo Di Caprio is Leo Di Caprio, you know, one of the best actors on the planet. I bet you all know that in the scene when he got angry because he discovered the scam he actually cut off his hand when he broke the glass and he kept acting despite of that! Those two was great, but in my opinion the best was Christopher Waltz, his acting was amazing. I recommend everybody to watch this film.",

            "content": "The Fastest Gun in the South: Django Unchained \n\nQuentin Tarantino's impressive directing power in Django Unchained brings you two hours of light humor, intense violence and emotional drama. While Django Unchained is profane, provocative and raunchy, it also demonstrates an ability to unravel America's legacy of slavery through a suspenseful plot. \n\nWhat makes Django Unchained so great is its ability to combine various different film genres into one movie. It fits revisionist western, adventure, romance, dark comedy and drama genres. Tarantino's use of dark comedy and violence in Django Unchained and his other movies resembles Stanley Kubrick's style, particularly in A Clockwork Orange. Both Tarantino and Kubrick's movies could fit countless genres as they capture the archetype of conflict between good and evil. \n\nThe cinematography is excellent, and the film does a strong job of capturing the slaves' perspectives. The first harrowing moments of the film show slaves walking all day with sweat dripping all over their faces and limping with huge cuts on their backs. Then the film takes off with a bloody moment 7 minutes in (a Tarantino classic). Right away, the audience is shocked by close-up shots of the inhumane conditions Django and the other slaves had to endure. \n\nBoth main characters in Django Unchained want something: Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter, wants the financial reward of killing outlaws, and Django just wants to rescue his wife from slavery. The film's social commentary aims to answer this question: What do humans need to be happy? One can see this theme through the journeys of the characters. Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) gains false happiness through evil means such as exploiting other people, while Django seeks the true happiness of love.\n\nDr. Schultz foreshadows the plot when he explains an ancient German fairytale to Django. The story is about a German princess who is sent off to stay on the top of a mountain and is guarded by a dragon. A knight eventually kills the dragon and saves her. Django presents a similar story, but when presented through the harsh realities of slavery, the story takes on more powerful levels of meaning. Overall, Django Unchained is a true cinematic masterpiece and I give it an A+.",

Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along. \n\nFor a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film.

The story was remarkable and like all Tarantino movies, the violence and blood was serious when it needed to be serious and fun when it is okay to be fun. The only problem with this movie is that it's a little long and I found myself fidgeting around in my seat. Overall, this is a better Tarantino movie with good characters, an interesting story and great special effects. For that, I give \"Django: Unchained\"... 5 stars.",

The cinematography varies wildly, in classic Tarantino fashion, from gruesomely gory closeups to comedic wide shots of group encounters.\n\nDjango's character arcs in a way that reflects a classic hero on a quest. In the beginning, Django is picked from a group of seemingly ordinary slaves (notably, the lowest ranking members of society). By the end, he is central in the plot to dethrone the white men with the most power. Django becomes a bold grim reaper character symbolizing raw, unforgiving power in the fight of Good vs. Evil. The complex relationship established between Django, Schultz, and Candie creates immense tension and draws interest from the audience. The depiction of Good vs. Evil reflects the brutality and societal structure of the time.\n\nWhat's perhaps most satisfying about this film is its resolution, which requires sacrifice to settle the conflict and allows Django to get what he wants. Tarantino is masterful at integrating gory threads that foreshadow each other. For example, Schultz' use of the spring action revolver to kill a central antagonist appears multiple times. Each time, I was filled with satisfying shock and joy, as I knew another climactic moment was ensuing.",

I've tried to like the Kill Bills films, Inglorious Bastards and The Hateful Eight but I just don't love them. Granted I didn't mind Pulp Fiction but I'm not a massive lover of it. This film though for me is different. It does have a few moments where I know it's one of his films and a few moments that could really be cut to bring down the runtime down but, I was too invested in the movie and outcome to care. The violence is as always ramped up to 100 in this movie but it really works, with Django one of the best gunslingers around. It makes for some stunning shoot outs and action sequences. I'm not usually a lover of too much blood. I just feel it's unnecessary but in this movie it just works under the context of everything seen on screen. Another thing that I loved in this film is the music. The opening Django theme is so damn catchy and the blend throughout of western songs and hip- hop just really worked for me. There's not many directors that would blend those two genres of music together and make it work so massive kudos to Tarantino for pulling that off and helping inspire a killer soundtrack. \n\nThis movie is more current now than it has been in the 8 years it's been out. The oppression and enslavement of black people is ingrained into almost all countries histories. To see how horrendously these people were treated is horrendous. It is highlighted by the ridiculous amount of times the 'N' word is used throughout. To see Django become a free man and rise up against these people who oppressed him and mistreated the woman he loves is a great thing to witness. Dr. King Schultz is the only white character in this movie with any conscience to how the slaves are treated. That really brings us in with our two lead characters and makes us root for them more. \n\nThe cast though assembled for this movie is amazing. Jamie Foxx is outstanding in the lead role and just oozes charisma and cool. The \"I like the way you die boy\" line for me is iconic and it just wouldn't sound as good coming from anyone else but Foxx. Waltz though steals the show his character Schultz is so likeable and is the rare good guy in the film. He doesn't have to help Django but he does and goes out of his way to help him reunite with his wife. Leonardo DiCaprio as always amazes. It's not often we get to see him in the lead villain role but this is that rare film where he plays it. He can play the villain just as well as the hero and his characters depravity is really brought to life by his performance. Finally Samuel L. Jackson is unrecognisable from his cool and usually calm self. He's snivelly and a pure weasel as DiCaprio's head slave. Having four of the best actors around really helps bring this brilliant film to life. If you're fans of any of those actors then this film  is an absolute must see!",

Emotions such as sadness, anger, and relief are felt as an audience member and even some laughs are to be had throughout the film. \n\nTopics such as racial inequality, love, death, and overcoming the odds are consistent themes seen throughout the movie. Tarantino even puts his own spin on the racial inequality theme by having the right-hand man to the owner of a plantation as a white supremist African American. \n\nDjango Unchained proves itself to appeal to those with a strong stomach and mind considering the amount of violence and profanity used, but regardless Tarantino accurately depicts events that took place during the 1800's.

On their way, Django must make a visit to Mississippi to meet plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and get his revenge. If that doesn't sound familiar, replace an ex-slave with a distraught bride, a bounty hunter with a Japanese swordsmith and trainer, the slave owners with the pack of assassins, and a wife with a five-year-old daughter. Also like Kill Bill, Django Unchained uses a cartoonish amount of violence, although the latter film uses bullet squibs hidden in blood packs over blood hoses and prosthetic scalps. Both use flashbacks in different color filters to symbolize torment of the main character. Finally, both star Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Parks, Laura Cayouette, and Zoe Bell, the stunt coordinator for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. However, Django is reduced to the simple \"damsel in distress saved by a heroic warrior\" story, unlike the other film which is a test of marriage and child custody. Plus, 2012 film has comedic elements like the Pythonesque banter from the Ku Klux Klan and some amusing one liners from the cast. Lastly, Broomhilda appears as in Django's vision throughout his quest, whether in the cotton field, beside a tree, or in a hot spring. Even though Django has some powerful imagery and glorious usage of Tarantino's \"showmanship\", Kill Bill is more memorable because of its  complexity and depth.

The way he talks, looks at people, and shoots a gun. But there's the person he learned from, Dr. Schultz played by Christoph Waltz, whom is also amazing in almost everything he does (he needs a good director, too). Then there's Leonardo DiCaprio and Sam Jackson as pretty much the villains. Both of them are such asses, but they do it so well. Jackson plays the head honcho of all the slaves and he *is* creepy, and DiCaprio plays the owner of the slaves. These are the kind of characters that you hate and love at the same time. And of course, there's the violence. It's bloody, it feels real, and doesn't mess around. I also appreciate that it's all practical, because CG usually sucks since it's cheaper.

Django was also a blast to watch, the plot was very simple to follow requiring little effort to really pay attention to, lined with the outrageous and crude nature of the film kept me entertained through it's run time. The overuse of the N-word is its greatest downfall, and really plagues the movie from being seen by a wider audience in reality. If Tarantino would've limited its use or perhaps not used the word at all, maybe it would be portrayed in a different light. I think that Django Unchained could've been used to empower black people because at the core of the movie it's a slave revenge and justice serving movie. I think Jamie Foxx does a great job breaking the shackles, quiet literally, and making the audience feel great striking back at vile and cruel slave owners by delivering their own type of justice.",

            "content": "Django, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the success story of a slave given a chance at redemption when given his freedom and an opportunity to train in bounty hunting with a sympathetic German mentor figure Dr. King Schultz. Django's position as a freeman bounty hunter sets him up to overcome the overtly racist old western society which suppresses him as he is protected by law to kill any individuals which a bounty is placed on. Even though Tarantino gives Djangos character this safety net, he does an phenomenal job at keeping the audience in the times by using subtle instances of slavery in the background of scenes as well as hitting the audience with very difficult imagery to keep us grounded. And yet it is these appalling difficult to watch slavery scenes that has us route for Django's ultimate success against this oppressive system. When we are presented with one of Django's gruesome flashbacks, it justifies the violent actions Django takes as a bounty hunter as he usually was forced to suffer much worse treatment than he made his targets undergo. For example, when Django goes with Dr. Schultz to the first plantation why was it important that he whips the white plantation worker before killing him? Well for one we saw the flashback before this where Django's wife was brutally whipped by the same man and second it is the first instance where Django seems to feel a true sense of justice and righteousness in his bounty hunting occupation. \n\tOverall I appreciated this film and believe that Tarantino was able to find a beautiful line balancing this dark and difficult subject matter with a lighter blend of comedy. It isn't easy to handle sensitive topics of racism such as the pre-Civil War American slavery era and the Holocaust in WWII, yet Tarantino finds a way to address these issues through fictional stories like Django and Inglorious Bastards which allow him to create unique plotlines and characters that sparks more engaging conversation regarding the subject matter as a result of the unusual circumstances we witness the subject matter in. I think bringing important ideas to light in an original fashions makes people think more critically about the film and therefore have more to talk about afterwards. Great film, would recommend if you have 2 and a half hours to burn.",

            "content": "Django Unchained – The Boogeyman\nThis movie is on my all-time favorite list. Quintin Tarantino does a great job developing the story and the characters in a way that is organic and engaging. The dichotomy of who Django is and who he pretends to be can be seen as the boogeyman in the film. They discuss this fact in the movie about how there was nothing lower than a black slaver. However, I believe that the archetype is likely referring to the owner of Candyland, Calvin Candy. Comparatively, Django is only the façade of evil being a black slaver and his character is developed through Dr. King Shultz in an attempt to free his wife Hilda. So, we can argue that Django is perceived by others as the boogeyman but it's doing what is good for mankind. Unlike Django, Calvin is a creature of his environment that remains loyal to the ideology of slavery. The film arcs in a firefight at Candyland leading to the death of Dr. King Shultz.\nAnother possible argument for the Boogeyman in Django Unchained is Stephen. Being a slave himself, one would think Stephen would understand the plight of Django. This is not the case, however, as Stephen is the causer of the conflict at Candyland. In Calvin's absence, Stephen becomes the man who runs Candyland. He reprimands the slaves that try to run away, as in Hilda's case, this makes his role in the slave community a little more egregious. When speaking specifically of how the boogeyman is portrayed in Django Unchained, it is more obvious that the fear created by Calvin Candy is far greater than the fear created by Stephen. The notoriety of Candyland alone is enough to create fear for slaves. Stephen is just another aspect of the hell that Calvin Candy created.",

Django befriends Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter, who grants Django his freedom and enters into a partnership agreement with him. The pair spend the Winter wrangling up the wanted outlaws of the South and amassing a fortune. Django and Dr. Schultz end their journey on the Candyland plantation in Greenville, Mississippi that belongs to Monsieur Calvin Candie. Here, Django and Dr. Schultz try to purchase the freedom of Broomhilda while undercover for a different business proposition, and all chaos ensues. \n\nTarantino attacks the cruelty of slavery in this film. Southern barbarity is one facet of this film that appears to be historically accurate. Tarantino's use of graphic violence reminds viewers of the disturbing reality of our nation's history; a history that is often rewritten in textbook pages and generally unspoken of. Django Unchained is a reminder of the horrors of slavery in our country that occurred not too long ago. \n\nThis film is not for the faint-of-heart or weak-stomached. Blood is one of the most prominent threads presented throughout the film. The overt, outrageous, and excessive depiction of blood in this film further emphasizes the barbaric cruelty of slavery. Torture, whip lashings, fighting, broken bones, cruel punishments, and a man being torn apart by dogs all make this film hard to watch. However, the graphic imagery is a reminder of the reality of our nation's history. The graphic violence makes viewers want to look away and turn their cheek, much like many people did to slavery. \n\nWhile tackling the brutality and immorality of slavery, the film also gives us a black protagonist to root for. Django is a badass cowboy who is quicker with his pistol than any other man. Tarantino draws upon the \"spaghetti Western\" film genre for inspiration. This film has saloon shoot-outs, pistol shooting, and bareback horse riding. This movie also has multiple allusions to German culture, including the fairytale of Broomhilda. Django is a real life Siegfried who walks through hell-fire to save his lady from captivity and ultimately emerges triumphant. Viewers root for the success of Django, and praise the demise of the southern slave owners. Soundtrack and music are used effectively to build emotions in this film. Modern music is used to make Django look like a badass, despite being set in the 1860s.      \n\nAlthough this film was hard for me to watch, I think it was well-done. This film left me feeling guilty to be a white person from the South. The film made me laugh, cheer, cry, and scream. I think it's important to tackle difficult subject matters in film. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.",

This ‘style' is all about copy-cat plagiarism, which proves, if you make enough money from fooling people who should know better, you can thumb your way to the top of a bottom-rung industry. \nIf you've seen one Tarantino movie you've seen them all, it's only the names and settings that change (slightly). \n\nThis movie-maker is as readable as a child:  the first rule of thumb; Take themes that spark controversy, over- exacerbate the violence and gore in order to hook those with a cause or agenda to push, and they will follow blindly to the ticket box – making the likes of supporters, Harvey Weinstein and a handful of overused stars (mates) along with a full assortment of soulless industry associates very rich.  Violence and lurid subjects appeal to the lowest common denominator the world over (only need to check out the daily news for confirmation) and, the monkey see monkey do syndrome will unfortunately, always be with us, this also gives us a punishing three hours of torture to prove it.\n\nHandfuls of insightful commentators have seen through the thinly-veiled ugliness, and bravely called it out. See; Thomas Frank – Louis Farrakhan – and surprisingly, industry personalities such as fellow moviemaker Spike Lee, and actor/reviewer Jesse Williams, who all clearly see the folly of Tarantino being taken in any way seriously. Then there's the silliness of Michael Moore attempting to call it ‘satire'!  The most obvious rip-off in this piece of tosh is the spaghetti western, after all, what did Italy know about the experience of living through the American west? Europeans were simply enamoured by the ‘romance' of watching fictional American westerns. Leone is blatantly copied right down to the choice of music (with even the composer, Morricone, calling Tarantino out for his lack of original ideas) The bulk of other music is as with most of this copyists work, lifted from other better films and too often unsuited to the era or narrative themes.   \n\nMuch more could be said but why bother, when consumers seem to love being coned - right down to their History, groceries, comic books, and so on...",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino does not stop surprising us with his amazing historical movies to which he adds his own twists. Ask anyone and they will tell you that Tarantino's dialogues and cinematography can be recognized out of thousands of movies. \"Django Unchained\" is not an exception. In this case, the producer decided to accurately show southern barbarity during slavery times. The movie explores a story of the former slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), who together with a German dentist, Dr. Schutlz (Christoph Waltz), takes on a journey to find famous slavers - Brittle Brothers. \n\tThroughout the movie, Dr.Schultz plays an important father figure as he teaches Django not only necessary survival skills but also aids in the development of his complex character. One cannot be surprised by the character arc of Django as numerous foreshadowing elements are presented in the plot. In the beginning, the protagonist is shown as a broken character who mourns separation from his wife Broomhilda. However, as the plot progresses it becomes evident that Django is much tougher than the audience expected. With the time Django feels more confident in doing what he wants rather than what people expect from him even if it means going against slave traders. \n\tThe recurrent archetype in the movie is \"The Boogie Man\". Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job of playing Mr.Candy. Despite me knowing that he is a slave trader I could not bring myself to hate him. A powerful and smart man who knows how to play people so he will get what he wants at the end. Not many people know that while filming a dinner scene, DiCaprio smashed the glass and cut his hand in a real-life, however, he kept on acting (for that scene alone I think he should have been nominated for Oscar). Even though Mr.Candy is a charismatic man, many fear him because of his unpredictability, one second he can be smiling and another command dogs to kill one of his slaves. Apart from his fortune, his violence and unpredictability are the qualities that made him famous in the South. On the other hand, the second time I watched the movie I thought that Django can be also called a Boogie Man: a former slave, who turned into \"a killer of white folk\". His story was quick to spread and many people knew who he was even before they met him. For the first time, white criminals are scared of an empowered black man who could kill them without any further consequences. \n\t\"Django Unchained\" is a definite must-watch for people who crave skin-crawling scenes and witty dialogues. Its plot twists and numerous side stories will make you stay in your seat until the end.",

Not enough depth or development, the movie seems to be just a vehicle to show off the cinematographic proficiency of the maker. Also, Jamie Foxx may be heralded as a good actor, but here his character is entirely too flat, while he is supposedly the central figure. For my taste, I see Foxx way too often play parts of an angry, rather simplistic black man, which I suspect he is not at all in real life. He is at risk of becoming a typecast, if he is not already. While especially in Django he had a chance of providing an example to other African Americans and all Africans indeed, of showing growth and development throughout the movie. Evidently, Django was not intended for that by Tarantino. Having the pleasure of knowing in my environment many admirable, socially active, highlevel African expats to whom I (a white university graduate in government employment) can only tip my hat, I find it a great pity that Django was filmed in such a flat typecast way for the main character. While you certainly cannot expect Django to become the US president at the end - though he would probably do better than Donald Trump (pun intended), some more development would have been nice. As it is, I find the movie more of an insult than a liberation or an appreciation to the African Americans. It makes me wonder why Foxx wanted to do the part. If you look, on the other hand, at Django just as an off-hand story of a former slave getting his revenge on slavetraders and plantation owners, the movie does the trick. Even then though, it did not keep me on the edge of my seat or even interested, unlike other Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir dogs, or recently The Hateful Eight. \nI have to classify Django together with Inglourious Bastards as a less interesting and indeed exhausting sit with way too little serious storyline. Perhaps amusing for simpletons and at risk of insulting large portions of the population left and right. Not very good, Quentin.\n unlike",

            "content": "Django: Unchained is set in the year 1858 where, Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who is being transported along with other slaves to another plantation. Then a man named Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz), a bounty hunter and dentist, wants Django in order to find some outlaws. After hunting down the outlaws, Django and Dr. King develop a relationship. Django tells Dr. King about his wife that is a slave at Candieland that is owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Steven (Samuel L Jackson) is a servant at Candieland on a mission to stop Django from fooling Calvin Candie. The series of events lead to a huge explosive ending that audiences love.\n\tThere are many reasons why Django: Unchained is one of the best movies of the last 10 years. With an Oscar in 2013 for best writing/ original screenplay, Django: Unchained does not let audiences down with amazing plot/subplots, characterization, setting, cast, and cinematography. The plot is very intricate with many moving internal and external plots; Yet, Django: Unchained keeps it easy to understand and fun for the audience. The characters are well thought out, while consisting of their own internal plots throughout the movie. Django: Unchained makes it seem by the end of the movie that the audience personally has a relationship with the characters. This film is also heightened by the setting of the movie. Quinten Tarintino has a reputation for setting his movie long before the current age. Tarintino keeps his movies historically accurate not leaving one detail out of time or place. The cast of the movie is arguably one of the most important aspects of a great movie. With Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and Christopher Waltz truly owning the screen and really capturing the audience's attention to every line. Finally, the cinematography (the art of making pictures) in this film is one of Quinten Tarintino' s best. This film should be on the bucket list of every movie lover ever.\n\tThe plots/subplots and setting are the groundwork to make a great film. The groundwork for Django: Unchained holds the great movie up. In the first 10 minutes the audience is brought to the two main characters Django and Dr. King. Dr. King introduces himself to the guards (and the audience) telling his name and life story, also his horses name. This sets up a mini plot for the introduction of the film. After the miniature plot resolution, the main plot sets up. There are also many internal and external subplots that are in the storyline as well. Including Dr. King's desire to help Django vs. his want for wealth. Also, Django's lifestyle as a slave vs. his life as a freeman. Quintin Tarintino makes his movies laid out so that depending on the audience's thoughts, the movie changes. But that isn't the only thing that makes Django: Unchained amazing.\n\tCharacterization and cast are the other layers that make great movies. With the amazing star-studded cast, Django Unchained really blows away the audience. If a movie has a great scrip and well thought out, very in-depth characters along with great actors that can portray the roles, it will be a great movie. Django Unchained is one of the greatest examples of great roles with great actors. There are so many layers in this film that build the relationship with the audience and the characters. Either if you like Django: Unchained or not, you cannot ignore the pure beauty of the characterization in this film. But there is one more basic category that makes a top-quality film.\n\tFinally, cinematography is a large aspect to the movie making process. The way that the camera angles can create emotion and add intensity to a film. There are many examples in this film including, when Django and Dr. King walk into the bar and the camera zooms in on to the bar owner. This can add to the emotion of the scene and the intensity of the characters reaction. This is the art that is lost in today's cliché films. Also, the angles of some of the action scenes in this movie are out of this world.\n\tThis film is completely saturated with the components needed for a truly great movie. With a 91% audience rating, audiences seem to agree. Some parts of the movie can be gory and violent, but the movie is well balanced in comedy, romance, and even some mystery. If you liked any other movie directed by Quintin Tarintino or are just an action movie junkie like me, then Django: Unchained is a movie for you. That's why Django: Unchained is the best movie in the last 10 years.\n",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino is not my favorite filmmaker, as has been well documented, but in attempting to watch every Best Picture nominee ever I have found myself watching Pulp Fiction (1994), Inglourious Basterds (2009) and this film. Of the three this was my second favorite as Pulp Fiction left me cold and Inglourious Basterds felt funnier and fresher than this film. This is still a significantly flawed film and the moments that were meant to leave me exhilarated and titillated never quite connected but I at least understood some of what Tarantino was aiming for. For Tarantino acolytes this should fulfill their needs but it doesn't reveal any depths to him as a filmmaker or a writer that will entice those not already enticed by his brand of loving pastiche.\n\nSlave Django Freeman, Jamie Foxx, is picked up by German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, Christoph Waltz, who shoots his owners and offers him the chance to go into business with him. Freeman and Schultz set out to kill the Brittle brothers and Schultz offers to help Freeman find and purchase his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, Kerry Washington, after a bond develops between them. They track her to the plantation of Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio, a sadistic Francophile who enjoys watching ‘Mandingos' fight to the death and uses African-American women as prostitutes. Candie discovers the scheme that Schultz and Freeman have concocted and after a prolonged confrontation Schultz kills Candie and ends up dying himself. It is then up to Freeman to survive being captured by the employees of a mining company and to return to Candie's plantation so that he can reconcile with his wife.\n\nMany referred to this as a \"love story\" but the fact that it focuses almost entirely on the male character and the female character is represented mostly through other characters talking about her it is hard to invest in this romance. We are meant to see this film as being a sort of fairy tale as the star-crossed lovers are reunited at the end of the film and the villains are all cartoonish and evil but Tarantino's love for blood and guts prevents us from being charmed by any of the characters. Washington does little more in her role than flinch and wince as we are asked to delight in watching her be abused and attacked in a way that makes this film feel more like a cheap exploitation film than the high art it parades as. \n\nThe performances could also be also be described as a tad overzealous as DiCaprio, in a rare villainous role, chews the scenery but manages to appear as though he is trying far too hard and leaves us disengaged. I imagine the effect was intended to be both hilarious and menacing but I wasn't amused by his thick Southern accent or the fact that he couldn't speak French and while it was utterly horrid watching men abuse one another I was not convinced that Candie was cold or terrifying enough to carry out these actions. Jackson appears to be impersonating a minstrel as he plays a character who is rather confusingly written and it is sad to see an actor of his talent wasted on a role like this. Dennis Christopher pops up in a supporting role which strangely reminded me of Breaking Away (1979), a very different film, a disconcerting distraction during a film of this sort. Tarantino can draw the worst out of actors, as seen with Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds (2009), but with the amount of talent he manages to attract I am always shocked by how stupefying and misjudged their performances can be.\n\nIf you have a taste for bloodshed several scenes in this film will satisfy your craving but for me I felt that they were needless and the violence did not excite me or add anything to the story. In terms of 2012 films I don't think this was one of the best and I would have preferred to have seen Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and The Hunt (2012) nominated for Best Picture. Obviously every body has their own personal preferences and Tarantino happens to go against my own but for those who enjoy his films I am perfectly happy to admit that there is probably something I am not seeing.",

And I emphasise on the word \"novelization\". Since for the first time, his film feels more like a book than a script. Just take the scene where Samuel L. Jackson calls out for Leonardo DiCaprio from the dinner table where the crowd is enchanted in Christoph Waltz's charm. Such a scene is often lopped out from a script that is to make it to the screen and instead some other element is added to boost the script and the pace of the film.\n\nBut the writer and director of the western superhero flick Quentin Tarantino insists on going through the social rigmarole as an excuse of understudying the history. And you are up for it. That's what baffles me the most. Why have we been ignoring the lectures and documentaries and books so blatantly but consistently fails to even speculate his views on those very subjects. We are chugging it up unapologetically, repetitively. That is because, Tarantino knows what he adores about the history and what will gather and please the crowd, the most. And it is not just that he infuses the facts into narration that goes unnoticed.\n\nIt cannot just be the smoothness. It is actually the best aspect of the historical events, the so called highlights, and it is the characteristics of the characters and even the world they revolve around. He uses those tools to convert those facts into a myth casting spell upon spell on us, just like he bombards us with whistle blowing one-liners, slapstick humor and guns blazing across the room. Addition to that, you can see him using his reputation and credibility in Django Unchained by casting a cast of such caliber and more importantly using those tools into narrative that celebrates the cinema life that he lives and breathes for.",

Now, first thing, the acting was excellent, accompanied by some darn good dialogue, made every single encounter and person to person interaction so interesting and enjoyable. You literally couldn't take your eyes off the screen. But, some of those dialogue sessions drag on for a tad too long. The action is classic Tarantino, whenever someone gets shot, blood everywhere. Yet that's kind of realistic, and for a western entertaining to say the least. Being almost three hours long, I can see a couples of scenes shortened, but that wouldn't have changed much. This is a very good movie, I think Inglourious Basterds is better, but this is still better than most.",

In the room there are two slaves on the ground wrestling with their owners edging them on, the scene is initially tense In Supreme writing, acting, and execution, Quentin Tarantino again creates a modern masterpiece with his film Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino has managed to reinvent the spaghetti western genre with a blend of dark humor and dramatic storytelling while also acknowledging and portraying the horrors of American slavery. In one particular scene, however, is quickly diffused when Candie stylishly give Schultz a nod of approval after brief questioning and offers him a seat. \n\tThe scene builds tension again when Django has to sit at a bar and not only listen to the brutal fighting, but also approve of it to keep his cover. The scene comes to a bloody and conclusion as one slave putting out the eyes of his opponent, all while the spectators watch on, black and white alike. Scenes similar to this are frequent in Django Unchained, characters do very little to stop the horrors that occur, and sometimes cheer it on. \nWhile on the surface Django may seem overindulgent in violence, it also serves an ironic twist on the viewer, who may be horrified with the inaction of characters, but enjoys the violence all the same. Ironically, Tarantino is critiquing the acceptance of violence he so often creates.

E cosa si può dire riguardo gli interpreti? Uno più sublime dell'altro, Waltz e DiCaprio avrebbero dovuto ricevere entrambi l'Oscar ma ahimè solo uno può vincere e alla fine dei conti è giusto che sia stato il tedesco a prevalere. Samuel L. Jackson sempre al top e Jamie Foxx eccezionale e con Waltz formano un duo piuttosto interessante e che mai avrei immaginato funzionasse così bene. Il personaggio che ho amato di più è stato il Dr. King Schultz e la pacatezza di tono, di parole e di movimenti con cui affrontava anche le situazioni più difficili.

However, as much as I loved Django Unchained, I am at a point where I'm finding (probably trying too hard actually) flaws. QTs formula is a unique story, colorful, yet brilliant dialogue, a couple of long build-ups to super tense situations that engross the viewer and perfect endings. He is simply one of the best. Hands down. However, with Django Unchained, while there were tense moments, they weren't nearly the level of the adrenaline shot in Pulp Fiction, the opening scene to Inglorious Basterds or the latter's basement bar scene. Django is a fantastic film that is quintessential Tarantino. The dialogue is fantastic. The acting of every major character is unmatched. Yet, because it lacked those crucial tense moments that made me feel the same way I have before inTarantino flicks, it does make me wonder if he has worn out his formula and needs to pull a Scorsese and do a film like \"Hugo.\" Then again, if he just isn't capable of doing that, I'd watch as many Djangos as QT wants to film since, really, it is better than 99% of the crap out there.",

I think its important to say that Tarantino treats violence that is historical accurate with the respect and truth that is needed to remember them; the violence that is fancy is over the top theatrical (sort of an \"alienation of the audience\" so that you can just enjoy the emotional cathartic-ness of a wishful-thinking, cowboy sort of justice). The only disappointment (SPOILER ALERT) is that I wish Calvin Candy would have died a more horrible death.

The only surprise element is the romance. Even though Django gets as down and dirty as the \"baddies\" he is doing it for loooove. Ahhh.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nDjango is a slave in the American South. When he is freed by a bounty hunter, Dr Schultz, they form an unlikely alliance. They spend the winter killing people for money, then get down to the real business at hand - freeing Django's wife and taking sweet revenge.\n\nMood of the film\n\nPulp Fiction, but in a Wild West setting. No wait, Inglourious Basterds, but in a Wild West setting. Okay, I give up. It is a Tarantino western, people! It is insane.\n\nBest performances\n\nIt is a tie between Django's (Foxx) intensity, Dr Schultz's (Waltz) panache and Candie's (DiCaprio) malice. (Samuel L Jackson's housekeeper, Stephen, was too much of a caricature.) I vote for Christoph Waltz. He is more magnetic than Foxx and certainly more subtle than DiCaprio.\n\nStand-out scene\n\nEish. One of the most horrific, chilling scenes I have ever seen is surely the Mandingo fighting sequence. Two slaves are made to fight each other to the death. They do so in the lounge by the fireplace, surrounded by \"gentlemen\" drinking cognac, smoking cigars and chit-chatting.\n\nNegatives\n\nI do not mind Tarantino's penchant for squirting blood, but it does not do anything for me either. It has been done, Quentin, move on.\n\nIs it relevant today?\n\nIt certainly touches on issues that are still relevant in society, such as a group of people being treated as second-rate citizens, violence perpetrated against women, etc.\n\nTarantino has been criticised for the violence in the film. His reply is that there is a big difference between the violence dished out by the baddies and the justice that Django serves up. The audience is supposed to know the one is cruel and unjustified and evil, while the other is pure and fun because it is revenge. I have to admit, I did distinguish between the two types of violence, and I did root for Django when he was doing the shooting, but whether that is acceptable is quite another story.\n\nDoes it cop out?\n\nHas Tarantino ever shied away from any issue, from any controversy? I mean, he killed Hitler in Inglourious Basterds!\n\nFYI\n\nDuring filming Christoph Waltz fell off his horse and broke his pelvis. Jamie Foxx subsequently gave him a saddle with a seat belt.",

Not to mention that this is his first western flick. It takes place in the early 1900s and is about a slave played by Jamie Foxx who makes a deal with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) to help him find a group of people and to find his wife. Django Unchained blew me away in every way possible. It was extremely well written, (Obviously. It's Tarantino) well acted, It looked beautiful and the direction was out-standing. I could not find a single thing that I disliked! Everything was perfect! It's hard to determine the genera. It's mostly a movie about slavery, but it has the setting of a western. I guess that it could be considered a southwestern movie :) The two main protagonists have good chemistry. One is a slave who will do anything to get his wife back. The other is a man who cares for him and just needs his help. Watching these characters grow together as a team was quite an experience. Especially because Django is a slave, and back then, it was unusual to treat a slave with kindness. The antagonist that we are introduced to is Calvin Candie. (Leo's role) He is a very successful slave owner and has a large cotton plantation. He pulls off a fantastic performance. There is one scene when he smashes a glass on a table and he actually starts bleeding on set, but he continues to compose good acting. The character himself was a very unlikable character in all of the right reasons. I absolutely loved this villain.",

It is a story of a slave gaining freedom and ultimately freeing his wife from slavery and in the process takes down a famous slave plantation Candy land. The movie starts with Django being a slave but he is rescued from slavery by a german bounty hunter named Dr Schultz. He practiced dentistry for a while but then became a bounty hunter. He needed Djangos to help him locate the briddle brothers who were slavers. Dr Schultz takes him through this journey and they track down the briddle brother two of which Django himself killed and whipped and before killing one of them he says to the salves \"yall wanna see something\" and blows his brains out. He is then recruited but the Dr to be a bounty hunter for the winter and the thought of killing white people for money was very interesting to Django. He became very talented in shooting. After the winter he tells Dr Schultz that he wants to free his wife Broomhilda whose name the Dr recognized because of her german name. She ends up being in candy land the famous slave plantation. They go to candyland to save Hilda and they come up with a terrific plan. The plan goes south after they are caught by Mr candy's trusted friend who was a former slave named stephen. Dr schultz is killed but Django get into a big shootout with them and kills a lot of white slavers. He is captured but escapes and comes back to candy and slaughters all the white people in the plantation and also stephen the former slave.\nThis movie makes me think of what it would have been like if slaves had rebelled and gone out after there master and try to kill them. You can imagine the pain the slaves felt but they never fought back. This movie unleashed the pain the slaves felt to white people in very violent way but get the idea across that slaves at that time would smile and the death of a white man who was their slave owner. The movie makes us think could white people endure the pains black people went through if they were slaves. There a scene where Django had to watch a slave who was refusing to fight being fed to dogs to die and this hits home hard because I could never imagined being in that position. The movie though violent makes you feel, or at least for me a little bit of hatred towards white and in some cases you'll find yourself smiling when Django slaughters all the slavers. I love the setting being the west but the town is greenville tennessee which was  a big slave town even after the abolishment of slavery. The movie show the west in the eye of a black man and a foreigner. It shows how america treated the those who were not of the country. Overall the movie is very eye opening and just show that slavery was a very disturbing time in the history of the us and we have come a long way. But we also have a long way to go.\n\n-- Joel C.",

Fixated on finding his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), Django makes quick work of locating the Brittles earning his freedom and a tidy sum of money. \n\nInstead of going their separate ways, Schultz offers to assist Django in finding and rescuing his wife. Refining Django's hunting skills and providing vital access to information, their search ultimately leads them to the slyly-charming and brutal Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). \n\nExploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Candie's trusted house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). Marked and measured, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival. \n\nNominated for five Oscars, iconic writer/ director Quentin Tarantino's first western is an intriguing narrative about life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance. Tarantino's trademark flair for dramatics and violence sit well in the pseudo-genre.\n\nWaltz once again shines under Tarantino's direction, a true master in the art of line delivery, everything about him screams presence. Jamie Foxx's performance is slightly overdone and calculated almot to the point where it looks as though he is acting, rather than embodying. Jackson (as always) brings a little sparkle to his purpose written characters, adding levity but also insight. Whilst DiCaprio, whom has always had my curiosity (if not my personal taste) finally caught my attention with the perfect balance of smarmy and sneaky, enough so to make me forget it was in fact him. \n\nA major miscalculation in performance however was Tarantino's own cameo. All most as if it was thrown in at the last moment, he attempts to match our own John Jarratt's accent in a bizarre ill-fitting mess of vocal gymnastics that is beyond laughable and detracts attention from the last 15 minutes of suspense.\n\nThe Verdict: Although a decent film from one of the most distinctive directors, I wouldn't put Django Unchained even in his top five. Personally, I think my 165 min would have been better spent revisiting cult classic Reservoir Dogs or the unique Inglorious Bastards; and I think other projects will take the Oscars on offer for the same reason. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 08/02/2013",

Although I have to admit, sometimes the jury still seems to be out on Tarantino's style; this movie makes a definite case in his favor. Nevertheless, the story is one that is both timeless and novel at the same time. Classic man seeking lost love, but this man happens to be s freed slave bounty hunter, killin all the white folks that are deservin' of a killin' with the help of his German friend and benefactor. Beyond the story, however, Tarantino also solidifies his role as the modern epic storyteller sparing none of the gory, boring, long, beautifully shot details. Somehow it all works. The modern western epic is here to stay with Django (and eventually Hateful 8). Is Django perfect? No. If it was perfect would it truly be a Tarantino film? Again, I say no. Much like the Japanese principle of wabi-sabi, this film has a certain something that isn't quite right, but makes it oh, so memorable (although some-times maybe just a tad too memorable). But here I think there is the right amount (give or take a liter of blood) of Tarantino uniqueness without being totally overboard. Is it a life changing drama covering unspoken hot-button transcendental subjects; well, yes and no; in a Tarantino sort of way. In summary, it is long, but it moves and is, quite plainly, a good movie\n\tAnother thing that really pulls this movie together is the acting. Tarantino as usual, formulates the perfect balance between strange and just plain talented actors and actresses A wonderful amount of convincing acting comes from Mr. Foxx. Mr. Jackson is as talented as ever (perhaps too good) as the cranky old slave. Oh, and did I mention Leonardo Di Caprio... enough said. In short, the story combined with the incredible acting make a worthy flick\n\tWhat really seals the deal, however, is the incredible cinematography. Tarantino really finds himself at home in the incredible vistas of the near-west and south in ante-bellum America. I hope that you are able to find yourself in an IMAX for this bad boy. I think that this is really what licks the envelope for me. It should be noted that this doesn't rid the movie of the necessary Tarantinoisms. Story, talent, and technically beautiful. And as an extra add on Tarantino's choice in soundtrack is as eclectic and oddly appropriate as ever. I will give this movie the solid \"really should see (aka 8.5/10). Enjoy.",

            "content": "A bloody masterpiece and brilliant piece of filmmaking from Quentin Tarantino; bold reinvention of the spaghetti western with a legendary cast + execution. 9.7/10\n\n...\n\nSet two years before the Civil War, Django Unchained tells the story of Dr. King Schulz, a dentist-turned-bounty hunter who enlists the help of a slave named Django on his escapades. As the two become friends, Schulz learns that Django's wife is still a slave at one of the South's largest plantations and the two conspire a way to set her free. However, this proves a difficult and dangerous feat, leading to a big finale showdown.\n\n*Possible spoilers ahead*\n\nTARANTINO HAS DONE IT AGAIN. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF A FILM. It was quite bold when Tarantino announced he would be trying to 'modernize' the spaghetti western with his newest film 'Django Unchained'. Tarantino had already had classics to his name, including such works as Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, and Inglorious Basterds, but this was pushing the boundaries of cinema even more than what he was known for and what was acceptable in film history, as western had not had its hay-day in popularity since in 40 years. However, what we got was an absolute marvel and near flawless film that comes around once in a long time, and proof that Tarantino belongs in the Pantheon of Top Directors of All-Time  (Top 7 objectively, Top 5 in my opinion). Here's why.\n\nThe film is so masterfully crafted, I don't know where to begin. First, from the opening credits of the film, you instantly get the feel of the classic genres of film like westerns cinema-lovers like me adore. The film is brilliantly constructed and the story equally unfolded so that there is never a dull moment, even in dialogue-only scenes which is a marvel of a feat difficult for many directors and writers to attain aside from Tarantino's famously grand and bold action sequences.\n\nThe acting in this film is breathtaking. I maintain that Django Unchained might have one of the most legendary casts EVER assembled in a film: Academy-Award winners Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award nominees Samuel L. Jackson and Jonah Hill, and Golden Globe and Emmy (most aforementioned share these as well) winner Kerry Washington. Like literally just read out loud that cast. Insanity. And they do not disappoint, Christoph Waltz and DiCaprio steal the show with All-Time great performances, but there is not one weak link, all actors sharing the spotlight and coming together to make a spectacularly acted film on every level.\n\nThe range of the film is equally wowing. The cinematography for one features perfectly-shot scenes ranging from the old west to mountain canyons to southern plantations. The soundtrack is unbelievable and as diverse as humanly possible in a film, while always working with the scene its paired with. You have classical Beethoven, old west tunes, hard rap from Rick Ross, R&B, and even JAPANESE music all smushed together, and somehow it fits perfectly. Unreal testament to how talented Tarantino and his staff are.\n\nDjango Unchained also balances tear-jerking humor with a serious and psychologically complex script drawing on heavy issues such as religious ideology, classic fairy tales vs. real life, and the horrors of slavery. The movie is downright HILARIOUS. Dr. Schulz sly humor always hits the mark and Django too and there are genius sequences like the KKK horse-riding and \"bag\"-incident, but Samuel L. Jackson had me actually weak from laughing so hard, one of the funniest roles I've seen in a long time and refreshing in the film's ultimate motif of diversity and range in all aspects including tone.\n\nFinally, the action. Yes, Tarantino's specialty and flare. He certainly does not disappoint in his bold extravanganza of a finale shootout at the Candies' estate, the most memorable moment of the film and an absolutely jaw-dropping and thrilling sequence. The gore is moderate in comparison to most of his other films, genius in order to draw a bigger crowd that won't be scared off by something as inconsequential as violence, but I'd like it if it was a little more turned down (not a problem for me but others understandably) so that everyone else could love it and enjoy the film in its entirety as much as I do.\n\nThat, and that I wish the film was about 15-20 min shorter, as 2:45 is a long time, are the only (infinitesimally) small flaws I can find in this masterpiece of a film from an All-Time great director in complete control of his craft.\n\nMost Memorable Moment: Final shootout at the Candies' estate\n\nPros: Incredible acting with one of the most legend-packed casts of all-time with Christoph Waltz (show-stealing performance), Jamie Foxx, Kerri Washington, Jonah Hill, Leo DiCaprio, & Sam L. Jackson, a masterfully crafted and written story that is funny, deep, tear-jerking, and action-packed drawing on religious ideology, classic fairy tales, and reinventing a bygone genre in westerns and mixing it with modern technology and cinematic techniques, sure-handed direction and writing by a director in full control of his craft in Tarantino, hilarious in its poking fun of slavery's absurdity and scenes like the KKK scene, expert balancing of light-heartedness and seriousness in tone and plot, amazing soundtrack mixing classic Western-inspired tunes with even modern rap, bold decision pushing the boundaries of Hollywood to try to modernize the spaghetti western (a bygone and legendary genre in film), stunning cinematography with meticulously crafted shots ranging from old west scenery to mountain canyons to southern plantations, thrilling action sequences and final shootout in classic Tarantino style and grandeur, gore that's still graphic but toned-down in relation to most of Tarantino's movies in a brilliant way to not have it ruin the public and moderates' vision of the movie, clever construction of the film and story, Tarantino's most complete film yet\n\nCons: Gore could've been turned down a tiny bit more for the mass appeal, wish it was 15-20 min shorter but these both are very minor flaws\n\nOverall Rating: 9.7/10",

Sometimes it seems like they're able to make a few good movies, and as time goes on their works becomes sloppy or uninspired. This is far from the case for Quentin Tarantino, who has, in the past, directed arguably some of the best films ever released in cinemas. With Django Unchained, he continues to showcase what he and his films have become best at: the ability to chose incredible actors to play memorable characters, the smooth incorporation of violence, dialogue, and tension into an interesting plot, and the creation of a setting that is believable and engrossing (if not entirely historically accurate... I'm looking at you Inglourious Basterds.) Django Unchained tells the story of two unlikely friends: a German bounty hunter and his new, recently freed-from-slavery partner, Django. The film follows their adventures into the plantations of the Civil War-era South as they transition from two bounty hunters looking for their next reward to two gentlemen trying to rescue Django's enslaved wife. Now, the thing that stands out most here is the acting from the ensemble cast. And EVERY main actor steals EVERY scene they're in. Jamie Foxx, who plays Django, does a stellar job in his role without a doubt. But he is overshadowed in most of his scenes by Christoph Waltz, and oh does he overshadow him. Waltz establishes himself as one of my favorite actors in the film industry with this film, doing an equally impressive job as his role as Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. His character is funny, interesting, likeable, and badass all at the same time. And that's without speaking of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Samuel L. Jackson's parts in the movie. One word can be used to describe their performances: incredible. When Foxx, Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson are all on-screen at once, it's overwhelming in the best possible way. Additionally, Tarantino does a fine job of incorporating the best parts of storytelling into this masterpiece. His trademark tension shows up several times and, of course, what would a Tarantino movie be without the violence we all know him for? The explosions of blood and ridiculous shouting and screaming make their entrance many times throughout the movie at well-placed times. The Civil War-era feel of the movie is also great and feels authentic, and I felt immersed in the time period throughout most of the movie. In short, Django Unchained is one of the best action movies to hit screens in a long time. With incredible acting, an amazing script, and satisfying action, Tarantino reminds us of the way movies should be made with one of his finest works yet.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), ein Zahnarzt, fährt mit seinem Gaul und einem klapprigen Wagen quer durch das Gebiet des amerikanischen Bürgerkriegs. Er bewegt sich auf Schleichwegen und durchkreuzt einen Wald. Der ist so tief und dunkel, dass er aussieht wie ein Märchenwald. Eine Kolonne gefesselter Sklaven wird durch die Dunkelheit getrieben. Im Vordergrund Dr. Schultz an dessen Wagen ein grosser Zahn befestigt ist, der munter hin und her wippt. Schultz ist auf der Suche nach einem Sklaven namens Django (Jamie Foxx). Mit Djangos Hilfe hofft er die Brikkle Brüder zu finden und so seine Ehefrau. Vorweg: Quentin Tarantino hat mich jetzt schon in seinen Bann gezogen! Er setzt auf eine tolle Szene noch eine grössere oben drauf, alles um diese beiden gegensätzlichen Charaktere herum inszeniert, die drei Dinge zusammenschweissen: Pragmatismus, finanzielle Vorteile und persönliche Gründe. Weiter gehts mit Dr. King Schultz! Kein Blick zurück! Vielleicht ist das auch besser so, denn sonst müssten wir uns ja fragen, was Schultz überhaupt in diesem dunklen Wald macht und weshalb er weiss, dass dort Django gefangen gehalten wird? Nun erleben wir Schultz, wie er eine seiner finanziellen Transaktionen durchführt. Schultz scheint ein generöser Mann zu sein, der eine Menge Bargeld verteilt. Manchmal kommt er mir vor wie ein Zauberer aus einem Märchen. Er besitzt auch die Fähigkeit, das Leben der Menschen zu steuern. Er lenkt ihr Schicksal und wirft sie in Situationen, in denen sie das bekommen, was sie verdienen! Obwohl Django Unchained ein phasenweise harter Film ist, möchte ich meinen, dass nichts darin echt ist - am allerwenigsten Dr. King Schultz. Für Tarantino kommt Schultz auch gelegen, denn er vermag den Plot dahin zu lenken, wo er will. Übrigens zieht Schultz während des gesamten Films keinen einzigen Zahn. In Wahrheit arbeitet er als Kopfgeldjäger und liefert seine Klienten aus: Lebendig oder tot. An sich benötigt der Plot eine ganze Reihe an Erklärungen. Schultz weiss aber einfach, wer Django ist und wo er ihn finden kann, weil das eben sein Job ist. Dann erschiesst er in aller Seelenruhe einen Sheriff und immer wieder erlaubt er Tarantino erstaunliche Szenen - einfach dadurch, weil er alles weiss und immer einen Ausweg kennt. Schultz gewinnt die Freundschaft Djangos und bildet ihn während eines harten Winters aus zum Kopfgeldjäger. Schliesslich hilft er dem Freund, seine verlorene Frau Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) wiederzubekommen. Warum tut er all das? Weil er Django mag und die Sklaverei hasst. So wie Tarantino in seinem vorigen Film den Holocaust behandelt hat, geht er auch mit der Sklaverei um. Es ist Unrecht und muss gerächt werden! In beiden Filmen spielt Christoph Waltz eine Schlüsselrolle. Nicht nur wegen seines österreichischen Akkzents, sondern auch, weil Tarantino mit ihm brilliante Dialoge inszenieren kann. Die liebt er bekannterweise und die besten Dialog-Szenen sind so lang, wie es kaum üblich ist für einen solchen quasi-Exploitation Film. Tarantino hat immer behauptet, er wäre zuvor Videothekar gewesen (ein Job, den ich natürlich als einen höchst ehrenwerten erachte!). Wir können uns vorstellen, wie er in seiner Videothek hockte und alle Filme sah, die dort herumlagen. Vieles hat er dabei gelernt, eins aber nicht: Die sparsamen Dialoge von Exploitation Filmen. Tarantino hat einmal behauptet, er würde bereits beim Schreiben des Skripts die Lacher in seinem Kopf hören. Allerdings: Nichts wäre für ihn schlimmer, als ein Publikum, dass auf die Lacher vorbereitet wird. Ein Publikum in der Erwartungshaltung, zu lachen! Deshalb ist Django Unchained ein so überaus brutaler und grenzwertiger Film! Am liebsten lässt Tarantino auf seine Brutalitäten Lacher folgen - und keiner ist darauf vorbereitet. Django Unchained funktioniert wie ein Comic! So erleben wir den Grossgrundbesitzer Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), der ein echtes Monster ist. Nach dem Dinnieren lässt er seine Sklaven Todeskämpfe gegeneinander austragen. Diese Szenen sind wirklich scheusslich, stehen aber im Dienste etwas Grösserem: Darin verpackt Tarantino seine Satire. Oft ist Django Unchained auch einfach wunderschön. Wir bewundern die Plantagen im Frühling, darüber erheben sich Wolkenformationen und einige Sklaven stehen da und geniessen diese Schönheit. In solchen Szenen wissen wir, wozu Tarantinos Gewalt auch dient: Sie zerschiesst die Bequemlchkeit des Publikums! Sie verhindert, dass wir uns einfach berieseln lassn. Sie passt darüber hinaus auch in die Zeit: Django lebt in einer grausamen und brutalen Gesellschaft (die wir durch Tarantinos satirischen Filter sehen).

His enemies are tremendous too and Samuel L. Jackson stands out more here than he has in a long time (and we're talking about the dude who always stands out).\n\nIt has all of the blood and guts that we saw in Kill Bill but takes the villains to the next level and adds in such a great mix of interesting characters; particularly Christoph Waltz's Schultz. \n\nLike, Inglorious Bastards, it heavily relies on a bombastic historical revenge plot where this time, the Nazis are replaced with slave owners. It's pretty cheap in both cases, but man is it fun- especially here when we know that bad-ass Jamie Foxx is gonna take everyone to task. \n\nTarantino's films seem to becoming simpler but the style is still there and the action is better than ever so I don't think that it's necessarily a bad change. Still, this is another Tarantino film that is exactly what you would expect. If you aren't a fan then don't even touch this one and if you are a fan, well, you've seen it already.

This is exactly the case with 2012's 'Django Unchained,' which explores a whole bunch of themes, from racism and retribution to pride and committment. This is nothing outside the norm for a Tarantino film, as they usually have at least some kind of political message baked into them.\n\nThere are many things to both admire and detest about 'Django,' which probably means it's a well-balanced piece of cinema. For one, the screenwriting is excellent, and the dialogue shines thanks to meticulous delivery from the German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) when contrasted with the brash, simple delivery of many others he crosses paths with. As the film's namesake, Jamie Foxx delivers an impressive performance as a freed slave who takes up bounty hunting as a profession as he makes his way to Mississippi to rescue his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Along the way, Django and Dr. Schultz bond as the body count increases.\n\nPerhaps the best performances come from Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the former portrays the smooth talking owner of the Candyland plantation and the former, his 76-year-old \"Uncle Tom-ish\" head slave, Stephen. DiCaprio's most remarkable scene is when he manages to cut his hand on pieces of glass on a dining table (not part of the script) and he continues to act out the scene as blood covers his hand. If that's not the mark of a great actor, it's hard to determine what is. Additionally, Jackson's character is so detestable that a lot of the credit needs to be given to the actor from bringing him to life. It should also be noted that the diverse soundtrack is another element that really elevates what transpires onscreen.\n\nIn terms of its shortcomings, of course 'Django' is filled with carnage, some of which is so ridiculously over-the-top that it's hard to not get distracted by it. Also, the 165-minute runtime really pushes boundaries here, but again, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without these aspects.\n\nThanks to brilliant writing, a top-notch cast and an experienced, award-winning director at the helm, 'Django Unchained' is an important film that will be looked at by other directors for years to come.",

            "content": "With Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino has turned wholly satisfying filmmaking into a science. Sure, this film might not be as emotionally affecting as Jackie Brown. It might not be as novel as Reservoir Dogs, as ambitious as Pulp Fiction, as playful as Kill Bill, or as bold and audacious as Inglourious Basterds. But Tarantino's latest is arguably the most complete package of any film in 2012, and when the only \"complaint\" you can come up with regarding a film is that it isn't as good as its great director's very best, you're probably nitpicking with a real champion of a film.\n\nJamie Foxx plays this film's title character-a slave who, in the film's opening scene, is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Django is one of the only men in the South who knows the identity of the Brittle Brothers; They whipped him and his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and brought them to auction where they were separated forever. But Schultz offers Django a deal: Track down these brothers and spend the winter as partners in bounty hunting, and in return, the good doctor will do everything in his power to find and free Django's wife.\n\nThe hunt for the Brittles doesn't last but an hour, and the bulk of the film occurs at \"Candieland,\" the enormous plantation home of Brunhilda's new owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). He's a frightening man and also one of the richest plantation owners in Mississippi. Even slimier than Calvin is his black housekeeper, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). The film ultimately turns into a brutal battle of wills between both black-white pairs with Django and Schultz lying through their teeth in order to simply gain access to Broomhilda. Getting her out? A whole other story.\n\nBoth halves of Django Unchained have their own style, tone, and high points. The first half is funnier. A Jonah Hill-and-Don-Johnson-led KKK summit is its comedic high point, but every monologue delivered by Dr. King is simply genius. For the second Tarantino film in the row, the best-in-show award goes to Christoph Waltz. The competition is stiffer here, but Waltz is just so delightfully at ease. It's really a pleasure to watch him work his magic.\n\nThe second half has a very different look; The painterly sunsets and sweeping vistas King and Django travel across are replaced by darkly lit, blood-tinted rooms in a truly hell-like plantation mansion. Our heroes are surrounded by scum, and as such, Tarantino doesn't hold back from showing us their very worst qualities-the very worst qualities of any man. His screenplay packs a real punch in that respect. It's obviously not as pop-culture-heavy as past efforts (even Basterds had the scene in the basement of the pub), but the man hasn't lost a step these two decades since Reservoir Dogs.\n\nThis bloody second half is also dominated by Leonardo DiCaprio. Giving what's his best performance since The Departed, he's playing severely against type and the most morally backward character of his career. It's jump-out-of-your-seat work; He's charismatic and will woo you in, but you really don't know where he draws his line, and the depths of his hatred and villainy never cease to astound.\n\nThen, there's Samuel L. Jackson. There are parallels between he and Django in that they're both \"above\" the average black man in the South circa 1958, and it doesn't become clear until late in the film whether either, both, or neither of them is serving the cause of the enslaved negro. What we do know about Stephen is this: He walks with a limp, he loves Calvin, and he really doesn't like the idea of a black man riding a horse.\n\nThough he's the film's title character, Django's quite an understated individual. That's not to say he doesn't act when called upon. On the contrary, his arc is big and he seizes the day with gusto. Foxx underplays him, but appropriately so. After all, he's a recently freed slave stuck in the deep South, and (on a more cinematic level) there are three big scene-stealers orbiting around him for nearly three hours. While it certainly would have been interesting to see what someone like Will Smith or Idris Elba brought to the role, Foxx's presence in the film is never a sore point.\n\nRobert Richardson's photography is (predictably) some of the best of the year. Ditto the production design. What was a point of concern going in-the film's editing-turned out to be nothing. Fred Raskin proves a worthy successor of the late Sally Menke. The film's rhythms are welcome (it moves like a Tarantino film) and sometimes, a little surprising (see the aforementioned Jonah Hill scene, as well as a very revealing scene that pops up late in the film).\n\nIf this is the \"most\" anything within the Tarantino oeuvre, Django Unchained is probably his most thematically rich film. Superficially, it's a revenge film set in the faux West, but there's so much beneath the surface about identity (Schultz gives Django the last name of \"Freeman\") and masculinity. It's a really terrific movie on every level, and it's absolutely worthy of Tarantino's towering filmography.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/django-unchained-review/",

            "content": "Django Is an Instant Classic\nOne of the hardest, most uncomfortable things for the populous of the United States as a whole to talk about in our history is slavery, and the awful things that happened during this time in our country's' past are things that we avoid, and things that not many enjoy speaking on. This simple fact only emphasizes how amazing Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is. This film is about a slave, being Jamie Foxx, just a couple of years before the civil war. In Django's struggle for freedom he encounters a German bounty hunter by the name of Dr. Schultz, Christoph Waltz. Dr. Schultz and Django become friends and go through the effort to make the African American Django, a free man. After this the two go on numerous adventures in exchange for bounties of wanted men, and later end up at the plantation of a man named Calvin Candie, who is played by Leonardo Dicaprio. This place, where they encounter, \"Monsieur Candie,\" is a plantation with the comedic pun of a name, Candieland. While at Candieland Dr. Schultz and Django enact a thoroughly planned strategy to attain Django's long lost wife who currently is enslaved at Candieland.\nChristoph Waltz and Jaime Foxx play two relatable characters that anyone can reason with and liken to. First, in Waltz' role as a bounty hunter he holds himself in such a way that you can not help but like him. Whether it be his way of speaking with a respectful, and insightful tone, or the way he conducts himself in all facets of life. The way he walks, talks, and communicates with everyone else who is around him is fantastic. Doctor Schultz acts in a way that I imagine any decent man would act from todays world, and that is what makes him so great.\nNext, Jamie Foxx' Django is quite possibly the opposite of who I am today, me being a white college student in the progressive twenty-first century, and him being an African American man who is in the ignorant and simpleminded nineteenth century. But yet, somehow, Django is one of the most loveable and relatable characters in this movie. This is directly because of the way that Foxx brings this character to life. He's tough, romantic, sensible, and determined. While Tarantino did devise the script in such a way to create this character, it's the little things that Foxx does that really makes Django the man he is. The way he grits his teeth the way he stares at people, and even the way that he fluctuates his voice when talking to slaves versus non slaves, it is just brilliant. \nActing is not the only central aspect to a quality movie, sound effects are often a crucial piece of filmmaking that are often overlooked, but in this movie, Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino uses sound effects to perfection. The filmmakers make small events so much bigger, for instance, the breaking of bones are gruesome not gross, the galloping of a horse is majestic, and the creaking of a door is ever so eerie and enticing that cannot help but leaving you wanting more. These details that are often misused or even forgotten in most films make Django Unchained uniquely immersive and help take you to another world. This often overlooked aspect in filmmaking is beautifully manipulated in, and throughout, the entirety of the film by Tarantino.\nThis movie may make you uncomfortable since it is about such a controversial, and touchy topic. After watching this movie, you may think, \"where has the time gone,\" since the film is so long, two hours and forty-five minutes to be exact. But, at the end of this movie, I can guarantee one thing, you will be satisfied. Tarantino is a genius, who is accompanied by the amazing acting trio of Foxx, Waltz, and Dicaprio; this combination is deadly, and anyone who has the time should spend it watching this film.",

Django Unchained follows Django, a black slave that is 'freed' by a bounty hounter, Schultz, and they soon become good friends and partners in \"crime\". Schultz asks Django for help in his bounty hunts and later he helps Django buy back his wife from one of the biggest plantations, Candyland. I won't go deep into the plot as there's a lot to explain, but I will say that it runs a bit too long. I've a few ideas how they could've shortened it up and still make it as amazing as it is. Anyways, the movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino. I'd say that says everything about what the movie is like, but for the sake of those ignorant of him, I will say more than it's needed to be said. The scenery is beautiful and the movie is very colorful, especially when a scene happening is situated outside, rather than inside a house.  The violence is amazingly fun! Nearing the end there's quite a lot of shootouts and they're all so pretty to look at! It was a great experience, especially with that soundtrack in the background! The characters are very well developed and the actors did a great job portraying them. I especially enjoyed Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters as they were quite extraordinary people. Also, having seen The Hateful Eight as well, I've noticed that Samuel L. Jackson's characters in both movies say the same sentence \"I'm sure I don't know\" which I'm sure is not a coincidence, which is why I pointed it out. Speaking of Samuel L. Jacksons, he looks very old in this movie! I was surprised to see him like that. The story is interesting, though as I've said, it runs a bit too long. At times I was, like, \"How is this movie going to end\" because some scenes in the movie seemed like the movie might be coming to an end, but there was still over half an hour left! Other than that, I had literally no problems with the movie. Everything from the atmosphere to the acting in this movie was amazing! I'd highly recommend checking this movie out!",

Tarantino doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of slavery which creates an even more uncomfortable feeling at times when these upsetting themes are explored through, and juxtaposed with, his style of hyper exaggerated violence and off beat humor.\n\nHistorical accuracy aside, on a technical level, per usual, everything comes out looking aces with top notch set designs, costumes, and sound. The dialogue was sharply engaging for the most part, keeping me off kilter with a tone unoften employed when depicting such serious subject matter.\n\nThe cast was on point here with Jamie Foxx leading the way as the quietly charismatic and steadfastly determined titular character. Waltz is an absolute gem and one of the best actors out there now, but I will save further gushing for an Inglourious Basterds rewatch. Di Caprio is able to pull off a unique portrayal as the despised plantation owner by inspiring a tremendous amount of revulsion in the viewer with his actions while at the same time demanding their attention with his sophisticatedly syrupy diatribes and exhortations, leaving me disgustedly impressed.\n\nI did appreciate the level of catharsis achieved by the conclusion and while I was entertained I was also simultaneously reminded of many horribly inexcusable and unbelievably upsetting truths about our species. Because of Tarantino's style I can understand why I have heard some of the criticisms that I have for this film that you would never expect to hear for a movie like 12 Years a Slave, however I can also argue that as long as people are being confronted with these undeniable truths, who may not have been otherwise, that is a positive thing no matter the form or medium. 8.5/10\n\nSamuel L. Jackson Binge: Jackson's outstanding, and enraging, portrayal of Stephen, the most well positioned slave on Monsieur Candie's plantation stood out among a totally stacked cast. This was one of his most physically impressive performances I have seen so far as Jackson totally embodied his elderly character. Jackson adeptly acted his character's advanced age when to his benefit with stooped shoulders and a cane wielding shuffle, while dispatching a Machiavellian level of quick witted cunningness in maintaining his elevated position by Monsieur Candie's ear. You may not personally like, and will probably even loathe, his character here but that is all the more credit to Mr. Jackson this time around.\n\nSLJ January #21",

Django Unchained suffers from this and is a bit of a \"Curate's Egg\" of a movie. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Dr. Schultz, the smart-talking bounty hunter who frees Jamie Fox's character, Django, from slavery while on the hunt for a group of ruthless, murdering brothers. The first part of the film is witty, clever and enjoyable. Shultz and Django team up to catch some of the most wanted criminals in the US and make themselves a small fortune. However, the movie begins to unravel as the pair head to Mississippi to track down Django's wife who was sold as a slave to the ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is good in the role but this segment of the plot feels flabby and contrived. Where the earlier sections sparkled with some great dialogue and were blackly humorous, the latter portion drags and stumbles along. This is a shame as it rather left me waiting for the film to end rather than wanting to find out how the plot would be resolved. It all could have done with tightening up and would certainly have been a better film had it been given from a few editorial snips here and there.",

Django has been enslaved, torn apart from his love and forced into a life of misery. While being transported, Django is soon given his freedom by a bounty hunter named Schultz, in return for his assistance over the winter. However when Schultz finds out about Django's love, he feels compelled to help, leading the duo on a dangerous mission that will see them encounter a sadistic slave driver, Calvin Candie. In typical Tarantino fashion, he manages to pluck the best cast money can buy, with solid talent including Foxx, Waltz, Goggins, DeCaprio, Jackson, Washington, Johnson, Hill and even original Django, Franco Nero. Tarantino has always been a master of script writing and performance and Django is no departure here, characters will elaborately discuss all manner of topics during their travels and Tarantino manages to create a wealth of interesting and quirky characters. Shot on film, Django is gorgeous to witness, its colours are potent, the surroundings all feel perfect and shots all feel highly cinematic, all these things have never failed in Tarantino's efforts, what problems do arise are sadly unforgivable and completely stop Django from becoming a masterpiece. There are 3 main problems with Django, the first is Django himself, Foxx is excellent as our hero, he completely cannot be faulted for his performance, however Tarantino seems to be less interested in our lead and more interested in Waltz's wonderful character Schultz. Waltz is a brutally brilliant thespian, so there is no shame is coming second fiddle to his towering performance, however Tarantino decides this is more his story than the protagonists and just when it looks like Foxx hits his stride, DeCaprio thunders through, with Tarantino having Waltz and the heart throb chat it out for a huge chunk of film. It seems insulting for Foxx, he is a more than capable actor, holding many a film on his own, here he is never allowed to run with it until the end, which leads me to problem number 2. Django is about 20 - 30 minutes too long, the film has a clear ending, one where its obvious the drama and action should culminate, however just as you feel your heart race and proceedings are getting wrapped up, Django derails itself, with a character who has spent the entire run time, not allowed to hold the film, now holding the film, as we back track into needless territory for the sake of a rubbish cameo and another shootout, its just infuriating to watch, knowing Tarantino just couldnt stop himself from being over zealous. Finally Django fails in the auditory department, yes Ennio Morricone's score is out of this world, but just as you are suckering into the world and the time, Tarantino thrusts you out with modern day hip hop, that befuddles and destroys any illusion of setting, by trying to come across as quirky and relative. With these 3 factors, lining up side by side, Django constantly feels like its at war with itself, its a brutally brilliant and enjoyable movie, with some out of this world performances, stunning visuals and vicious action set pieces, but with 3 critical flaws, Django and Tarantino miss out on crafting a tightly packed and stellar outing.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is movie DJ Quentin Tarantino's 7th film, and his first foray into Western territory.  \n\nThe film stars Jamie Foxx as the titular Django, a slave who has been separated from his wife during that slavey time in US history.  One day while walking in a chain, his march is abruptly halted by Christoph Waltz, who plays a German American Bounty Hunter, posing as a traveling dentist.  One way or another (watch the movie fucker) he manages to get Django in his employ so that he can identify a couple of people needed for a bounty.   Together they set out on their adventure towards the west.  \n\nDuring their travels, Waltz becomes impressed with Foxx's good marksmanship, and friendly company, and decides to extend his hand in partnership.  As they travel around collecting bounties, they form a bond, and it's agreed that Waltz will help Foxx find his wife, ahem, 'Broomhilda' (fucking Tarantino). \n\nUnbeknownst to the pair, Broomy, is living in the most racistly racist plantation in the South, known as Candyland (more similar to Willy Wonka's factory than you'd think), run by its 'White is Right' owner John Calvin Candy, and staffed by his loyal house nigger Stephen.  Both challenging roles are expertly portrayed, the former by Leo Dicaprio, and the latter by Tarantino veteran, Samuel L. Jackson, with their relationship serving as a broken mirror image of the one shared by Foxx and Waltz.  \n\nGetting down to the nitty-gritty, this is an expertly woven storyline, with characteristic Tarantino dialogue, a decent amount of laughs, and the typical Tarantino level of over the top violence.  The characters feel like they're really interacting with one another, and the world feels fleshed out and realistic - which is sort of unbelievable considering the pulp feel of this film.  \n\nThe cinematography is good, but lacks some of the impressive and memorable framings found in other works by the director.  The lighting is what tends to stand out more here, with places like Candy's private Mandingo fighting room putting on a level of opulence and warmth so over the top that it almost emanates through the screen.  \n\nTarantino's films have become noted for their soundtracks, heavily reliant on music from pop culture, and Django Unchained is no different.  The film makes heavy usage of Ennio Morricone and Luis Bacalov (two famed Spaghetti Western composers) songs, including the theme song from the Corbucci classic Django, from which this films title, and character's name is derived.  Unfortunately, Tarantino decided to break the 4th wall, in a sense, by including a trap-snare filled song from Rick Ross called 100 Black Coffins which not only doesn't fit the scene it's in, but it fails to do so in an ironic fashion.  This pulled me out of the movie by way of my suspension of disbelief in a method so severe that I don't think any other situation in any other film could compare.  The choice of song actually feels vaguely insulting to me, in the sense that Rick Ross uses the moniker of a famous Drug Dealer, while he himself was a corrections officer prior to becoming a rapper, giving the whole line of \"we need a 100 black coffins\" an air of such inauthenticity that it cheapens the message of the film.  As a result, the trade off for using a \"gangster song\" to make the character seem \"gangster\" ends up feeling like a complete cop out.  \n\nBut, I digress.  Essentially, the film is marred by it's partially spotty (still partially amazing) soundtrack, its lack of any particularly memorable camera work and shots, a few characteristically over the top deaths, and a couple of jokes that dragged too long.   Still, that isn't quite enough to give it a bad review, and the amount of good things in this film are enough to heavily outweigh the bad.  \n\nTL;DR - 8/10\nDjango Unchained is a good piece of film, but when stacked against Tarantino's other work, it does fall flat.  The dialogue and story doesn't compare with Pulp Fiction.  The tension and grittiness doesn't match Reservoir Dogs.  The brutality and intrigue doesn't match Inglorious Basterds.  The over-the top action and out of place music doesn't match Kill Bill.  The result is the film is much less memorable, and I blame part of that on Django's character himself.  Jamie Foxx is a good actor, but he offers absolutely nothing to the lead character, and the whole movie suffers as a result.  In fact, if you were to take away Waltz and Dicaprio, this film would absolutely plummet in rating, and it's not enough for a film to be propped up by two supporting actors at the expense of the lead.",

It's an epic movie, but it seemed like its serious scenes didn't combine well with its comical ones. Sometimes, actually, it felt as if I was watching a cartoon, rather than a drama movie.

I unfortunately have never seen a Tarantino film in cinemas and this movie is unluckily no exception. My dad managed to find a good quality copy and watched it. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie definitely does use the many tricks and elements of past Tarantino films but that isn't any fault and somehow creates a universe of wit and danger.

            "content": "This is one of my favorite movie this year. Thank Tarantino for giving me two short but happy hours of surprise and excitement. I've heard a lot about this film before, but never had a chance to watch it until now. Tarantino's work never disappoints me before and yet He brings us another masterpiece of his film fantasy.\n\n    Just to make it clear, I am not really a big fan of \"Westerns\", whether it is American Western or Spaghetti Western. The last Western I remembered is still \"No Country For Old Man\". However, I am a big lover of Rockstar's classic game, \"Red Dead: Redemption\". After watching this film, it just gave me an urge to play the game from start once again.\n\nFirst, I'd like to share my opinions on this film from an overall perspective, then shift our focus on the performance of the cast.\n\nTo beginning, I like Tarantino's version of aesthetics of violence, thus every minute of the film is of great joy to me. Watching gun blazing like fire spitting, blood splashing like a fountain and people hit by bullets like a watermelon, not to mention the splendid explosion scenes, makes my blood burning and heart pumping fast. Every aspect of violence scene is done well and some horseback riding scene is excellent. I always tend to think Tarantino creats films in a way like a kid playing with his toy as he can do whatever he likes. As a result, in the making of this film, Tarantino's imagination is like an unchained horse running wild.\n\nAs is expected, Tarantino's film always comes with great music. Every piece of music used in this movie has the mark of his unique taste. If we listen to these music separately, most of them would feel special, some even odd. But when put under the context of movie, every single piece of music just blend in with background and it surprises us to realize that they are in perfect harmony with each other. It always gives me great pleasure to listen the background music as the movie progresses, and I smile every time when I don't understand  why the music feels so right in the movie. But there is only one problem, the rap songs. Is it just me or the rap is really out of place? It always bounce me out of the movie. Not that the raps are bad, but whenever it is played, it just don't feel so \"western\" anymore. But anyway, it could be just me.\n\nAlthough this film enjoys considerable merits, it's not flawless. As I said, Tarantino's imagination is unchained. But as a result, it also lacks direction or focus. As I quote from another high voted review, \"I enjoy every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels\"(Reference Link). For example, the search for the Britle Brothers which I initially thought to be the centerpiece of the film ends too fast. I anticipated it to last at least half an hour before Django and Dr.Schultz complete their first mission. However, it ends in minutes. It would be episodic if it is more detailed. Beyond this, the film ending seems too smooth for Django, even a little unreal. For example, it is totally unreasonable for Stephen the butler and Lara the hostess to give Django away to a railway company when they have a chance to finish him. For a merciless and skilled bounty hunter like Django, he is certain to come back and take his revenge. He kills a dozen of fully armed slave overseers within minutes, how can you feel safe when he is in custody of anyone? Nevertheless, a few flaws can not belittle many virtues of the film. Djanglo Unchained still remains to be a great movie, so I will rate it 9 out of 10 honestly.\n\n\nAlthough this film has a genius director and a well-written script, it still can't become a classic without its wonderful cast.\n\nFirst of all, Dr.King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz is my favorite character. Christoph gave great performance in this movie. as he did in \"Inglorious Bastards\". Though Dr.Schultz is a merciless bounty hunter, but he deeply despises slavery. \n\nMany other wonderful performance are present in this movie as well. Another actor that stands out of the cast is Leanardo Dicaprio. His brilliant performance portrayed a seasoned and cruel slaver with greed and hypocrisy. Jamei Foxx as the main lead, though shadowed by the above two actors, still gives great performance. Though at first he is not comfortable in Django's shoes, but once he finds his foot, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. I think he has a special talent for comedy, because it feel extremely funny when he tries to play serious, like when Django tries to give the slaves a piece of his mind in order not to \"break his character\". As a subtle actor, He is also able to offer audience a peek into Django's emotions with  a little changes in his expression or gesture. Summel L. Jackson's performance as the black butler Stephen is also outstanding.  Stephen is obviously more experienced than Dandie. After nearly 70 years of torturing slaves, he completely betrayed his race and degenerated into a lickspittle for the slavers. Djanglo calls him \"snowball\" not only because  his hair whitened because of age, but also because he is a \"white\" slaver with a black face. The audience hates Stephen more than Dandie, so it gives me great joy to see Djanglo put Stephen into justice.\n\nIn summary, \"Django: Unchained\" is a must-see for a Tarantino fun and anyone who  is looking for a western with thrilling action and funny comedy.",

Tarantino mixes the themes of revenge, american slavery and not to forgot, the Blood sport action scenes. But most importantly, its the characters that you take away from this movie. Be it brutish Calvin Candie, the soft spoken Dr. Schultz or the quirky Django, every single character in the film is remarkably been portrayed. The background score gives an added thump to the story and takes you forward. \nHow often do we see that a bunch of Cowboys are riding in a grass field and a rap song starts playing in the background. It takes guts to make a scene look authentic and different at the same time and this is what the director and the cast has done. Di Caprio shines in this movie, but the real man is Christoph Waltz. He spears the film and sets the tone with his unusual charm and elegance being embedded in the character of Schultz. Jammie Foxx gives another good performance and suits the bill for Django.",

            "content": "Tarantino may be well-known for his use of violence in the films he makes, but he is also great at creating complex relationships between characters and plots which need analysis, such as in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. With this film, it is pretty straightforward what the plot is: Schultz needs Django to identify and kill the Brittle Brothers and then he offers to help rescue Django's wife Broomhilda. This film is easier to follow than some of the best Tarantino films, which is good for enjoying the film but disappointing if you like Tarantino's complexity such as the out-of-chronology plot of Pulp Fiction.\n\nHowever, one element that is maybe better in this film than some previous Tarantino works is the use of dialogue and monologues to create elaborate metaphors through their subtext, which is surprising because Tarantino has already proved to be a master of dialogue. The best scene of this film is probably when Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is presenting a skull of a slave to Schultz and Django and talking about dimples within the skull that represent a slave's submissiveness in order to illustrate that not just slaves, but all black people (including and especially Django) need to be put in their place. It is one of the best monologues written by Tarantino, and an accident on set made the scene even creepier: DiCaprio wasn't supposed to actually cut his hand in the scene by smashing a glass, and he wipes his actual blood on Broomhilda's (Kerry Washington's) face which elevates his menace to a whole new level.  Other important dialogue in this film includes Schultz telling the legend of Broomhilda, racists complaining about the bags on their heads, and Schultz reflecting on what Alexandre Dumas would think of Candie's evilness.\n\nWhile I'm happy that Christoph Waltz got another Oscar for a performance in a Tarantino movie, I'm a little surprised by this at the same time.  Hans Landa was a much more complex character than Schultz, and Waltz rightfully deserved his Oscar for that role, but in this film, while some moments with Schultz were undeniably funny, all I saw was a bounty hunter with great diction and good wit from time to time. I'm not saying his performance wasn't good, but attempting to look at the film objectively, I don't see how Waltz should have necessarily been the front-runner for the Oscar.\n\nI'm surprised that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb, seeing that my third favorite Tarantino film is Inglourious Basterds, but what I have to admit is that this is probably one of the funniest Tarantino films to date with many good moments where Schultz steals the scene and especially the scene with the racists complaining about bags on their faces. Even the most violent scene of the movie is funny at parts since a worker on Candie's plantation gets shot a ridiculous amount of times, sometimes by his dumb partners, and he lives longer than he should and keeps screaming and becoming more agonized throughout the shootout.\n\nI generally really like this movie, but the third act is a little disappointing in my opinion, and I think Tarantino could have written the ending in a more satisfying way if it were close to or combined with the biggest shootout of the film. But then again, I guess an ending like that would have been too simple or would have seemed like a cop out. What Django has to say at the end of the film is pretty great though, and I wouldn't change that a thing about that, but towards the end of the film it seemed 20 minutes longer than it should have been.\n\nA very good Tarantino movie (though when is he NOT good?), but not one of his best. But maybe I'm of that unpopular opinion because I have a bias towards Westerns? Who knows?",

Most of the films are dialogue with violent scenes intermittently popping up as a way to drive the story forward. I loved that other than Hitler, my most hated character in Inglorious Basters was played by Christopher Waltz, the same guy who played my most loved character in this film.

This is the first time Tarantino has completely disappointed me since his short section in Four Rooms. For good reason, it took me awhile to get around to watching this one. First, I sensed it would be a let down from the trailer and plot synopsis, which pretty much showed it was going to be Inglorious Basterds, substitute Nazis for Slave Owners. Second, I don't like Jamie Foxx since his \"Lord and Savior Barack Obama\" statement, and third I could see it was only going to glorify more racial division, which it did. \n\nDjango Unchained follows slave turned freeman, gunslinger Django and the man who bought his freedom, Dr. King Schultz around the south. Schultz is a bounty hunter and he soon teaches Django the ways of the trade. Their journey leads them on a search for Django's long lost wife, and that search leads them to Candyland and Calvin Candie the ruthless, sadistic proprietor. \n\nThis has to be one the most overrated films of the last decade. Nothing happens, nothing. A German meets a slave, turns him into a bounty hunter and from there.... long conversations(entertaining at times, but for 2 hrs 45 mins you'd expect more) and blood, blood, blood, blood, and more blood. \n\nThe movie has a good look and I'd love to see Tarantino go full out Spaghetti Western, but overall it's not worth a damn. The acting is good, but the whole cast, as in most recent Tarantino movies, don't play real human beings, but caricatures. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx(even though I don't like him, he truly is a good actor) give good performances as always, but stealing the show was Leonardo DiCaprio as the ruthless Candie. If only Tarantino didn't have to overblow every piece of this movie, the performances would have made it worth the look, but in the end, it was a waste of time.",

I was expecting something kinda more like Inglorious Bastards, and in a way I did as it has the same feel, length, and gore, but a petty pace and story.  The worst thing with Inglorious Bastards is the unbearably slow pace, as scenes last way to long with nothing happening, then of course the plot and unrealistic nature of the movie jut made me hate it, not leaving a good impression on me of Quentin.  But I was impressed my this one.  The story is far more interesting, better played out, and engaging.  The acting is good, and the script is good also, with many notable quotes. Scenes do go on for long times at parts, but have stuff going ok that keeps us interesting at least and plays a role in the film, making for a good story with developed characters.  The characters are pretty badass for the most part, or funny, or just interesting, but all have a place in a movie that covers a grand expanse of North America.  The action is of course what gives Quentin his name in all of his movies, this one maybe more than others.  The mass use of overdone blood and the sounds it makes as a body absorbs a bullet, however unrealistic, is awesome to watch making for some of the most bloody, different, yet fun to watch shootouts I've seen.  Just the blood left over in the house after the shoutout must have been gallons, all down the walls, floor, and simply everywhere.  The rest of the effects and stuff to make the shootout good where there too so it was quite entertaining, but not in a bad way.  The ending was again a massive explosion with most people dying, and Django walking off with his rescued wife. Typical Quentin movie, but a good fun watch with a good story, characters and acting, even if some scenes where a bit slow or long, but it was entertaining none the less.",

Tarantino is one of the best directors in terms of direction and in general terms. He is not apologetic and he shows how harsh it is. Tarantino wanted to get his point across by showing how harsh the conditions for the slaves were but also has a tale of revenge that is great.

            "content": "Full of anachronisms and heedless of any form of caution or subtlety regarding its subject, Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western-stylized, Blaxploitation slavery epic, revenge thriller Django Unchained takes the filmmaker's brazen, over-the-top antics to their extreme; the film blends genres while exciting the plot with dramatic zooms and bloody, stylized shootouts set to music associated with the spaghetti westerns of Italy. The revenge flick follows Django, a slave, freed by a certain Dr. Schultz, as they travel the American south pre-Civil War to kill white men for money as bounty hunters and to track down Django's beloved wife, who is being held as a slave on a famous plantation named Candieland (after the eccentric plantation owner Calvin Candie). In true Tarantino style, the movie is entertaining and visceral - it never bores. But it also, unfortunately, never really transcends the genres that it pays homage too, and doesn't really seem to have all that much to say about either revenge or racism; at times, the film almost flips the racism that it despises on its head, branding almost all white people as horrible villains.\n\nThere is a certain honesty, however, to the portrayal of slavery and bigotry in the pre-Civil War south that is admirable amidst all of the pulp; a particularly poignant moment, after Calvin Candie has one of his slaves torn apart by dogs, has Jamie Foxx's Django saying to Candie, after not batting an eye at this violence, that he's too used to America to have this phase him - he's used to seeing people fed to the dogs. Moments such as this, and the brutal whippings throughout, are as harsh a portrait of slavery as has ever been seen in American fiction. This is admirable. But the movie doesn't seem to deal with slavery with much tact as it progresses, and every character comes across as over-the-top, unrealistic, and each has his moments of racism, even the black characters.\n\nOccasionally, the film succeeds at an odd form of slapstick satire, for lack of a better phrase - particularly early sequences involving the first plantation owner that Django and Schultz visit, \"Big Daddy\" Bennett. Schultz and Django arrive at Bennett's plantation and Schlutz requests that Django be shown around by a slave woman, but that the woman not treat him like a slave - he wanted that made expressly clear - but like the free man that he is; Bennett, a terrible racist having been won over by Schultz's offer of quite a lot of money, asks Schultz to clarify: does he want Django to be treated like a white man? No, heavens no, he didn't say that - only that Django was to be treated as better than the other black people around the plantation, because he is a free man and Schultz's valet, after all, not a common slave.\n\nAfter violence breaks out in typical over-the-top Tarantino fashion and things settle down, this quirky and tense triangle escalates in hilarious fashion in the following scene, when Bennett is revealed to be the leader of a local branch of the KKK. The galloping of the KKK is a giddy, gothic, glorious moment set to dramatic classical music that sweeps over images of men dressed in white hoods riding across open fields and grasslands - but then the scene stops, and the men assemble and intend to discuss their plans to kill Django and Schultz, but wind up complaining for some time about the hoods that they are wearing and how ridiculous they are, and how some guy's wife on the team didn't do a good enough job cutting out the eye holes, because none of them can see out of them, and then the woman's husband gets upset and rides off, and the KKK members feel kind of bad but admit that the wife could've done a better job cutting out the eyes... the scene goes on like this, and it is a highlight of the film, one of Tarantino's fine, unexpected verbal battles that are often the best parts of his movies.\n\nUnfortunately, though there are moments of inspired dialogue, it feels here more so than ever before to be a little more forced, a little too self-conscious, not as assured as the dialogue and storytelling construction that made his past films so special. In Django Unchained, it sometimes feels like Tarantino is trying too hard. Even more disappointingly, the film lacks the great suspense builds that made Inglourious Basterds so completely gripping - there are no scenes here, really, like the bar scene in that film, or like the great opening conversation between Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa and the Jewish farmer - scenes in Django explode into violence, yes, but with far less of a build, and whereas Landa was a cool, collected villain who broke naturally into devilish sadism, Calvin Candie (played by Leonard DiCaprio) seems to be just purely insane: he snaps and flips out, memorably breaking a glass with his hand (DiCaprio's own blood bled in that scene) but lacks the dark assurance of Landa (as enjoyable and theatrical as Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is). But this is a problem that hits at the core of the main problem with Django: Tarantino has finally gone over the edge with his characters, and they have almost fully become caricatures. And unlike in Inglorious Basterds, they aren't given as much room or space to really come to life and revel in their environments. For some reason that I can't quite pinpoint after a first viewing, I was far more disappointed with his characters here than I have been in the past.\n\nThat is not to fault the performances, however. Jamie Foxx gives Django a certain fierceness that is captivating to watch, and he portrays his wounded, enslaved past and violent strength with equal weight. Kerry Washington gives an emotional performance (as emotional as Tarantino gets, at least) as Django's wife, stolen from him by the racist plantation owners who made them slaves. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is wonderfully over-the-top and colorful (the problem is with his character himself, as stated above). And Samuel L. Jackson gives a wonderful supporting performance as a racist black man who stands by Candie and watches over the plantation.\n\nI found it difficult to accept Christoph Waltz's performance in this film during some moments not because it is a bad performance - quite the contrary - but because the baggage of his previous role in a Tarantino movie carries over to this, and Tarantino seems to be doing little to guide him in a new direction. The performance feels like it has the same nuance of speech and same hints of danger as Waltz's Landa; however, here he is meant to be a dentist turned bounty hunter, not a sadistic Nazi. There isn't any of the dentist here, except for the ridiculous bit of art decoration atop Schultz's stagecoach early on. Just the bounty hunter.\n\nA bit more depth, greater character development, and the addition of more suspense and more subtlety (not Tarantino's strong suit, I know) would have guided Django Unchained in a better direction. As it stands right now, I was entertained from start to finish, but found myself wanting more. It's a good enough bit of cinematic entertainment and a loving ode to genres seemingly forgotten by the masses and by Hollywood today, and Tarantino is still one of cinema's most unique and exciting voices; however, Django Unchained is not, in my opinion, one of his best.",

He has a good look, but he just doesn't have that stern, cold presence that I felt the character needed. If only the movie was made at the peek of blaxploitation cinema, Fred Williamson would have been perfect for the role.

Terantino movies are very tongue in cheek with a lot of irony based on dark character studies.

If however you can take it in context and \"get\" the humor in deadpan and funny situational shenanigans then you see that a lot of the violence is ironic and...well glorified for the heck of it. He takes on taboo topics many won't touch and he does it in a way that is brash but not directed at any \"group\" singularly so it can offend everyone, therefore nobody really gets mad about it (if that makes sense).

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is one of his more recent works of cinematic art. The plot is original; the cast is well-known, and viewers will never get bored throughout the film, even though it is almost three hours long. Basically, the film is about a slave named Django, portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who teams up with a \"dentist\"/bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz. Django becomes a free man and helps Dr. Schultz find bounties, so the two become great associates. Schultz teaches Django about how bounty hunting works and how to shoot a gun. While getting to know each other, Schultz finds out about Django and his wife being split up after trying to run away to the North. Django and Schultz set out and find Django's wife Broomhilda, who is played by Kerry Washington, and find out she is at Calvin Candie's (Leonardo DiCaprio) plantation. Making and executing an elaborate plan, Django gets his wife back, yet at the cost of many, many lives. The ending leaves the moviegoers with a sense of satisfaction and happiness but with a hint of sadness. Tarantino won many awards, including two Oscars, which means that he really outdoes himself with this film (IMDb).\n\tThe acting in this film is crisp, fresh, and not to mention Oscar worthy. In the scene when DiCaprio's Calvin Candie finds out of Schultz's real intentions behind being at his plantation, he holds Broomhilda hostage with a saw. DiCaprio slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass cup, consequently, cutting his hand. Nonetheless, DiCaprio never breaks character, continues his role, and even goes as far as to smear his own real blood on Kerry Washington's shocked face. Also, this scene was not scripted. Kerry Washington was appalled by this action and you can see it in her face (Rosen). Many people would have stopped what they were doing to go get their wound checked out, especially a cut that needed stitches, yet DiCaprio continued his role as Mr. Candie. By the way, DiCaprio's cut did need a few stitches. This great scene was able to be produced because of one little accident of a glass breaking. Another example of great acting is when Dr. Schultz says goodbye to Mr. Candie after giving him $12,000. He refuses to shake Candie's hand and walks away, but Candie will not let him leave without shaking hands. Schultz reluctantly returns and shoots Candie dead. The acting in this scene makes Waltz seem as if he really despises DiCaprio in real life. His general walk of loathsome behavior, furiously shaky tone in his voice, and even fluid actions seem as if he could not wait to pretend shoot DiCaprio. His expression, which consisted of pursed lips and eyebrows bent in the angry position, is just one of great hatred. His overall acting in this scene is first class.\n\tThe special effects of every scene made this movie a great deal more entertaining. During the shootout at the Candie residence, Django skillfully shoots many of Candie's henchman to the point of leaving them in pieces. The bodies lie around in agony with blood all over them was like something out of a crime scene. About ten bodies are stacked in the center of the Candie mansion, and most of these bodies have holes as big as a person's fist. When the characters are shooting each other, pieces of flesh fly in all directions, which would explain the giant holes that I mentioned previously, and the flesh that is being blown off seems extremely realistic because of the motions that it goes through while in the air. All of these effects add to the movie's entertainment in that it keeps the viewer from becoming bored by all of the action. The elements of action are heightened in the scene where Django shoots a person's belt, which contains dynamite, and the person just blows up and causes dust to fly everywhere. The guy that blows up just disappears into a cloud of dirt and smoke. After the dust settles, there is fire and a giant burn mark around the area where the dynamite goes off. Audiences are left in awe after viewing this because of the fact that dynamite would actually cause all of this damage. The special effects make the movie much more memorable and entertaining. \n\tThe music in this movie is extremely varied and fits the movie well. The song \"Django\", composed by Rocky Roberts, is played when introducing Django in the opening scene. It shows Django, along with a few other slaves, being led through the desert. The song fits well because of the fact that it has a \"western\" tune to it, and it doubles by actually introducing the protagonist. In the scene when everyone is traveling to the Candie plantation, the song \"100 Black Coffins\" by Rick Ross plays. It happens to play right after a tense moment between Django and one of Candie's henchmen. The song gives the film a more modern feel to the movie, making it more appealing to the younger audiences, but it also foreshadows events that are going to happen. The music choice is different than any other film of this kind; it brings a modern and compelling feel to the scenes.\n\tDjango Unchained is added to the long list of Quentin Tarantino's movie masterpieces. His actors being committed to keeping the scenes going no matter what and the special effects make this movie one of the best of the year 2012. This movie will forever be remembered in the history of movie making.",

It does not deserve the label \"blaxploitation,\" most often reserved for bad B movies.  This one may capitalize on Black anger and use the antebellum South's horrific practices as a perfect setting for Django's \"coming of age\" as a free man, but it rises so far above the genre in just about every respect that the label just doesn't apply.  Aside from the off-putting shooting of a horse by main character Schultz in the very beginning of the film, this is one of the best I have seen in a very, very long time and the *only* Tarantino movie I have been able to sit through.  The bizarro is actually somewhat minimal, with the exception of an unexpectedly side-splitting and totally derailing raid discussion about the logistics of wearing a white hood.  Just watch it!",

Jamie Foxx og Christoph Waltz leverer herlige tolkninger i denne Tarantino-filmen, der sjefen selv dukker opp mot slutten i en kvartett som er minst like lettlurte som meta-kvartetten i Jarmusch' \"Dead Man\". Tarantino køler på med det han kan best: postmoderne blodsprut og kvikke replikker. Foxx i blå dress og rapmusikk på totalbilder i fra ville vestens 1850-tall funker helmaks. Uten å røpe for mye så står vel heller ikke sluttscenen(e) så mye tilbake for andre orgier som f.eks i \"Scarface\". Tarantino kan humor og han kan å skrive dialoger. Min favorittscene må være den heftige diskusjonen som oppstår blant klansgjengen som sliter med dårlig sikt gjennom hullene i den hvite hetta - noe som ikke faller i god jord hos ektemannen til hun som har vært oppe hele natten og klippet ut øyehull! Fantastisk bra humor som kom veldig uforventet - sånt liker jeg! Tarantino har gjort mye rart de siste 10 årene, men var tilbake på sitt beste med Inglorious Basterds i 2009. Jaggu klarer han ikke å overbevise denne gangen også. Anbefales!",

Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi slave plantation owner (also known as Candieland in the film) who Foxx and Waltz try to rescue Django's wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington, who is a lovely and an emotional presence in the film. Watching her and Foxx together again for the first time since \"Ray,\" just proves that they are one of the best on screen couples right next to DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in \"Titanic.\" Samuel L. Jackson is also great as DiCaprio's house slave Stephen, who is without a doubt as Jackson put it himself is probably going to be \"One of the most hated Negros in America cinema.\" But let's not also forget the surprising and good performance by Don Johnson as Big Daddy, one of the slave plantation owners of Tennessee, that Foxx and Waltz trick into thinking they want to by one of his slaves in order to track and kill the three Brittle Brothers that Waltz's character has a bounty out for and also whipped Kerry Washington's character after Foxx's character pleaded with not to at the last plantation that he and his wife were together at before being separated after trying to escape.

QTs formula is a unique story, colorful, yet brilliant dialogue, a couple of long build-ups to super tense situations that engross the viewer and perfect endings.  He is simply one of the best.  Hands down.  However, with Django Unchained, while there were tense moments, they weren't nearly the level of the adrenaline shot in Pulp Fiction, the opening scene to Inglorious Basterds or the latter's basement bar scene.  Django is a fantastic film that is quintessential Tarantino.  The dialogue is fantastic.  The acting of every major character is unmatched.  Yet, because it lacked those crucial tense moments that made me feel the same way I have before inTarantino flicks, it does make me wonder if he has worn out his formula and needs to pull a Scorsese and do a film like \"Hugo.\"  Then again, if he just isn't capable of doing that, I'd watch as many Djangos as QT wants to film since, really, it is better than 99% of the crap out there.",

He just owns the role completely. Alongside him stands the good doctor (Christoph Waltz) and the evil slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Waltz does a great job as the quirky and odd doctor, and he and Foxx have great chemistry. DiCaprio plays for the first time, a character I hated. He did such a sublime job at playing this rich southern slave owner. I cheered internally when he met his demise. \n\n   The film has so many different vibes.

I  kid you not, there is a rap song twice in this film during an action scene. \n\n   \"Django Unchained\" was not at all what I expected. From start to finish I was entertained by this funny, bloody, quirky western driven by tremendous performances and great direction from Tarantino.",

There's something in us as movie-goers that will always love to see the bad guys do bad things, then get their comeuppance. This film is no different, and it just oozes cool. It finds that magic spot of taking something just past the point of being silly to being somehow awesome.\n\nAs evil as Christoph Waltz was in Inglourious Basterds, he is equally good and badass in this film. He deserved that Oscar. Such a great character.\n\nDiCaprio, playing the rare villain role, chews the scenery and pulls off being the guy you \"love to hate.\" That means he did something right.\n\nJaime Foxx filled the leading role well enough, he certainly has the physicality for the role- but his dialogue delivery suffers a bit. I almost wanted to say to him \"speak up,\" like he was restraining his voice. Weird.\n\nAnd if course, Samuel L. Jackson kills it. Plain and simple. \n\nThis is an explosively violent, cleverly written, anachronistically bold musically, strangely funny \"Spaghetti-Southern\" with an incredible supporting cast. Great film.",

Fair dos, 12 years is beautifully shot and features powerful performances, but its pointlessly misery inducing. \n\nAs if you need to convince any clear thinking 21st century citizen that slavery is wrong. We know its wrong, we know racial discrimination is wrong. Granted, not everybody accepts these truths, which is more of the reason why Django Unchained is the better film about slavery as it more immediate in its message. \n\nThings might be different if (institutionalised) slavery was still a big thing in America. Maybe then would 12 years' approach be more the appropriate. But in an age where the urge to hate for no decent reason is hidden behind more widely accepted moral codes and propagated subversively when fear its at its most potent, presenting \"truthfully\" this bigoted and dark, dark period is not going to do any good in enforcing the message that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable. Racist people and similar scum nowadays claim not to be what they are and the worst of the worst don't even acknowledge their evil. They don't know they are evil,  a \"Banal\" attitude when guilt no longer effects and they just act because its all they know. \n\nThe same attitude aristo wannabe Candie sports where he is totally unaware of his own villainy; to the point where he takes major offence when Django and Schultz try to steal back Broomhilda from him. He is so blissfully unaware of his obvious moral lapses that he takes severe umbrage to Django and Schultz' actions. HE thinks he is the one who has been wronged. This is the dark heart of human evil pumping strong, loud and proud without shame of any kind. \n\nThis is what makes Django the better film, how Tarantino highlights the absurdity of the situation and goes to a certain extent explaining how such an institution as slavery could thrive so prosperously in an admittedly still very young nation which founded itself on ideals of freedom and democracy. Whereas 12 Years just showed it, Django explained it, then and now that this happens, its happened throughout all of history and will continue to happen and all we can do is fight those who strive to keep such ideas alive in our society. \n\nOn this basis, i'd even say Django is even the more humanist film than 12 Years, the braver therefore, the smarter as well and sure as hell the more entertaining. It also has the benefit of being an actual cinematic work and not just an unoriginal two hour TV special.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is the latest film from Quentin Tarantino, of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill fame.  He is a filmmaker known for smart dialogue, brutal violence, and various over the top indulgences.  This film does nothing to break that trend.  Anyone going into this film should know what they will be getting.  This film should be viewed as a bloody action, suspense, humor, hybrid that is over 2 and a half hours long.  This is not \"12 Years a Slave.\"  That film is harrowing, realistic, and painful to watch.  Exposing the crime of slavery with no romanticism whatsoever.  This movie has extreme violence against African Americans as well, but it serves to set up the cathartic desserts that are served at the end of the film.\nThe acting, as to be expected in a Quentin Tarantino film, consistently hits the mark.  With the exception being Kerry Washington, who really isn't given much to do in the scenes she is featured.  Leonardo DiCaprio is mesmerizing as plantation owner Calvin J Candie, whose genteel nature is just a ruse for a heartless, vicious temperment. Just as exciting to watch is Samuel L. Jackson, the very definition of an Uncle Tom who appears harmless at first glance and is anything but.  \nThis being a Tarantino joint, you are going to have to deal with some overlong scenes and one misplaced one, where a would be mob has an issue dealing with the eyeholes on their masks, seems like it should belong in Blazing Saddles instead of here.   However, on the whole the pacing here feels much better than in QT's last film, Inglorious Basterds.  \nThe extreme violence of this film cannot be overstated.  I do not know if \"Mandingo\" fighting was a real thing, but it is disturbing and very difficult to watch as presented here.  The scene also lets us know what kind of human being our heroes are about to deal with regarding Candie.  There is also another ultra-gory shootout that you may feel a little guilty to be thrilled by.  \nI feel QT takes the revenge aspect a little to far in the end.  The whole mission of the film was for Django to get his wife back. He does, and then instead of getting out of Dodge while the getting is good he goes back to Candie's estate for one last, totally over the top confrontation with Samuel L. Jackson.  It becomes a little indulgent to say the least, you will be ready for the movie to end.  That said, there are a number of great moments and you will not mistake this film to be from any other filmmaker out there.  Score: 8.5",

It stars Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (won best supporting oscar), Leonardo DiCaprio,  Samuel Jackson (in another great and unusual villainous performance) and Kerry Washington.  It has been called a Western, because it takes place in Mississippi circa 1860.  This film is about a freed slave who partners with a bounty hunter, and also searches for his wife, who was sold to a different owner.  The film was criticized for use of the \n\"n-word\", but it is about as moving and convincing a statement against slavery as had ever been made.  The film is full of violence and blood, like many Tarantino movies, but none of it was gratuitous or unnecessary.  This is a great movie in a time where the film business has been in a prolonged slump.  The film is highly entertaining, gripping, riveting, heart-wrenchingly moving, and probably the best movie made in the previous 10 years.  Tarantino's method of story-telling, and his use of high comedy to clearly expose the foolishness of human actions, harken one back to the great Mark Twain. With this film, Tarantino has solidified his place as the preeminent director of this era, and proven that he is a true genius.",

If Leone has a corner on the market for spaghetti westerns, then Tarantino has himself the first great chitlin's southern. \n\nJamie Fox is great as usual, but it's Christopher Walts' Dr. King Schultz who steals the show with his calm, courageous bounty hunter persona. It is a true joy to see him work his magic against the slave traders, the Marshall, and the plantation owner; a marvel to behold, as the doctor slowly calms and then dismantles his victims with logic and, so often, the lure of big money. It is the lure of big money and the inherent greed of those willing to talk \"business\" that is the final nail in the coffin for most of his \"transactions.\" \n\nA fine movie from top to bottom. And considering the great injustice slaves went through, who can't enjoy a good white redneck being taken down in cold blood? No tears shed here, as most viewers would probably agree. That great joy can been seen especially in the best belly laugh Django has when the KKK members get blown to bits by a dynamite blast. \n\nHey, there's even humor. The KKK who-made-the-eye-holes scene was a true belly laugh. And the doctor's smooth, even at times silly statements are a hoot as well: \"My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony.\" The dialogue throughout is priceless. \n\nThe only issue I have with the film is the excessive blood, especially the ending  (and the water-melon-being-dropped splats! that pepper the film as blood, bone, and sinew fly). I also think the end was a bit overdone, the immovable plantation obliterated, but I guess it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without all the mayhem. A good watch indeed.",

My 'Tarantino watermark' remains \"Pulp Fiction\" and this movie doesn't rise to that level of film-making; after a sluggish start it's not until the last hour that this picture reaches a full gallop. At times the film takes on a distinct feel as a spoof to viewers taking us back to the 1960s westerns. The music was above average and perhaps the movie's best quality.

However, it is the sharp performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the cruel and merciless plantation owner Calvin Candie that steals the show in this violent tale set in the south prior to the civil war. Inspired by the 1966 Italian made western Django, Tarantino wrote a script for this film that accent and combine his unique style of filmmaking with the \"spaghetti western\" genre while presenting an eye-opening look at slavery in the deep- south during that period. In typical Tarantino fashion this movie was not made for the faint of heart with its extreme graphic depiction of violence and torture...so be warned.

Since he was covering a subject that hasn't been covered, I guess I assumed it would be as revolutionary as Pulp Fiction, but for the most part it was pretty basic (For Tarantino standards.) I believe it relied a little to much on its premise, without tending to developing new and interesting characters.

But the first half was a superbly written masterpiece that very often had me in the moment, with no idea of where the train was actually headed. Christoph Waltz's character was particularly intriguing, pairing quick wit with gun-slinging skills. The sequence with the klansman complaining about having difficultly riding with the bags over their faces was just the most ridiculous, hilarious, and brilliant part of the entire film. I could certainly have done with a little less race language, though I suppose there's never such as thing as \"just the right amount\" of the n-word in a movie, and it's not like it was out of context.",

            "content": "\"Django Unchained\" is a very interesting, well-edited, well-directed and acted film, but it's also an uncomfortable film. Whether you have a problem with the violent depiction of slavery, the idea of a slave hero taking revenge, the torture that's shown, the death, or the blood, it just doesn't go down easy. As an action film it works rather well, and the fact that Django (Foxx) is out for vengeance against those that have wronged him and his wife, makes it one of the better motivated films about revenge. It also puts traditionally shown torture in exploitation films into a new context, as it's realistic and historically accurate, which only adds to the unsettling quality of the film. Christoph Waltz gives an amazing performance as a character that so rarely gets written or shown onscreen. Leonardo DiCaprio is very malevolent as Calvin Candie, showing us a villain that is almost unknowing of the absolute cruelty he inflicts, while also being arrogant, pompous, and spoiled. As a dandy he is nothing but interesting, although much more awe-inspiring is Samuel L. Jackson as the head house slave Stephen. His performance was incomparable, obviously the more complex and entertaining villain, even alongside Candie's absolute evilness. Stephen is both treacherous and crafty, unlike many villains seen before, and the fact that he betrays his own people makes him the more hated. The ending is where this film lost me. It kind of peters out here and there before gaining back its momentum, inevitably slowing to a grave pace at certain points. While the ending was significant in the awesomeness of the action, it felt tacked on in some way, less satisfying than if Django outright won, without consequence. That may seem selfish of me to say, and small minded, but a shootout would have felt better deserved.",

The film of course uses a lot of shots that are both a satire and a tribute to spaghetti westerns (like the very fast zoom-ins that give the film the kitsch quality of the old, Italian b-westerns) but Tarantino seems to use them for no other reason than to be playful. Under this post-modern, playful surface there is a very conventional plot, which pretends to be dealing with a serious subject like slavery. Gone are the daring plot structures of Pulp Fiction, gone the subtle black humor and the unexpected dialogue; in their place we see silly humor (like the guy who is shot repeatedly by his own guys in the mansion) and testicle-shooting jokes. Yes, the Christoph Waltz character is entertaining but not as much as his writer would like to think. But actually the problem transcends this film and has to do with the attitude of audiences today, who are uneducated in cinema (because they only watch films that are from 90s onwards) and see in the empty post-modernism of films such as this, intelligence; or mistake the countless references to other films (they haven't seen) for depth. This fake post-modernism under whose skin lies the wolf of a cheap, easily-digested philosopy of consumerist Hollywood has nothing revolutionary, despite selling itself as such. Tarantino's films were all style and no substance from the beginning of his carreer of course (and the self-consciousness of this was their strength), but now the style doesn't seem fresh anymore and the films are trying to be something more than empty style, they try to be meaningful in resolving conventionaly the tensions of the linear plot.

Why make a film where the violence is uncomfortable to the point of exhaustion, then make scenes where we are supposed to be cheering for the violence on screen. It seems like a sadist's exercise in cinema at points and that really knocks the film down a lot. The ending was the worst part because the film ends with an explosion of vengeance that wasn't needed.. The film was showing some of the horrors of slavery and yet it expects the audience to jump out of their seat in excitement when more people die in brutal ways? I Just wish if they were making a film about a freed slave becoming a bounty hunter, that they stick to making a buddy western film instead of injecting scenes of  a cruel nature which doesn't fit with the film. A film like \"12 years a slave\" perfectly works because it is a true story showing you the horrors of slavery at it's worst without becoming a fantasy  like Django.

The tale follows the life of Django, as he manages to transform himself from a mere slave to one of the best gunsligners around. Whilst I never consider Fox for his acting, he portrayed the driven character convincingly. Alongside the excellent Waltz, they are a fine lead duo, cleverly ensuring that things almost always go in their favour. The film takes an interesting; if not expected turn, when they begin to pursue Django's love interest; the brilliantly named BroomHilda. From this point on the film steps up a notch in tension and excitement, due considerably to the ever brilliant DiCaprio. His portrayal of Calvin is amongst his best work (although I am beginning to use this phrase all too often). The somewhat psychotic character perhaps optimises those who possess great power and money during this era. The scene set around the dinner table is of great quality, particularly as the blood of Calivin' s hands is that of his own. I half expected the medics to come charging onto the screen, but it inevitably added to the performance. \n\nHumour also runs throughout which is more than welcome; albeit unexpected. Jonah Hill and Samuel L Jackson stand out, and keep everything relatively light-hearted. I did however think this element went somewhat too far, so as to detract from any tension or emotion. Whilst the shootout towards the end was amusing and somewhat exciting, it did seem too spoofy. However overall this was a very enjoyable watch, featuring multiple stand-out performances from the leads.",

He expects people to enjoy gratuitous violence without any remote meaning. And sadly, looking at the success of the film, he's right.\n\nNow it is not fair to say the whole movie was bad. While Django himself was boring and flat, Christoph Waltz was a joy to watch. But it was Leonardo DiCaprio who completely stole the show from the moment he was on screen. Great acting that fit the movie absolutely perfectly and created the best character in the film, by far. \n\nEveryone else in the film was completely forgettable. And as to Samuel L Jackson, I was just confused. There were no explanations, no meaning, and nothing to take away from his character. \n\nThe only reason this film even deserves 2 stars is the fun, adventurous first three quarters of the movie.

This film is very well directed by Quentin Tarantino. This film is really entertaining and I love the scenes of Django Schultz killing for money. This film is so gory and just tones of fun, although one of my problems is that while I do appreciate the two different types of violence Tarantino is using, over the top gory and fun like the candy land shootout and the more disturbing violence like the Mandingo fight or the dogs ripping apart the slave or Broomhilda being tortured. I'm fine with the violence and it's not like I couldn't watch any of it but at some points I don't feel the two times are handled too well. The candy land shootout is amazing. The soundtrack is very good and this film is just a lot of fun. However I think the films is just way too long. The film is nearly 3 hours, I mean Tarantino has made some long movies before but I think this film is just too long. The ending is in my opinion a big let down when compared to just how good the rest of the film was. There's a whole sequence involving Tarantino in an acting role as a miner. In my opinion that bit should have just been cut. For me the first two acts are fantastic but the third act is let down. However the amazing candy land shootout does somewhat make up for it. While Django Unchained is a great film I just don't think it's as good as Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and Inglourious Basterds.

            "content": "Wednesday, January 15, 2014\r\n\r\n(2012) Django Unchained\r\nWESTERN\r\n\r\n It's supposed to be a homage to the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Corbucci and Leone but after already seeing so many, I actually thought this film had no rhythm in terms of the storyline. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino who writes great dialogue but it doesn't seem to belong to this film since the perception that wealthy residents of Mississippi speaking perfect English like they all have 100% IQs is unrealistic since it has always been a proven fact that throughout American history the state of Mississippi contains some of the less educated people of the United States Of America. No matter how long ago the film is based on some of the dialogue exchanges is similar to how some people speak here for theirs hardly a character that speak like how people used to speak during the 1800's and from the most racist state too.         \r\n\r\nThis is two movies and not one where at the first half is Django helping and aiding a German bounty hunter- the second half centers on bounty hunter Schultz helping Django retrieving his wife back from the Leo Di Caprio character.  Jamie Foxx stars as the title character Django who was initially walking along with a group as a slave until he was saved by a bounty hunter who calls himself Dr. King Schultz played by Christopher Waltz.  At this point we don't fully understand why he saved him, but it was for financial motivations, since Django happens to know who and where some the wanted men happened to be located- and they're wanted dead and alive which means that besides personified as not being likable characters because they're racist that they also perform other atrocities against whites.  Tarantino has shown many great ideas but for reason they're not well executed here, for instance at the beginning, Schultz defends himself from a couple of racist outlaws escorting the slaves who're walking with chains on their hands and feet.  Schultz then manages to shoot one person dead and killing the other outlaws horse.  The guy curses but doesn't try to slip his leg out of his dead horse, and as Schultz and Django are leaving, the other slaves then attack him.  This scene is baffling since throughout the years I've been watching Westerns and so forth ... and from what I know from real life, majority of them who're in that exact situation are able to pull or slip their leg out, but in this film, he's completely helpless and unable to do that. I mean, if you're going to make a movie, check if pulling one's leg out is not possible. \r\n\r\nAnd the scene after the Schultz and Django gather up their kills, how did Schultz know when and where a particular racist mob is going to come after them, for the movie never explains.  Nor do we know about how Schultz is able to know  whether or not other racist mobs are going to come after them just because most citizens at that particular time don't like the idea that Schultz is associating himself with someone who's supposed to be a slave.  I mean, what's stopping other mobs from other towns coming after them since some of the wanted people Schultz had killed also had friends as well for those 'wanted dead and alive' situations seems almost entirely blatant. And it's the result of Tarantino watching many \"Spaghetti Westerns\" and not so much American ones. And because Tarantino has a habit of duplicating certain scenes from other movies, some of them don't seem to be better than what I had already seen such as \"Mandingo\" and the gun scenes that is similar to \"A Better Tomorrow II\". Tarantino stuffs his characters with a lot of smart dialogue but they don't appear to belong to this film if viewers were to compare this with other Spaghetti westerns, you will find that many of it's dialogue especially the ones directed by Sergio Leone one will be able to see that the dialogue exchanges are always compromised with the Eastwood character saying the least. We don't see any of that done here.  Winner of 2 Oscars out of 5 nominations. \r\n\r\n2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "Finally, Tarantino has created a film that he has been paying homage to for so many years. Django Unchained is Tarantino's 7th film and still hasn't lost his touch. Sadly Django Unchained is not perfect, as it has problems.\n\nDjango Unchained follows the same approach that was applied to Kill Bill, driven by a clear end goal and uses a linear approach in telling it's story, despite a few flashbacks. Though similar, it is a major improvement from Kill Bill as Tarantino keeps our attention with it's quirky characters. Characters in this film are definitely a much needed depth, with a richer backstory, in comparison to his previous films. Though the story does somewhat touch on previous territory, like the Django being trained by Schultz similar to The Bride trained by Pai Mei and Bill, and also moments where characters are camping telling a story. The film is definitely a big film, with a story that spans on long periods of time and creating personal growth for the protagonist. It would have been more interesting, if Django Unchained explores more of his personal and physical journey of becoming a bounty hunter. The film's dialogue is quite fun and it plays around with the dialogue found in classic Westerns. I did enjoy the fact that Tarantino has written two characters that clash in personality, Schultz and Candie, as their conversations with one another especially towards the end was thrilling to watch. Great dialogue is being written for Schultz and Candie as they represent the most over the top characters in the film, aside from Samuel L. Jackson's character. The Schultz character is definitely a complex one, for a Tarantino film, as this character seems to be doing his bounty hunting job as he has a sense of morality, which is probably the main reason why Candie and him resent each other.\n\nDjango Unchained tackles the genre that Tarantino seems to be in love with the most, and it seems like this is a film he has always wanted to tell but because this is a Tarantino film, it doesn't stay on course with the traditional Westerns by exploiting a topic that is barely touched on in the genre or at least not commonplace within the mainstream films, slavery. This does make the film a bit controversial as not everyone can be comfortable with the topic and even to the point of being offended. Both Inglourious Basterds and this film, touch on history but they don't ever become a social commentary or it never places the situation on trial, rather it is just used as a backdrop. Tarantino avoids having his characters become a representation of the cultures within that era. If you want to watch a film that touches on these themes with depth and fueled by a message, then watch Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, but if you want to see a fun film then watch Django Unchained. This film in a way follows Kill Bill's approach in it's story, with a clear end goal, but this film balances the style and substance much better with it being consisted throughout the entire film. Django Unchained strays away from Tarantino's common use of the non-linear narrative and leans on to the conventional 3 act approach but keeping it feeling fresh due to his style. There are 2 scenes that were done so well that they deserve a mention, these scenes are the KKK segment and the Dining Room scene with the principal characters.\n\nRobert Richardson returns to work with Tarantino and their collaboration always seems to give off positive results and this is mainly due to the understanding of each other's vision. Both have created a look that is reminiscent of the classic Westerns, using a warm palette to create the atmosphere and softer shots, in order to have the audience feel immersed to the era. The film also contains the quick zooms and close ups that were found in the films that this is paying homage to. With each subsequent film, Tarantino's budget and trust from the studios seem to rise which allows him to be ambitious in his work using multiple locations to film and build up faithful and detailed production sets. As the characters in this film have much more depth than Tarantino's previous film, the photography was able to convey that depth to these characters which then sells the character's motivations.\n\nSimilarly to his previous film, Tarantino has taken a soundtrack approach rather than hiring a composer to create an original score for the film. The tracks he chose though are score driven and again chooses the tracks that are either from Morricone or at least similar. That does allow the film to feel like a Leone film at times. Tarantino interestingly enough has used Hip-Hop/Rap music on certain moments but it comes off more as humorous, which allows the audience to not take the film too seriously and maintaining that fun upbeat tone.\n\nDjango Unchained may not be an ensemble film like Inglourious Basterds but this is due to the story being a bit more grounded and personal. Jamie Foxx as Django was a decent choice but he didn't really create something astonishing here with the character or maybe he was severely overshadowed by the acting performances from Waltz and DiCaprio. This is definitely the best that I have seen from Kerry Washington but it doesn't seem to be enough for me to highly appreciate it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio on the other hand was a stand out in this film delivering performances that will always be remembered when people look back at their filmography. Waltz was able to come off as charming which makes him so likeable and he delivers his lines with amazing grace. DiCaprio creates this menacing character but at the same time able to give off a sense that he is a phony and a bit of a try hard. Samuel L Jackson was great in this, with an introduction to a character that will leave you surprised on how unlikable this person is.\n\nDjango Unchained is a fun Western film that I have been waiting for him to make since he started his film career. It contains amazing performances and great direction from Quentin Tarantino. Yes, Django Unchained could have been better but it has enough great moments for this to be in the stronger side in the director's filmography.",

The rest was bland rehash stuff from revenge flicks previously done and done better. Waltz is a great actor, don't get me wrong, but he did the exact same character from Inglorious Basterds, but he was switched to the \"good\" side. This is in no way a masterpiece. It has gore, action and a great cast, but people should stop brown nosing Tarantino for his movies. They're redundant and very boring. It is better than the atrocities he made in the nineties such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but just barely. People need to get their heads out of Tarantino's ass and tell him his movies suck because this is getting tiresome.",

Well, if Tarantino traveled in time to the antebellum south and he witnessed something we don't have registered in history, yes it really happened. They chose the best one to be the white villain, DiCaprio, because his script was psychological and DiCaprio always do a good job when it comes to this. It went too slow and the story was very unilateral, we need more perspectives if we have a 165 minutes movie. The racist black played by Samuel L. Jackson was too much, maybe the purpose of that character was to make you angry, but hey, the black racist was even more racist than Calvin Candie (DiCaprio). We have a lot of blood at the end, to satisfy the need of brutal action that we lost throughout the movie; it was a positive trait though. The sacrifice of Schultz was unnecessary, even when it increased the quality of hero that Django already had (now he's not only reclaiming his girl, now he's taking revenge for his friend).

I was 25 years old when Pulp Fiction came out and remember thinking that it was one of the most fresh and original films I had ever seen; I loved every minute of it. The Kill Bills were clever and inventive, and for me, Inglorious Basterds was perfection. I mention these things because I truly \"get\" where Tarantino is headed most of the time with his art's direction, but I think he completely sold out the younger generation with Django. Mind you, I am no champion for black rights, but I found the use of Rick Ross and Tupac in the soundtrack for a 19th century film to be not only a bit disrespectful, but incredibly nonsensical and merely a thinly veiled attempt to draw in the Millenniels. Whereas the over the top violence worked well in the Kill Bill's, it was certainly ill placed in a movie concerning slavery. Leo was awesome, as was Don Johnson and Jackson, but Jamie Fox seemed to walk through the role mimicking his worst Clint Eastwood impression possible.",

Personally, Christoph Waltz steals the show here, but Jamie Foxx, Leo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson all deliver top-drawer performances, that they all seemed to be having great fun with.\nTarantino's characters are always larger than life, and must be an absolute dream for performers to get their teeth into. \nYet another 'must-see movie' from QT, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the films overly long run time. But that's it's only flaw.",

Probably 45 minutes too long. Almost nothing seems to happen for nearly an hour in the first half of the film. The dialogue isn't a patch on some of his best films, and the whole thing is massively self-indulgent. The final scenes are simply ridiculous: if you thought the slaughter at the end of  Kill Bill pt1 was gruesome, you ain't seen nothing. The very last shots are awful; utterly trivial and (IMHO) a huge misjudgement of tone that undermines some of the serious depiction of slavery and brutality he's lingered on for the previous 163 minutes. They nearly ruined the whole thing for me (but by then my patience was already gone...!). \n\nI didn't much care for Inglourious Basterds on first viewing, but really liked it second time around.

            "content": "Tarantino's latest film is, shall we say, over-ripe. Of course, the film is too long and generally in bad taste (focused on slavery and bounty-hunting in 1858). In the past, I might have rewarded a director who leaves the throttle open and goes for the gusto on all fronts, but I've never been one for the spurting blood capsule brand of violence and the use of the N-word (apparently 109 times) is patently ridiculous (if not also offensive).  Nevertheless, when you set those things aside (if you can), then I think we can see that Tarantino has a masterful touch as a director who pays attention to the tempo and pacing of scenes, to the suspense that can be generated through camera movement, cutting, and, of course, his trademarked dialogue.  He creates incredible set-pieces that are set apart by purposeful lulls (in this film, shot against nature's majestic beauty in some cases, or beauty created by the director's eye, something new in Tarantino's work). However, there are just too many set-pieces, as if the temptation to show-off could not be resisted. Jamie Foxx is persuasive as the ex-slave turned bounty hunter but Christoph Waltz very nearly steals most of their scenes together with his witty German bounty-hunter.  Leonardo DiCaprio is weird as the plantation owner into slave-fighting, almost transcending his usual self, whereas Samuel L. Jackson as the sycophantic head slave proves unable to do that even under old man makeup.  A film in line with Inglourious Basterds in many ways and showing Tarantino's development on many fronts but always with his glee in teasing the audience with anachronistic music (Jim Croce, modern rap), comic asides (the KKK-bag scene), cameos and recycled stars of the past (Franco Nero, Don Johnson), and so on.  Despite his greater control, he just can't control himself.  Finally, does the film tell us anything about slavery that we didn't already know? It is grim material for a film.",

It's a little degrading but totally worth it, now that I'm realising I just had the misfortune of watching bad movies when I went alone before, and it can actually be enjoyable, so long as the film itself is good.\n\nDjango Unchained is totally good.\n\nIt's not without flaws. It's broken up into pieces in much the same way as Tarantino's last effort, Inglourious Basterds, but where in that case the segments made up little chapters, in Django, the segments just unpleasantly breaks the story-flow apart and brings you out of the environment Tarantino worked so hard to create (also titling one of these chapters with no capital 's' in 'Somewhere' pissed off the OCD Grammar Nazi within).\n\nAlso, why did the soundtrack feel the need to sing about everything that was happening? I was watching the movie as it unfolded, and the twangy voices in the background served solely to aggravate me and bring me further out of the actual drama. It's meant to be an exploitation film, not a Randy Newman concert.\n\nThere's a scene where KKK forerunners reenact the Lion King, which was just plain ridiculous, but they (complete with Jonah Hill) at least manage to make this humorous, unlike my other qualms with Django which make it just plain stupid.\n\nFor the most part though, the film's great. There wasn't much chance of it being anything else, Tarantino's a master who I've enjoyed since his very beginning (though an argument could probably be made for the failings of Death Proof). The flashbacks are brilliant, the colour scheme is some of the most fantastic work I've seen, there's great lines such as \"I like the way you die, boy\" to walk away with, and the shootouts (though admittedly 100% foreseeable) are some of the most enjoyable work I've been able to watch this year.\n\nPeople will complain about the film for many reasons, I'm sure. Not least amongst them is the fact that Django Unchained has use of the word \"Nigger\" probably more than any other film I've ever seen. But also because the pace wasn't fast enough for some, or maybe the events weren't all together historically accurate. But this film is powerful, and at the end of the day, Tarantino is here to right characters. Perhaps none in this were as staying as Hans Landa (portrayed by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz [Epic, Carnage, The Three Musketeers, The Green Hornet] who in Django plays Dr. King Schultz) of Inglourious Basterds, but the fact is he wrote a role for Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception, Gangs of New York, The Man in the Iron Mask, Critters 3, The Departed) that actually made me like him. Which is something I've been managing to avoid for years.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson's (The Avengers, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Spirit, 1408, S.W.A.T., Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction) work in this alone is enough to make Django worth watching, not to mention the fact that Tarantino had me genuinely convinced that Jamie Foxx (Due Date, Law Abiding Citizen, Jarhead, Stealth) being up on a horse was a big deal, just because he's black. He cameos the (quite literally) most convincing Australian accent I've ever heard in my entire life (from a non-Australian, of course) and more importantly he does it by the side of genuine Aussie John Jaratt (Rogue, Wolf Creek). It may have had nearly as many endings as The Return of the King but Django Unchained is well worth the three hours it runs for.\n\n78%\n\n-Gimly",

            "content": "Django Unchained, the latest in director Quentin Tarantino's string of gratuitously violent revenge flicks, is also the first film of his that I've had the opportunity to see in its entirety. I have no real grounding comparing it to his other films, so I want to see how it holds up compared to movies in general that deal with racism, or the Wild West. In the latter regard, Django Unchained was fantastic as a standalone action film. Right as I saw the opening scene, with Dr. King Schultz casually shooting a slaver dead in order to acquire Django, I was riveted to my seat. Despite the nearly three-hour length, I noticed no issues with pacing, and was continually invested in all the witty banter Tarantino had to offer. The writing, which won an Oscar, held the movie together, seamlessly combining comedy, drama, and general awesomeness into a tale of epic proportions. Django Unchained, first and foremost, is a character piece-nothing happens unless it reveals or alters a major character arc, and that gets rid of any banal repetition the movie would otherwise have to bear. Furthermore, the characters are unpredictable, making the jigsaw puzzle of their collective saga all the more interesting to solve. \n\nAny film can attempt to tackle the heavy subject of race, but it takes a masterpiece to flip the issue over its head with any real success. Django Unchained achieves this by reversing the roles of white and black, master and slave, and then makes this transition as natural as possible. For instance, plantation owner Calvin Candie is not only entirely dependent on his slaves for his profits and lifestyle but also entirely trustful of them with these things. Part of this humanization of the villains may stem from the good reputations of the A-list actors who play them, but the villains themselves are also written as what amounts to the living embodiments of hypocrisy. \n\nWhile the villains of this movie have muddled motivations, Django's own intent is obvious-to rescue his wife Broomhilda from slavery. Despite this being the first Tarantino film I've seen, I was well aware of Tarantino's penchant for over-the-top blood and gore, which made me worry that Django would trade his sense of heroism for pure revenge. Then I actually saw the movie rather than jumping to conclusions, and it seems that to Django, revenge IS heroism. Quite simply, the former slave has nothing left to lose, and must regain not only his wife but his dignity. Therefore, he'll never be morally satisfied until all who oppressed him feel the same wrath that was inflicted on him, on Broomhilda, and on all slaves. In this film, this path is the only one that makes any sense. \n\nThis bloody, unapologetic variety of thematic exposé also left me caught off-guard by the level of visceral comedy inherent in the film. All the humorous banter both veiled to the characters and made clear to the audience a growing ascent towards an epic showdown, a dramatic foil of every character onto one another: Django and Schultz, Schultz and Candie, Candie and his favorite slave Stephen, and Stephen and Django. Each case wrought mutual resentment out of the fundamentally polar and irreconcilable differences everyone holds between each other. Skin color is the easiest example, but the same applies for two people born into the same race-for instance, Schultz's intellect and sophistication inversely reflects Candie's feigned interest in the arts and cultures. Meanwhile, the title character of Django, whose hatred of those who enslaved him and others compounds with the visceral imagery of hotboxes, whiplashes, and runaway brands, never had much humor stem from his own character arc, instead working off of others' interpretations of him (i.e. paraphrasing his former owner with the line \"I like the way you die, boy\"). In this way, his life as a free man is shaped fully by his experiences in the movie. And just when matters settle down, BANG! Someone is lying, dead on the ground. Yes, there's a bit of blood, but I can easily tell it's fake. I was made to laugh at the demise of minor troublemakers or major outlaws, knowing that each of their actions in life were all in vain. I enjoyed myself despite my moral objections to murder, and I wanted more of the satisfying resolutions to petty characters. Anyone versed in these sorts of hard-R films may think I'm too naïve for my own good, while those who tend to avoid the films for these reasons might also try to reason some sense around me. This is the nature of the Tarantino film, and it will never go away. And I love it. \n\nSo to sum matters up: the directing is superb, the writing is fantastic, and the acting is phenomenal. The movie knows how to make me laugh even and especially when drenched with the gratuity of Hollywood splendor. It parodies itself in its overdose of violence, In any case, I appreciate how this film retains all its viscosity and balances the violence with the right characters and plot needed to provoke that violence. No, it's not perfect, but that's not the point; the point is to have fun. Django has truly been unchained. And now, I feel the same way.",

            "content": "Django Unchained is not an excellent movie and certainly isn't Tarantino's best movie, but it IS a good movie overall (even despite the approx. 3hr runtime).  It shows how Tarantino has matured as a filmmaker over the past 20 years.  Previously rough edges are now smooth, familiar.  This includes the cheeky violence Tarantino is famous for.  His movies are the rare sort where it's legitimately okay to laugh at the sight of a woman flying full-force off screen while being gunned down in cold blood.  While Tarantino the screenwriter and filmmaker has reached a new level of maturity, Django breaks no real ground as far as storytelling goes, and breaking ground is what made Tarantino famous.  But I think Tarantino's most significant achievement with Django, thanks to Jamie Foxx's & Christoph Waltz's superb talents, is to create a new legend of the Old West (or more accurately, the Old South).  A new American myth as iconic as the real historical figures or any of Clint Eastwood's characters.  A film this memorable, an instant piece of our American culture, is a rare feat, and Django Unchained is worthy of that status.  Jamie Foxx, of course, deserves a great chunk of the credit for for bringing Django to life with the intensity that has shaped him into an Oscar-worthy actor.  But underneath that brooding, vengeance-filled intensity is a thin veneer of humor to remind us of Django's humanity.  I like his story, including the aspect of a person able to snatch Opportunity from adversity - the rare kind of opportunity which lets one discover who they were always meant to be.  Speaking of opportunity, I also enjoyed the opportunity for Leo DiCaprio to really cut loose in a role like he did with Calvin Candie.  Playing villains allows one to fully tap and explore a wild side.  Most protagonists have to restrain parts of themselves, and these are roles DiCaprio mostly portrays.  He's played angry & intense characters,  but none have quite let him unleash an erratic and amoral personality quite like Candie.  Christoph Waltz, I believe, was truly the best actor in this film, which is saying a lot considering his co-stars' performances.  But I loved his smooth-talking, intellectual character with an innate sense of justice that may or may not conflict with the laws and social mores of the country in which he operates.  Kerry Washington's performance was also solid, as was Samuel Jackson.  Like DiCaprio, he so rarely plays villains, especially calculating sniveling characters like Stephen.  I delighted in watching him pull that off spectacularly.  But Stephen is where the crux of my criticism lies.  Django Unchained is obviously a Magnum Opus for Tarantino, an epic to rival that of the Kill Bill movies while paying homage to spaghetti westerns of yore.  But even at almost 3 hours, you can feel Tarantino had to cut much of the story he intended to tell.  I wish he had found a way to split Django into a series of films because, again even at nearly 3 hours, this felt rushed.  I felt like some of the characters' stories were incomplete or discarded.  (I still maintain my theory that Stephen was the real power behind the Candyland throne and Calvin was just a front.  I really believe Tarantino intended this, but switched it to the current version for time or whatever).  You could argue the incomplete characters are hints at a much larger world of which Django and his adventures are a small part, adding another complex layer to this film.  I'd say that's a good argument, but it still doesn't shake the feeling that some of the storytelling art was cut for the sake of time.  That brings us full circle to why Django Unchained is such a good movie.  Even after nearly 3 hours, it imprints itself on our memories, leaving us wanting more, hoping to see or read more about Django and his world.",

Stylistically taking off where Inglorious Basterds left us (OTT historical fiction) Tarantino exclusively follows Jamie Foxx's Django from his break for freedom with Dr. King Schultz (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz) through to his bounty hunter training and subsequent attempts to free his slave wife from the clutches of Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's Deep South slave plantation owner is another highlight in a film of great performances including Samuel L. Jackson's phenomenal turn as Stephen, Candie's entrusted and apologetic aging black slave. The acting is clearly top notch throughout and Tarantino's controlled direction and blinding score makes the (rather lengthy) 2 hours 40 minutes run-time a joy trather than a pain. With the amazing soundtrack accentuating the emotional journey, Tarantino has made a brilliant film and in this reviewer's eyes, the best since Pulp Fiction. Django does Entertain!

What appears on the surface to be a cheesy, violent spaghetti western goes a ton deeper, touching on the themes of slavery, racism, and religion in real and often hilarious ways. Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christoph Waltz all give Oscar-worthy showings (congrats to Waltz on actually winning one). I admit to rooting for Moonrise Kingdom for Best Original Screenplay, but I'm not too mad that it went to Tarantino.",

I know there has been criticism towards the racism presented in this film, however the film is set during the slavery years, so it has contextual justification. Once again there is a superb cast, from the dynamic Jamie Foxx as the lead, from the sophisticated Leonardo DiCaprio and wise cracking Samuel L. Jackson. Once again, Christoph Waltz is the true highlight  as he becomes the charismatic, witty and law bringing bounty hunter. With a faster pace and bloodier action than his previous work, Django Unchained is likely to keep almost anyone entertained from start to end.

Though Foxx does well as Django, the character is simply a bit uninteresting and stoic, though indeed likeable. Leonardo DiCaprio nails his egotistical Deep South slave owner Calvin Candy perfectly, once again leading people to question why this man is Oscarless at this point in time. Samuel L. Jackson shines in his role as a grumpy foulmouthed house slave on good terms with his master Candy.

An indication about the ignorance versus intelligence of innocence was made clear in the story telling part - minute 47. Furthermore in that part, several interpretations of freedom and love are also possible. Of course, all of the above review is just more than what Tarantino's films deserve. Creativity sometimes is being marked upon simplicity. As to newly celebrate a black protagonist, it quite raises the orthodox question of whether spotting discrimination is racism or not.

I wanted to like the film very much and kept waiting for some convincing, if stylized storytelling . The principle fault was pacing, which was pokey and slack. Genius though his dialogue may appear on the page, or the computer screen, Tarantino doesn't seem to have learned that film dialogue, even the conversation we consider \"literate\" or \"bright\", requires a ruthless efficiency.\n\nThe constant references to the cheesy tics and tacky tropes of old exploitation movies in the work of Tarantino as passed the point of being homages, tributes displayed in new films that, in themselves, are legitimate extensions of durable genre. Cringe as he might, Tarantino has created his own kind of formalism, a post-modern template in which the borrowing of elements from other films is no longer a clever, brilliant and innovative method of transgressing boundaries and revealing but has rather become what seems a knee-jerk response to a challenge to make a certain kind of movie. I agree with the assertion that there is a certain clubhouse knowingness about his films that distance the typical viewer from enjoying his films; the genius of genres is that the true masterpieces in Western movies, war movies, crime dramas, et al, is that they go well beyond the expectations of hard core fans and appeal to a greater audience that recognizes something greater than the mere satisfaction of genre expectations. To coin a phrase, the cliquishness is a buzz-kill and is, I think, more than cynical in attitude. All this mix and matching , bric-a-brac, and pastiche mongering assumes, by design, that surprise is no longer possible with film narrative and that what film makers need to be are little kids taking a hammer to the toys they are bored with. That is not my idea of a fun date.\n\n The characters here, especially those played by Christoph Waltz and Leonardo diCaprio, chatted up considerable dust storms of hyperbolization that would the dialogue equivalent of a jazz soloist improvising for too long .This is at the sacrifice of momentum, a quality that isn't achieved in \"Django Unchained\"- try as I might to suspend my disbelief, I was never convinced that the inevitable reckoning would result in the catharsis that even a hipster variation of a Jacobean revenge tragedy requires as a matter of form. Humanity and all its layered awfulness--lust, greed, avarice, revenge, slavery, racism, all those rotten instincts that create tension within individual characters who try to abide by codes of honor, decency and respect who then are transformed into somethng much uglier and wrathful--are summarily smothered by Tarantino's heavy hand and instead used as premise-giving props as the writer/director hits all the generic marks. In doing so, QT seems like a less than agile man learning how to dance, following the shoe prints laid out on the floor, \"...one, two THREE, one, two THREE...\"",

Tarantino's natural instinct in film-making seems to be to exaggerate, and Django Unchained is no different. His use of blood is hysterical, creating a volcanic type eruption whenever a bullet strikes its target. Furthermore,Tarantino uses the N-word as often as he believes he can get away with, yet, I don't feel he over-stepped the mark. Tarantino films must always be watched knowing that what you are about to see is not trying to be a true depiction of the era or subject involved. It is simply Tarantino's take on the subject, and nearly always poking fun. Take Kill Bill for example, the action sequences are ridiculously unrealistic, with QT clearly making a joke about martial arts films. I feel something similar is happening with Django Unchained, as Tarantino writes his own history.\n\nThe film opens to a pair of brutish slave-traders who are dragging a chain-gang of black men across Texas. Next enters Dr King Schultz, a stylish German-born bounty hunter. Schultz dispatches the slave-traders in a superbly calm and comical style, and off he and Django, released from the chain-gang, go together. When Django explains he is looking for his German Speaking wife, Broomhilda, Schultz becomes entranced and agrees to help find and free Broomhilda, who happens to be under the ownership of plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).\n\nChristoph Waltz follows up his excellence in Inglourious Basterds by delivering another phenomenal supporting performance, and a deserving winner of the Golden Globe. However, the stand-out performance was that of veteran Tarantino favourite Samuel L. Jackson, as Stephen, the housekeeper of Calvin Candie, and the most evil Uncle Tom. \"Who dis nigger up on dat nag,\" is the reaction of Stephen seeing a free black man, and also the audiences introduction to Samuel L. Jackson. From his introduction onwards, Samuel L. captures every scene with his quick-wit, contagious laugh, and dark betrayal of Broomhilda. The character of Stephen perfectly highlights Tarantino's ability as a screenwriter, as the large portions of dialogue, mixed with the outbursts of violence, manage to successfully captivate the viewer.\n\nTarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, one that should definitely not be missed.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n9/10.",

Sorry, when you shoot somebody, it does not look like that (hint: it looked like they were exploding, not being shot). Besides the gore, there were some unbelievable characters. Dr. Schultz was one of those 'I-can't-believe-he-just-did-that' characters that you, despite yourself, start to really like throughout, despite his kind of warped, almost psychopathic sense of humor. Jamie Foxx did good throughout, of course, playing first the unwitting accomplice to this mad dentist and turns into an emotionless, vengeful killer. DiCaprio for once played a character you HAD to hate, really going against his pretty-boy image, which was hard for most of us who watched to adjust to. And then there's Samuel L....what the heck! Came off as a bratty little butler who had his master by the coat-tails, which would not have happened. He was smarter than his own good. Not a stand out performance for him; it didn't work. The story line was well thought out, though very, very gruesome, portrayed the time they lived. Seemed very drawn out, though, and a lot of the fluff could have been cut (the long survey of DiCaprio's land, for instance). Overall, a good movie, but not everybody's cup of tea",

The entire third act makes the film worth your while alone. I know I'm going to sound pretentious for saying this but I also was hoping the film had more action since it was being noticed for its violence and western style.

            "content": "Django Unchained, Quinton Tarantino Unleashed:\n\n\tSet in 1858, the last 2 years of the antebellum era, we see the Django played by Jamie Foxx marching in a slave chain gang when Dr. King Schultz, a bounty hunter liberates him in a most hilarious way. That is, by killing one of the slave traders and injuring another. When describing these actions, it shouldn't be funny by any standards yet, the genius and style of Quinton Tarantino makes it so. Quinton himself went on the other side of the camera to give us a brief but very explosive performance. I'm belly laughing at people getting shot, maimed, and blown up as if I was watching Looney Tunes. But there's plenty of drama and character development to enjoy as well. We see Django transforming from a timid slave into the confident bounty hunter sidekick to Dr. Schultz played by Christoph Waltz. And we see Dr. Schultz haunted by the atrocities of the antebellum era. \n\nI really enjoyed seeing Christoph Waltz playing the polar opposite of his SS character in QT's 2009 Inglorious Basterds, while maintaining his Austrian accent. Equally as delightful was Don Johnson who rejoined the QT team (see Machete 2010). Hopefully we'll see him as well as others to be regulars in Mr. Tarantino's movies. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as the Slave owner/Mandingo fighting promoter and with the introduction of his character, Calvin Candie; the brutality escalates exponentially and with historic accuracy. But still Quinton's movie style goes from a horrific brutal scene to a humorous moment at light speed. In fact at one point I unintentionally drew attention to myself as I laughed just a little longer and a little louder than the rest of the audience at the cartoon like demise of a slave mistress. I won't give \"another\" spoiler by describing the scene exactly, but I thought it was one the hilarious moments as only Quinton can do with this subject matter.  \n\nDjango is further evidence of genius arising from humble beginnings. Not bad for a boy who started as a video store clerk. I'm just glad I was one of the polite customers who always rewound.",

            "content": "Qualquer novo projeto em que Quentin Tarantino se envolva, direta ou indiretamente, acaba por se tornar num acontecimento mediático global. Não é por menos: ele é um dos cineastas da sua geração mais adorados pelo público e um dos poucos que ainda quer mudar Hollywood, não deixando de executar entretenimento ao mais alto nível. A cada novo filme Tarantino renova a sua imagem e versatiliza-se cada vez mais, por se envolver em projetos completamente distintos uns dos outros (não deixando estes, contudo, de ter as suas marcas específicas e muito tarantinianas). E mais importante do que isso, é relevante assinalar o significado que Tarantino dá à forma como as suas referências o influenciam nos filmes que faz. Muitas delas são desconhecidas do grande público ou estão, simplesmente, a fugir dos novos espectadores de Cinema, mas Tarantino tenta-lhes dar uma nova frescura para os seus fãs poderem perceber como os Grandes Mestres da Sétima Arte são tão importantes para este ídolo da cinefilia atual, e assim, terão alguma curiosidade em explorá-los. E «Django Libertado» vai buscar as suas raízes ao spaghetti western, esse género tão estimado por uns, e repudiado (sem razão) por outros, que foi muito famoso nas décadas de 60 e de 70 na Europa, e também ao nome maior desse tipo de filmes, Sergio Leone, que o tornou imortal graças ao seu génio inconfundível, bem expresso nas obras primas «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» e «Aconteceu no Oeste», como também no excecional não-western «Era Uma Vez na América» (que é, para mim, a mais soberba fita de Leone). É inegável o legado tremendo deixado por Leone, que aqui, e pegando noutras referências dos westerns com esparguete à mistura (nomeadamente o franchise «Django», protagonizado por Franco Nero e realizado por Sergio Corbucci, e que originou dezenas de cópias), ganha um novo fôlego, apelando às novas tendências e às necessidades do Cinema do Século XXI (cuja importância e revelância é tão subvalorizada, principalmente pela cada vez maior hegemonia do \"on-demand\" e do \"home cinema\"), pela visão de Quentin Tarantino.\n«Django Libertado» é um filme onde o divertimento é Rei e onde Tarantino explora ao máximo a sua veia sanguinária (mais notória depois de feito o díptico «Kill Bill - A Vingança»). Voltamos a ouvir os grandes diálogos habituais dos argumentos escritos pelo realizador, muito imaginativos, numa história muito bem construída (e muito bem musicada pelos gostos extravagan!tes e obscuros de Tarantino) que é esta demanda do ex-escravo Django (Jamie Foxx) e do Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), o homem que o libertou e que é um \"bounty hunter\" profissional. Ele \"contrata\" Django para encontrar os tão procurados Brittle Brothers em troca do salvamento de Broomhilda, a sua amada, mas serão muitas as surpresas que esperam este duo. E num total banho de sangue, num festim de piadas imparáveis (algumas mais negras e inteligentes - como o caso da agora famosa cena do Klu Klux Klan, que mesmo assim não é tão hilariante como muitos a pintam -, outras mais rebuscadas e fáceis) e numa aventura que parece não ter fim, «Django Libertado» é também um olhar crítico aos preconceitos da América (nomeadamente ao seu passado, com a escravatura retratada no filme, e à forma como, hoje em dia, o país parece querer esquecer esses tempos difíceis, impondo interdições e conservadorismos a torto e a direito) a e ao uso da \"N-Word\", ou aliás, à proibição do uso do termo, que já fez com que certos conservadores fossem mexer numa das Bíblias Sagradas da literatura americana (refiro-me a «As Aventuras de Huckelberry Finn», uma genial obra satírica e irónica de Mark Twain) por causa de uma simples e ridícula palavra. Aliás, muita da controvérsia que rodeou o filme foi exagerada e estragou, em parte, a estreia da fita e a paciência de Tarantino. Mas não deixou de ser um sucesso de bilheteira, mais um aliás, que se tornou o maior da carreira do realizador. Não é uma obra prima, não é um filme excelente e exagera, em parte, na sua duração e na lentidão de algumas partes menos estruturadas. Contudo, «Django Libertado», esta luta de um homem por amor, com as dificuldades postas pela escravatura e pelo racismo em primeiro plano, é um filme muito bom, um dos mais versáteis Tarantinos, que carrega mais uma vez na sua violência algo cartoonesca e divertida, com um grande elenco que providencia fenomenais performances (e só a dada altura é que percebemos porque é que Waltz é \"só\" um ator secundário do filme - porque a sua presença é enorme!), no meio da criatividade explosiva e delirante de Tarantino (onde se vê, hoje em dia, o uso do slow motion e da música épica que não nos filmes dele?), que, sejamos sinceros, adora matanças cinematográficas. E, se estivermos dispostos a isso, perceberemos como o que ele quer apenas é divertir os seus espectadores com todo aquele sangue. «Django Libertado» é mais uma ressurreição moderna do género Western, que tanto ainda tem para dar hoje em dia. Com ou sem tonalidades de vermelho a aparecerem no ecrã.",

This films centers around ex-slave-turned Bounty Hunter, Django Freeman and his mission is to find and rescue his estranged wife from Calvin Candie, a slaving owning business man of his own worth. With the help of Dr. King Schultz, he might as well be the \"fastest hands in the south.\" I was downright pleased with the love and admiration that went into making this film. Not a single moment, was I ever bored at all. The time and setting was WELL respected. The action bits were well choreographed. The pacing was well timed and it didn't feel like it wasn't dragging at all. Tarantino is really famous for putting tremendous amount of character development and dialogue in his films and it clearly makes a great return in Django Unchained. The performances were stellar with Jamie Foxx as Django being all badass, Leo DiCaprio being a great Southern %$$hole (hence the time and setting), Sam Jackson just being awesome. Yet, out of all of the performances, Christopher Waltz was probably the most thrill seeking. His expressions, his dialogue, and his motives tells us that he is in no position to mess around. When he wants a job done.....he gets the job done. Hell, his beard looks like he wants to kill someone. The soundtrack is well placed and doesn't feel like it was just there for the sake of being there. The music gave us that classic Western flare that films like any of the Clint Eastwood Westerns. Hell, Western composing master, Ennio Morricone provides the score in it and it doesn't disappoint. So, I have said enough about Django Unchained and I advice you to go and see it. In fact, I am actually going to see it again BECAUSE of how good it is.",

It reminds us of the horrors of the slavery era (though done many times already), and of course, adds the usual Tarantino twist to it, and the usual sly dialogue (Jonah Hill scene was the best imo).

            "content": "If you didn't like Tarantino's variation on WWII in Inglorious Basterds you are not going to like this film. The film has nothing to do with Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django apart from Jamie Foxx's character sharing the same name as Franco Nero's character in Corbucci's film. Franco Nero even shows up for an appearance as do a number of other familiar actors that were cast in the film. Tarantino is inspired by the Spaghetti Western genre (some original material for the score was composed by Ennio Morricone) and Blaxploitation films, particularly films like Mandingo(1976) set in the antebellum American South. Just as Tarantino thought that Hitler and his ilk got off too easy in WWII and turned Inglorious Basterds into a revisionist revenge fantasy, he thinks the Nabobs and their ilk in old South got off too easy and constructed another revisionist revenge fantasy here. I have no problem with that. I have never been a big fan of Jamie Foxx but he is good here, playing a gunslinger who like all good Spaghetti Western heroes is better and far cooler than his opposition. Still, its Christopher Waltz playing Django's benefactor, partner in bounty hunting, and friend who gets all the best lines and won an academy award for Best Supporting Actor. Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson, and even Don Johnson are having a ball playing bad guys in this film. Tarantino's script gives them all terrific lines. But the best moment for me was when the great Franco Nero meets Jamie Foxx in a saloon. He asks him his name and Foxx replies, spelling out the name and explaining that the \"D\" is silent. In a classic \"Fourth Wall\" moment Nero replies \"I Know.\"",

The film is about an African american slave, Django. Now the characters who would be considered normal (Back in the time this was set) are actually the characters we despise while the characters who are lower class (and often mistreated) are the people we hope will take a stand, what the film does in a way is make the audience hate the 'Normal' characters because we know (As an audience) what many people did to slaves was wrong.",

        {
            "content": "The tenants of classic spaghetti westerns are found within all of Tarantino's work leading up to his latest film Django Unchained (2012) - his first actual western.  Prior to this pre-Civil War flick, Inglourious Basterds (2009) was essentially a western set \"once upon a time in Nazi occupied France\".  Basterds featured music by the legendary western composer Ennio Morricone (The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly etc), a classic story of revenge, Mexican stand-offs, scalping, war-paint, dynamite, and bad Italian.  What made Inglourious Basterds even more special was that it was a movie about the power of film (physically and metaphorically), and it is that below the surface layer that made Basterds not only entertaining but something greater than just an action comedy (these elements were also hallmarks of Tarantino's most famous film from 1994, Pulp Fiction).  With Tarantino's love for cinema and infatuation with the western genre, Django Unchained feels like the film Tarantino was always bound to make yet something feels off.\n     Django Unchained follows a newly-freed slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) and a German bounty hunter by the name of King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) as they travel together through the antebellum south in search of the Brittle brothers who are wanted dead or alive for stagecoach robbery and murder.  Along the way, Django reveals to Schultz that he intends upon saving his wife from the roughest plantation in the south: Candyland.  Coincidentally, Django's wife is named \"Broomhilda\" (Kerry Washington) which captures Dr. Schultz' attention since there is, as Schultz recounts, a German tale of a damsel in distress named Brynhildr (pronounced \"Broomhilda\") who was in need of a hero and was saved by the brave Siegfried.  Schultz, admiring Django for being a \"real-life Siegfried\", decides that he will help his new bounty hunting accomplice in his quest.  Thus begins the classic hero complex: a hero with a want, a damsel in distress, and a dragon that must be defeated.  The dragon is a young and wild man (comparable to the unruly George Minafer in Orson Welles' 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons) in the form of plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), hence the name of his plantation \"Candyland\".  \n     Upon arriving at Candyland, the film takes a vicious turn as the true relationship between slave owner and slave is depicted with shockingly real brutality.  The merciless torture and unflinching murder of slaves in cruel and unusual ways is incredibly off-putting (as it should be).  It is nothing about Calvin Candie's stature or demeanor that is frightening, but rather it is within his appetite for cruelty and violence that Candie becomes a menacing phantom of the everyman plantation owner (or every-plantation owner).  The character of Candie makes slavery and slave owners despicable, but he also makes the people who stood idly by watching him commit his acts of hatred against his property for years just as guilty.  The lukewarm are just as guilty, and are treated as such in this film as Django strikes vengeance upon the oppressors of African Americans with furious anger.\n     Dr. King Schultz becomes the white conscience of the film as he witnesses the gruesome murder of a slave who was too afraid to continue being forced to participate in \"mandingo\" fighting (a gladiator-esque fight to the death between one slave and another), and throughout the film he is haunted by the images of that murder.  Like Travis Bickle in Scorsese's 1976 film Taxi Driver, Schultz feels empowered to \"clean the streets\" after witnessing all the horrible atrocities that take place on the plantation.  Armed with a spring-extending gun in his sleeve, just like in Taxi Driver, he takes his own violent stand surprising his fellow white-man with a bullet to the chest.\n     The vicious turn that the narrative in Django takes is a twist that never occurs in Inglourious Basterds - a film about a squad of Jewish-American-soldiers on a mission to end WW2 early by scalping and beating all the Nazis in their path to death (including Hitler and his cronies), but we never see our protagonists get harmed.  Had we seen images of the holocaust in the film, it would have been a much darker film and would have had a similar feel as Django Unchained in regards to the depiction of slavery.  Django at times feels like a rehash of Basterds.  It's racial revenge by the victims of oppression.  Another key difference would be the degree of victimization that the protagonists experience in their respective films.  In Basterds, the protagonists are indirectly affected by the evil of the Nazis as they have never experienced the cruelty of a concentration camp.  However, In Django our protagonist is beaten and abused numerous times in the film (and so are his peers).\n     It's interesting that filmmaker Spike Lee is so opposed to Django Unchained, claiming that \"I can't speak on it 'cause I'm not gonna see it.  The only thing I can say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors to see that film.\"  In all reality, Django Unchained feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee's breakthrough film Do The Right Thing (1989).  In Do The Right Thing, the temperature and racial tensions are high in modern day Brooklyn as everyone gets fed up with each others' differences.  At the end of the film, Mookie (Spike Lee) chooses to lead an angry mob of African Americans to burn down the Italian antagonist's pizzeria instead of killing the owner, and in which by burning the pizzeria down they are destroying the establishment that embodied the ideals of their opposition.  Sure, Mookie chose the lesser of two evils (property destruction over murder), but these actions are reflected in Django Unchained as racial tensions escalate to a violent boiling point concluding in the destruction of the plantation.\n     This film is a major platform for discussion concerning the ethics of the characters and the history of our nation, but it didn't leave a nice taste in my mouth.  The first half of the film is so rich in character and feels like a true western, but the second half (which begins with a mandingo fight) is marred with hip-hop music, brutality, and poor decisions.  Characters choose to act violently, like their slave owners, instead of making peace - a conscious decision that Quentin Tarantino explained while on Charlie Rose on the 21st of December.  It makes for great entertainment, but it brings to mind an interesting plot device that justifies brutality in Inglourious Basterds: it's an alternate reality.  Basterds defies history by changing the way the second world war ended, where as Django stays within the bounds and confines of history (within a fictional narrative), but it makes the violence feel unnecessary.  Revenge was not his mission: Django only wanted to save his wife from the dragon of slavery, but instead he stays around and kills everyone (all the lukewarm observers of cruelty and the remaining white plantation work hands). Sure, violence is a \"trademark\" of a Tarantino film, but it fails to serve the logic of the character of Django.  Had Inglourious Basterds been a metaphor for American slavery hidden within the veils of a cinematically charged depiction of WW2, perhaps it would have been a greater vessel for this story, but it would have spoiled the charm of Basterds.  \n     Frankly, Django Unchained isn't very enjoyable, and with all the issues within the film, Tarantino's predictable wit and humor can't save it.  Lots of western imagery (not enough though), blood and guts (too much), and laughs - but it's a hesitant laugh.",

It is also well-acted with Foxx, DiCaprio and Waltz on the top of their game. But QT is no film-maker and cannot edit. 2h45m i'll never get back.\n\nWe get it QT, you love the Spaghetti Westerns. I have no problem with the Morricone rifts, sudden zooms and close-ups. But the blood-soaked spectacle of death was both ridiculous and boring. Its cartoonish, and its repetitiveness smacked to me of a film that had spiraled out of control.\n\nThe problem with QT and Django is tone. An epic KKK attack degenerates into farce when they start arguing about whether they can see out of their hoods. Some may laugh, I thought it bad taste.

Also, Tarantino's use of understatement when dealing with weighty issues like slavery and racism was a refreshing change. We all know slavery was bad--films dealing with the topic do not need to persuade us of this; Tarantino, to an arguably exploitative and purely shock-value level, merely SHOWS us the horrors of slavery, trusting his audience to deduce the rest. And lastly, Samuel L. Jackson's role as Stephen was a phenomenally rounded part, allowing a different perspective to the deeper issues of the film.

This was a much darker period in America's history and very much the world's, not to be taken lightly but also not to be missed, definitely a return to form for one of cinema's most treasured modern maestros.",

Jamie Foxx is badass in the role of Django, the slave turned bounty hunter who teams up with a German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz, who is supposedly a dentist, but hasn't practiced dentistry in over 5 years is played by the brilliant Christoph Waltz who is such a scene stealer that pours out Tarantino's dialogue like poetry. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Calvin Candie, the Mississippi slave plantation owner (also known as Candieland in the film) who Foxx and Waltz try to rescue Django's wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington, who is a lovely and an emotional presence in the film. Watching her and Foxx together again for the first time since \"Ray,\" just proves that they are one of the best on screen couples right next to DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in \"Titanic.\" Samuel L. Jackson is also great as DiCaprio's house slave Stephen, who is without a doubt as Jackson put it himself is probably going to be \"One of the most hated Negros in America cinema.\" But let's not also forget the surprising and good performance by Don Johnson as Big Daddy, one of the slave plantation owners of Tennessee, that Foxx and Waltz trick into thinking they want to by one of his slaves in order to track and kill the three Brittle Brothers that Waltz's character has a bounty out for and also whipped Kerry Washington's character after Foxx's character pleaded with not to at the last plantation that he and his wife were together at before being separated after trying to escape. The soundtrack that Tarantino has created for the film is one of his strongest since \"Pulp Fiction\" in my opinion.",

He recruits Django as he is the only individual capable of identifying some wanted criminals. Eventually the pair become business partners and friends. But Django only yearns to find his wife from which he was separated after they both tried to escape. After some enquiries they find out that she was sold to Calvin Candie, a rich and merciless owner of the big plantation Candieland. The pair made up some story about being scouts of mandingo fighters and infiltrate in the plantation hoping to buy Broomhilda back. But their charade doesn't go as planned and hostilities arise.\nThis is one of the most original westerns I have seen recently. Never before a black character was at centre stage, maybe a few in the background but never with that sort of strength nor skill, and never in the position to legally kill white folk, let's not forget that this is also a drama about slavery and social position. It is refreshing to watch something truly unusual.\nCritics and reviews said that the movie was too long and too violent. I think it was long, but not excessively, there were no empty scenes nor pointless dialogues, the dynamics of the plot needed quite a lot of footage and to make justice to the story the film had to be long (2 and a half hours).\nI quite agree though in the violence department, the use and abuse of the splashes of blood and exploding brains was most unwelcome and completely unnecessary. Of course there are going to be graphic shootings, torture and all sort of aggression but Tarantino has overdone it this time in that department. It is my only criticism to a movie that has got almost everything else right.\nI liked Tarantino's humour; I enjoyed the scene with the Southerners masks, it is hilarious but, at the same time, sounds as something that could have really happened, and that makes it perhaps even funnier.",

I think he is a great actor, but his character just didn't feel right in the movie.  Two, Kerry Washington's character could have been highlighted a little more in the movie, detailing her escape from the Candie plantation and reason for her being in the 'hot box'. Lastly and not of the least, the use of the 'N' word.  I know they said it back then, but I tend to tune out movies that overuse that word for whatever reason (and I know they were using it for realism & effect).",

I have seen many films cover some strange grounds, but when I heard this movie was a take on westerns and blaxploitation I was hooked. If you love Tarantino films well this is another to like then. I already feel like watching this movie again and it's near 3 hours long. Now that is not a complaint at all the run time is fine. If the film can take you in then you cannot have any problems with the run time. We got some great acting of course from Jamie Fox, Dicaprio, Samuel Jackson, and an actor who is reaching as one of my favorites Christoph Waltz. Waltz won awards for his performance and I can clearly see why, but it's very hard to compare and contrast to everyone else. Jamie Fox pulls off a stoic main character who soon gets a chance to break free and boy he does. Dicaprio gives another charming performance, but he has a lot of darkness this time and when his turn happens it left me stunned. Samuel plays someone who will surprise you, the trailers play out perfectly to leave things to be shocking. Then Waltz is the funniest character and my favorite cause he gives a man a chance of freedom and he does a lot for him. Now the best part of the film is the humor. For a movie that was covering these two genres I wasn't expecting to laugh so much. There are many funny scenes and they don't ruin the movie at all, it's probably one of the best sense of dark humor I have seen for a long time. It is a perfect blend of western, blaxploitation, humor, and gore who man there is gore! Tarantino keep up with your blood effects because I will never get bored of them!",

Foxx takes himself so seriously there'd be no room for anyone else in the movie except that he is effortlessly blown off the screen by the charismatic Mr Waltz, who always seems to be having fun.

At 2:45, it's a long running time, but it's so solid, you won't be clock-watching (although, I still think they could have probably trimmed down about 10 minutes...  but that would have pretty much been with Leo, and with his star-power, that probably wouldn't' fly).  This one deserved more Oscars, and it's successful genre-melding probably should have brought home the big one.  A really good time - easy 4.5 - 5 stars",

It has everything you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, including the lengthy runtime.  Along with outstanding performances from most of the cast (namely Christoph Waltz), Django manages to cram in as much Drama, Comedy, Action, Violence and Art-House into 159 minutes as it possibly can, and it just works.  Another outstanding movie for QT to add to his filmography.",

There's a lot of good work here, even if the story feels slight at times, and yet again QT plumps for a scooby-doo \"high five\" silly ending which undermines everything that has come before it.

            "content": "With any Quentin Tarantino film the expectation is always going to be at its highest. So what starts off as a new good looking film from QT turns into more of an event. Django really did live up to my expectations and I hope any other QT fan out there thought the same. When he first announced the release of Django Unchained, I thought okay another meaningless title, what is it going to bring and is it going to be as good as his previous films, is this is where it goes down hill for Quentin. Really I was just being pessimistic. Because yes it was just as intriguing as any other of his previous films. Quentin's love for cult cinema is commonly unknown by many, which was why I knew there was a western being loaded into the Quentin cannon anytime soon. He mentioned in one of his interviews that a big inspiration to him was Sergio Leone and his classic spaghetti western 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. So to see Quentin tackle the ethics of the western genre made the release that much more of a double event. But strictly speaking Django isn't a western. If anything it should be tagged as a 'Southern' coming from the man himself. It has nothing to do with the western genre. \n\nUnlike Inglorious Bastards, Django doesn't try to be a riot and doesn't try to be as politically correct as possible (referring to WW2). It concentrates more on character development, pointing at Django (Jamie Foxx). For the first time in Quentin history the story is more linear and concentrates on the portrayal and the story of one character's journey. Also there are no shifts in time like Quentin's previous films. We don't see Travolta being shot by Willis and then reappearing in a later scene which is based before that scene. This doesn't leave you so confused but that doesn't mean you're not left confused at times during the film. After all that is QT job. Which is why as Quentin fans we need to see the film another two to three times to get the full QT experience. Also we don't get 'Chapter 2' or anything like that. Django goes for the more 'Rescue the princess' type theme. The story sees Django a slave being \"Unchained\" by a bounty hunter slash dentist Dr King Schultz (QT latest discovery Christoph Waltz) who won his deserved Oscar for Inglorious Bastards in 2009. However over the campfire he is amazed to know that Django is married to another slave called Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) even though Foxx and Washington played a couple in Ray. \n\nNow as this is a 'Rescue the princess' film, there is a villain. Django Unchained's finest element is the new Robert De Niro, AKA Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. A plantation owner in the south. Who keeps slaves including Django's love. QT tries to make him a perfect, spiteful, prone to flattery, selfish, vain man who wants nothing else but money. But the result is naive and funny which doesn't disappoint. Now me being negative. Quentin's attempt to include black comedy leaves the viewer slightly confused and doesn't want to know why they are confused either. I know there has been some controversy on the films running time and frankly it is not long ENOUGH. It flew by for me and I feel that some scenes could have been longer but I have a hunch they were shortened for the best. But other than that the only other advice is don't watch the trailer as it doesn't do the film justice!\n\nIn conclusion Django Unchained is a delight to watch from two hours before the film starts to the end credits. Verdict: Another bloody, well scripted masterpiece that QT has fed to our hungry eyes. Django really does help define QT as one of the finest directors in modern day filming. The only issue now is, can he keep it up? Either way this film of course gets an A+.",

Containing a great story, terrific performances, good dialogue, and brilliant pacing, Django is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and that is really saying something.   The story of Django Unchained is that a black slave turned bounty hunter named Django is going after a plantation owner that has his wife. The story is told in a great way that only Tarantino can do, I  can't explain it really, but the story is so fascinating I was always interested to see where it was going. It also uses its setting to great effect, along with great pacing that keeps moving at a fast pace, you will find this story's setting just as interesting as its colorful characters and gorgeous visuals, or the gripping balls-to-the-wall action scenes.   With its all-star cast containing big names like Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and many others you know that they are all going to pull off their roles perfectly. And boy do they ever, especially Leonardo Dicaprio who plays one of my favorite villains in recent memory, and Jamie Foxx is a natural fit for this character. Their dialogue is well written, but there is one problem with the dialogue and that is the constant usage of the n-word. While I understand that people back then used that word very often, I still could've done without them saying it every 30 seconds. However, that is a relatively small complaint.    Django Unchained is a insanely entertaining western that I hold on par with Tarantino's best film: Pulp Fiction. It's brilliant mix of action, dialogue, setting, visuals, and storytelling ensures that this is one film that deserves all the praise it has been receiving. As for Spike Lee's stupid criticism: I didn't know who he was till he said what he said, and he looks like a fucking moron for saying it. This film is pure awesome.",

How Dicaprio has been passed by in some of his movies by the Oscar committee is baffling. Waltz deserves his Oscar as his portrayal of Dr. King Shultz is on e of the best acting jobs I can recall from recent memory. Django Unchained is typical Tarantino ultra-violent fare and at times it works and at other times it doesn't. The movie can be downright disturbing (the Mandingo fight and the dogs) but Tarantino goes about his work without hesitation and provides viewers with a fun, exhilarating, funny and unflinching look at slavery and revenge.
