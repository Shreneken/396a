    "summary": "The year is 1965, and the residents of New Penzance, an island off the coast of New England, inhabit a community that seems untouched by some of the bad things going on in the rest of the world. Twelve-year-olds Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) have fallen in love and decide to run away. But a violent storm is approaching the island, forcing a group of quirky adults (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray) to mobilize a search party and find the youths before calamity strikes.",

I think it's because the protagonists are children\u2014 it's stilted but not unemotional. I've always been a sucker for romance. This film adds the possibility of adventure on top of adolescent love. Though Anderson places his narrative in the 60s, the story is timeless\u2014 a failed marriage, an awkward orphan, a rebellious girl. Long takes. Perfect tracking shots. A final picturesque image. This is an auteur at his peak. I feel like Anderson is talking to an audience that has watched his rise, reaching out to the inner child within us; gifting us with a basic, humanistic theme: freedom.",

It's filled with everything you'd expect from Anderson \u2013 lengthy, intricately designed tracking shots, a bright color palette, quirky dialogue, and an expansive cast, which includes Anderson regulars like Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Ed Norton.  Despite the fact that the thin story starts to wear a bit thin by the halfway point, it is a movie that Anderson fans will embrace.  It is also a film that Anderson detractors will hate.",

And not only in the sense of it's a good movie, it's genuinely nice to look at and hear because it is directed and edited with such delicacy. He really is amazing and I see now why so many people like him. \n\nOh my gosh the colors. The camera angles. The cinematography. Everything is so beautiful. Wes Anderson's films all look relatively similar when it comes to transitions but I'm not complaining, his transitions between scenes or in conversations is gorgeous and it adds so much to the film.\n\nThe score is great too and I love the vibe of all the music. Music is super nice in film and Moonrise Kingdom is a perfect example of that. The sound engineer(s) deserve a raise because they went above and beyond on this film with sounds of the woods, dialogue, music, etc. There's so much that is notable about the audio and I'm all here for it.\n\nThe acting from our two young leads is phenomenal. They really shine in their roles and they're fun to watch. Honestly, this whole cast is stellar. I know Wes only works with the best of the best (which is why he reuses actors so often) and that really benefits this, if not ALL of his films.\n\nI can't say it enough, Wes Anderson's writing is amazing. The comedy and drama aspects are written so well that it's hard not to laugh and it's hard not to feel the . Like there is a scene where a kid is jumping on a trampoline. What is the point? It's freaking hilarious, that's the point. Wes Anderson is a really great writer, I can't wait to check out the rest of his filmography.\n\nSeriously so good. Not my favorite Wes Anderson flick that I've seen, but amazing nonetheless. I'm really starting to like the color yellow\u2026",

            "content": "Wes Anderson, eh? One of the most visually perfect films that I've seen. The pure aestheticism and clear perfectionism of the man astounds me. Every shot seems agonised over and the scenery is jaw-dropping. This being said, visuals do not make a great film and the story and performances must back them up. Luckily, this one has all of the pieces despite a few strange lapses. The characters have all of the quirks that Anderson seems to be known for. I think that the main child performances were slight letdowns, while some of the lesser young roles had more scene-stealing moments. The decision to include the French kissing scene and have 12-year-olds engage in a scene of sexual references and never visit the topic again seemed misplaced. Whereas it seems to have been lauded as a commentary on the sexualization of children, this moment seems almost paedophilic rather than the playful tone pointing out the naivety of young love that occupies most of the rest of the film. The adults shine through in unexpected avenues. Tilda Swinton is given all too brief of a turn as a sort of villain in a role that she excels in, but I would have loved to see more of her. There's some sort of heavyweight love triangle between Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Bruce Willis that falls victim to the runtime by never quite being fully expanded upon, although it has enough substance to it not to be a serious flaw. I enjoyed Anderson's frequent collaborator, Schwarzman, in a role he seems to enjoy. Norton is decent, and Harvey Keitel showing up was a welcome surprise. The humour pops more often than not and the visuals are stunning, so any of the gripes that I have mentioned are ultimately trivial in the grand scheme of things.",

(But if you want to read the rest of this reveiw there will be some spolers, but if you read on I just want to tell you that if you say I runnied it for you, just remember you wanted to keep reading.) One of the things about the movie is that I didn't like was that Susise (the girl who ran away) was super agresive, and yes I know that there are people like that in the real world but she stabed someone in the back with lefty sisers that I think that took the wrong turn. Also I didn't like how all the boys at the camp were planing on pontentually to hurt Sam (the boy who ran away), and yes I know it is supost to be funny but still. Also, I didn't like how the dog died,  but I don't like it when anything dies, but I think that the real thing that bothers me is that they just left him there, to rot, but I think that I would have liked the scean better if they burried the dog or put him in a river or something. Plus Sam said that he was a good dog and he didn't deserve to dye, so the dog probaly ment a lot to him so the fact that he just left him there just saddens me. Lastly I didn't like how Susie's mom was having an affair with the police offecer. Then Susie found out, then just told her mother and nothing happened, I just think that if the husband found out that his wife was having an affair then and forgave her I think that would have been a lot better, or if it just didn't happen, nothing would have been changed.But overall it's a really good movie and if you are looking for a childhood romance and a comady this is the movie for you.",

            "content": "Moonrise Kingdom is one of the best representations of Wes Anderson's writing style. While movies like Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox offer a look at his visual styles, his ability to write really shines in this movie. Wes Anderson's common use of disguising complex and dark themes with comedy and unique characters is more prominent than ever in this one. This movie really works in so many ways. The cast includes some famous actors like Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, but, it also introduces some new child actors as the main characters. These characters are cast perfectly, and while I think that there were certainly some problems with their reading, I think that overall, they really did a great job that I admired. Comedy in this movie works because of the deep characters that compliment it. Wes Anderson movies take a premise and makes it real, no matter what the plot is, Anderson manages to make all the characters and overall ideas relatable enough to carry an entire film. The number of moments in this film that will forever be engraved into my mind (the beach scene) tells me how memorable this movie is. It's truly charming, and it explores the wonders of young love and childhood as a whole. This movie does have a strong emotional payoff, and the ending really is satisfying. The music fits with everything perfectly. Really, my biggest complaint with this would be the number of unnecessary scenes that seemed jammed in. Moonrise Kingdom's story is simple enough, that it seemed like a lot of scenes were filmed just to fill some more time. There were also some shots that seemed to break the strong colour pallet and camera placement. When these scenes came up, they were extremely noticeable, and kind of annoying. Overall, it is a good movie that I would strongly recommend. 9.4/10",

            "content": "A bright, sunlit coming of age comedy!\n\nWes Anderson's indie coming of age comedy Moonrise Kingdom (2012) is a beautifully shot, 93 dreamy minutes of Summer bliss! Moonrise Kingdom carries a similar vibe to Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit, Sean Baker's The Florida Project, or Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird. Wes Anderson's direction is phenomenal as he realistically tells a sweet romance drama surrounded by a silly indie comedy full of heart. Anderson directs with such empathy for kids and misfits. Moonrise Kingdom might very well be Wes' greatest picture.\n\nIt's all sunny yellow to offset Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola's story about loneliness and dejection. Anderson and Coppola write a tale of a bullied, unpopular, misunderstood, orphaned, beige boy scout who finds his first love. Their writing makes Moonrise Kingdom a fun camp journey as well as an affectionate romantic coming of age tale that I know all audiences will relate back to their youth. They put themselves in the shoes of troubled children and stressed out parents. Kids that are different should not be left alone, but rather Moonrise Kingdom asserts they should be nurtured into the unique people they are at heart.\n\nJared Gilman is great as the disadvantaged boy in love named Sam Shakusky. Kara Hayward is wonderful as the dejected Suzy Bishop. They have nice chemistry together as kids in love. Sam is fun with his erratic behavior, sudden violence, and creative survival skills. Kara is adorable as Suzy with her interesting, expressive eyes and forlorn persona. They're both amazing leads for Moonrise Kingdom.\n\nAlexandre Desplat's score is magical, mysterious, whimsical, and wonderful like any great Wes Anderson film score. Desplat captures the adventurous spirit of childhood with the romantic tenderness of a coming of age romance drama. Wes Anderson sure loves his yellow as Adam Stockhausen's cute production design is all yellow everything. Kasia Walicka-Maimone's costumes for Moonrise Kingdom are all adorable. Cheery yellow scout uniforms, pink dresses, and clean white shirts as far as the eye can see.\n\nRobert Yeoman's cinematography for Moonrise Kingdom is his finest camerawork yet! Stunning natural wide shots of greenery like forests and fields match the quaint yellow uniforms, tents, and oars. The blue shots of the lake are probably the most breathtaking shots in Moonrise Kingdom aside from Yeoman's close-up shots of awe struck faces. Andrew Weisblum's editing is slick with very neat cuts. He gives Moonrise Kingdom a pleasant pace with steady cuts that keep the movie engaging.\n\nEdward Norton gives his kindest performance as Scout Master Randy Ward. His gentle attempts to understand the boys in his care comes across as genuine and sweet. He's very funny here as a worried man desperately trying to figure out what to do. Bruce Willis is phenomenal as the sad Police Captain Sharp. His sorrowful, yet caring performance is very likable. Moonrise Kingdom is honestly some of the finest acting Norton and Willis ever committed.\n\nBill Murray is hilarious as the lonely Mr. Bishop. He has several fantastic scenes with a stern and distressed Frances McDormand as Mrs. Bishop. Tilda Swinton is fun as the unfeeling Social Services lady. Harvey Keitel is amazing as the gruff and tough Scout Commander Pierce. I like Jason Schwartzman as the funny, blunt Cousin Ben. Bob Balaban makes for a quirky narrator to move things along. All the other scout boys are fun, especially the snarky Redford played by a young Lucas Hedges. \n\nIn conclusion, Moonrise Kingdom was the first Wes Anderson feature I ever saw and to this day it's still my favorite film of his I'd say.",

            "content": "Recently I have seen many critics turn against indie darling Wes Anderson to accuse his films of being insufferably twee and stating that all of his films are almost exactly the same. While I do not consider myself a lover of Anderson's films with the fervor that some others possess I do not think that his work should be discounted quite so harshly and I have a particular fondness for this film. Most Anderson protagonists, presumably based on himself, are young men who are old souls at heart and fall in love with mature woman who may present some form of danger. This is his best film about the feeling of young love and few films have articulated quite so poignantly what draws two people together and what makes the freshness and innocence of a first romance so precious.\n\nPrecocious twelve year old orphan Sam Shakusky, Jared Gilman, lives on the island of New Penzance at is unable to fit in at the highly regimented Camp Ivanhoe. He meets a kindred spirit in Suzy Bishop, Kara Hayward, who feels suffocated by her large family and alone in her intellectual pursuits. The two begin a letter correspondence and plan to run away together and live on their own in the wilderness. They are initially successful as they meet up at the right place at the right time and are self sufficient with supplies and shelter to stay alive. Shakusky's fellow campers present a threat as their intensely authoritarian leader Randy Ward, Edward Norton, sends out young campers to find the runaways and bring them back to him. Shakusky and Bishop are able to fight back and act on their attraction to one another but are caught and while Bishop returns to her parents Shakusky ends up under the care of Captain Sharp, Bruce Willis. After more attempts to escape from adults who hope to separate them Bishop and Shakusky eventually end up arranging a situation in which they would be able to see one another regularly.\n\nLike some of Anderson's best films this whole movie feels like the dreamlike vision that a young person has of love in which nothing else matters in the world except being with the object of your affection and any hurdle can be overcome. Many questioned the depiction of two twelve year olds experimenting with kissing and other forms of physical contact but I believe that this is the sort of odd idea that would find it's way into a child's head. My vision of love as a young woman involved standing in a field and having reindeers circle me as a the sun beamed down on me and I kissed some man although I did not know how the logistics worked yet. Children often have these sort of strange thoughts as they piece together information that they have been told by their elders which may or may not be true and then have their own warped view of the world that allows for misconceptions or simply less conventional interpretation of concepts like love.\n\nThe idea of everlasting love is something that almost everybody aims for even from a young age but for precocious children this is especially true as the idea of something so stable is appealing. We all know that being in love involves agreeing to a lack of stability and constant turbulence in your life as you are forced to take into account the feelings of another person when making almost any decision. What we see here is the honeymoon period of early love in which both people are so happy to have one another that they have not yet gotten around to being irritated by their partner's annoying habits or simply sick of the same old routines. This is something that we all know does not last but in just 94 minutes this film perfectly encapsulates the wonder of having these feelings as you sense in their letters that both are thrilled to have found somebody who shares their interests after so many years of loneliness. Their small haven, the titular \u2018Moonrise Kingdom', is representative of all of the innocence of this first love and of youth itself and the campers who chase after them are the systems that slowly and effectively make people cynical and jaded about concepts like love. This film stands in support of love and naivet\u00e9 and all of the emotions that we are supposed to grow out of but lose so much by doing so. I feel a warm glow surround me every time I watch the film and it reminds me that there are people who are still earnest enough to admit that they care about emotional problems.",

The film stars Jared Gilman as Sam and Bruce Willis as Captain Sharp. \n\nThe acting is very strong especially for the children actors. I especially liked Jared Gilman as Sam; I felt that he gave the character a very good performance.\n\nThe characters I felt were both very enjoyable and portrayed very well. \n\nThe cinematography like most Wes Anderson films really works and in my opinion also works with the comedy.\n\nThe film also has some very nice and well designed settings from the woods to a scouting camp.\n\nThe set design and costume design are done very well and fit the style of the film really well.\n\nThe style of the film I personally love from the colour scheme to the stylistic  cinematography.\n\nThe film also had some very sound practical and special effects, but most of it is toward the end of the film.\n\nThe film also has a little bit of action, but it is mostly used for comedic effect.\n\nIn my opinion I personally really like the way the dialogue is delivered especially with the comedic scenes.\n\nThe editing in the film is also very strong and helps with the comedy of the film.\n\nLike most of Wes Anderson films it also had some surprisingly really good music.\n\nThe story follows a boy named Sam who escapes his scouting camp to run off with a girl called Suzy Bishop. During this Sam and Suzy are on the run from the camp, cops and Suzy's parents.\n\nThe comedy in my opinion is some of the strongest that Wes Anderson has ever done and had me laughing out loud throughout the runtime of the film. \n\nThe film throughout also had a great atmosphere to it especially toward the end of the film.\n \nThe film I also really enjoyed and is something that I will be watching again very soon.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - second best Wes Anderson as of right now",

The struggles to survive their individual childhoods are soothed by each other. In one another they find the support to move through their pain, progress into adult situations and give each other comfort they couldn't receive from adults. The quirkiness of the script's situations are typical of Anderson films, but the \"yellowing\" of the film's color and the exquisite use of children as the main characters add to the depth of perspective, showing the adults as the goofy, clueless, immature element of the cast. In their own chaos, the kids appear to have it together much more than the adults. Throughout this wonderful film, the kids deal with the adult scenarios with maturity and logic while the adults come across as trained monkeys. The children come together as a strong, empathetic team while the adults are miserable robots succumbing to the rigidity of their mundane lives, clinging to every vice there is, from cheating, lying, drinking, smoking, etc. while all the kids want is to be loved and happy. The simple things we all set out to obtain.",

            "content": "The film Moonrise Kingdom, directed by Wes Anderson, opened in the box office in 2012. The film can be analyzed alongside other child romances such as Little Manhattan.\u00a0What makes Moonrise Kingdom stand out is the world which it portrays. It is not a utopian society, nor is it magical, but there is something awfully enchanting about this little island. The island itself is 16 miles wide, yet its only inhabitants seem to be our main characters. Though it is set to take place in the 1960s, there are no cultural references or allusions to justify this. Besides the costumes, the film could really be presented at any year and its main themes would still clearly come across. The two themes of the film are escapism and innocence. Suzy, our heroine, lives with her parents and 3 brothers in a house next to the lighthouse, which symbolizes for her a tool for escape. Sam, the protagonist, flees his camp in order to meet up with Suzy in the woods. Both, unhappy and discontented with their lives, are eager for a fresh start, and who better to reestablish yourself with than your pen pal? The second theme of innocence is evident in the fact that the protagonists are both 12 years old. There are scenes of police chases, burning buildings, the death of a dog, and the stabbing of a child, yet there is a childlike innocence hugging the film. Despite some of the difficult emotional aspects to the movie, the audience never struggles to keep watching. The lightness and easiness of the dialogue makes for a funny movie, filled with one-liners and tons of irony. Satire may be too strong of a word for it, but, there is definitely an ounce of the satirizing of childhood and how we treat our kids. The movie proclaims that our children are not so different from ourselves, they want to be accepted, to be respected, and to love just like we do. This is a must-see for the whole family, kids who feel like they deserve more, and adults who need to loosen up alike.",

Obviously the artistic ability Anderson possess is magnificent. The color design screams Wes Anderson style and I'll always appreciate a well constructed and detailed set design. The undertones of a rough family life between Sam and Suzy made for a great plot line that should have been exploited farther. With the inclusion of the purposeful bland acting, this movie wasn't for me. Having a low attention span keeps me from physically investing myself in the storyline, the slow pace is a taste I haven't yet desired. I was excited about Bruce Willis and Bill Murray in this movie but sadly both of them had no character build, all of the adults in this movie had little to no characterization. This movie made me feel like everything was being hinted at with a little *wink* *wink*, but nothing was ever explained entirely. I applaud Anderson for steering towards more creative films but it requires a taste.",

Even though there were some risqu\u00e9 moments (particularly between the two main characters & one of the main characters was offered alcohol), I would recommend is film for families to watch since I feel they would enjoy it. \"Moonrise Kingdom\" proves itself as one of the best films of 2012, of the 2010's decade, of the 21st Century, & of Wes Anderson's filmmaking career!\nNominated for the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (although it lost to Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\"; another great film released that same year).",

            "content": "Moonrise Kingdom is a sweet heartwarming coming-of-age comedic drama that showcases some great talent. That talent mostly being Wes Anderson who has crafted an authentic drama with some contemporary flavours. His direction is so quirky that it's hard not to fall in love with it. The centralisation of characters and objects with the camera, the still shots of the excellent production design, the side track panning as characters walk along and a nice 360 degree scene within a house. The stages built for those scenes just ooze design excellence and I have to admire the simplicity. We follow two 12 year olds who fall in love and plan to run away, but various authorities attempt to track them down. It's a basic plot but the animated characters and young performances help reinvigorate this exhausted genre. Our typical Anderson cast (Norton, Swinton, Keitel, Murray etc.) are all here again and give great performances. The awkward yet loving chemistry between our two young leads was moulded with care and tenderness that I found somewhat relatable. I'm sure back in our youth we all fell in love with a crush and wanted to run away from everyone...no? Just me then. Again, the production design was genius. I love how it purposefully look like it's built for a stage show as opposed to a cinematic piece, there is something so idiosyncratic about Anderson's choice of style that just makes it wonderful. Whilst all the above is all plain sailing, my major issue was with the narrative. I found myself somewhat disengaged until about halfway through. Right from the start, you are thrown in straight away with about 47 characters (completely accurate...) and a geography lesson of the island. Honestly I needed to get a notebook out. It was intimidating! Like an onslaught of quirkiness. It took so long for me to catch up and become invested that the short runtime of 94 minutes was nearly over. It's a shame, wish it was longer so that the plot development could take its time. However, it's a sweet film and Anderson's style is impeccable.",

Here we have a heartwarming coming-of-age tale of a boy and a girl finding each other through pure feelings and innocent dreams, but with a colorful setting overshadowed by numerous vile aspects of the society like bullying, child abuse, unfaithfulness, depression, abandonment, and social ignorance. The way innocence of the childhood prevailed such social prejudices indeed helped lighten the mood of the audience, but many among them may still feel uncomfortable observing such especially dark depictions of humanity (Wes Anderson is no stranger in illustrating the dark sides of humans, but inexplicably I found this film a note darker than his previous ones). Wes Anderson's treatment of the two main characters is especially admirable, with the pinnacle scene of Sam and Suzy dancing to Fran\u00e7oise Hardy's \"Le temps de l'amour\" on the Moonrise Kingdom beach that will surely invoke a melancholic feeling of childhood and initial loves from the viewers. The acting of those two are not particularly outstanding, though, and the cast of this film in a whole, while very versatile, still seems to be less impressive than the cast of Wes Anderson's next one \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\". Still, a very moving coming-of-age film that is rare these days.",

So now that time has gone by and that I download this on Netflix for offline viewing in the Canada trip, I watch it for time waste sakes, and while I think it's a great film, it's not quite of there in the highs. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are fantastic as they got the quirks that work for a Wes Anderson film, and their chemistry is very odd, but very heartfelt. The acting is also great, which is nice to see Bill Murray be funny, even if he's playing it straight, and Bruce Willis not act over-the-top. The characters are quite interesting in an odd way, and the humor is sometimes funny, although not quite as funny as it's trying to be. It's interesting to see how the scouts get even more weird as this is a Wes Anderson film, and while it's not that interesting to watch at times, I was still interested enough to know where I wonder is going to.

How metaphysical of Wes. He has the style, all right, and even better, he has the wit to pull off this story of prepubescent love written for the eyes of tired adults. Had there been a better explanation as to how our two main characters met, which is important to consider in the circumstances of living on such a small, isolated island and them being \"emotionally disturbed,\" I would deem the plot to be flawless. That ultimately matters little in the adventure, for the film's strength rides more dependently on everything else -- the strangely skewed dialogue, the true-to-its-own-world performances, the colours, the landscapes. This movie is so pretty! How it must feel to see the world as if you knew everything you wanted in life, and you could get it. Bill Murray's character knows better. Bruce Willis' character knows better. Frances McDormand's character especially knows better. Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward do not need to know though, not now anyway.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson has never been afraid to give a swift kick in the ass to realism and all naysayers - he's interested in art and he's sticking to it, because he does it so well.\n\nAnderson-verse is a shared universe, a world of connectivity where people and things that seem sparse are more connected than they appear.  Just as so, they are divided.  This is an honest reflection of anyone's mind, and an artist who is given the freedom and reign to find that will almost certainly present satisfying results.  I wouldn't have expected at first that Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop knew anything of each other, but to realize they're in an affair gives this world some juice.  Each artist is the god over their domain, and in Moonrise KINGDOM, Anderson takes some inspiration from the Holy Bible.  Unlike so many modern filmmakers who use this as a source of political upheaval, spewing hatred and paranoia at the church, Anderson makes no such criticism.  He rather acknowledges it as a story that can reflect his own imagination, and godliness as an artist.  There's at least Noah's Ark and a subsequent sacrifice made by the local sheriff, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), to save two children atop a church during the 'flood.'\n\nAnderson films have such sweet tenderness to them, some personal touch and situations that draw out my inner-child.  It may make some uncomfortable, but I like stories of young romance, as long as they don't become graphic.  It speaks to the heart of adventure, this film's certain genre.\n\nWorlds within worlds, a microcosm that easily shares a macro - it says something about a family when they hang a painting of their home in their home.  They're trying  to be a family and put some emphasis on that.  Anderson's opening shot shows us the exterior in a dreamy painting, then maps out the upstairs floor, and ultimately pulls out of our main female protagonist's (Suzy) window to reveal an equally dreamy shot of the home itself in rain, surrealist quality, almost looks like a toy.\n\nAnderson will stage things very obvious, literal, as you'd see in a play.  I think the closest any director comes to squaring off the frame and putting it's viewer into a theater box is this auteur.  Just in the opening credits, in the upstairs of the house, he frames Bill Murray and Frances McDormand, a married couple called the Bishops, on two separate points of the z-axis, implying a distance between them which foreshadows greater revelations - Murray is furthest, most in the dark about anything, especially McDormand's affair.  But the camera pulls back to the foreground where Suzy continues looking out the window through her binoculars - she has her own mission, she'll be a missing child soon.  But her parents' neglect, largely stemming from their marital dissonance, contributes to their ignorance of what's going on in her life.  That's a lot to say in one shot; that's genius.  Only wish it were in 3D to make those layers come to fruition.  This whole opening is a visual/auditory essay that I could write about forever.  All along he's dropping these hints about separation, distance.  Multiple times in this montage, Murray and McDormand are clearly seen in separate rooms doing separate activities, divided by walls.  In the aforementioned shot, Murray sits down to read with some wine at a table divided, which he collides so he can rest his elbows down - as the camera pulls back, McDormand notices him from the other room, refrains from going in and opts to smoke her cigarette at the doorway.  And what do we hear all along?  An orchestra broken into parts, narrated by a kid who talks about the separate parts which make musical harmony - an omen to this family's mission.\n\nI happen to be amidst a production of Our Town and noticed Bob Balaban's Narrator is directly out of Thorton Wilder's pages, giving us a history and geography lesson of the fictitious setting, telling us about the delivery man and town/island functions, and informing us of act three's fateful storm.  Unlike Wilder's Stage Manager, he doesn't take over the story, and remains SEPARATE rather than interactive.  That he's a scientist combines him with Wilder's Professor Willard, whose lines Stage Manager could've done anyway.\n\nThemes of separation continue throughout, as if each frame is intended to be this microcosm of that larger idea.  Tents separated by a gap in the middle, a zipper opening straight down the middle separating either side of tent, distant radio communication between Sharp and Scout Master Ward (Ed Norton), cut to telecommunication in a priceless scene where Sharp tries to tell Sam's foster parents that their kid is missing - SPLITSCREEN and the foster dad informs he doesn't want Sam back.",

It is shot in 16 millimeter, and it does resemble 1964 ish in some measure, especially Edward Norton's haircut, the young boy's frayed undershirt, the way the director let the good cut roll of the young actor, not the one Willis plays, which, coming from the theatre, not film, I don't understand the whole problem there. I just see that it's real hard to do.\n\n So, sometimes, the younger actors are having a moment, but the older one stumbles on his words, but the director said, That's my take, so it must be hard to get even half of what you're working at, is all I know. In other words, it's funny to see Bruce Willis take a back seat to a 12 year old protagonist, and maybe, dare I say it, barely able to keep up, shall we say, to that 12 year old's acting level?

There is one aspect of Anderson's film-making that I greatly respect and can easily get behind, though. I love the meticulous way he captures his own visual style. The perfect framing of scenes in rooms built specifically for appearing on camera makes the movie look like a story book. You can tell that every little detail has been planned in order to give a colorful and pleasing shot every single time. What I hate in this movie is that it takes place in some really odd alternate reality where people don't behave like normal human beings. Everything from the dialogue to the decisions made by characters is so strange that it's like I'm watching a bunch of aliens trying to reenact events they read about in our books. The cast is mostly full of very talented actors, and some of them almost manage to appear normal in certain scenes. The big exceptions to the good casting are the 2 lead kids. Now I don't want to criticize the actors themselves, because I feel like this was a director's choice, but they are worse than robots. It's as if Wes Anderson said \"well, since kids are usually not the best actors, let's just steer into that skid\" and he asked them to be completely emotionless in every line delivery. That kind of undercuts the whole plot of the film since it's built on these 2 robots falling in love. Ordinarily I would probably like this story, and I certainly would like it with this visual style. But because it is so weird and off-putting I was mildly annoyed by the whole thing and will be reluctant to see any more of Anderson's movies.",

The photography, dialogues and artwork reminded me of a regional director who took a similar style way back. A similar theme of emotional, calm and thoughtful adolescents vs. knee-jerk, crazy adults has been dealt with by many different filmmakers but this one stands out as a better finished product than most. \n\nSam (Jared Gilman) is an unpopular boy scout absconds from the camp run by strict and kind Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). A search party involving Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) is dispatched. At the same time they hear that a sad and depressed young girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) goes missing from a nearby town. Soon they realize that they both conspired to escape. Rest is how they spend time, get close and explore each other and what happens when the adults catchup with them. \n\nThe focus is on the new leads who give a superbly apt performance in the backdrop of lush vistas, creative and unconventional photography and artwork, melodious and blending soundtrack packed with some of the heaviest weights of Hollywood in Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. The opening scene photography and background score introducing the Bishops sets the tone for the oncoming brilliance. Wes Anderson deftly balances the innocence and maturity of the leads especially resonating in a delicate scene which could have easily become vulgar turns out to be warm and comic. The remaining big stars are given enough space to develop their characters written carefully not to overlap each other and they do give their money's worth. \n\nA superbly supported Wes Anderson show",

            "content": "Moonrise Kingdom opens with a shot of an immaculately tidy room in a quaint, old-fashioned home on the New England coast. Suddenly, the camera pans right on the perfectly straight line to another such room, with three similarly-and oddly-dressed boys. They play a symphonic record and sit down in perfect symmetry. It all happens in a matter of 30 seconds or less, but it's all the time we need to identify the film's director. Ladies and gentlemen, Moonrise Kingdom is a Wes Anderson production through and through.\n\nOf course, many people will go into Moonrise Kingdom knowing it's Wes Anderson, and as such, they'll carry a set of preconceived notions regarding the director. For some, he's a savior of American cinema. For others, a colonoscopy would be more enjoyable than sitting though one of his films. Moonrise Kingdom isn't going to win over this pro-colonoscopy set, but ardent Anderson supporters will be thoroughly satisfied with what he has to offer.\n\nThe film echoes some of the themes found in Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, namely that small-town life sometimes causes us to act in reckless or foolish ways. On the island of New Penzance, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) don't fit in. The former is an orphan who excels as a Khaki Scout despite frequently butting heads with the other boys who call him \"emotionally unstable.\" Suzy, on the other hand, lives in a \"traditional\" home, but she's short-tempered, and her parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) simply ignore her rather than give her the guidance she needs.\n\nBut Sam and Suzy find comfort in each other. Through a series of letters, they concoct a plan to run away and live off the land. Their disappearance, however, sends the rest of the incredibly insular island-including a police officer, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), and Sam's Khaki Scout leader, Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton)-into a real tizzy.\n\nThe film's running time seems evenly split between Sam and Suzy's budding love and the adults' frantic search for them before Anderson and his cowriter, Roman Coppola, bring them all together for a genuinely surprising conclusion. History and expectations would tell us that actors like Murray, Willis, Norton, and McDormand would easily outshine their much younger and totally inexperience costars, but that's pleasantly not the case. Hayward and Gilman are revelations. Anderson is unsurprisingly the perfect man to write and direct a story of this nature, which relies heavily on the viewer relating to these kids, their headstrongness, and pie-in-the-sky attitudes toward love. You do, but without the strong performances of these two youngsters, you wouldn't have much reason to care.\n\nThat's not to say any of the bigger names come up short. Willis is as good as he's been in a while, and Edward Norton delivers Anderson's wacky dialogue like he's Jason Schwartzman or something. Murray and McDormand are fine, but their subplot is Moonrise Kingdom's weakest element. In them, Anderson attempts to show us how and why Suzy developed into the emotionally troubled young girl she is. But it's not a stretch to just accept her that way. As such, the extended sequences with their marital problems in display feel unnecessary.\n\nAlexandre Desplat delivers another great score for an Anderson picture (his second after his Oscar-nominated work on Fantastic Mr. Fox), and Anderson's typically great eye for detail and shot selection is once again on display (you won't find a film that's looks more quintessentially 1960s than this one). From top to bottom, Moonrise Kingdom is an exceptionally constructed motion picture, but more importantly, it's emotionally satisfying, quite fun, and in many ways, an ideal summer movie.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/moonrise-kingdom-review/",

I don't know if this is typically found in his films but Moonrise Kingdom is slow, bland, unfunny, and plain boring, even with its all star cast, it's a hipster's dream but an overall snoozefest for me.\nMoonrise Kingdom's plot will be really cute to some and really weird to others - I found it the latter. Two 12 year olds find love, one a handy boy scout and the other a misunderstood basket case, and run away together, all the while being chased by their parents, a police officer, and a scout leader.\nMoonrise Kingdom is, in a word to accurately describe my immense dislike for the film, boring. Anderson's style is unappealing to me and is particularly aimed at hipsters and indie lovers - not that I don't like that, it's just Anderson tends for his comedy style to be a big bland inside joke. The film is comparative to that of a bland, boring palette of beige and sparrow blue. Its recurring themes of love translate to overall creepiness amongst especially bland and unfunny child actors. The acting, even from its big name stars, is atrocious - nobody really tries here because the film doesn't really tend to take itself seriously. It doesn't know whether it's a cute romance story or a bland especially dry comedy. Nothing seems to work in this film, maybe there's some sort of irony in that. Moonrise Kingdom is a bland unfunny bore, and my first film of Anderson's fails to amuse me.",

However a lot of his work are really extraordinary stuff that everyone can find a favorite among them. One of those works happen to be Moonrise Kingdom. Anderson in this 2012 indie hit takes us on a journey with two young kids learning love at a young age. Anderson uses his trademark quirky directing to give us a story that's a true delight for cinema lovers.\n\t\n\nIn 1965, on an island off the coast of New England, Sam and Suzy are two kids who have fallen in love and decide to run away. This causes a wide array of individuals to come find them. These individuals are played by Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Edward Norton and more. This love story plays out in an unusual world that Anderson creates for us. \n\ntremendous directing and camera work. The side by side framing is impeccable. The film as a whole had a really fun vibe too it. Anderson places in his usual sense of quirkiness. Its cool seeing bruce willis in something more grounded and more structured than his usual action films. Edward Norton is really good here. he is a scout master who really cares about his boys and feels it is obligated duty to find him as an actual parent would since this kid doesn't have one. The introduction of the boy and girls love story was kinda poorly executed and written but the entire rest of the way through it was on point. It's a nice little love affair between the two young characters. Really dope adding in the element of scouts in there and showing the resourcefull ness of our young lad here. From the entire cast alone, stupendous acting from all of them.\n\nthere must have been an extensive rehearsal process for these scenes it really pays off here. on a technical note good lighting and good editing too. This was also decently funny too.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom is fantastic picture out of the extensive filmography of wes Anderson. Definitely worth checking out",

The scenes are shot in a way that makes action scenes look calm and idle scenes even more idle. This along with the serious attitudes of characters towards bizarre events makes the funny parts of the film not lose their meaningfulness and gives the picture a pseudo realistic style simply because anything closer or further from realism would cheap. Yet this easily transfers to an obvious problem, characters in this film simply do not give a damn. They execute their actions with as little emotion as possible and while certain drama occasionally appears in the film it generally barely contains any. Nevertheless lack of emotion is skillfully compensated by adding depth to characters with fascinating idiosyncrasies and goals.

This movie scouts bravely off into new territory.  For example, no longer does a phone call split screen end when the phone call ends, he just keeps it going so you can see what both parties are up to after the call.  Framing in each scene is meticulous and brilliant, obvious symmetry is not avoided but embraced.  Just watch the first five minutes of the film and you will see that you are not in for a usual movie in any sense.  The whole film: performances, script, lighting, the setting and the island itself, are wonderfully insane.  Should be taught in film schools worldwide.  I wish there were more than five stars to give it.",

Every shot was aligned perfect and had a purpose. This movie told such a story and displayed such a personality through just the shots. The style of this movie also made it a must watch. The mix of comedy and drama is off the charts and creates such an unique feeling like no other.\n\nThere is not a single dull one dimensional character in this movie. Each character is one of a kind and just amazing. Sam and Suzy are absolutely amazing in this movie. They have such a chemistry and own every second of screen time they have.

            "content": "This film seems to have passed largely under the radar, unlike Wes Anderson's next movie, Grand Budapest Hotel.  Which is odd, considering how it's in this film that Anderson's unique style and technique is finally moulded into something coherent and brilliant.  All of the hallmarks that made Budapest Hotel so Grand are here - the absurdist comedy and idiosyncratic characters from The Darjeeling Limited - the miniatures and detailed set design from Life Aquatic - even the narrative style from Royal Tenenbaums - all of these little quirks from his previous movies, all finally fit together like one big puzzle, to form something beautiful, memorable, and utterly hilarious.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom is a comedy without jokes.  The subject matter would be serious, if it weren't presented in such a way that constantly holds a mirror up to itself to recognise its own absurdity.  The visual comedy is executed brilliantly, and the acting is stoic and deadpan - even when it really shouldn't be - which adds to the style and humour.  To treat the ridiculous with utter seriousness is the key to the laughs here, and to do that, constant parallels are drawn on other popular movie tropes.\n\nThis is a film about a troubled soldier and orphan, that escapes from his platoon in order to run away with a girl he met (also troubled), whom he had been secretly communicating with.  His own platoon is sent after him to hunt him down, and bring him in - but being the least popular (see troubled, again), they don't mind so much if he's brought in dead or alive.  A deadly cat and mouse game ensues.\n\nOnly, these aren't soldiers at all.  They're boy scouts.  The \"prison break\" involves nothing more complicated than cutting a hole in the side of his tent and escaping, but the hole is covered-up with a map, a la Shawshank Redemption.  As the movie progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer that the Khaki Scouts are an analogy for soldiers, and there's some brilliantly funny scenes walking through camp where we see the little boy scouts running obstacle courses, marching in unison, zip-lining and setting off rockets... all drives home this wonderfully absurd mix of the serious and child-like, which permeates everything about the film.\n\nAnother favourite Anderson staple of mine that appears here, is the symmetrical composition, and fast 90 degree camera swivels.  Every shot in the film is painstakingly arranged for maximum effect, and every frame is a work of art.  Attention to detail is everything here, and every element - from the yellow tint that gives every shot the feel of an old photograph - to the flowery French text that appears as captioning - all is specifically designed to evoke some kind of reaction - and in this case, it's to give the film grounding and context as a 60's era piece of euro-cinema.\n\nIn short, this film is nothing short of brilliant, and absolutely on par with Grand Budapest Hotel.  Fans of that movie are guaranteed a good time with this one.",

The story is simple but Anderson makes it complex by intertwining tales and narratives. the acting is spot on as always starring Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances Mcdormand, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman, and two brilliant young child actors whose names I don't know.\nWes Anderson's script is so finely tuned and quirked in all the right ways that it makes this movie special in every sense. \nNow let's talk about the framing. Good lord the framing. it's so symmetrical and beautiful. the colors are vibrant and pop right in your eyes.\nMy only flaw with the film is that the ending seemed a little rushed and left me slightly unsatisfied.

Truthfully, this is not the auteur's best work since Rushmore (that would be Royal Tenenbaums and Grand Budapest Hotel), but it hits a lot of the right notes ... especially if you're a fan of this writer/director's life Quixotic. You have to trust his quirky vision by jumping in - not slowly dipping your toes to find the right temperature. This warning seems more the case with this film than any of his others. It's a wondrously whimsical world painstakingly brought to life with specific brushstrokes and amazing performances. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated 1960s-set dramedy , two young lovers (Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward) make a pact and run away into the wilderness, riling the local townspeople intent on finding them before a violent storm touches down. \n\nThe fact that Moonrise Kingdom takes place from a kid's eye-view (as opposed to Rushmore, which took place from an eccentric kid-beyond-his-years) makes this Anderson film a unique confection, tender and warm even amidst the storminess. Despite boasting a marquee cast chock full of bona fide movie stars, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton beautifully fall into the fabric of this tale and never once overshadow their young players. Like a seasoned troupe, the actors - young and old - comprise this Kingdom equally. If you're willing to fully bask yourself in Anderson's particular rays of Moon-light, the payoff is worth a king's ransom. \n\nBottom line: Makes Hay While the Moon Shines",

            "content": "The best way to describe, 'Moonrise Kingdom', is that of a fairytale. It whisks you away into a very vivid and creative fantasy world; it totally captures the leads childlike innocence, it's sweet, warm and it made me smile. However, like in most fairytales, there is an underlying tone and hint of despair and impending doom, it is even unexpectedly violent a couple of times. It even pushed the envelope sometimes as well. \n\nThe cast for this film is excellent with new and old faces and they all give excellent performances, especially the two young leads, which is obviously good as they are the primary focus of the film and the success of the film rides on their shoulders. This is to be expected though as Wes Anderson really knows how to work with actors. The characters were all great with some actors, like Willis and Norton, playing against type and it was fun to see, they are all written excellently well, for the most part, with Willis' character in particular being the standout with making me feel sad for him. I say for the most part because I really couldn't grasp where Murray's character was coming from; Murray does typically excellent work but when his character is proposed a rhetorical question about their daughter running away, his initial reaction isn't to be worried like the mother is, it's to make a witty remark. That might be his schtick as well as to show how much he doesn't care about the situation around him, while it was still funny, it felt a little weird. The Narrator seemed like an odd addition as he's just in a handful of scenes but his entity grows stranger the longer it goes on, he seems just as a character for us, given his name, but he randomly comes out of nowhere at one to interact with our characters. Also, I thought I saw Owen Wilson at one point but he wasn't in this film, weirdly.\n\nThe story is told in a slightly non-linear way at first, which was creative and worked but the way our characters meet each other seems kind of random and coincidental. Besides that, the girl sitting on the right next to Suzy seemed weird, she was fine when she thought that Sam was just asking what they all were but then said that no boys were allowed when Sam said he was just talking to Suzy. I'm also kind of surprised the other characters didn't see that hole in the tent, it wasn't even like the other side of the material covering up the hole was painted or anything, you'd think anyone would have already seen it by now, but the hole wasn't visible on the outside! I also felt sorry for that Turtle that Sam just threw back in. Suzy bringing that cat seemed like she didn't really think it through, despite the family would clearly notice both them gone, what would she do when the food ran out? You'd also have thought they would have made an effort to get away from those boys coming after them, from the way Sam was hiding it looked like they would be hidden from them but clearly not and of course because they don't like him, they're going to turn him in! It seemed odd seeing Norton's character smoking given where he was, but hey. I thought they would have zoomed into the picture at the end to line it up directly with the real life location but that didn't happen and would the term 'nudes' be around in 1965?\n\nEverything on the technical side is excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous and glides across the screen so naturally, everything is staged perfectly, the colours are so rich but at the same time seem muted to fit in with the nature and it just feels warm. The pace was unbelievable, I loved this so much that it felt like no time had passed at all, I couldn't believe it when it finished. The film has a typically unique style and with this film it is the use of letters as well as the font of the film, it's beautiful. The CGI in the film is noticeable, it isn't bad but it's used in such a way where you can notice it when it is used and Anderson puts his own spin on it. Explosions are used a few times and like I have said in the past, perhaps because I have used too much green screen but one or two of the explosions didn't look the best, but I'm aware the budget was quite small and it was excellently spent in every other department. Alexandre Desplat works with Wes Anderson again and this soundtrack is absolutely amazing. However, there was one point where it seemed too loud and, while that isn't his fault, it made one audio line quiet, although it did seem like in that scene in particular it didn't matter that it was loud because it didn't seem like a scene where we had to necessarily hear the line, 'follow me' as it was one of those film scenes where music is used to cover a journey, even if it only happened for that one line. \n\nThis is a very unique film, it left me smiling and happy, but there was also a hint of sadness in there. It is a smart and emotional film with deep themes and really leaves you thinking about it after everything is said and done. When the last shot of this film appeared, coupled with the music and what came just before it, I just had such a huge smile. This film is magical and totally memorable; 'Moonrise Kingdom' is an absolute delight.",

Wes Anderson is one of the few filmmakers left that has a style all his own, yet he's still telling stories with purpose and style that keeps the viewing experience purely cinematic and interesting.\n\nThe cast has an extensive pedigree, the script is precocious and sharply witty, and Wes Anderson's devotion to a universally deadpan tone, color, symmetry and pattern is inspiring. This is a movie all about the feeling of falling in love, whether it be fresh or time tested, and it's beautiful from start to finish.\n\nClearly from the schools of both Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick, this feels like Anderson truly hitting his creative stride. Most would say that he came into his own with THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS or maybe RUSHMORE, but this one stands out because the style is consistent and bright without deviation.\n\nOverall, if you've not seen it yet, see this film. MOONRISE KINGDOM is one of the finest American movies of the decade thus far.",

            "content": "There are few directors out there like Wes Anderson. Each one of his films is unique, yet they all share a similar vibe that is threaded between them. In 'Moonrise Kingdom,' Anderson brings his signature deadpan quirkiness to a New England island where an orphaned, misfit \"khaki scout\" finds love with a disturbed, misunderstood young girl. As with most Anderson films, the cast of 'Kingdom' is full of a who's who in the industry, including memorable performances from Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton, among others. In terms of the two stars of the film, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) both do respectable jobs, especially considering their ages. Their monotonous delivery of their lines is also pretty impressive, considering child actors are usually extremely energetic by nature.\n\nEverything else about 'Kingdom' is what you'd expect from Anderson: an offbeat score, crazy cinematography and lots of frowns to go around. True, there's a depressed sentiment throughout 'Kingdom,' but the sarcasm and irony that also permeate the dialogue and the actions that happen throughout the movie. And yes, some of the nonsense that takes place is hard to ignore (including lightning strikes, exploding cabins and \"dog murdering,\" but these are not out of character, all things considered. As for the humor, it's not the kind that you'd find in an Adam Sandler movie, but that's what makes it great, as there a lot of tongue-in-cheek references and intelligent, subtle jokes.\n\nAt it's conclusion, 'Moonrise Kingdom' could leave a bad taste in audiences' mouths, but that's likely because they are not fans of Anderson and his unorthodox style.",

One day, Sam disappears with the only person that he has ever bonded with: 12 year old Suzy Bishop. Soon a rescue party starts in order to find the two young lovers and bring them back to a safe environment.  \nTo be honest, this was the first Wes Anderson film I have seen and even though I was aware that he was a director with a unique and quirky style, I wasn't prepare for what I got in this film. \"Moonrise Kingdom\" counts with ridiculously entertaining acting by almost every single actor of this peculiar cast, clever dialog, a mesmerizing cinematography, gorgeous locations, unique and charming characters, a sympathetic story, an energetic and focused directing, a beautiful art direction, and a perfectly atmosphere that sets the mode for this innocent story. With all that being said, \"Moonrise Kingdom\" is an amazingly uneven and unbalanced film. The main couple\u00b4s acting is at times great and believable but mostly it is bland, the innocent and quirky style doesn't work when the films tries to create some drama or introduce some conflict, there is no character development, the visual style at time distracts you from the story, there are some subplots that never go anywhere, the pacing is so fast that it removes the power of most of the character moments, not all the comedy works, the music is repetitive, the balance between the stories of the adults and the children is inconsistent, and the last third is one of the most ridiculous endings I\u00b4ve ever seen on a film, I get that this film\u00b4s style and atmosphere are peculiar to say the least but they take it to such an extreme that\u00b4s laughable. \n\"Moonrise Kingdom\" is a film that's filled with innocence and heart but it doesn't always work in the narrative. Many people will loved it due to its romance and sweetness but it will feel as a pretentious and uneven film for others that expect more from a director that was acquired a respectable reputation.",

For Wes Anderson fans they will be used to this however before Moonrise Kingdom, I had never seen any one of his movies. My first impression was simply enchanting. With such a star-studded cast, surprisingly my favorite performances were from the two leads who are a couple of nobodies. Jared Gilman who played the lead boy Sam was hilarious to watch as an exaggerated scout expert while Kara Hayward, playing Suzie was a perfect counterpart playing a lonely and lost girl. Their love story although playing characters as young as twelve was still more enjoyable than most one's of more adult romantic movies. I feel the only aspect holding this movie from a perfect five-star score is how as the movie progressed it became less and less grounded and more unrealistic. This, in some ways added to the humor but in others took away from this movies natural charm. Besides that slight nit-pick, this work of Anderson's is a very solid addition to his gallery of films.",

Thanks to Wes Anderson's vibrant and energetic direction, full of tracking shots which establish with ease and delightfully comical close-ups, as well as a fantastic score by Alexandre Desplat, accenting the quirk and weirdness of the story, Moonrise Kingdom is a flawless film on a technical level. \n\nBut that isn't why anyone shows up to a Wes Anderson film; they show up because they expect the characters, scenery and humour to be outstanding, and that they all are. Headed by outstanding performances from teenage actors Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, the entire ensemble embraces the hilariously serious plethora of diverse and interesting characters, all drawing attention to their weird and wonderful quirks. Anderson fills all his characters with a warmness and reliability though, that manages to maintain a semblance of understanding with the audience, allowing them to properly see through the eyes of these characters which initially seem too overtly weird and wonderful to properly connect to.\n\nEdited to perfection, jarringly hilarious, perfectly acted, filled with amiable thematic intentions and messages, full of interesting and diverse cinematography (this should be the film, alongside The Grand Budapest Hotel, that is shown to film school students for advice on framing and executing shots); Moonrise Kingdom explores our fascination with breaking free from the confines of our normal and abusive lives, and finding a place beyond the hills where we can be ourselves and explore our deepest desires.

This film is kind of like Romeo & Juliet meets Bridge To Terabithia, but still feels original at the same time. It's a fascinating study of how kids view other kids, how kids view adults, how adults view kids, and how adults view other adults.\n\nThe performances in this film are all excellent, from Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward as the two main kids, Sam and Suzy, to Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as Suzy's parents, to Edward Norton as Sam's scout master, and Tilda Swinton as a woman named Social Services. Bruce Willis is also excellent as a sheriff, and it's nice to see him do a non-action film for once. Bob Balaban is excellent as well as the on-screen, unnamed narrator who tells the story by breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the audience.\n\nIt's a unique film that shouldn't be missed by any film lover. 10/10.",

After seeing this year's The Grand Budapest Hotel, I knew that I needed to visit this film which slipped through the cracks for me in 2012.\n\nThe movie is beautifully shot in Anderson's trademarked tea-stained filter and symmetrical compositions. His humor and wit are also in full force. My only complaint with the film is that it feels perhaps a little indulgent. It's almost too Wes Anderson-y for its own good. Maybe it's clich\u00c3\u00a9, but I feel like hipster kids must eat this shit up like candy. Does that make it a bad film? Of course not. But it's like listening to a guy that really loves to hear himself talk.\n\nEdward Norton is the best casting decision in the movie- he was perfect for the role of the master scout. I don't blame the child actors for their sometimes mediocre performances- it rare that actors that young deliver anything astounding (it was both the young actors' first film, so in light of that, they were pretty stinkin' good.)\n\nIt's worth your time checking out, especially if you enjoy Anderson's other works. It not my favorite film from his filmography, but it has so much charm and beauty that you'll probably find it a delightful diversion.",

The struggles to survive their individual childhoods are soothed by each other.  In one another they find the support to move through their pain, progress into adult situations and give each other comfort they couldn't receive from adults.  The quirkiness of the script's situations are typical of Anderson films, but the \"yellowing\" of the film's color and the exquisite use of children as the main characters add to the depth of perspective, showing the adults as the goofy, clueless, immature element of the cast.  In their own chaos, the kids appear to have it together much more than the adults.  Throughout this wonderful film, the kids deal with the adult scenarios with maturity and logic while the adults come across as trained monkeys.  The children come together as a strong, empathetic team while the adults are miserable robots succumbing to the rigidity of their mundane lives, clinging to every vice there is, from cheating, lying, drinking, smoking, etc. while all the kids want is to be loved and happy.

Yes, compared to the average movie, this film is good and enjoyable. However, compared to Anderson's potential, it falls flat and is rarely funny. Whilst the dead-pan humour worked in the Royal Tenenbaums, here it seemed to detract from the story. It has its moments, but it is not something worth boasting about.",

I especially liked that young Suzy (Kara Hayward) was such a devoted fan of reading books (even if she was a bit of a library-clepto) and Sam was such an impressive wilderness ace that it made them all the more endearing characters because they didn't seem like stereotypical, whinny, spoiled, self-important, entitled teens portrayed in films now-a-days. They were clever and self-reliant; what an awesomely unique quality in young person. This film kind of reminds me of the t.v. series \"Pushing Daisies\" (starring Lee Pace), this too had a similarly unique vibe to it.

            "content": "Wes Anderson's seventh film Moonrise Kingdom begins with an almost hyper calm; the camera whirls around disorientingly, stopping to show us different, perfectly strange glimpses of what's happening in different rooms in the home of the people we are about to be eavesdropping on. It's a weirdly interesting and unique opening, compelling as much for its delightful cinematic style as subtle eye-raising content. As the film rolls along, with its wonderful, unique mixture of methodical, albeit brisk storytelling, it becomes apparent that the composition will threaten to overtake the cinematic oddities in a way that maybe no previous Wes Anderson film has accomplished. That is, there's a palpable grit of true emotion that rings throughout, giving his eccentricities more weight.\n\nThe story of two children seeking refuge from their lives on a small New England island is told through current incidents and quick recaps. The boy, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman), is an orphan who has earned the ire of his fellow \"Khaki Scouts\" just by being a bit different than they are. (This is no small feat in an Anderson film, often largely populated with all sorts of unconventional folks). The girl, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), has a penchant for creating havoc amid an already shaky relationship between her parents (a tragi-comical Bill Murray and uber expressive Frances McDormand). The two kids begin a \"pen pal\" relationship of sorts, which leads them to scheme to run away together to the woods.\n\nOne of the most profound moments of the film comes early on when Sam questions Suzy on her reasons for wanting to run away. She shows him the book that she found on top of the refrigerator, the title of which is \"How to Deal With a Troubled Child.\" Suzy's eyes instantly reflect her deep hurt Suzy. Sam`s immature reaction - he laughs - turns her hurt to anger. It`s also one of the few reminders that hey, this kid is only twelve. In a very big way, these tiny heartbreaks are the reasons the audience will relate and become attached to these characters. There are significant junctures where the camera is allowed to linger for maybe a second longer than it does in the more outright comedic segments. In fact, some scenes are structured with a kind of emotional schizophrenia; we might be driven to awkward laughter only a few seconds before one of those little shards of delicate despair strikes.\n\nIt makes the viewer aware that anything could happen, creating an unsteady consistency that drives the film with its paradoxical inevitability. That is, there is more than one reaction that the characters could have, and there is more than one road that the story could take. It's refreshingly pleasant poetry to watch, with the director confident that the understated complexity of present emotions is stronger than any direct imagery could be, regardless of how stark and striking.\n His signature framed backdrops become the outline of a painting in which the characters' actions and reactions play out.\n\nWes Anderson's films often have a signature aesthetic, and they feature familiar actors delivering unfamiliar performances and Moonrise Kingdom is no exception: In Moonrise, Bill Murray plays his Walt Bishop in a nearly breakable way; it's different than the almost stubborn acceptance of Herman Blume, his character in Anderson's excellent Rushmore. His voice is almost unrecognizable in a few scenes. In other words, he isn't just playing Bill Murray. Similarly, Edward Norton plays the perpetually confounded Khaki Troops leader Scout Master Ward with a touching innocence and concern.\n\nMaybe even more impressive is the performance by Bruce Willis, far from his smart mouthed John McClain type roles. Willis is utterly believable and mostly sympathetic in his role as the local police captain. He's not delivering his lines in a tongue-in-cheek manner as his parts often call for, rather with a ponderous weight, as if he's really thinking about these things before he says them. He's not Bruce Willis scaling buildings and spouting catchphrases; he's a lonely, middle-aged man searching for hope in a small, idyllic town that he doesn't quite belong to and finding an unlikely friend he maybe didn't even know he needed. It's a charming, memorable portrayal.\n\nPut simply, Moonrise Kingdom is a beautiful film. The art direction is exquisite, the colors are appealing and ambrosial without being distracting or obnoxious. Viewers are drawn into this singular dreamy world with delight; it's a very strong reflection of the importance of a child's individuality, as well as the many ways that adults fail them, both accidentally and out of exasperation. The kid actors are wonderful, portraying the freedom of a child's infinite imagination and the frustration with the adults around them, already resigned to their own unpleasant stations, and therefore trapping the children, however protectively and unknowingly. Their eyes are soulful, sad, playful, sometimes all in the same scene.\n\nDriven by atmospheric music, the movie jettisons effortlessly between vivid images of sixties small town life, haunting climactic frames, emotional peaks and valleys, and little fragments of sheer delight. It's an example of a contemporary artist with something to say, beyond the commercial triviality of another summer blockbuster.\n\nMost importantly, it's a tiny peek into a different world, where charm and innocence are celebrated. And a desperate look at two awkwardly lovely children who seem fully and even painfully aware of their frail hold on what is likely the most unregimented summer they will ever experience.",

            "content": "Odd, peculiar, and something that you don't normally see is how I would describe this film but somehow it works. Set in 1965, on a small island off the coast of New England, this is the story of Sam, a 12 year-old Khaki Scout who abandons his troop to run away with his pubescent crush, Suzy. Sam is an orphan who may have problems with mental stability, whereas Suzy comes from an unhappy home. She resents her mother Laura for carrying on an affair with the island's police chief, Captain Sharp. Her father Walt is always busy working or being generally distracted. Her little brothers are pests. When the two kids run off into the wilderness, Sharp heads up a search party. Assisting him is Sam's bumbling scout leader, Scout Master Ward, and the entire scout troop. Meanwhile, a major storm looms off the coast making it imperative that Sam and Suzy are found as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJared Gilman and Kara Heyward are really good finds. Despite their youthful age, they know exactly how to nail Anderson's fondness for exaggerated characters. The kids could come off as a bit precious, yet the young actors find real humanity in them. If you ever felt inwardly tormented as a 12 year-old, you'll relate to Sam and Suzy. A terrific ensemble cast provides backup, with Norton getting laughs as the scout leader who really tries hard to take no nonsense, and Tilda Swinton getting even more laughs as a Social Services worker named...Social Services. She devotes herself to finding Sam so that she can send him to juvenile detention, which puts in motion the third-act events that show Moonrise Kingdom's compassionate heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson balances broad comedy with occasionally surreal quirk, while still holding the emotional center. The film is largely told through the eyes of the kids, so the delightfully silly little touches are indicative of how they see the world. When you get right down to it, these young folks are wiser and more grounded than the adults around them are. They see through the folly of their \"role models.\" Telling a story about children appears to have freed him somewhat. The movie has moments of action, and even some special effects. Everything adds up to create a cinematic rush that simulates what Sam and Suzy are feeling inside. While Moonrise Kingdom bears its maker's unmistakable stamp, it also feels new and fresh, very much unlike anything else. The beauty of a picture like this is that you can't anticipate where it's going to go. There are surprises every few minutes sometimes a plot twist, other times an unexpectedly absurd bit of comedy, still other times a creative visualization of an idea. Even the end credits are compellingly presented. At a time when even fun movies often feel rubber-stamped, it's so refreshing to see one that catches you off guard, making you smile with its exuberant energy. Moonrise Kingdom celebrates crazy young love in an odd sense of style.",

            "content": "Moonrise Kingdom (2012) - 8\r\n\r\nDuring my childhood and early adolescence, I had the privilege to own an incredible aptitude for dreaminess. It was common to find myself daydreaming with riveting places, landscapes, people or music which made me outburst with feelings or emotions so different from everything else that I still don't know if there are words able to describe them. Those daydreams were the stage of the deepest love fantasies of my early adolescence. As I grew older, this aptitude weakened progressively and today my mind is so gripped to reality that I cannot disconnect and feel the blaze of other worlds anymore. Nowadays, I am blessed with such visceral experiences only, and by rare luck, during sleep. Unfortunately, I forget most dreams. Cinema and music are the only escapes able to relieve me from the absence of my childhood reveries, but, try as they might, the experiences they offer are rarely close to be as visceral and unique as those that my mind can induce myself into. \"Moonrise Kingdom\" is far from being such visceral experience, but it leaves me with faint nostalgia because the story portrayed features the same kind of platonic young love affair that I fantasized in my early adolescent digressions: a love adventure tale in a wistfully beautiful and stormy landscape. So far, this is my favorite Wes Anderson movie, it's the only one that graces me with a cinematic experience that comes remotely close to transfigure into a waking dream. I also think this is the most powerful expression of the oblique quality that distinguishes his movies from the others.\r\n\r\nThe offbeat pathos is apparent in the aesthetic polish and narrative sophistication of \"Moonrise Kingdom\". Here is yet another fine example of Wes Anderson's predilection to whimsically deliberate his characters' behavioral profiles. The youths are the main characters in this story and are endowed with obvious adultlike mannerisms, the acting is not exemplary, but this actually adds to the charm and funniness of the young characters. One more time, I perceived a tendency to dissect an almost intangible quality from some human subjects, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop don't seem to be absolutely inserted in who they are (supposed to be), their manners are not as raw and settled as reality would demand. Their personalities seem to balance precariously on a tightrope at the limit of their elusive definition, just like appears to be the case with other subjects in \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and \"Rushmore\". But it is unreasonable to ask for such accomplished acting from kids or teenagers without any prior acting skills, so either this young couple of actors is monumentally talented or Wes Anderson is an expert at the art of crafting his characters by using actors as mere tools. Or maybe this fleeting and almost intangible quality I'm drooling about is nothing more than an illusion or wishful thinking of mine... and, in part, it probably is.\r\n\r\nThe wonderfully crafted cinematography and soundtrack enhance the dreamlike quality of the experience and contribute to forge different moods throughout the movie. Wes Anderson always reveals great musical taste in his movies, a quality I highly appreciate. The script and editing work are typically excellent and the camera work may be the most formal I've seen from Wes until now. Distractions come down to some poorly camouflaged CGI effects and little else. Once more, the story has a happy ending for the protagonists and yet again, the movie is more than just the story. In \"Moonrise Kingdom\", more than the other Wes' works I've seen, the style itself adds to the substance and owns part of the appeal of the movie. \"Moonrise Kingdom\" is very easy to be enjoyed as a visceral, exciting and fun cinematic experience. I don't find it as hilarious as \"Rushmore\", but I see it as a natural evolution of Wes Anderson's cinematic style. Wonderful movie, highly recommended!",
