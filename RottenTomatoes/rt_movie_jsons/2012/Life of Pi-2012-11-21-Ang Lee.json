I found most of the backstory very dull and something that was not relevant to the second half at all, despite the protagonist's tears. This film leans heavily on Big Fish, with some lines reading almost identical. The second half of the movie is mostly a peaceful and gorgeous watch, but the movie as a whole could have been stronger. The novelist framing device was extremely trite and could have been removed. Trust your audience! The visual effects team deserves a high score, but the multiple reports of tiger mistreatment on set will unfortunately bring this movie down to mid at best.",

It's just such a interesting story, about religion, believeling and faith, which i have always admired, how someone can believe so deeply in something he has never seen before. The CGI is stunning, the tiger is photo realistic, the storm was great and man the cinematography they created using CGI is amazing. The performances are solid, Suraj Sharma is great in this role. The whole movie has just such a beautiful message and it really pays of in the end, i had to cry. The score is incredible, as well as the sound design and mixing. There were some parts that they dragged out a bit, but then they show you beautiful cinematography and you just don't care about it, i just wanna live in that moment. I gotta be honest, Irrfan Khan could be the narrator of every movie and i will never be bored, the wisedom of his character in the movie is amazing. Overall a gorgeous movie with a interesting plot, decently executed, with great performances",

Thanks to stunning cinematography and some truly remarkable special effects, the movie is visually spectacular from beginning to end.  The story itself, like in the novel, is fascinating and, despite the fact that it often feels like it's about to border on bible-thumping, the deliberately ambiguous ending leaves plenty of room for discussion for both believers and non-believers.",

            "content": "It's well done. It's visually appealing. The CGI is decent. And there's some depth here. I can't really decide if the movie is arguing in favor of spirituality/religion or against it. Maybe it's neither. The whole point is that Pi made up the story with the animals so that he could live with the memories of what he had to do to survive, killing, cannibalism, etc. The tiger never really tried to eat Pi because he is Pi. Pi didn't like that his more primitive side had to come out to survive but he also knew he couldn't abandon the tiger as it was part of him and they needed each other. And people do this all the time. We remember uncomfortable things in a brighter light than the reality. We excuse ourselves from facing our own demons by making up a metaphorical tiger and acting like it was something separate from ourselves when we really understand, on a completely honest, rational level that it was us, but we don't want to embrace that truth. I'm also not so sure about the island. I guess it represents his thoughts of giving up hope of rejoining the world. He could stay there and die alone but he decided that's not what he wanted to do. He wanted to keep moving on and trying to find people again or die trying. And he viewed it as a sign from god that he needed to find the island to realize it wasn't his time to just give up and die. And this is why his tiger side had to leave the island with him. This part makes me think the tone of the film is pro-spirituality/religion, even though it recognizes it's not rational. The larger idea here is that religion is basically a coping device that people use to adopt a brighter perspective on the harsh realities that we have no evidence suggesting we are of any significance or anything more than an accident. I think atheists, and even some theists already realize this. So this isn't some revolutionary idea. And the movie dragged a bit in some places. But it is well done and worth seeing at least once.",

Very smart too being able to write the entire numerology of pi, 3.14 etc. That whole ship scene and him going overboard with the little boat into those humongous waves gave me crazy anxiety. Some of the scenes were very unrealistic which made everything seem very much fiction, which I guess this whole story is.\n\nThat carnivorous island part was really interesting. The way the island was shaped like a human being that was laying down. The island was alive, like a breathing organism. The whole relationship between him and the tiger was interesting. All the hardships they went through. And that whole thing about the tiger not looking back to say goodbye before he went into the jungle, that stuck with me. It's kind of like not being able to say goodbye to the ones you loved or had some kind of meaningful relationship with. \n\nPhilosophical in nature. This is a movie about faith, religion and the greater power of god. It's about love and pain. Very beautiful nature landscape imagery.

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT!\nSummary:\n        The movie starts in Canada where a Canadian writer visits an Indian boy named Piscine Patel, also known as Pi, and asks him to tell his epic survival story.\n\tThe story begins in Pondicherry, India, where Pi's parents own a small family zoo. Pi is raised practicing Hinduism. Later in his life, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and he starts to follow all three religions as \"all he wants is to love God\", no matter how he does it. \n\tWhen Pi is a teenager, his dad decides to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They go on a sea voyage with the animals that they are going to sell in Canada. One night, a heavy storm happens, and the ship begins to sink. He tries to find his family, but he gets thrown into a lifeboat by a crew member. The next morning, he finds himself in the boat with an injured zebra, a hyena, an orangutan named Orange Juice, and a Bengal tiger, hiding beneath the canvas of the boat, named Richard Parker. After some time, the hyena kills and eats the zebra and then Orange Juice. Finally, Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena. Pi is left on the boat alone with the Bengal tiger.  \n\tPi finds emergency food, water, a whistle, and a handbook for surviving at sea in the lifeboat. With all these supplies, Pi builds a floating device and attaches it to the boat so that he can keep a safe distance from the tiger. He then realizes that he must tame the tiger, or the tiger will eventually eat him. He blows the whistle and rocks the lifeboat enough to make the tiger seasick. Even though he cannot fully train him, he is able to make the tiger subdued by blowing the whistle. After crashing into a breaching whale, Pi loses almost all of his supplies. Due to starvation, Pi starts eating raw fish, even though he is vegetarian. \n\tAfter a few months at sea, both Pi and Richard Parker barely have any strengths. They find a weird floating island full of edible plants and freshwater. But soon, Pi discovers that the island is carnivorous. At night, the island emits acid and consumes everything on it. Pi also finds a human tooth inside of a plant. Then he stocks the lifeboat with supplies and leaves the island with Richard Parker. Eventually they reach the beach of Mexico. Richard Parker runs into the jungle and stops at the edge of the jungle. Pi hopes that the tiger will look back and acknowledge him, but he doesn't. Pi is brought to a local hospital. There, he is interviewed by two Japanese officials. He tells them this story which they find unbelievable to report. Pi then tells them a similar but much darker story. In this story, everything is the same except for one part. He shares the boat with his own mother, Gita, a sailor with a broken leg, and the ship's cook. After some time, they are worried about the limited supplies in the lifeboat, the cook kills the sailor and then Gita. Pi then kills the cook for self-defense purpose. \nAnalysis:\n        This movie talks about the fight to survive. As mentioned before, Pi believes all three religions. He has developed kindness towards all things and has learned morality from these religions. But when facing death and starvation, Pi has to abandon his own morality to survive. Animals in the first story all have a corresponding human character in the second story: Gita is the orangutan, the sailor is the zebra, the cook is the hyena, and the tiger is a projection of Pi himself. And I believe this illusion created by him actually helps him to survive the endless sea voyage after knowing that he has committed a horrible act, which is against his personal morals but is natural for tigers, without losing his sense of humanity. And seeing people as animals is much easier under those circumstances. \nCritique/Recommendation:\n        The actor Suraj Sharma gives a marvelous performance in this movie. And director Lee did a great job on visual effects. It also leaves us a question: which story do you prefer? Are you a person that believes in things that make sense? Or are you a person that believes in miracles? You can have different interpretations of what \"really\" happened, and there is no right or wrong answer. I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend this movie and I'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "The highly acclaimed Yann Martel novel that serves as the basis for this film is held up as a defense of multiculturalism and respect for minority groups during a time when political leaders like Donald Trump wield immense power. I support the idea of respecting all cultures and religions but watching this film I was not necessarily drawn in by the religious themes and the idea of acceptance of outsiders being positive but the insane third act twist. In the days since I have seen the film I have gone over this twist in my mind again and again with it disturbing me more and more as I imagine my own family going through the same thing.\n\nIn Pondicherry, India the young Pi Patel, Suraj Sharma, grows up under the care of his strict zookeeper father Santosh, Adil Hussain, and softer mother Gita, Tabu. He becomes open to all religions as a child against the wishes of his father who wants him to follow only one religion and he tries to build a friendship with lion, Richard Parker, who lives in his father's zoo. As a teenager he begins to fall in love with a dancer but his father needs them to move to Canada for work opportunities and the family board a ship along with the zoo animals. There is a storm and Patel finds himself on a lifeboat with Parker who initially attacks him before the two learn to work together in order to survive. The two go fishing and eventually find an island that appears beautiful but later proves to be polluted. Patel is later found by authorities but the fantastical story he tells is rejected and we are left to ponder whether the events he described were real or whether the animals represented his family.\n\nThe most disturbing idea that the film puts forward is that the animals on Patel's lifeboat who are depicted murdering one another early on in the film are actually representative of his family members. What is the film trying to say about family dynamics then? If the familial relationship can break down so quickly in stressful experiences and family members can literally kill one another as a result of their joint terror then is the only rational response to turn to religion. After all your relationship with god is not as direct as your relate to him through the environment around you and the god or gods clearly hold more power than you do. In a marriage, in which both partners ostensibly hold equal power, there is so much potential for argument because both people have the option of leaving the other, physically wounding their partner or hurting them with their words. A god can totally control a human so there is not the possibility for the argument and in some ways this total power imbalance leads to a better relationship because there is no disagreement from one party.\n\nAll of this philosophy was slightly bewildering but I think that while the film allows for some interesting discussion, as the best films do, the first two hours of it are not as compelling as the last six minutes. The opening monologue about how the main character's name was determined is funny enough but when Patel ends up on the lifeboat with the tiger I felt myself edging away from the film. The effects were brilliant, there is no doubt, and the film was right to pick up awards in all of the technical categories but the story that these efforts were devoted to may not have been worthy of them. As Parker and Patel square of in the boat and then become friends I was mildly amused but also struck by how similar this film is to so many other films about a boy and a dog.\n\nI had expected so much more from a film with so much critical support behind it and multiple Academy Award wins but at the end of the day it regurgitated plotlines that have been used for decades. Consider the questions that the film opens up to you but don't proclaim the film one of the best of 2012 because for most of it's running time it is a regular ‘prestige' picture.",

The film starts promisingly enough with an introduction to an interesting boy and his family, the zoo is nice enough and I found the scenes where Pi first meets his first love to very sweet in a non-schmaltzy way. The sinking of the boat is extremely well done.\n\nBut the film sinks along with the ship. A lot happens too quickly, then not enough happens for a long time. The CGI animals are very realistic, but not realistic enough. I never believed a real tiger was really there, so I felt no sense of threat or majesty. The island was out of context, when it should have been part of a tapestry of mystery. Its presence simply highlighted how badly the rest of the sea adventure was envisioned. Too much realism when there should have been non. \n\nThen the big reveal. Alas, the preceding hour did not justify it. And the writer's Golden Rule of \"show, don't tell\" obviously didn't get a look-in here.\n\nPerhaps it's wrong to blame Lee, though. The film is a PG and designed to win Oscars in an age when difficult cinema is unwelcome. No Deer Hunters these days. The dark nature of the story behind the story is glossed over so heavily that the fantasy becomes meaningless. At no point are we encouraged to consider that it may be a fantasy (at least until we get to the island, by which time it's too late). It was impossible to \"show\" enough in a PG movie, and so we were left with the clumsy \"tell\" at the end.\n\nUltimately, the film was let down by its CGI. Either it breaks the fourth wall, or, when it succeeds, it convinces us it was really real. Which, for the sake of the storytelling, is exactly what it should not have done. ",

            "content": "An enchanting journey of survival and faith.\n\nAng Lee's Life of Pi (2012) takes you across the Pacific Ocean from India to Mexico and ends in Canada. It's an epic of breathtaking aquatic visuals from visionary director Ang Lee. Lee cleverly uses aspect ratio to fill up a screen full of seawater, stretch the image to allow flying fish to leap out at the viewer, and widen your horizons with a mesmerizing whale sequence. The whale encounter is definitely my favorite scene in Life of Pi.\n\nLee's CGI team really outdid Avatar in taking you somewhere. The deep blues and brights yellows really pop in Life of Pi. The ocean looks real as does the intricately detailed tiger. You see plenty of real animals in the beginning of Life of Pi and while you can slightly tell the tiger, Richard Parker, is fake, you are never pulled out of the film. The tiger moves and feels like a realistic animal struggling to survive just like the boy.\n\nSuraj Sharma is a pretty good actor for making you care about him being lost at sea for a majority of the film. He is compelling as you see the fear stemmed inside him through his shocked eyes. Each movement feels deliberate from Sharma. Much like Lee's slower deliberate pace, Sharma makes you feel like you are stuck at sea with him.\n\nI most appreciate Irrfan Khan as the narrator and the adult Pi. He is the moral and philosophical heart of Life of Pi. He presents you his character Pi's life story with a grounded emotional delivery. You are immediately invested in his life. While not all of the movie will hit you hard, Khan's portions always grip me with his serious and spiritual style. He poses an unforgettable question at the end of the film.\n\nRafe Spall is also a good framed narrative character. His author seeking a story gives the audience a way into the strange and magical tale being told to him.\n\nTabu is great as the mother of Pi, but she gets very little to do or say. Lee certainly underused her. I like Pi's father too, but some of the CGI around him early on looked pretty fake. You only ever notice the CGI when it's a stray fish that's too shiny or a person's face aged a certain amount of years. Lastly, Gerard Depardieu is in Life of Pi as a racist cook for some reason. He's terrible and bland like a parody of himself. No idea why Ang Lee wasted screen time on him. I think Lee needed to cut down Life of Pi by maybe 10 minutes or so as it does feel too long. I was captivated by the story and visuals the entire run-time, but it's slow pace wears you down after a bit. \n\nOverall, Life of Pi is unlike other survival films. It's more emotional and beautiful than Castaway. It captures more grand natural storms than The Perfect Storm. It rivals the exotic spirit of The Adventures of Tintin. I'd also say Life of Pi took some of Scorsese's magical fantasy tone and style from Hugo and brought it a new life. Life of Pi is therefore similar to many movies, but a refreshing experience all its own. The visual stimulation is sure to entertain most audiences unless you just don't like tigers.",

As such, there is no collective \"message\" to take away from this film.  Each viewer is left to decide for themselves how they wish to interpret it.

            "content": "As a deer living in a human world, I often view movies differently from conventional human audiences. In animal movies especially, I understand both the human and animal perspectives and reflect on how accurately the scripts portray real-world human-animal relations. Most movies merely treat animals as, well, animals, and fail to properly represent their complex interests and ambitions (I'm looking at you, Jaws). Other films, like Bambi, do the opposite: the human is diminished to some dark, hulking monster who seemingly exists for the sole purpose of murdering innocent forest creatures.\n\nAng Lee's Life of Pi, however, is different. It doesn't follow the traditional human-animal archetypes or fall into the common tropes of its predecessors; the animals are neither mindless nor helpless and the humans are neither bloodthirsty nor in total control. Instead, both Richard Parker, the tiger, and Pi, the human, are treated as equals. Both man and beast become trapped in the middle of nowhere and the odds are stacked against them. Despite their differences, they face the same looming threat of death. They realize that they need each other to survive.\n\nThe unique relationship between the two protagonists is so refreshing because it forces Richard Parker and Pi to understand each other. It is not a mere tale of human-animal companionship, but a challenge to the conventional wisdom of human and animal identity. Pi sees himself in Richard Parker, who, in the vast nothingness of the Pacific Ocean, is the only being with whom Pi can share his fears, hopes, and feelings. Richard Parker resists the predatory instincts that made him almost kill Pi as a child, even though Pi represents the only source of food available on the boat for much of the movie.\n\nThough the movie isn't based on true events, it combats the very real and pervasive ignorance that separates humans and their animal counterparts. Before moving into the human world, I didn't know just how caring and gentle humans could be. However, while doing deliveries for Legendary Whitetails, I have experienced countless interactions with them that warmed my heart; a grandfather buying a camp hoodie for his grandson's first hunt, a husband buying his wife a vest to keep her warm in the winter, an old lady inviting me inside for some celery and water. Spending time with humans has allowed me to better understand them, and I believe that no movie better promotes that concept than Life of Pi.",

Richard Parker and all.\nThe ship sinks in a storm and Pi ends up alone on a lifeboat with some of the animals, a zebra, hyena I think and Richard Parker.\nThe castaways are at sea for what seems an eternity and even stop off on on a deserted island before finally being rescued 227 days later in Mexico (22/7=Pi) get it.\nFeaturing excellent use of CGI. I mean how else would a Benghal tiger be shown in a lifeboat?\nI usually hate the practice of CGI and 3D films but on this occasion it is fully understandable and technicalkt brilliant.\nThe film won several Oscar awards including Best Director for Ang Lee on release.

Unfortunately, it seems people were too hyped about the visual effects, and ignored what is, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told. It is the story of Pi, and the 227 days he spent stranded out at sea after the ship he was on sunk. More importantly, though, it's a story of faith, proof, perception, reality, the darkness of man, and religion. If you accept the second story to be true, it is a movie where you get to see the character interact with a much darker aspect of himself that he never new before, and how he at first violently rejects it out of fear, but ends up needing it and loving it. And then there is the aspect of faith --  which story really was true? Does  even it matter, as the outcome is the same either way? The movie asks us that question - does it matter? At the end, Pi poses both stories. He notes that neither story can be proven, as no one really knows what happened. So in the end, it is only a matter of what we, the viewers, liked better. What the better story was. And really, that's what a story is - what we choose when there is no proof either way. This is where the movie connects with religion. Is it a proof God exists? Absolutely not. But it does point out something profound about religion - since we cannot prove either way whether God exists or not, the best thing we can do is choose which reality we prefer - a world with God, or a world without God. It tells us it is irrelevant what the truth is you can't prove it either way. This movie has the usual components of a great movie - great performances, stunning visuals, etcetera, but what it has, more than any other movie ever made, is an incredibly stunning and revealing story that makes you think. It is a relatively lighthearted, PG picture about a boy befriending a tiger. But that is what is only what is on screen. Dig deeper, and it is quite possibly a story about a boy who survives by eating off of the rotting carcass of a man he murdered. You decide. I have decided this is the best and most important film ever made.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Ang Lees Life Of Pi ist eine fast übernatürliche Leistung, eine Geschichte zu erzählen und ein bahnbrechendes Experiment visueller Kunst. Ang Lee gelang es, über einen Roman zu triumphieren, der als unverfilmbar galt - darüber hinaus ist sein Life Of Pi von so ehrlicher Spiritualität, dass es nicht untertrieben ist, zu behaupten, dass hier ein Film über das Leben an sich kommt! 227 Tage lang trieb ein Junge gemeinsam mit einem bengalischen Tiger im Ozean. Nach einem witzigen Prolog, der auch das Zeug dazu hätte, einen Familienfilm einzuleiten, finden sie sich auf demselben Boot wieder und das stellt die Überleitung zu einer Parabel übers Überleben, gegenseitiger Akzeptanz und Anpassung dar. Vielleicht hat sogar der Roman-Autor Yann Martel selbst gestaunt, wie die Hollywood Maschine von Lees eigenwilliger Poesie verdrängt wurde? Alles beginnt in einem Familienzoo in Pondichery, Indien. Hier wächst ein Junge namens Piscine (Suraj Sharma) auf. Sein Spitzname ist \"Pee\" und darauf wird dann \"Pi\". Pi ist die Nummer ohne Begrenzung und genauso kann man auch Pis Leben beschreiben. Doch der Zoo geht Pleite und Pis Vater überführt die Familie und einige Tiere auf einem Schiff nach Kanada. Für Pi ist das nicht ungefährlich, denn die Tiere des Zoos, vor allem der bengalische Tiger mit dem Namen \"Mr. Parker\", sind wirklich wild und kein bisschen vermenschlicht. Das Herz des Films ist natürlich die Passage auf dem weiten Meer, in welcher der Mensch beweist, wie er erfinderisch denken kann und der Tiger, dass er imstande ist, zu lernen. Ich möchte aber nicht zuviel verraten. Interessant die Perspektive der Kamera, die auf dem Boot installiert wurde. Life Of Pi legt keinen Wert auf Einstellungen, die Beiden verloren auf dem Meer zu zeigen. Life Of Pi handelt davon, wie Mensch und Tier das Boot teilen. Sicher, der Tiger könnte den Jungen verdrängen, doch es gelingt Pi, dem Tier beizubringen, dass es klüger ist, das nicht zu tun. Irgendwann beginnt der Tiger, den Jungen nicht mehr als \"Beute\" oder \"Master\" anzusehen, sondern als ein Lebewesen, dass eben auch auf dem Boot existiert. Lee verbindet hier ganz still einige religiöse Ansätze, so dass die Geschichte auch den Wunder des Lebens offenbart: Wie herrlich, dass sie überhaupt da sind; der Mensch, der Tiger, die Fische zwischen ihnen und die Vögel um sie herum. Noch wonniger wird dieses Gefühl, wenn eine schwimmende Insel voller Erdmännchen auf sie zu treibt... An dieser Stelle habe ich mich gefragt, ob das überhaupt noch real sei? Ist der Film wirklich? Doch die Frage muss bejaht werden: Life Of Pi ist real und hinterlässt so einige Eindrücke, die jeder auf seine Weise verarbeiten darf.",

            "content": "The main character in Ang Lee's Life of Pi claims to have a story that'll make you believe in God. To say that's true would be to overstate its impact, but there is something miraculous about the film as a whole. Life of Pi was filmed on the water with a first-time actor playing against a 100% CGI tiger. That's crazy, but hell, it works.\n\nIt's a half hour into the film before the ship carrying Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), his family, and the family's many zoo animals sinks to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. During those first 30 minutes, we meet an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan). He lives in Canada-his family's intended destination those many years ago-where a writer (Rafe Spall) is asking him to recount his story.\n\nIt's a tragic, but inspiring one. Pi is the only human survivor of the shipwreck, but he's not alone. He's forced to share his small lifeboat with a large Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Pi is able to construct a small raft that he keeps tethered to the boat-in order to keep some space between he and Richard Parker-but more than anything, he feels betrayed. Pi has tried to lead a pious life. As a child, he shopped around for the right religion and, having not found one he liked above all others, he cherry picked his favorite aspects of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. So why would God do this to him? Why would He take away Pi's family? Leave him to die on the ocean? Sic a hungry and cranky tiger on him?\n\nThere's no question the most compelling material in Life of Pi occurs after the shipwreck and before we flash back to adult Pi in Canada. By framing the film the way he does, Lee strips away any doubt we might have about the outcome of Pi's journey. That said, it's still packed with suspense. Or maybe it's an overwhelming sense of wonder. Regardless, both the visualization of this journey and its actual substance will, on multiple occasions, take your breath away.\n\nThen, there's that framing device. It's more a momentum killer than a film killer. I didn't object to the questions adult Pi raises in the film's closing minutes. Quite the opposite, in fact. But the material leading up to the shipwreck (which itself is more understated than you might expect) tends to drag, and the material after his journey feels tacked on. As for the structure itself, it's hackneyed to say the least.\n\nThere's no topping the visuals in this film, however, and any trepidation one might have about the story or its structure should be allayed by the film's stunning special effects and cinematographer Claudio Miranda's choice of shots. Just the palette Lee uses-its brilliant orange sunrises and cool silver moonlight-will make your jaw drop. The tiger, however, is the film's calling card. It's extraordinarily realistic, and the way young Suraj Sharma interacts with this invisible creature is also noteworthy.\n\nHis entire performance, in fact, deserves praise. He's asked to carry the film on his shoulders through its most inherently compelling moments, and when all is said and done, he succeeds at doing just that. At times, he'll move you to tears. And yes, there are moments when his inexperience rears its ugly head, but the good here more than outweighs the bad. Without him, the film wouldn't work. That its such a success is as much a testament to him as it is to Ang Lee or anyone else involved.\n\nLife of Pi isn't exactly \"pro-faith,\" but it does ultimately give its viewers a choice between two competing, but unequal (within the context of the movie) philosophies. It's refreshing, though, to see a film speak to something like faith when so many big Hollywood pictures tiptoe around it or ignore it completely. Life of Pi's screenplay (courtesy of David Magee and based on the novel of the same name by Yann Martel) definitely isn't its biggest asset, but in this respect, it's admirable.\n\nMychael Danna's score is among the best in 2012, and the way Pi's entire journey is edited together contributes a welcome rhythm to the film as a whole. Ultimately, it's just an expertly crafted motion picture on almost every level, but should we expect anything less from someone like Lee? He's proven time and time again that he can turn any type of story into something special, and Life of Pi might be one of his best.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/life-of-pi-review/",

But after I heard a lot of positive reviews on this movie, I was tempted to watch this movie.. And after I spent almost 2 hours watching this movie, I must gave a big two thumbs up to Ang Lee for making a beautiful visualization of this novel.. Suraj Sharma also make a great and quite impressive performance for his Hollywood debut performance as Pi Patel.. Overall, the Oscars that this movie got shows us how great the quality of this movie had..",

            "content": "\"Life of Pi\" is a breathtaking movie directed by Ang Lee. With his experience in directing box office hit movies like The Hulk and Brokeback Mountain, this Taiwanese- born American director received an Academy Award for \"Best Achievement in Directing'. Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi' revolves around the story of Pi Patel who was stranded in the middle of the ocean for 227 days and spent most of his time on a lifeboat with Richard Parker. Going further into the story takes one on an adventure of a lifetime where determination, struggle and the acknowledgement of fear are all necessary in order to survive.\n\nThe story begins with a writer who visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel in Canada and asks him to share his life story. Pi starts his story right in the beginning as a child who lived in Pondicherry, India (French part of India). Back then, Pi and his family owned a zoo but due to several reasons the government decided to not support the zoo operation. This left Pi and his family with no choice but to move to Canada, where they would be able to sell the animals owned by the family. \nPi and his family board on a Japanese cargo ship along with their animals, while sailing through the ship soon loses control and is wrecked due to the harsh weather. Pi in his quest to survive, manages to survive on lifeboat with an Orangutan, a Tiger and a Hyena. Stranded in the middle of the ocean, Pi's struggle to survive with limited supplies and with the fear that the animals on the boat may at any time cause his death represents a large part of his story. Later on, Pi is able to miraculously survive and reach a Mexican beach 227 days after being stranded in the middle of the ocean.\n\nSuraj Sharma, an Indian actor who made his debut in this movie, played Pi Petal. As the guardian would comment, \"It would be an exaggeration, says Suraj Sharma with a laugh, to describe what he did in the adaptation of Life of Pi as \"acting\", despite the admiration he is swiftly accumulating for his role as Piscine Patel, the boy stranded on a lifeboat for 227 days with a Bengal tiger.\" In order to better synchronize with his character as Pi Petal; Suraj also needed to experience the drastic weight loss that Pi experienced on a life boat for 227 days. Also, Sharma says, \"it was all just real, I was just trying to survive, tired and didn't know what to do\". Understanding the situation and the very detailed setting of the story, the shooting of the Life of Pi was made to seem as real as possible further proving how great Ang Lee is as being one of the best directors in turning fantasy into reality. Furthermore, it was really brave of Suraj Sharma in taking this leading role considering his inexperience with big screen movies. Pushing on from this, Pi would later on star in Disney's movie \"Million Dollar Arm\". Since then, he has continued to amazed with his capabilities as Sharma's fame continue to grow.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" presents one of the best cinematography viewers had seen. Through this Claudia Miranda won the 2013 Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The movie revolved around the mix of fantasy and adventure. The movie also presented advance special effect shots including the CGI Bengal tiger \"Richard Parker\" who played a big part as one of the main characters in the movie. Miranda says, \"yet capturing its epic essence in a way that would match the unbelievable CGI being prepared.\" Hence in order to capture this imagination, this movie was shot in an abandoned airport in Taiwan and furthermore, in order to replicate the ocean, a 1.7 million gallon behemoth was produced and represents the world's largest self-generating wave tank. In addition, various lights coming from different angles were used to make sure the shots taken were as detailed as possible. The New York Film Academy says; a giant door was created to allow the actual sunset to light the tank every day at dusk, allowing the indoor ocean to be shot during the magic hour. Since this movie requires a tremendous effort and money, Ang Lee decided to shoot this movie in 3D as well to make it more factual; which is a huge gamble since the use 3D technology was known to not be perfect as yet during that time. But he insisted, because he believed that the power of the ocean and its movements could be more accurately captured. In addition, many of the film's most astonishing images were animated in a computer but Ang lee, Miranda and the cinematography team managed to make it believable for the viewers. By combining both science and creativity this movie successfully made fantasy come to life.\n\nThe Life of Pi was also able to integrate various religious views in its attempt to dig deeper into the real understanding of life. These views were projected by the animals stranded on the life boat with Pi. An example of this was when Pi was stranded in the middle of the ocean and suddenly caught a fish for his supper. Immediately, he says, \"Thank you Wishnu (Hindu God) for helping me in the form of fish.\" \"Life of Pi\" is not a true story but Ang Lee made it so real and believable in the eyes of the viewers. I do recommend this film to everybody who would like to experience the magical fantasy and adventure. For me, this movie was one of the best produced in 2012 and I personally find it enjoyable for both adults and children.",

La storia del ragazzo naufrago insieme ad una tigre è solo un pretesto per esprimere un messaggio molto più profondo, un intreccio tra scienza e religione che sfiora temi filosofici estremamente complessi, che nessun film osa neanche sfiorare. E non è tutto, vi è anche una profonda riflessione riguardo all'essere umano in generale, e ai suoi conflitti con sé stesso. Se tutti questi temi vengono sorretti da una regia delicata e poetica come quella di Ang Lee, effetti speciali sbalorditivi e un comparto tecnico pressoché perfetto, allora il risultato è un film completo, che raggiunge a pieno titolo la perfezione. Si tratta di un'opera d'arte immensa e parzialmente sottovalutata, che merita di essere ricordata come uno dei migliori film mai concepiti.",

I feel like I'm watching a Man vs. Wild episode, rather than a story trying to make me believe in the \"Almighty God\". This boy transform from a Hindu, to a Christian, then turns to Allah. Then at the end he believe in all.

The Bengal tiger element adds an element of danger, unfamiliar tension, and sublime beauty that is hard to compare it with.\nThere are also several sequences full of stunning beauty and power. The sinking of the ship, for instance, is a remarkably powerful visual moment, and Pi's reflection on the role of loss in human existence is emotive and potent.

The cast includes Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, and Rafe Spall.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" follows the story of a young Indian boy named, Pi Patel. As a young boy, Pi was heavily made fun of. That is, until he showed his fellow students how sublime he was at mathematics. Because of his birthplace in India, Pi grew up with hundreds if not thousands of Indian gods. When he became a young man, he decided to explore three of the main world religions; Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. His comfortable life in India comes to and end when Pi's father decides to move the family to Canada. Selling their land, but keeping their animals, Pi's family board a ship for Canada. During a furious storm, the ship is overtaken by the towering waves. Pi is left in the open seas, with nothing but a life boat and a tiger.\n\nOne of the films biggest themes is the importance of spirituality. Pi's father was the voice of reason in his life. He taught him to use his head and to think. His mother reminded him that spirituality would help him from within and give him hope. As Pi explores different religions, he learns what he can from them. The result is an extremely thought provoking film that makes one appreciate certain aspects of religion. Whether or not certain claims made by religious beliefs are true or not doesn't matter. At least, not to the one who believes them. It's about the feeling of hope and meaning.\n\nVisually, this is one of the most stunning films I've ever seen. The CGI is really something to behold. While it's sad knowing so much of what you're seeing is fake, it's still something to marvel at. The cinematography is also beautiful. Each shot is like a brilliant painting playing before your eyes.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" is a beautiful visual masterpiece directed wonderfully by Ang Lee. It explores deep life themes like spiritually, love, and wonder. The score by Michael Danna is emotionally resonate, and the performances are top notch.",

The effects are a masterpiece which created the most realistic tiger ever which I'm glad that it got some accolades for it. the movie develops the main character well which I'm glad because it's a main step for making the survival movie very interesting, and actually make me care for the main character. Ang Lee did a fantastic job directing this and it could've been so shaky that I wouldn't be able to know what's going on. David Magee also did a great job of writing the movie which the consensus say that the book is \"unfilmable\". As an added bonus, I saw the movie in 3D, and it's the best 3D I have ever seen in a movie which more movies hold be like this.

Even this week, as I started to play the HD version on the TV at home something made me wonder if this was to be much worse than I had even expected, and I had expected it to be a piece of over-hyped part mediocrity at best.\n\nHow wrong I was!!! Oh thank God, thank God. Relief is just steaming from my pores.\n\nWhat a great film. I haven't seen a better made film for so many years.\n\nThe plot is just one of the best, the concept makes it one of the best films ever made - but Life of Pi may surely be within one of the top three best films ever produced for its ability to take the idea and script and make the most wonderful piece of cinematic theatre from it.\n\nIt's just simply sublime. Here is one of the very few best films ever made.\n\nLiterally, it's really, really wonderful. And so intelligent, with that - how often do we get genuinely intelligent films with a great deal of effort behind that intelligence? \n\nLife of Pi is a really rare entity.

It begins with an adult Pi dictating his life story to an author searching for material for his new book. The author has been told that Pi's story will make you believe in god.

Despite the objections of his wife Jita (Tabu) and his young son Pi (Suraj Sharma), both are obligated to accept the idea due to the father's insistence and the eldest son RaviÃ¢ÂÂ(TM)s (Vibish Sivakumar) enthusiasm. The father takes the animals he owns along with his family on the ship but the ship sinks and all the passengers die except for Pi who shelters in the lifeboat along with a tiger called Richard Parker. Both go on to undertake an epic journey together.\n\nLife of Pi is a wonderful human and visual experience that moisturizes the eye and spirit against the harshness surrounding us which is full of ugliness. The experience of watching the young Pi manage to stop his colleagues making fun of his name and make them all call him the \"miracle of the school\" makes the heart happy. The film also provides a spiritual tranquility as we join the teenager Pi in his search for God along mysterious paths, whether on the land among Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, or in the ocean among hurricanes, waves and fish. Moreover, a lesson of the film is that the \"will to survive\" can overcome the mightiness of the sea, the ferocity of the tiger and the horror of an island that swallows the flesh of both humans and animals.\n\nLife of Pi's coherent structure by writer David Magee is based on playing among three ideas competing with each other. Finding out how the film answers the questions raised by each idea thrills, and ignites curiosity. The first idea: Pi as a child and a teenager. What future for the miracle child? How will fate make this experience a turning point in his life? How will the lessons he was taught by his parents - despite their different approaches and their basic experiences- help him in the future? The second idea: Pi's Journey in the ocean, and what kept him alive? How will the relationship with the tiger turn gradually from a relation between a human prey and a wild animal to a peaceful companionship? The third idea: the lessons that Pi the adult Ã¢ÂÂ\" perfectly played by Irfan Khan- will pass to his children? What will be his perspective in narration when he tells it to a writer who came from Canada to record his journey in a true story book told by its real main character?\n\nPi sailed for more than 280 days in the ocean carried by a lifeboat, while the audience may sail in the film with Pi through 127 minutes carried by a great soundtrack by Michael Danna. No doubt Andy LeeÃ¢ÂÂ(TM)s masterpiece will remain one of his best for the broad minded interpretation and great work he has done on a wonderful story.\n\n \n\nSummarization for my article published on Albedaiah.com on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.albedaiah.com/node/15784",

This is when the story switches to Pi's past when he lives in India with his family on a zoo. He describes his life as a curious child and his search for religion. He then explains how his family decides to move to Canada and sell all their animals there. They then pack up everything and began to sail in the Pacific Ocean. At this time a storm is occurring and sinks the ship, taking away all the passengers, including his family and most of the animals aboard. Pi is stranded on lifeboat alone with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a tiger, but eventually they all die off leaving Pi alone with a tiger. Pi has to try and survive alone with this tiger, while he is fighting for his own life. Throughout this time he is asking God many questions and debating his faith. He as he is about to give up and accept his fate to die, but then he hits land and he is saved and the tiger leaves him. Reporters about the wreck then question Pi, and when he tells the story, they do not believe him. They demand the truth and he tells a story of the animals actually being people and how they actually were the ones to kill each other. Pi then told them to pick the story that is preferred and the story with the tiger was what the reporters wrote about.\n\tI give the movie Life of Pi four and a half stars out of five because this is a movie I will never forget; there is no other movie like this one. The cinematography is beautiful; most of the scenes are computer generated, but the picture is marvelous and feels realistic. The way they set up the places is just shocking and made them as beautiful as a dream. Of course the animals were computer generated as well, but they appeared completely real. Especially the tiger, we are up close and personal to the tiger multiple times in the movie and he appears to be real as the actor who plays Pi. There is no possibility of being let down by the cinematography in this movie because of the beauty on the scene.\nThe script is mostly all in English and is put together quite well. The casting on this movie is spot on; I applaud the actor Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, all the way. I do not think they could pick anyone better because he brings life to his character. Suraj is also one of the only main characters that is actually alive and not computer generated, seeing that the focus is mostly on him and the animals in the raft. The soundtrack and effects that are applied in the movie add to the magic and fit in the story perfectly. This storyline was like no other movie I have seen before. I was practically glued to the screen the entire movie and was kept on the edge of my seat. \nI believe the message that is sent to the viewers is that there is more than one way to view any situation. Pi tells two different stories, and he says to pick the one you like better. He involves God in the one with the tiger and he just tells the other story straight, plain, and simple. The story that makes you feel better and have a better outlook on the situation is the one where he is not alone and he has the tiger with him. The other story he is alone and no one is there with him. I do not see this as the filmmakers throwing faith and religion at me, but more just telling a story.  The tiger represents Pi in the story, and his struggle with himself and the situation. The tiger is how he sees himself and this movie allows the audience to interpret how to hear the story. Life of Pi is a touching movie that is a game changer in the cinematography field.",

            "content": "1.\tAbove all else: don't lost hope. That is a sentence that rings true in this unlikely survivor story. Based on Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi, director Ang Lee takes the story of a young Indian boy who braves an ocean for 227 days and turns it into a visually stunning, spectacular story that falls just short of being as humanly touching as it sets out to be. Although the main character of the story is our unlikely hero who goes by the name of Pi (Suraj Sharma), the main character of the film is, unarguably, the stunningly beautiful and over-the-top visual effects. That is not to say the story takes a backseat to the visual nature of the film, the story, as witnessed by the success of the novel it is based on, has much to say against a beautiful backdrop. \n2.\tStraight off the bat, Ang Lee and his production team let us know that we are in for one of the most visually beautiful films of 2012. The film opens with a cozy story about a city in former French-India called Pondicherry and Pi's early life within that city. In the beginning of the review I mentioned that this is a survivor's story but for the first 45 minutes of the film, viewers are given a \"cute\" story about Pi's upbringing. The first segment of the story is a description of Pi's early life. We are given stories of his name change from Piscine Molitor Patel to just Pi due to his fellow classmates teasing him by calling him \"pissing\". From this we are taken on Pi's personal spiritual journey. He starts off as a Hindu who fell in love with Jesus and then Islam due to its calming nature. Spirituality is indeed a very large theme in the film. As a character, Pi shows his adventurous traits when he sneaks into the back of his father's zoo but his playful attitude is extinguished when his father teaches him a very harsh lesson about \"animals being just animals\" whereas Pi protests that they have a soul. This moment in the film is one of the first pivotal scenes as the whole idea of an animal having a human soul is one of the main talking points of the second segment of the movie.\n3.\tNear the 45 minute mark of the film, we see the most important scene in which Pi and his family's ship sinks into the ocean near Mariana's Trench. At this point is when the survivor aspect and the longest segment of the film begin. After the disaster, the sole survivors are Pi, Richard Parker (his tiger companion), an orang-utan, a hyena and an injured zebra. Besides Pi and Richard Parker, the other animals are done away with quite quickly and so begins the survivor's tale. Ang Lee knows that this is the part of the film that audiences are going to lap up since it is this part of the story viewers' love to experience. An unlikely character that overcomes his fears and survives in the face of total death. The visual effects at this part are milked to a point where they might be seen as gimmicky by the more attentive viewer. The beautiful scenes of the ocean looking as vast as outer space and especially one scene with a phosphorescent whale lunging out of the water makes for stunning scenes but adds little to the story. \n4.\tEven though these scenes maybe intense and involving for the viewer, we are given short breaks in the form of an adult Pi, played by the masterful Irfan Khan, explaining the story to an author played by Rafe Spall. These breaks allow audiences to digest the chaotic ocean and the relationship between Richard Parker and Pi. Our hero is remarkably resourceful in his quest to survive by building a raft while maintaining his distant but central relationship with the tiger. Richard Parker serves to be Pi's company at sea and the film utilizes the relationship quite masterfully. We are not in for a sappy, tearful birth of a beautiful friendship between animal and human but rather a cautious journey which never allows the audience to forget that Richard Parker is a dangerous animal and Pi never shows an overt amount of sentimentality towards the animal. The theme of spirituality also makes important appearances during this segment of the film such as when Pi catches a fish and thanks Hindu Lord Vishnu for appearing in a form of this animal so he could stave of his and Richard Parker's hunger. While the spirituality running through this film is endearing, it does start turning into almost a parody when Pi screams to the skies to let God know that whatever comes he will still love him.\n5.\tAfter his 227 day journey, Pi 's story enters the third and most disappointing segment of the film. At this point, he reaches the shores of Mexico during which Richard Parker leaves him very unceremoniously. Pi was destroyed by not gaining some sort of closure from his companion who displays Pi's father's initial point that animals are merely animals that do not have human souls. Pi gets picked up in his weakened state and is taken to a hospital where he has to recite a more believable story to a Japanese insurance company, changing all the animals that were on the boat into human characters such as his mother, the cook and the Buddhist sailor. The reason I say this segment is disappointing is that there is no visual representation of Pi's second story even if it could have a short montage. It felt cheap and awkwardly placed in a film with such visual grandeur. It's almost as if Ang Lee and his production team burned through the budget creating the splendours of the other two segments and could not work this part into the film.  \n6.\tAs a comment on Suraj Sharma's acting, I do wish he had won some accolades for his performance. His interaction with a CG Richard Parker was incredible, really helping the audience believe that the tiger was real. It doesn't hurt that visually the tiger looked authentic. Besides his interaction with Richard Parker, he has incredibly poignant moments such as when he tells Richard Parker that both of them are dying. Additionally, Sharma being the only actor for the majority of the movie, he carries the film incredibly well without interacting with other human beings. The only flaw I find with the acting is in Rafe Spall. While listening to the adult Pi reciting the story, he usually had a confused look on his face as if he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Being a minor character in the film, it can be overlooked. \n7.\tTo conclude, the most noticeable part of this production are the visual effects which carries the story. The scenes carry the story rather than the story carrying the scenes. This begs the question though, should we care? This film is a whole product visually; acting wise and even while the story isn't in the foreground it is still quite important. This film is meant to be experienced rather than just watched. Ang Lee set out to make a beautiful movie that would stun audiences and he succeeded in making an above average summer blockbuster packed with substance. I give this movie a B+.",

Much like religions way of explaining things of believing in the impossible this is a film that is asking for our attention to where we think it wouldn't be necessary. Where there are certain characters who generally met and never see again wondering what purpose did they serve and was there any significants behind them and if you are able to finish the journey, you find the emotional scenes are no way forced into the films narrative arc in which left to the audience for their interpretation for what the characters are to them . Ang Lee managed to pull off the impossible by showing the impossible by using visual effects and showing certain through symbolism and metaphors it gives an emotional ride of what does certain things mean to the individual by asking not do we believe in god but what do we believe.",

            "content": "I have seen this film 3 times now, and each time I go in I think maybe this film would have lose its power on me but it surprises me and keeps me locked in with every single viewing. Life of Pi is definitely Ang Lee's masterpiece.\n\nLife of Pi is essentially a film that tackles the power of spirituality and rationality of life. Pi is a young man starts off as a boy who found spirituality, following not one but at least three as his curiosity and the depth of religion have attracted him to a perspective that gave his life meaning; but his father kept him grounded to reality, teaching him that rationality and science unlocks the meaning and progression of life. Then suddenly he and his family have to move away from India, sailing by boat to Canada. When the boat sinks, Pi was able to keep himself alive in a lifeboat with a tiger, orangutan, hyena and a zebra. He is then left to try and survive in the isolated ocean, while also undertaking a journey that would open his perspective of the meaning of life.\n\nPi's life before the accident has been empty as his family, particularly his father, has wiped away the one thing that made his life seem beautiful and filled with a sense of purpose. When the accident happened, he was sent out to face the dangers of the world, which required him to survive by making decisions based on either spirituality or rationality. His journey is a fight of two different life values, and the winner would determine how he would then live his life when he returns safely.\n\nPi's feelings during this journey go back and forth. There are times where he believes that the animals he is on board with have souls and are equal in value. Other times he follows the principles of nature which required him to set an order of hierarchy and allow Richard Parker to learn his place, which is below him. Pi learns that life isn't led by one set of values and one can gain the best of both worlds in order to survive in this world. I myself can relate to his struggles, as I am at a crossroads in my life where two of the most important figures in my life have given me paths to choose from. Unlike Pi though, I am still in the middle of my journey, taking in things around me that would eventually shape me the person I would be later on.\n\nPi near the end of his journey reaches to an island that saved his life, but figures out that the island is a carnivorous organism and the longer he stays; the less likely he is able to get out of there alive. This part of the film wasn't clear to me during my two previous viewings. The way I see this scene, is that Pi was saved by god and that he was presented with paradise, but nothing in this world is ever that wonderful, and the more he indulges himself in it, the more likely he would die from it; kind of like alcohol and drugs, one gets a sense of euphoria during the first few times of consumption but with prolonged use one starts to deteriorate.\n\nThe film's third act provides the audience with two stories that one could decide which one sounds more appealing. The first story is remarkable but logic is not of great importance, while the second tale details a realistic side of the story. Both tales actually sound appropriate for me, but the film gives us a choice on which story we would believe. Is everything we were just shown actually the truth, or was it manipulated by his hallucinations and delusions, using symbolism in order to cope with the stress of the situation. I couldn't let myself choose which the definitive tale is, as my current position in life and the values I follow determine my decision.\n\nAng Lee provides us with drop dead gorgeous visuals but he doesn't allow it to overwhelm the film's story and ideas, instead it is present to support it. Most of my feelings towards the film were sparked by these visuals and without it; the film wouldn't have been able to get the film's ideas across. If one is just planning to watch this film at a superficial level, the visuals are enough to keep your attention locked and be amazed. The film also features a memorable score that elevated the film's story, creating this gentle and touching atmosphere that, again like the visuals, supported the film's deep themes.\n\nThe acting in this film was powerful with an impressive performance from Suraj Sharma. I never expected someone who was new to the profession to be this great. I developed this sense of connection with the character and his issues, and a lot of the credit goes towards the acting. I know the tiger in this film was for the most part in CGI but the artists did a wonderful job in making him come to life. I was actually able to connect with a tiger that doesn't speak any dialogue, I felt every single emotion that the tiger was trying to convey and it just astonishes me that the film was able to do this. Hats off to the team responsible for making this character come to life.\n\nI don't want to give this review a long and detailed conclusion, instead I'm just going to write a short sentence that summarises my feelings towards the film. Life of Pi is a beautiful and powerful film.",

            "content": "Life of Pi is one of those movies that is wonderful to watch, but would have seemed even more brilliant if I had not read the source material beforehand. As a lover of Yann Martel's unforgettable novel, I found this film adaption leaning too heavily on computer-generated spectacle intensifying the sinking ship, the rolling sea waves, and the initial cat-and-mouse encounters between Pi and Richard Parker. Thank goodness the quality of CG effects was brilliant, as otherwise this film would have felt like a cartoon. Rhythm & Hues, the late special effects studio in charge of the numerous simulated animals and environments produced some of their best work to date; I was truly convinced that Richard Parker was a living, breathing Bengal Tiger after Pi's throat. In turn, the colorful psychedelic sequences of color and light were also a wonder to behold, even though a certain night scene featuring glowing jellyfish and algae screamed \"Let's cash in on Avatar's Pandora.\"  Ang Lee did a fine job handling the narration, with the back-and-forth interplay from present to past; Martel's writing was too good to leave out, and the best of the novel's written passages were incorporated into Pi's retelling, down to the spot-on perfect final conversation he has with the two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport. This shocking revelation of the symbolic nature of the zoo animals was by far the best part of the film (and novel) and it ended the film in a satisfying and melancholy manner. As far as an emotional ride, Life of Pi scaled back the spiritual and emotional journey of Pi lost at sea; I never got the sense that the boy was stranded on sea for 230 days, as he looked and acted like he was lost for 2 or 3 months. My favorite part of the novel, which was the humorous three-way fight between the Christian, Hindu, and Muslim priests, was left absent. Even more frustrating is the absence of Pi's conversation with Richard Parker; this was a total, complete missed opportunity, as CG could have been used very well to create a talking Bengal tiger. Suraji Sharma, who played Pi, and Irrfan Khan, who portrayed Pi's adult-self, were very well acted and memorable. I wish I could say the same thing about Rafe Spall, whose overly-amazed interjections stuck out like a sore thumb.",

            "content": "\"I much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly, and that begins with thinking rationally.\"\n\nFor about two years I've heard massive acclaim on a film titled Life of Pi, directed by acclaimed (and sometimes controversial) filmmaker Ang Lee and based on a novel considered to be unfilmable, and with a story involving a boy and a tiger, it's easy to see why I was skeptical of the film, especially when the tiger would obviously have to be a CGI creation. And even after looking at the massive acclaim on the film and the awards it got, I was still a little skeptical, even though I was growing slightly more interested the more I heard the film's name. And now it's been two years since Life of Pi has been released and I've finally had the chance to see Life of Pi. Is it worth its hype? Well, coming from someone who missed out on super acclaimed 3D showings, even on a flatscreen TV, I was still very impressed with this remarkable motion picture.\n\nPi Patel (Suraj Sharma) is just a young man living in India who struggles to figure out what he wants to be in life. His father (Adil Hussain) runs a popular zoo and the only interest Pi has is religion, particularly Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. The family, in hope for a better life, leaves India and travels with the zoo animals by boat to  Canada, but a ferocious storm shows up, and Pi is the one survivor of the shipwreck. Stranded all alone on a lifeboat with a couple of surviving animals, particularly a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, Pi has to figure out how to survive at sea and find ways to control the tiger before he gets eaten.\n\nThe film also stars Irfan Khan as the adult Pi, who's telling his life story to a writer, played by Rafe Spall.\n\nLife of Pi is a remarkable moviemaking achievement. The digital cinematography is simply stunning, particularly shots at sea, which is actually a tank in Taiwan (but still impresses even if you didn't know that), and the visuals are mind blowing, some of the most realistic and convincing CGI in recent years. The detail on the tiger is made so strong that in many scenes, I thought it WAS an actual tiger on the boat with Suraj Sharma. While I missed the film in 3D, the film still managed to impress me visually even in 2D, , and there were some scenes that still managed to make me feel like I was watching it in the third dimension, such as a scene involving flying fish.\n\nWith a lot of these acclaimed digital films, main criticism has been that the visuals play the main role, and the story is weak, and that's a common criticism in films like Avatar (which I loved) and Gravity (which I have not seen yet). But in Life of Pi, the story is just as powerful as the visuals. Anyone that's had to suffer so much as the main character can easily relate to what Pi is going through, though maybe not as life threatening, and Suraj Sharma acts brilliantly. Even though its been two years since Life of Pi's release, it seems like he still hasn't gotten recognition for this film, and that's a shame, because Sharma has one of the strongest performances I've seen in a child actor, in most cases, acting more like a young adult than a kid, and that's what's great about his performance. If Sharma doesn't appear in more films, then Hollywood is missing a golden opportunity. What also surprised me was the religious aspect of the film, where Pi discovers God while in his situation. Even if you're not that religious, I think anyone can watch Life of Pi and still find strong emotions out of the overall message. Also impressive is the film score by Mychael Danna, which is very moving and very mysterious in places.\n\nThe story may have been considered unfilmable, but Ang Lee has made a modern filmmaking masterpiece, one that will definitely be called an essential in the next 30 years or so. The digital filmmaking is likely the most stunning I've witnessed, more so than Avatar and Hugo combined, the visuals are out of the park, and the emotional content delivers. I haven't seen any of Ang Lee's other films, which includes Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or Brokeback Mountain, but even if I do attempt watches of his other acclaimed films, I don't think his other films will top Life of Pi in my book.\n\n\" I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.\"",

Maybe some scenes did use a real tiger; I simply can't tell.\n\nThe plot involves a young east Indian man name Pi (short for Piscine, a name suggested by his swimming pool-obsessed uncle) who is the sole human survivor of a shipwreck while his zoo-owning family was emigrating to Canada with their animals. It turns out that Pi must share his lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Paker. It is never entirely clear whether we are witnessing what Pi remembers (he is telling his story to a writer who wants to document his tale) or hallucinations he experienced while lost at sea and delirious: there are scenes where the lifeboat appears to be floating in a star-filled sky; a strange floating island made of tree roots and populated with meerkats appears late in the film and is certainly unreal.\n\nThe imagery and symbolism are intended to say something about God and why we should believe stories of the miraculous and the amazing. Although the film doesn't entirely succeed in its ambitions, it is a spectacular attempt.",

I feel that the amazing 3D visuals can sometimes detract viewers from the initial storyline since it is after all based on a novel written by Yann Martel. \r\n\r\nIt is called \"The Life Of Pi\" because it is about how this particular East Indian person got this unusual name in the first place, and the adventure he had to endure that went along with it.  'Pi' at first started as an embarrassing name for him which was short from \"Piscine\", but was pronounced as \"Pissing\" which his father named him because he used to love swimming in radiant swimming pools, and one of those pools happens to be his favorite called the 'Piscine Molitor' resulting his son's full name to be 'Pisicine Molitor Patel'.  Piscine then managed to convince his fellow peers to call him 'Pi' after memorizing many numbers before 3.14. And it was about this time his real adventure begins involving being stranded on a small boat with a Bengal tiger whom he calls Richard Parker, since his parents owned some of the animals from the zoo where his parents were renting the property from. \r\n\r\n  All I can say is that the viewing experience would have been better had it been seen on 3D than on 2D since a considerable amount of the sequences are quite visionary.  Some of the little things baffled me such as if Pi initially didn't want the tiger or the hyena for that matter to tag along with him, he did have the opportunity to hit these aggressive animals with his paddle and back into the water.  Movie doesn't really amount to anything except to witness an artificial journey.\r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4",

With the greatest respect to Ang Lee, it just looked like he might have let indulgence take over and produced the worst kind of disconnected cod-introspective rubbish, because he can. I now sit ashamed of my own narrow thinking as I remember what a great movie he made. In fact, I almost hope the arthouse audience at large hated this film for having too much substance. It looks terrific, for a start, and is another positive step for genuinely artistic use of the 3D craze. My other nagging doubt - that I didn't want to spend two hours with an obviously CG tiger that was supposed to be convincing - was allayed as soon as I realised how sparingly it would be used, and how intelligently - Lee's no fool. He did what a director should strive to do and took me out of myself, as did the magnetic Suraj Sharma, sharing with us multiple types of terror as the seemingly doomed drifter - keeping things afloat, if you will. (hopefully you won't) Nothing is repeated, nothing is laboured, a new turn round ever choppy wave. It's a truly exceptional piece of movie directing given to a decent, unmistakably Eastern story that was frankly privileged to get it.",

            "content": "I believe in education. I believe in it the way a man dying of thirst believes in the oasis over the horizon. When students say things to me like, \"Why do I need to learn trigonometry? When will I ever use it?\" I am flabbergasted. It's a fair question, but fundamentally misses the point. Sometimes I ask back, \"Why do you need to learn about God? When will you ever use it?\"\n\nI have to therefore admit that my favorite part of Life of Pi is what film people sometimes call act one, aka 'the setup' or the introduction of the protagonist and the setting and, ultimately, the conflict.\n\nIn Life of Pi's first act, we get to see a boy growing up in a zoo in India and learning about life. On account of his name, shortened to 'pissing' by mocking classmates, he's something of an outcast. Outcastism, however, is not that bad - it frees you from the rules, encourages you to develop your own unique vision of the world.\n\nAs such, we next get to see Pi adopt every religion - first Hinduism, then Christianity, then Islam. His father speaks to him about this, about his own belief in reason and science. His father says to him, \"If you believe in everything, that is the same as believing in nothing.\" We see his father forcing him to watch a tiger maul a gazelle in order to teach Pi about animal ferocity. There is beauty as well.  We see Pi playing drums for a dancing class filled with willowy, graceful young dancers. And ultimately we see Pi aboard a ship as waves crash against it and flip it over and strand him on a life-boat with a zebra, a tiger, a hyena, and an orangutan named Orange Juice.\n\nAct two - the time that Pi spends on the boat, trying to survive - is a visual feast and, I think, the reason for Life of Pi's best film nomination. It deserves it.\n\nBut for my money, it's act one that makes the film.  It celebrates curiosity - that beast simultaneously satiated and whetted by education - and culture and contemplation.\n\nBecause Life of Pi, for all of its rawr! tigers on boats and its glowing krill and its impressively rendered storms (they feel powerful), is a meditative film. Without the underlying meditations on truth and fiction, religion and reason, survival and nobility, there wouldn't have been much to the film. I would love to talk about my thoughts on all of those, but once started, I would never stop. This is ostensibly just a film review. And so:\n\nFinal Say: Life of Pi is a visually stunning tale, beautiful and suspenseful enough to entertain at a superficial level, yet with deep themes of spirituality, morality, and the ancient dichotomy of the harsh truth vs. the noble lie. Thought-provoking AND entertaining is like peanut butter and chocolate - the combination just can't go wrong.\n\nHow to Watch It: With an open-mind and with other persons who have open minds. A dogmatic, whether religious or Atheistic or otherwise aggressively philosophical, personality will not do well with this movie nor in the discussion of it.\n\nTrivia: The actor for Pi (Suraj Sharma) never actually spent any time in a boat with a live tiger. The tiger was CGI most of the time. Kind of disappointing, yknow?",

The film may have a lower budget than other films with stellar visuals, however, the Oscar-winning visuals are incredible, create a sense of beauty and realism, with many tense moments for good measure, and have a convincing look and feel to them.  The film also has elements of a fight to survive, including the rationing of supplies, the way to adjust to surroundings, and the assembly of shelter and storage of supplies.  Pi also has to survive alongside the Bengal tiger named Richard Parker on board with him by earning his trust.  The film has other beneficial qualities, such as Suraj Sharma's incredible portrayal as the 16-year-old Pi fighting for his life out at sea, as well as other great performances from the cast, and David Magee's smartly-written script.  The film also has incredible dramatic depth thanks to the effective connection between Pi and Richard Parker.  This film is one of the best films of 2012, a film worth seeing, and another great book to film adaptation.",

Not only does the cinematography and photography touch you in a special way but also the story.  It brought tears to my eyes as we hear and witness some of the events in this young child's life and how these events have matured and created him today.  The beauty of this film will capture the hearts of many viewers, from teenagers to mature adults. \r\n\r\nThe movie begins with the unraveling of Pi's early childhood and the tragic incident that led to him to be stranded on a boat with a tiger.  It shows how Pi copes while shipwrecked in the middle of an ocean for a long period of time with the tiger.  Although, many believe this is the entire movie, there is much more life and stories captured throughout the movie. \r\n\r\nThe overall theme in the movie is of hope, faith, and survival.  Director Ang Lee and the first time actor who plays Pi capture all of it marvelously, making us feel Pi's experiences for ourselves.  This movie is one that should be watched again and again, and I am sure every time you will find a new layer of symbolism and depth.",

            "content": "*Spoilers ahead* Having already undertaken the difficult adaptations of Jane Austen (Sense & Sensibility) and the even trickier Stan Lee comic book (Hulk), Ang Lee has turned his Oscar-winning directorial eye to Yann Martel's allegorical story of an Indian boy orphaned at sea with a Tiger from his family zoo. Named Richard Parker after a form-filling mix up, the beautifully rendered CGI animal helps this film survive beyond its glorious visuals with a genuine believability and emotional resonance opposite Suraj Sharma's 16-year-old \"Pi\" and his efforts to stay alive at sea against enormous odds. Special note should also go to a phenomenal Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi who, in the main plot device, recounts his story to Rafe Spall's wide-eyed journalist. Although I watched in 2D, the depth of the cinematography was still clearly there to see and the literal highs and lows of Pi's journey takes the audience on a (boat) ride across the ocean's wonders via flying fish, tempestuous storms, titanic whales and island-dwelling meerkats. For what it's worth, and without giving too much away, the film's mantra, \"Thank you. And so it goes with God\" about the power of storytelling led me to believe this was an atheist film rather than the power of \"faith\" it may have been trying to preach. But maybe, along with Groundhog Day, its brilliance lies with the fact that no matter your religious standpoint, the film's universality leaves you believing it's only about your world view. A marvellous triumph of acting, SFX, storytelling and adaptation, Ang Lee shows why he is a true master of the craft with a film feast for the eyes, brain and soul. 8/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

Ang Lee has pulled off a great coup in translating a seemingly uncinematic story into a piece of excellent cinema.

The whale & flying fish sequences are breathtaking, and the tiger CGI properly amazing. I was never taken out of the film by the CGI - just gave myself up to the fable.\n\nUltimately this is a story about storytelling, and the myths we create in our own lives to make a more palatable reality. As in the book, this is a bit shoe-horned into the last scenes, but it does succeed in making the viewer reconsider what they have seen.",

Personally I felt that this portion was a big part in the plot mainly because of how bad Richard Parker and Pi's situation was and leaving the question of who did he find? Was it someone from the crew from the Tsimtsum? Considering that Pi had no idea this leaves us to guess as well (and hence why he may not have shown who the person was). Either way I felt given the amount of conversation you can have around this book/movie that this portion was no exception. \n\nHowever looking back this movie was absolutely done perfectly. The plot was essentially dead on. Making sure to nail the most important parts of the novel but also not creating a 10 hour movie. Don't get me wrong the Novel is a much better choice if you want the full effect, as books will always explain and describe a scene that is much more personal and detailed than a movie could ever do. Needless to say this movie, which is based on the novel, stands out compared to other movies of this type. Sound and visual effects also what create this movie so breath taking. Unfortunately I rented this movie as a standard version but a 3D, Blu Ray edition is very much needed and recommended to get the entire experience. This movie is a must. Regardless if you believe in god or the idea that this plot will make you believe in god, which I don't necessarily agree with, it has a theme that gets you to wonder what the meaning of life means to you personally. Which makes for a better story the one with animals or the one without animals? Even with the slight issue I had with the film I just can't rate it even slightly lower than a 5/5, even though at first I thought 4.5/5.0, since the movie is so perfect in every other category. A weekend night price for a 3D, IMAX experience is not suggested it is required. The only other films that I felt deserve this type of rating was the Dark Night and the Dark Night Rises.",

While it does not seem like this could make for an eventful story, there is nothing further from the truth. Pi deals with everything from massive storms to close brushes with wild animals and a general apathy to survival while he's adrift, which makes for a complicated yet involved plot. By alternating between the storytelling of an adult Pi and the realtime travails while he's in danger, audiences get to experience a unique structure to the film's storyline. There are a good deal of twists and turns that keep things interesting, and the CGI adds an additional layer of awesomeness to 'Pi.' By the time the film has concluded, audiences have a lot of unanswered questions and are left to ponder their own conclusions, which is great. Despite its long runtime and sensitive themes, 'Life of Pi' is a very well done piece of cinema that will be remembered as much for its complexity as it will for its enchantment.",

The story never becomes a religious clusterfuck thanks to some sharp writing, which it easily could have been. The ending caught me completely off guard where Pi tells his \"real\" story. But when you think about the entire film afterwards it all made sense. Pi was the tiger. When he tries to tame the tiger, he's trying to tame his own anger after losing everything, even his faith almost. \"Faith is a large area with lots of places to go.\" Brilliant achievement for Ang Lee. One of my favorites of 2012.",

All you know is he's not good at choosing - since he follows Hinduism, Christianity & Islam. Sure, some parts on the raft are interesting, but it probably didn't need to go for over 2 hours.

People who claim it's boring (talking about you Dillon Mack) treat this as simply a movie and miss the idea of how Pi wants his story, and thus how we should interact with it, to be seen: Pi survived only because of God. \n\nThe filming of the \"insane\" was done beautifully-- it's hard to make what feels like an acid trip at sea come to life with animals in your boat, epic sea storms, exotic fish, etc. The CGI was used well and appropriately for the movie's content. And where CGI was not used to film Ang Lee's ideas, the way everything was composed was also well done. As this movie is a flashback with Pi recounting his story to a reporter, there is some back-an-forth cutting from then to the present at the beginning, which is annoying at times, but soon fades to the bulk of Pi's journey. The interviewer himself thankfully was not shown on screen for most of the movie, because I could never figure out what emotion he was feeling. I was confused if he was sincere or sarcastic or just aloof in his comments or when the camera cut to his face-- just poor emotional acting. As for the spirituality in this film, it interestingly tries to blend the idea of one overall God that introduces Himself through the deities of other religions (i.e. Krishna, Allah, Jesus, etc.). While that is certainly a great way to compromise, create common ground, and answer the problem of the diversity of \"true\" religion, it blatantly ignores the differences of the goals and perceptions of wholeness for each religion. If Pi's assertion that God is introduced by these other deities is correct, then God is a very confusing and contradicting God-- not one that can be understood in human capacity or trusted on any level.\n\nLife of Pi... watch it, and engage with the it on the spiritual level it deserves.",

Ang Lee scores full points for - a) daring to attempt to transform the book 'Life Of Pi' (Booker Prize winning novel by Yann Martel) into a movie and doing it brilliantly, b) maintaining the fine line between the two sensibilities that are most dominant in the movie i.e. survival and spirituality, c) deriving award winning acting from an absolute newcomer, Suraj Sharma i.e. the protagonist of the story, Pi.\n\nStoryline is very simple. But the treatment is very effective. Computer aided graphics are one of the best that we have seen till date. Scenes depicting real world as well as the imaginary world have been created realistically and beautifully respectively. Some sea storm based scenes remind you of 'The Truman Show'. \n\nMost amazing part is that more than ninety percent of scenes are just between Pi and Richard Parker (Bengal Tiger) and still you don't miss anything. You are hooked to the screen till the end! The director did an intelligent job by casting acting stalwarts Irrfan, Tabu and Adil for the introductory scenes. Their intense acting do help in maintaining the audience interest during the building up phase of the movie.\n\nAt times people act awkward simply because the majority expect them to. Same seems to be the case of depiction of Indian natives in English and Cross Culture movies and this one is no different! It would be really nice if Indian sensibility and dialogue delivery will be shown, as it actually is, and not how so called developed countries perceive it to be.\n\nA very important lesson that you learn here is that the barriers and enemies that we come across and fight and may overcome, actually keep us sane, our senses alert and our soul hopeful. Life without obstacles will actually be boring and we will soon forego the urge to live at all. Rather than destroying the enemies, it is better to tame them and co-exist with them.\n\nThe movie is an innovative visual treat. Creative people must watch it.",

I have never read the book, so I can not state  if whether the book is better than the movie, but with most of adaptations,  one can assume that the book might be better. (Just an assumption). The movie is a slow paced movie, and although a bit long, the movie is a pretty good movie. The movie is over two hours long and if you are going to watch it I suggest you do when you have a clear mind and ready to focus, because like I said it is slow paced. The movie is visually stunning and I assure you you will enjoy a lot of the scenery, but there were times where I felt they went a little overboard with the cgi. (Of course most of it is cgi, but there were times where I felt that some things were just unnecessary) Although some of those parts are somewhat bothersome it is still not enough to take away from everything else. I was originally going to give this movie three stars, but because of Suraj Sharmas performance I bumped it up to a four star rating. His performance was just amazing. He did not over do it and he made you feel what he was feeling during the scenes. He did an extraordinary job playing the character of Pi.",

Academy Award Winning director Ang Lee directs this film with sharp camera work and beautiful scenery with some of the best CGI I have seen since Avatar. The shipwreck and the entire movie at sea is just so compelling to watch, the imagery looks fantastic as if it were real! The animals specifically the bengal tiger, Richard Parker, the detail is amazing.\n\nThe story follows Pi as he is shipwrecked and stranded in the middle of the Pacific all that survives with him is a zebra, a hyena (which can be regarded as an antagonist) and his father's Bengal tiger Richard Parker. Life of Pi is told via flashback when an older Pi reveals his story to a compelled novelist. Pi recalls being stranded on the island for nearly a year and his struggle to survive aboard a life boat, a raft he makes while trying to survive at sea with relatively no food and with a fearsome tiger that is getting hungry. Pi tries to befriend Richard Parker, take care of him, feed him but also keep himself mentally strong and occupied and not succumb to fear, panic, doubt and loss of hope. \n\nSuraj Sharma shows astounding acting credibility as the 17 year old Pi, shipwrecked. He shows his emotion whether it be fear or calm as well as intellect in his struggle to stay alive. Above all he shows faith and never giving up hope that he will one day reach land. His performance truly shines during the storm at sea in which he and the tiger are nearly killed by terrifying waves and wind, here he screams out to God saying he is ready to die and see his family. However it is his survival that brings him to the next part of the story.\n\nWhen Pi drifts to this tropical floating island with edible plants and all to rejuvenate his strength. However at night the island becomes hostile and it is aparent to Pi that to survive he must leave and keep going, it is here we see emotion as he reaches Mexico exhausted, defeated and alive where Richard Parker runs off into the forrest that we see an emotional breakdown from Pi. His older self played by Irfan Khan also gives a great performance showcasing his emotion recounting his character's past to the novelist. \n\nAng Lee is an extraordinary director and with his visuals at sea, the animals and the island he crafted truly a visual masterpiece and one of the best films of the year.",

A version of \"Castaway\" with Wilson being replaced by a Bengal Tiger.  There is a prelude to the shipwreck sequence, but it's mostly pretty boring.  Many things that happen in the life boat seem a little ridiculous when watching it (from a plot stand point, not from a realism stand point, since this movie isn't about realism), but make more sense in light of the twist ending.

Aaaaanyway... I think this is as great of an adaptation of the book as could be made. Really captures the emotion and spirit (from what I remember). [4/5 STARS] [082613]",

At times though, the story feels so paper thin that the audience wonders what the point of even watching the film anymore is. It drags on at times and then quickly picks back up the pace, but the scenes that are interesting are so unevenly spaced out - it makes the film a very difficult one to sit through.",

The film follows a man as he recounts his story of being lost at sea. For starters, I don't see what all the fuss is about concerning the visual effects. Visually, the film looks like a high priced cartoon at times. The visual effects are not as great as one would expect, or even as good as one would hope. And it doesn't help that the situations are so outlandish that the effects don't even remotely seem real. On the acting side, credit has to go to Suraj Sharma for the sole fact that he basically carries the ENTIRE film for a huge chunk of it. It isn't easy to be the only actual actor on screen for an entire film, and he does a decent job at it, despite a few hammy and corny moments. Overall, this was just painfully dull for me and I don't see where any of the hype is deserved.",

            "content": "Life of Pi proves that not all epics consist of tons of characters and extras. Just a young Indian boy with his CGI friend. Whether this film is real or not, the question must never be answered. Its all real. Life of Pi asks us to take a journey with a young boy Pi and a Bengal tiger Richard Parker across the harsh ocean that they endure as this epic. Creating this grand adventure so cinematically bold, one feels as though they are venturing on the small boat with Pi and Richard. I watched this film in 2D and even that was immerse and interactive, so the 3D must have been reality. Based on Yann Martel's novel Lee and screenwriter David Magee have managed to stay true to the source without being constrained by it, as so often happens in adaptations. Lee has done what no other director has ever been seen done and that is enhancing the novel's power, employing 3D and CGI technology with such originality that there are moments when the ocean seems to float around you. And when a certain tiger roars, you may well jump. I know I did. \n\nAs magnetic as Ang Lee's boundary-breaking visuals are, it wouldn't be enough to carry the film if it were not anchored by such an electrifying tale. The core is the 227 days Pi spends in the lifeboat with the spiritual Tiger and relationship between the two truly is magnificent. Both tear filling and important. Suraj Sharma is very faithful to his character and for his debut film his acting is more than sufficient. Lets just hope he doesn't end up like Dev Patel. This film exceeds all my expectations. Its flawless. Nothing more and nothing less. And lets face it should have won best picture. Fear becomes Pi's first ally when a storm rips at the ship. The will to survive will kick in later. He's thrown into one of the lifeboats and in the chaos that follows, some of the zoo's belongings join him - a frantic zebra, a fussy orangutan, a frenzied hyena and Richard Parker, who boards despite Pi's best efforts to keep him at away. \n\nYou might think spending the bulk of the film in a lifeboat would soon lose its intrigue. But when there are wild animals, unpredictable seas and diminishing rations there is no time for things to get boring. Life of Pi is a rare kind of film and we won't be seeing anything like or up to its level in the neat future. Ang has directed a film that will surly stay with us forever more and what more is there to say. Well done Ang Lee. Verdict: With the stunning visuals, the miraculous storyline and Ang Lee's direction, Life of Pi is defiantly the best in its category. Life of Pi is Ang Lee's best film to date. And don't forget your tissues!",

Having lost his family in a horrid storm whilst travelling aboard a cargo ship full of his parents zoo animals, the castaway surfaces adrift from the wreck with only four animals for company, one of which being the Bengal tiger at the top of the food chain. Whilst battling one another, as well as their own thirst and hunger, we witness how the struggle unfolds, and just how unbelievable the events turn out to be. Will anyone believe what happened out there, or are we just witnessing a fantasy version that masks the true events? Either way, it captures the imagination through a mixture of stunning animation, religious beliefs and innovative cinematography. Its just about the right length as any longer and the enticement of the watery setting may have become little tenuous, regardless of how pretty it may look in 3D. It's certainly not one to watch repeatedly, but a unique story that all the family should enjoy at least once in their lifetime.",

It's ought to be an inspiring tale to make one believe in God. In the end, there's only few questions to ask, but what made this spectacular is the amazing use of special effects and the direction. You do not always get a film as gorgeous and as highly enjoyable as this one. It's one of the best kinds of experiences you'll get in cinemas. It has real tension, humor, and emotional depth, but the real landmark here is the visuals that are undeniably spellbinding.\n\nThe beginning is quite intriguing as it talks about faith and its morality, but the conundrum disappointingly ends up being less subtle in execution. Despite of that, we still get to see something extraordinary. One is a genuine fortitude in every suspenseful and emotional moment which practically compels the whole picture. The other is obviously the visuals. Ang Lee interestingly turned the survival into a whimsical and surreal exterior that made this look so remarkable like when the water perfectly reflects the stars in the sky or the lightning struck at the entire ocean during a harsh storm. The CGI-ed animals are amazing how they move and act like real animals. The enjoyable bits is when Pi interacts with those band of misfits. The film is in 3D and yep, there are plenty of things jumped off the screen(noticeably changes ratio aspect in one sequence), but it also shows some interesting use of it.\n\nThere's only few things to say about this since I haven't read the book(rule breaker here), but I'll say it has the same root of Cloud Atlas. The message isn't overwhelmingly executed but the technical achievements and the direction made it a powerful cinematic experience. It could have been a much better experience if it's strong to its themes, but it's all stunning anyway. Life of Pi is a compelling cinematic journey with endless visual wonders.",

            "content": "\"Life of Pi\" opens numerous avenues for discussion and debate - but I'll try to keep this short (as all the other \"reviews\" I write on here). I must, first, admit that I've not read the book prior to seeing the movie. In fact, I knew very little of the story going into the movie. I think going into the movie with such a blank slate (or tabula rasa) is the best way to experience \"Life of Pi\". \n\"Life of Pi\" tells the incredible struggle of a teenaged boy who defies the impossible and survives 227 days in the middle of the Pacific in a lifeboat with the companionship of a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The teenaged boy is named Pi - after taking much abuse from his classmates growing up because of his real name, Piscine (or Pissing), he shortens his name to Pi and adopts the infinite number as his moniker. Quite fitting. \nPi, in essence, offers two stories to the viewers/listeners. One story is powerful, imaginative, visceral - and if you accept it, you accept God(?). The other story is more probable and realistic - but does that mean if you believe it, then you don't believe in God? That's left to the viewer to decide. \nNo matter what you believe, you can't deny the extraordinary beauty that director Ang Lee and co. provide us. Some of the best moments are when Lee combines the water of the ocean, our hero and his tiger companion, and the stars above as one. For the time Pi spends lost at sea, he and the tiger are the only beings left in the world - maybe even the entire universe. \nAng Lee deservedly won the Oscar for Best Director. This is one of those rare movies that stays with you long after you've left the theater (or, in my case, turned off the Bluray player).",

After the hyena kills the zebra and the orang-utan, Richard Parker ends up eating them all up and Pi is forced to build a raft in order to survive. The movie follows Pi's attempts to tame the tiger and his adventures as a castaway. Eventually Richard Parker becomes the very reason not to fall into desperation and to carry on living. \nIt is a beautifully filmed movie, with powerful images of the sea, the sky, the stars... I was a little disappointed to find out that the tiger was computer generated, but to be honest, it is so perfectly done that you cannot spot the difference.\nA lot of people have wanted to see something else in this story, a reflection of human nature (where each animal represents a feature of human personality) or an insight into religion (the tiger meaning the soul). But I also believe that there is a real possibility of this just being the narrative of a remarkable survivor. It is up to each viewer; the film acts a mirror of our own experiences.",

The leading character was a great choice and he also put n a convincing performance, which must have been hard with so much graphics being used. This is a bit weird to say, but the relationship between Pi and the tiger was brilliant. It reminded me a lot like Wilson and Tom Hanks in Castaway. Anyway, this movie should definitely not be missed because there won't be another movie with such a deep and meaningful storyline for some time. Brilliant!\n\nRound-Up:\nI did find the ending a bit corny, after going through such an emotional ride, but it doesn't take away the greatness in the film. Although the storyline is great, it's the visual effects that must have taken a hell of a long time because of its precise and believable realism. The whole shipwreck scene will put Titanic to shame, but in some ways, its not the type of movie that you will watch time and time again, for a some unknown reason. With all that aside, this movie must look excellent in 3D, which is the format that I recommend to everyone who watches this movie and check out the wicked names for the animals.\n\nBudget: $120million\nWorldwide Gross: $609million (Well Deserved!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who like there emotional, fantasy/adventure movies with a touching storyline. 8/10",

Comparisons to Avatar are fair only because they are both visually stunning. But where Avatar is unashamedly anti-capitalist, anti-American, and anti-military, with its pro-aboriginal message, Pi takes thought provoking and existentialiat views at theism and rationalism, at what motivates us and what drives us, what gives us reason to live. And while I don't think it possible to be a Hindu Catholic Muslim that teaches Judaism, Life of Pi presented this notion without offense, without slander. I found it intense without being cheesy,moving without being sappy, emotional without being a tear-jerker; a visual marvel that reminded me more of What Dreams May Come than it did of Avatar. I purchased the movie expecting to be impressed, and I got more than I bargained for. I only wish I had seen it in 3D. It is one of the better films that I've seen in my young life. Ang Lee is truly a genius (Hulk notwithstanding). I can't think of a single flaw in this movie. It's perfect. A plus.",

From there on the movie descends into a virtual depressing pity party.  You wait for the uptick, but it never comes.  Instead, we further descend into depression.  Yes, the scenery is remarkable, a feast for the eyes, but more and more I felt I was watching a snuff movie.  In the end, we find the animals in the boat are not animals at all, but people, and Pi has construed a story around the actual events to hide his guilt and shame.  Finally, after watching this depressing movie, we find out it is actually about cannibalism.  Really Hollywood, another movie about \ncannibalism?  This movie is more about the extremes that Hollywood will go to in presenting what they feel is entertainment we want.

The Life of Pi accomplishes that and needs very little else.\n\nThe film and its director, Ang Lee, won numerous awards, but it is baffling to think about how many it didn't win. There is with little doubt that Life of Pi delivers one of the best films of 2012 and destroys all signs of existence from it's competition off the stage.\n\nJust watching trailers, it can bee seen how just visually stunning the film is. Who knew that being stranded on a small boat in the middle of the ocean could be so glamorous and riveting. \n\nAnd with that said, it must be noted that it wasn't the visuals that carried this film. Beyond the visuals is a story so deep and so entwined into the fabrics of our imaginations that we can't help but sit in awe. The emotional give and take from the film is an experience in and of itself.\n\nAng Lee challenges your very thought processes and engages your mind from start to finish. The audience feels as if they are experiencing the world and learning new lessons right along with Pi.\n\nWriters David Magee and Yann Martel took source material that broke down the barriers of our imaginations and transcribed it into a script that would only enhance the intricate complexities contained within.\n\nSuraj Sharma took that script to another level. Spending most of the film alone in the middle of the ocean and in the company of a tiger, Sharma is able to translate, enforce, and relegate sheer amounts of power and will through the screen unto the audience. If he were to fall flat, so would the message he was expected to deliver. \n\nThe story within the story, Piception if you will, keeps you fully engaged and needing more.\n\nOn one hand, you have a great film worthy of the many awards it won. On the other, you have art. A masterpiece that goes beyond the everyday bounds of film making and one in which that takes you on a spectacular journey through the deepest crevices of your mind, body, and soul.\n\nWhich is it that YOU believe?",

Pi is a young boy who lives with his parents and brother in a zoo.  The zoo is to be closed and so his family take the animals on a freighter as they leave India for Canada.  \n\nA storm occurs, the ship sinks and only Pi, a zebra, a tiger, and a hyena survive by entering a lifeboat.  \nLater an orangutan comes aboard the lifeboat.\n\nThe hyena attacks and kills the zebra then the orangutan and then the tiger kills the hyena.  Pi and the tiger come to a standoff during their fight to survive.  They land on a mysterious island with meerkats on it but abandon it to stay alive.  They finally reach Mexico where the tiger vanishes and Pi is found by people and eventually makes it to Canada.  We see Pi in later years narrating the story to an author and it is in returning to that context that the film is saved from completely faltering on a weak premise of a disturbing lie being accepted by accident investigators who want to know why the ship sank when Pi doesn't even know.\n\nThe story falters when Pi is interviewed about the accident.  He tells them his story but as they don't\nbelieve much of it, he then fashions a false story in which the details are tragic and absurd and even in the service of the storyline and plot rings false and that pulled me out of sympathy with the movie (I stopping the film to write this review).  8/10",

Yesterday I went into this pawn shop where i get all my movies and i saw this for only 2.99 so i got it. My intentions were to just add it to my collection and never watch it but i decided to view it and i am glad i did. It had my attention from beginning to end. I would have gave it 5 stars but i ran out of chips while watching and i got pissed lol",
