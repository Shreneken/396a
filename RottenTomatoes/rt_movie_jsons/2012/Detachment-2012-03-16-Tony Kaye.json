    "summary": "Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a substitute teacher who shuns emotional connections, and never stays long enough in one district to bond with his students or colleagues. Troubled and lost, Henry lands at a public school where an apathetic student body and disinterested parents have created a frustrated, burned-out group of teachers and administrators. Inadvertently, Henry becomes a role model to his disaffected students and bonds with a teenage runaway who is just as lost as he is.",

Adrian Brody is excellent as usual, as a substitute teacher assigned to a failing school.  Sammi Gayle (Nikki in Blue Bloods) is effective as a teen runaway that bonds with the teacher.  Music by the Newton Brothers is wonderful. Shout out to Lucy Lui with a small but shattering performance. In fact, the whole film is shattering. The young generation needs values that are timeless. As I am writing (Feb. 2023) teens, especially girls, are experiencing emotional dysfunction and confusion like we've never seen before. This film graphically depicts the problem - but presents no solution. The only ray of hope is the joyful embrace of Brody and Gayle at the end. Love perhaps might be the answer.",

Its perhaps a little like Dangerous Minds, only not so dramatic as such. Having been in education for many years, seeing how disinterested the numerous students were reminded me of situations I've seen myself. I liked that at times we (the viewer) are shown what appear to be drawings made out of chalk shown on old fashioned blackboards, drawings/images of birds taking flight, animals and so on. I suppose its to represent freedom and mobility (social mobility) perhaps.\n\nI thought that Adrien Brody did well portraying the substitute teacher, someone who can guess what may be behind some of his temporary pupils problems and issues but never having the time to be able to fully work with any of them, while we also see that he has his own emotional stresses in his own family life.\n\nThis is a sad watch but its a good film. I liked the variety of characters present and I thought the film was well casted too, so overall I would recommend this film, yes.",

Director Tony Kaye is not content to tell a straight story about inner city school kids and teachers, He has to show off his chops with  flashbacks, voice overs, glaringly symbolic visuals, and every other trick in the book. It's annoying.\nOn top of that, there are numerous sub plots going on. Teacher Henry Barthes (Adrian Brody) takes in a young hooker (Sami Gayle) in some kind of half-assed attempt at rehabilitating her. The school principal (Marcia Gay Harden) is being laid off because the school's test scores aren't meeting government requirements. Henry, whose mother committed suicide when he was seven, is dealing with his dying grandfather, who is in a nursing home. That's only three  of the sub plots; there are several more. It's like a rather morose version of John Sayles. \nJames Caan is a standout as a hard-edged realist teacher. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. But they're dealing with a messy, scattered script that's more of a collage than a story. \nIt's all very solemn and despairing. Too bad, because Adrian Brody is a fine actor. But here, I felt like he was a puppet with Tony Kaye pulling his strings. When giving a depressed student advice, Henry tells her \"We're all the same. We all feel pain. We all have chaos in our lives...But if you write it out, it will all be OK.\" How about: \"No one wants to think about what it takes to become somebody, to get out of the sea of pain that we all have to get out of.\" I don't know how Brody got those lines out without choking on them. \nThere's altogether too much angst going on here, and the artsy direction gets in the way of the story. But good acting makes up for a multitude of sins.",

Detachment meramente expone una sociedad enferma y dirigida por los medios controlados por la ambición y el consumismo. Revela las vidas de quienes han quedado presas de de esas ideologías enfermizas, a la vez que personas de buen corazón que quisieran ver a la juventud libre de el bombardeo de los medios y una cultura decadente, se encuentran hundidos en la desesperación y el pesimismo del fracaso ante este mal tan generalizado. \n\n\"No se ofrece una solución\" ESE ES EL PUNTO. Mostrar vidas al límite, ante una sociedad construida sobre premisas utópicas engañonas que no pueden proporcionar verdadera felicidad. No es una \"FEEL GOOD MOVIE\" (película para sentirse bien). Es una denuncia a la consciencia social. Un verdadero logro, finamente filmado y actuado magistralmente por un elenco de primera. \n\n¡MUY RECOMENDADA!",

First I will start off with the positives because most of the review will be me trashing the film after I name it's positives. Adrian Brody did give a great performance in the film and I kept wishing throughout it that the film was as good as he was in it. A few more are that James Caan cracked me up in a weird hilarious scene and the young prostitute who hung out with Adrian Brody's character did do good at showing emotions when things got tough with her. Now on with the negatives because there are a ton. First off, the movie has way too many plot lines going on and it has way too many characters including some who are only in a few scenes like Bryan Cranston's, Blythe Danner's, and James Caan's. The movie completely wastes the talents of these fine actors and they did not contribute one memorable thing out of this whole movie. The plot lines could have worked but there was never a clear focus on anything going on and you don't end up caring about anything yu see on screen. First the movie tries to establish a relationship going on between Adrian Brody and the young prostitute, then it tries to show this horrible society that goes on around the school, then it shows these random scenes of teachers gathering around for meetings, also it shows Adrian Brody visiting his father in the hospital, and then lastly, it tries to establish this bond between Adrian Brody and the class he teaches while also trying to be really thought provoking and preachy with it's depressing messages, and it was all very mind boggling and messy for me and I can't imagine any normal person being able to soak all that in on one single viewing because I certainly didn't and I most certainly won't be revisiting this film anymore whatsoever in my lifetime, just because of how pretentious and depressing it got as it went on. I really did want to like this movie and for a little bit I was giving it the benefit of a doubt, but an hour in, I just stopped caring about the whole movie and was just waiting for it to end. If the movie would have been just about Adrian Brody and the relationship with his class and cut out all the pretentious preachy crap and the multiple unmemorable plot lines, the movie wouldn't have been so daunting to sit through and it would have been more effective. Considering that this film comes from the director who had brought us the great effective drama American History X, I expected a hell of a lot more. Overall, I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore because I get upset thinking about it and this movie is just a clear example of wasted potential.",

The particulars differ, yet the sense of individual isolation in a chaotic and uncaring universe is unified through the elegiac tone of the movie.  The sense of existential despair is responded by the stoic Mr. Barthes who endures and carries on his duty to be a good teacher and a decent human being.  Yet his Kantian Imperatives is honed by deep schism in psyche and memory.   He reminds me of Detective Cole in True Detective Season 1.  Somber and suffering souls bear witness of life honorably, dutifully, yet without false hope. \n\nThe one critical scene we see Barthes read among the detritus and chaos around him.  The order of the universe lies in his life of mind instead of the sensory life itself.  Embodied in moral imperatives,  Mr. Barthes is the essential stoic's \"ataraxia\", a serene calmness against all the odds yet not detached from the love of life itself.  \n\nWhat marks this movie from any other happier-ending ones is the absolute confidence in the present:  The danger lies in the joyful tears of Erica rushing toward him.  One fears more pain than joy in the universe however the beautiful sunset in the shaded grove looked at that moment of embrace.",

It is an odd film, erratic at times and raw in its portrayal of communities with a low socioeconomic status.  The documentary feel enhances the realism of the story.  You don't feel as if you are watching characters - you feel as if you are watching real kids with real problems.  Unfortunately, this style requires the film to move slowly and without much action, so it does turn into a very long 100 minutes.  The story centers around Adrien Brody, who plays a substitute teacher that reaches out to these kids on a level that they can understand.  Unlike \"Stand and Deliver\" or \"Lean on Me,\" Brody has his own circumstances that stand in the way of his success.  Pieces of this film are predictable because the story so accurately portrays the daily encounters of teachers in their classrooms.  The highlight of the film is Lucy Liu as she shows the frustration with misled students that teachers cannot ever reveal.  I was also quite taken with Sami Gayle, who acted beyond her years in this role.  \"Detachment\" moves at a snail's pace and will likely ruin your night, but any person involved in public education will be able to relate to these characters on a deep level.",

            "content": "Tony Kaye's Detachment is like his feature film debut American History X in its bleak depiction of America's youth, trapped within the bureaucracy of public education, an institution that which they lack an understanding of, causing them to lash out in acts of cruelty and malice systemic of the failures of government sanctioned institutionalization, knowledge and empathy replaced by ignorance and competition. Indicative of Kaye's characteristic dissatisfaction for the culturally degenerative firmament of America in the twenty-first century, Detachment examines the failures of public education in America, depicting the role of the teacher as more warden and jailor than educator and counselor, Kaye's chosen subjects down trodden civil servants held back by the anger of their students and the economic strictures of the nation's poorest and most racially volatile residential districts. In Adrian Brody's Henry Barthes, the viewer is afforded a veritable reincarnation of Kaye's previous protagonist, Edward Norton's Neo-Nazi turned social activist Derek Vinyard, Barthes' internalized rage quelled by a poetic soul, erupting in fits of isolated panic when provoked by the very worst of society's machinations of arbitrary law and order. Like American History X, Detachment is nearly suffocating in its dark dramatic tone, the dour halls of Kaye's public high school lending an impenetrability to the characters within, the torch of enlightenment unattended, leaving a whole generation of children scrabbling in the dark, capitalistic antagonism affording only the meager light of a single lit match. Where Kaye's feature film debut found him investigating racial prejudice and violence in Southern California at the dawn of the twenty-first century, his fourth film finds him interrogating the survivors of his prior social apocalypse, his public educators tied down by the ego of discontentment engendered by the detachment of racism that has continued to course through the American subconscious in the proceeding ten years.\n\nAs a successor to what is possibly the greatest social drama of our time, Detachment is comparatively engaged in a discussion largely pre-determined, Kaye's rhetorical flourishes on the importance of an ever diminishing liberal education heavy handed, but restrained by the subtleties afforded in Carl Lund's script and through the deft performances of its exceptional cast. If Kaye is a director's director, than his oeuvre is perhaps most marked by its unrelenting authorial style, Kaye's films less about interpretation than they are about elicited reaction, his films provocative in their engagement with topics already laden with a socially pre-conditioned response. And Detachment is no exception, decidedly brutal and effectively moving, Kaye's dissatisfaction echoing our own resentment towards an ingrained cultural disengagement, America in the twenty-first century remarkably insincere and prone to satire, but without the knowledge of where that insincerity and ridicule stems from, causing further division and turmoil within the culture. While some might find Kaye's stubborn cynicism exhausting, and American History X is nothing if not unmistakably critical, Detachment possesses an empathy for its characters that proves optimistic, even if the battles waged don't always culminate in success. While the film's conclusion leaves its characters in much the same quandary in which it finds them, Kaye's direction imbues a familiarity with his characters that proves empathetic and diagnostic of the lack of concern in public education in America at large, the solution dependent on our response to the film's comprehensively informed satire.\n\nIn Henry Barthes, Kaye has seemingly distilled the spirit of Derek Vinyard to his bare essentials, the anger of an upbringing found lacking in proper emotional support and economic stability fostering an adult lacking in social stability, the torments of his past informing his impersonally detached nature in the present. While Henry undoubtedly cares deeply for his fellow teachers and students, his status as a substitute teacher enables him to leave before becoming too emotionally attached to any one school district, classroom, or location, constant motion and change negating the effects of what is a meager and hard earned existence. Like his students, Henry feels the undercurrents of oppression surging forth as anger, a socially propagated affliction of a culture in a state of arrested development engendered by the very lack of education that Henry is actively engaged in instilling into a stagnant national intellect. When Henry says that he understands that his students are angry, or when he takes in a young prostitute off the street out of sheer charity, his own intelligence is temporarily lent to an American youth emotionally and mentally abandoned, the public schools little more than police states, the children put under their care abused, neglected, and ignored. In Kaye's film, all of his characters are dissimilarly detached, their very inability to connect with one another ironically communal, if only they could reach out and see each other in order to transcend the culturally regressive traits that have kept them deaf, dumb, and blind.\n\nPerhaps the most pervasive aspect of Detachment comes in its ability to articulate the incoherence of teenage angst as a symptom of an ephemeral maturity, proffered as a possibility, but with no clear social avenues by which to reach it. If Henry Barthes serves as any indication, adulthood carries the baggage of adolescence around with it, our formative years spent in the American public education system alternatively deleterious or transformative to our own intellectual and emotional growth, our nation's teachers the first line of defense against the violence of racism and social prejudice, so long as we give them the freedom of authority to educate. Without the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong, pure and corrupt, Kaye's film provides the evidence to make it unmistakably clear that the civil turmoil depicted in his American History X will continue, anger the physical manifestation of psychological neglect. It's impossible to come away from any film directed by Tony Kaye in an apathetic manner, his film's provocations immediately familiar in their sources of criticism and indictment, his dissatisfaction echoing our own subconsciously felt grievances, and informing our consciously held complaints. As a social activist, there is no director currently making films quiet as effective in eliciting a volatile response from the tacitly disengaged masses, and Detachment, the spiritual successor to his masterful American History X, is perhaps his greatest achievement yet, diagnostic of the social ills of a lack of a proper public education, else we remain in a culture divided by the color of our skin and the size of our respective bank accounts.",

His interactions with Sami Gayle (also excellent) as Erica are particularly poignant; this narrative is certainly the most honest, well-crafted through-line of the film--effectively avoiding the often grossly glamorous \"hooker with a heart of gold\" trope-- but it gets a bit lost in the muddled myriad of other half-baked stories and characters. \n\nThere's also such a mishmash of stylistic tropes, seemingly thrown in at random (Malick-esque poetic voice-over, documentary interviews, hand-drawn animation, photo montage, jump-cuts, dream-like flashbacks) that serve to confuse and distract rather than support. Even the ending seems to have far less to say about the overwhelmingly bleak circumstances of these characters than what feels necessary.

            "content": "This movie has a great central performance by Adrien Brody, and parts of it are undeniably powerful, but it's also an incredibly messy piece of work that feels like it was adapted straight from the screenwriter's random notes to himself, rather than an actual finished screenplay. This movie just kind of throws a lot of melodrama and despair at a wall; some of it sticks, a good bit of it does not. I can't say it's a very good movie due to its extremely rough, unfinished quality, but I also wouldn't tell anyone not to watch it if they were interested.\n\nThe central plotline of the movie focuses on a substitute teacher (Brody) who is sent to fill in for a month in an English class in a rather bad public high school. There are a lot of subplots thrown in, sometimes seemingly at random, but they do all boil down to one consistent theme: the American public education system fucking sucks, but it's more the fault of parents, administrators, and children than of the teachers. Actually, the movie portrays most of the teachers as noble, suffering souls, and most of the parents as evil, stupid, vile monsters. This movie will make you hate high school children and their parents.\nThe movie has a whole bunch of great actors, but then proceeds to waste them with about five minutes or less screentime for each: Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, Tim Blake Nelson, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Lucy Liu, and Bryan Cranston (BRYAN FUCKING CRANSTON) are all given a couple of brief scenes each (Cranston only gets about one minute!). Brody does do a good job holding the center of the movie together, and for me the most interesting and successful of the many subplots involved him sheltering an underage prostitute (Sami Gayle). The movie begins with apparent documentary footage of real teachers talking about their jobs, then just kind of lurches around from one scene to the next. It feels more like a rant than a narrative at points, though admittedly a fiery and compelling rant. This is only the second completed fiction film by Tony Kaye, whose previous fiction film was American History X way back in 1998. (He also made a documentary about abortion called Lake of Fire which I haven't seen yet.) Based on those two films, the guy clearly has an effective, angry, powerful way of talking about big important issues, but he could work on discipline and form. I don't demand that every movie be a slick, uniform narrative, of course, but in this case it often feels less like experimentation and more just like a straight-up mess. This movie also has some of the most laughably amateur lighting I've ever seen in a real movie - one scene in particular has Tim Blake Nelson apparently casting sharp shadows in every direction in his house. Who let that happen? \nStill, as chaotic and seemingly random as this movie can be, I'd still say it's worth seeing as a realistic, depressing antidote to those inspiring-teacher movies everyone hates. The movie it reminds me most of is Half-Nelson with Ryan Gosling, which I thought was a pretentious mess (when I saw it 7 years ago, admittedly). This is also a pretentious mess, but for some reason I liked it better.",

            "content": "A dark chronicling of the sad state of the American Public School System, through the eyes of a long-term substitute teacher (Adrien Brody), wrestling his own demons whilst trying to make a difference both professionally and personally during his latest assignment.\n\nTony Kaye's \"Detachment\" is not the lecture I was expecting. It's an almost spiritual study of a system; a broken one, flawed (and as suggested) not inherently but by larger societal problems too broad and numerous to fully grasp or understand. It assesses these issues not with hope but with pitch black honesty. No solutions given but the disturbing thought that some things will never change. Kaye uses the phenomenal performance of Adrian Brody to ground us in the drama. We think at first this will be one man's story, but the narrative's concerns are much broader. This reminded me of \"American History X,\" a masterpiece, also directed by Kaye. It showcases a career best performance (Ed Norton in that movie) in a character piece that isn't so much about a personal journey as it is a grand statement about a specific social problem that will continue to thrive with no end in sight. In \"Detachment,\" Kaye's technique is equally experimental, in a story that's even less streamlined. Brody is definitely the star of the movie, but is not necessarily the focus. We are violently thrust into the lives of a myriad characters; unexpectedly and frantically at times. It could be argued that \"Detachment\" lacks focus to a fault, but I didn't feel this. Kaye's creation works as collage, similar to but not as extreme as Terrence Malick's take on WWII in \"The Thin Red Line.\" As with \"American History X,\" Kaye's stance is obvious and moment to moment scenes are a bit preachy, but none of this detracts from the established tone and eventual takeaway of this socially conscience,  effortlessly powerful movie. The film's cold, apocalyptic final shots aptly conclude a bleak portrait. One that's relentlessly grim, sure, but a bold work of cinema that leaves a lot to ponder.",

Which reminds me of another stupid scene, the fat chick gives the teacher a hug while he explains that he doesn't love her and another teacher enters the room and implies that inappropriate contact was initiated because the teacher put his hand on her arm without gripping and stroking.\n\nHe then shouts and throws tables and goes home. Later on the fat chick overdoses by putting unspecified powder in a cupcake which would've probably disintegrated under such heat required to make cupcakes and then the teacher tries to give her CPR... For an overdose!\n\nStay away from this movie like AIDS",

Detachment parece irse por ese camino, pero termina siendo intencionalmente casi lo contrario y hasta depresiva en ciertos momentos.\nNos adentra al mundo de la escuela, pero más que ocuparse de los estudiantes, parece centrarse en la situación de los maestros dando a entender que todos tienen problemas, pero ante todo, los profesores y sus intenciones son siempre buenas y desearían el bienestar de todos sus estudiantes, algo que me parece difícil de creer y más para mi que he conocido maestros a los que claramente no les interesa la educación de los alumnos.\nLa película recoge varias aspectos de la vida humana, sobre todo psicológicos y sociales de una manera bastante sólida y emocional, aunque ciertamente no tan profunda, en parte, me parece, debido a la no tan extensa duración del filme.\nA pesar de la ligera superficialidad y ambiguo paso con el que a veces parece caminar el filme, en algunas ocasiones Detachment presenta diálogos y frases brillantes y reflexivas que dicen mucho con pocas palabras, sobre todo en las escenas del abuelo en el hospital.\nLa película cuenta también con una interesante fotografía, con experimentación que a veces es agradable, pero que a veces resulta innecesaria.\nOtro punto destacable son las excelentes actuaciones y el admirable trabajo de Brody que ya ha demostrado en repetidas ocasiones que es capaz de interpretar papeles con suma credibilidad y naturalidad.\nAunque su mensaje y objetivo quedan poco claros y que posee varios puntos en contra, Detachment tiene más a su favor, lleva a la reflexión y es en todo momento interesante.",

You'll learn some things about yourself, your emotions, other people, and society in general. All of this is capable, of course, by some very powerful performances from big names like Adrien Brody, James Caan, Lucy Liu, etc. It's rare to find comfort in sadness, but with the intelligence of this film it is quite possible.

Has there ever been a man with such an expressive face/eyebrows? For me, he never fails to captivate my attention.\n\n In this story, Brody plays a jaded substitute teacher, who tries very hard to shut everyone out of his life and remain unbeholden to anyone. The students quickly warm to him, but he remains untempted to put down any roots. Moving beyond his usual, solitary attitude, he helps a young woman that has been living on the streets. When their friendship cultivates, he cuts himself loose, in perhaps the most upsetting scene of all. \n\nIssues such as bullying and teenage suicide are also addressed, but after such a stark underlining, there fails to be a bright spot at the end of the tunnel. It is a film driven by a frustration and disquietuide concerning society today, and it drives it's point painfully home. The realism prevents the emergence of a save-the-day hero, perhaps leaving the audience a little flat and depressed, but the serious persistence of the film is to be commended.",

Unfortunately, he didn't make that many films and those that he did - \"Lobby Lobster\" and \"Black Water Transit\" - didn't quite reach a bigger audience. As a result, I was happy to come across \"Detachment\" which proves that Kaye hasn't lost any of his style or starkness. \n Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a substitute teacher brought in to a struggling urban high school to teach English and work with kids who are performing at a very low grade. Being a substitute is exactly the way Henry likes it as he deliberately tries to avoid making genuine connections with people (and that includes his pupils). As time goes on, though, Mr. Barthes realises his pupils' needs for his input which forces him to confront his own demons and isolation.\n \n\"And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world.\"\n As the film opens, this is the quote from French philosopher Albert Camus, that's scribed onto a blackboard before we are introduced to the protagonist and the personal conflict he finds himself in. On the one hand, he's a caring individual but on the other, he deliberately keeps a distance from people as he's consumed by a guilt that doesn't belong to him. His detachment is also reflected in the frustrated and disillusioned pupils he teaches, making this a melting pot of emotionally dysfunctional people. It's this very mirroring in the individuals that make this quite a thought provoking character study, as well as a diatribe on the state of the American educational system and the problems therein.\n Kaye shoots the film with an edgy, fly on the wall approach, utilising the shaky-cam technique and numerous close-ups that bring you closer to the characters and their inner turmoil. There's also the assembly of a very impressive cast, all-be-it, a lot of them are wasted in thankless, underwritten roles. The likes of Bryan Cranston, Blythe Danner and William Petersen needn't have turned up at all, but James Caan lightens the mood whenever he's onscreen and the young unknowns get a chance to shine instead; particularly (the director's daughter) Betty Kaye, who develops a crush on her teacher and Sami Gayle as a young prostitute who develops a similar infatuation. The real star, though, is a brooding and commanding Brody. He's rarely offscreen for the entirety of the film and even though it's no surprise that he delivers his usual reliability, he's especially good with a very powerful and charismatic performance. However, the cast and the impressive handling of the material can't save the film from being overly depressing, or when drawing to it's conclusion, descending into melodrama from which it never fully recovers.\n Cut from the same cloth as the, Oscar nominated, Ryan Gosling movie \"Half Nelson\", director Tony Kaye delivers a good insight into the difficulties of teaching and the importance of instilling a good childhood and sense of self in our youth.\n\nMark Walker",

Well-received at film festivals, it's less liked by critics but has a solid 7.6 rating on imdb.\n\nIt's depressing as hell. Quite a cast for this type of movie...really names throughout. Still, it's the young and inexperienced Sami Gayle who really steals the show. At first, I thought she would just be another lame prostitute character. She really turned into a great, great, moving character. Really a top-notch performance.\n\nI can see why the critics don't like the movie for its \"wallow in dime-store despair,\" but there is a lot of truth to what is being said, even if the circumstances are a little shallow/overdone/cliche. Brody returns to prime form, finally, as a bleeding heart sub teacher. But there is a lot of truth in that character who is unhappy but tries to accept others. Not a fan of Lucy Liu, and her big scene I thought was going to be horrible, but she basically said what I was thinking earlier while watching the movie...it's easy to be callous. It takes character and courage to care. \n\nThere are a couple great scenes. Really, a lot of them involving Gayle are great, but especially near the end. She if she doesn't rip your heart to shreds. Then Brody's handling of the final traumatic event. There is a certain touching of the face that I thought was just damn perfect. So all-in-all, it's a helluva downer flick. If you look at it on the surface, maybe it's much ado about nothing. But look at the characters and their interactions and it becomes a very true story about a very mean world and the struggle to survive in that world.",

I related to his sorrow at not being able to put a dent in the desperate need out there.

His feeling of invisibility...yet deciding to overcome the past injustices, the present injustices, and make slight changes for the better.  I highly recommend this movie.

But this would really defeat the power of this film - which would suggest that such a need is due only to ubiquitous assimilation - the result of a marketing holocaust. Instead, in true existential fashion, Kaye propels us to look within ourselves - to understand the true nature of our own existence despise all the darkness that may be required to do so. What the film strives for is reality; to provide a very truthful and honost impression of society. The result is a very poetic and stylised impression of a group of characters trying to find their place within a carnivores society and a flawed existence. The film is not only darkness, however, - there are a lot of beautiful moments, particularly in Henry and Erica's character arcs - and the life that is breathed into them - at least momentarily (but are these moments not enough?) or the way the film turns to literature, poetry and art as an ultimate salvation.",

He spends his days conveniently avoiding any and all emotional connections by never staying anywhere long enough to form an relationship, in school and out. Then a new assignment places him at a public school with a frustrated, angst filled student body, neglected by their parents, and some of their teachers. Henry soon becomes a role model to these scary, disturbed kids. In finding an unlikely emotional connection to the students, teachers, and a runaway teen he takes in from the streets, Henry realizes that he's not alone in his life and death struggles to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.\" To read the rest of this review, check out our site!! :) http://www.screensyndrome.com/review-detachment-2011/",

            "content": "I hope you do not detach yourself from my movie review of the drama \"Detachment\". But if you do, I punderstand I mean understand due to the numerous puns incorporated. \"Detachment\" stars Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes, a longtime substitute teacher who detaches himself from deep emotion due to a troubled past. Oh Henry! What could have happened? I will detach myself from revealing that because it does play a crucial factor in the film's narrative, and I do not want to spoil it for you. When he is transferred to another school, Henry's life begins to change due to the new people in his life. Henry befriends an attractive teacher colleague named Sarah Madison. A bullied female student named Meredith admires Henry due to his willingness to always help students in need. Henry also aids a young prostitute named Erica, and even allows her to stay in his place, with no sexual attachments required. Henry also constantly visits his ailing elderly grandfather. Henry is a good man. But when Meredith wants Henry to be a substitute of a father figure, and when Erica wants Henry to be a substitute of a lover figure, and when Grampa wants Henry to be a substitute of a savior figure, and when Ms. Madison falsely accuses Henry of being a substitute of a child molester figure, it puts Henry into a maximum stress level state. Director Tony Kaye, who also helmed \"American History X\", does more than an O Kaye job in presenting a story of a melancholy man trying to assist others while at the same time holding on to a dark past. Carl Lund's \"Detachment\" screenplay was a bit unorthodox but well-worded. Brody has not been this good in a starring role since his Oscar-winning turn in \"The Pianist\". Brody taught us a lesson that he can still act with his marvelous work as Henry! Yo Adrien, you did it! Christina Hendricks continues her rise to movie stardom with another well-rounded performance as Sarah Madison. Others in the supporting acting faculty that had passing grades included James Caan as veteran teacher Charles Seaboldt, Marcia Gay Harden as Principal Carol Dearden, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Wiatt, and Lucy Liu as Assistant Principal Dr. Doris Parker. Young actresses Sami Gayle who played Erica and Betty Kaye who played Meredith did show some promise with their performances, but still have to pass a few more tests to gain acting tenure. So my assignment for you is to go to your own personal homeroom and examine \"Detachment\". ****Good",

A GQ-suited Adrien Brody is good as the aforementioned sub, who doesn't care but actually REALLY does care about the lives of his temporary charges. I could have done without the boring is-he-or-isn't-he-a-molester grandpa subplot, but the film's central relationship between Brody's bummed-out teacher and an adolescent prostitute is surprisingly beguiling, given how hoary and cliche it is.\nBut too often, the small scattershot moments of emotional truth are bludgeoned to death by overreaching moments of near-comic travesty. (One teacher's wife won't even look at him when he comes home. Literally.) By the end, you'll be surprised there's only one suicide given how unspeakably terrible everyone's life is. A sad-teacher montage plays like an outtake from R.E.M.'s \"Everybody Hurts\" video shoot.\nI was actually surprised by how many good actors got sucked into this downbeat sulk-fest (is that Bryan Cranston as a toe-sucking WASP?). But just when everything seems lost, James Caan and Blythe Danner pop up as veteran teachers who know just how to deal with Kaye's teenage overkill: they make fun of it.",

Starring Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes on his first teaching day on possibly one of the worst schools in America full of students who happen to be misfits, criminals and mental issues and are getting away with their criminal behaviour because of they're underage and because their parents are ignorantly self indulgent.  Lack of funding for education blah, blah, blah- showcasing criminal situations that can either be thought up by newspapers or by writers coming up with this stuff themselves.  the person who's the center of all of this are well intentioned and goody goody Mr. Henry Barthes played by Adrien Brody who also happends to be the narrator as well.  Very hopeless film which law enforcement or government are never used as part of a solution to rectify any of the issues.  Although I struggled to watching this I was able to finish this film as a result of seeing some recognizable actors and just seeing them act such as Lucty Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks,Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston and James Caan. I felt detached by watching this.\r\n\r\n1 out of 4",

The only part I really didn't get was when he takes in a teenage prostitute and tries to set her straight. Poor acting on the girls behalf, a little weak in the writing. Could have been cut. At one point Brody is addressing his students and gives a very moving monologue, which I found profound and deeply unsettling, in a good way. Overall it was a good movie and would recommend.",

            "content": "Detachment is a sharp, pessimistic drama which ultimately engages, but also depresses. Desperate, artistic and sometimes filled with anger, this movie depicts the problems within the American school system in much better way than the usual school sagas. It actually develops into a broader criticism of the whole society and at some point the comparisons with American History X become inevitable.\r\n\r\nHenry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a gifted, but lonely teacher, who is completely devoted to his profession and assignments as a substitution teacher. He is sent to a public school, where lack of motivation, despair and frustration have created a poisonous school environment.  Barthes has the ability to engage and to captivate the attention of his students and soon he becomes a sort of role model for some of them, while he is facing further personal challenges. His life is a daily struggle against a non-working system, a system in which frustration and apathy have the central place. \r\n\r\nWhat Tony Kaye has achieved is the depiction of the non-working educational and social system in the US. Just like in his previous delivery American History X, he hits hard, not sparing the audience for a single moment. The whole pace is slow, filled with pessimism and anger about those abandoned children. The dramatic load in Detachment is surely  a result of the stunning leading performance of Adrien Brody, as well. His self-assured behavior, his ability and determination to find the strength to continue every day are performed in an unforgettable way and this becomes by no means Brody's best role since The Pianist.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, director Tony Kaye has shown that he knows how to successfully and convincingly  re-create the inconvenient reality. Unfortunately, the message in this movie is unclear, chaotic and based on idealism. There is no solution provided, even the criticism is as if it comes from an idealist: it's loud, it's emotional...but unclear. This feeling is strengthen by the \"too artistic\" approach taken by Kaye: the camera testimonials and the animated parts are appealing, but inefficient when it comes to conveying the whole message to the audience.\r\n\r\nDetachment is no doubt a drama to be seen. With incredible leading performance and a topic that hits hard in your face, you would be thinking about this movie long after its final credits.",

A truly realistic, heart-wrenching, and depressing film. The screenplay was written by Carl Lund, which is actually his first screenplay. I cannot wait to see what else this man will write, as this is one of the finest crafted scripts in quite some time. The story is brilliantly told, and flows in a perfect pace, with very powerful dialogue. The direction was done by Tony Kaye, who directed American History X, which in my opinion is one of the finest films ever made. Kaye directed this film quite stylistically, like he was wanting the cinematography to be well focused but having a feeling of being detached from everything. The film was led by an unflinching performance by Adrien Brody, who gives the second greatest performance of his career (just edging up behind his role in \"The Pianist\"), and it features a truly brilliant supporting cast consisting of Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, William Peterson, and Betty Kaye (who is the daughter of the director). I just cannot get over how powerful this film is, and how realistic it is. I must say that it is unlike any film I have ever seen in my life. \r\n\r\nTo conclude this sloppy review, \"Detachment\" is unlike anything I have witnessed, it is a very true to life, passionate, and disturbing film by a very talented director. What makes it even more chilling is that it correctly portrays modern high-school life. I highly recommend to all. Thanks for reading.",

Itâ(TM)s certainly his best performance since The Pianist, he inhibits his role completely, conveying depression, emptiness, and regret with every expression, every gesture. His work is the most unforgettable part of the film. He gives the film its authenticity, itâ(TM)s soul, itâ(TM)s identify. \n\nThe supporting performances are also strong, and uniquely portrayed by each actor. The smart script helps, with a good blend of intelligently written dialogue, characterization, and commentary. The emphasis is not so much on the system itself, rather the individuals actors within that system, and the hopeless and tragic cycle that is simultaneously the cause and a symptom of it.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, itâ(TM)s directed well, with good framing and a methodical pace. My only significant criticism of the film is the sometimes over-indulgent editing techniques, which sometimes distract from the scenes, with constant shifting.\n\nOverall, itâ(TM)s a memorable, thought provoking, look at the educational system, society, and the internal struggles we all deal with. \n\n4/5 Stars",

I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.\" \nâ\" Edgar Allan Poe (The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales )",

The movie most certainly had its moments, but on the whole the piece was overshadowed by some pretentiously cringe-worthy camera work and bleak writing.

A substitute teacher, Henry, is assigned to a high school where other teachers and staff feel completely helpless in controlling their students as well as the school itself. Henry has seemingly walked into a world that is crumbling around him. He's okay with that since he's spent most of his life being detached emotionally. Usually, if you're lucky enough, you have people in your life to teach you the complexities of the world and the people in it. Henry hasn't had anybody since his mother committed suicide. His grandfather is his only relative left and even he can't help Henry. His grandfather's mind is slowly going and eventually he'll be gone. Another reason for detachment when you know that you'll be alone.\n\nHenry is confronted with connections. A girl in his classroom who is as lonely as he, a runaway girl who prostitutes herself and a teacher who doesn't like being alone. It's up to him to connect with these three ladies, but he's so blocked emotionally that a connection to him would feel like a disillusioned folly. It's not easy since the pain of losing another person probably would be like being a drift in a sea of foreboding waters. You don't know what to expect in that isolation.\n\nThis film isn't exactly about the school system. It's partially about it, but leans more to the title of the film itself. It's not easy to get through since it's extremely depressing, but honest in it's depiction of a life prone to loss and self doubt and trying to detach yourself from all of that stuff. Even from the people who maybe feeling the same thing. An important movie.",

He is a sad man who experienced loss from a young age and continues to experience loss of self every day. He is pessimistic, but at the heart of every pessimist is a disappointed idealist. That seems to at least partially identify Henryâ(TM)s situation at the start of the film.\n\nHenry is starting work at a school in New York where the students do not respect the faculty and the faculty has all but given up. The very teacher he is substituting for ends up quitting while he is gone, and leaves phone messages in the office everyday, ranting and raving about the madness and dregs of the system. These fuming messages sound like sermons from a school in hellâ(TM)s deepest circle.\n\nThe rest of the disillusioned faculty includes the pill-popping Mr. Seaboldt (James Caan), the deeply frustrated guidance counselor Dr. Parker (Lucy Liu), Ms. Madison, a lonely teacher in denial of the severity of the situation around her, Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson), who feels invisible to the point of emotional numbness, and Principal Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), who will soon be fired.\n\nDearden knows of her imminent termination because a suit comes to her office to inform her quietly and calmly. She doesnâ(TM)t want to accept it, but it is inevitable, she is told. Her time is up. Later, when a real-estate\n\nKaye weaves this aura of inevitability throughout âDetachment,â? from the inevitable demise of individual characters to the philosophical crumbling of the education system. The events going on in this school are a dramatized portrait of reality, and that reality stems from the fact that the film was written by former public school teacher, Carl Lund, who takes great care in offering up questions without answers. \n\nWho is to blame for a failing school? Teachers? Parents? Students? The living environment of the students? Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions, playing the blame game, searching for answers that donâ(TM)t want to be found. That âDetachmentâ? inspires these questions is a testament to its significance, and one reason why it should not be lost in a sea of forgettable. Itâ(TM)s urgency and boldness have been criticized by other writers as âheavy-handedâ? and âself-important.â? But passion does not have to be dismissed, and Kaye and Lund clearly are passionate about their subject, and execute the story brilliantly.\n\nMore than anything, I think the school in âDetachmentâ? is an amalgamation of a multitude of issues going on in public schools. Henryâ(TM)s entrance into the school is a breathe of fresh air, as his lessons and ideas actually start to stimulate even the roughest toughest students. These scenes are more sincere and straightforward than any like them I have seen. Like the film itself, they do not offer clean solutions but small instances of hope in a system that has lost its way.\n\nAn important story parallel to Henryâ(TM)s teaching woes involves a relationship he forms with a teenaged prostitute named Erica (Sami Gayle). Henry takes her into his apartment and lets her stay there. Their relationship is never sexual and always mutual. She wants someone to take care of, and so does Henry.  He wants to help her, and treats her more like a foster daughter or niece, trying to take away her suffering and give her a new life off the streets.\n\nHenry also tends to his grandfather (Louis Zorich), who is senile and dying in a hospital. As the film goes on, we come to learn more about their relationship, and understand Henry more from his tragic childhood to his efforts as a substitute public school teacher, a position that is not permanent, and allows him go to many schools with many different students. \n\nArtfully shot by Kaye himself, âDetachmentâ? is a powerful cinematic experience. Few films I have seen have pushed me right to edge for most of the running time, and then left me dangling at the end credits, only to drop off with tears streaming down my face. Brody gives an amazing performance, and everyone else is in top form. This is not a perfect film, but it does not strive for perfection. âDetachmentâ? strives for emotionally raw, intimate portraits of imperfect human beings, and it succeeds. This is Kayeâ(TM)s best work.",

Later, when a real-estate\n\nKaye weaves this aura of inevitability throughout \"Detachment,\" from the inevitable demise of individual characters to the philosophical crumbling of the education system. The events going on in this school are a dramatized portrait of reality, and that reality stems from the fact that the film was written by former public school teacher, Carl Lund, who takes great care in offering up questions without answers. \n\nWho is to blame for a failing school? Teachers? Parents? Students? The living environment of the students? Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions, playing the blame game, searching for answers that don't want to be found. That \"Detachment\" inspires these questions is a testament to its significance, and one reason why it should not be lost in a sea of forgettable. It's urgency and boldness have been criticized by other writers as \"heavy-handed\" and \"self-important.\" But passion does not have to be dismissed, and Kaye and Lund clearly are passionate about their subject, and execute the story brilliantly.\n\nMore than anything, I think the school in \"Detachment\" is an amalgamation of a multitude of issues going on in public schools. Henry's entrance into the school is a breathe of fresh air, as his lessons and ideas actually start to stimulate even the roughest toughest students. These scenes are more sincere and straightforward than any like them I have seen. Like the film itself, they do not offer clean solutions but small instances of hope in a system that has lost its way.\n\nAn important story parallel to Henry's teaching woes involves a relationship he forms with a teenaged prostitute named Erica (Sami Gayle). Henry takes her into his apartment and lets her stay there. Their relationship is never sexual and always mutual. She wants someone to take care of, and so does Henry.  He wants to help her, and treats her more like a foster daughter or niece, trying to take away her suffering and give her a new life off the streets.\n\nHenry also tends to his grandfather (Louis Zorich), who is senile and dying in a hospital. As the film goes on, we come to learn more about their relationship, and understand Henry more from his tragic childhood to his efforts as a substitute public school teacher, a position that is not permanent, and allows him go to many schools with many different students. \n\nArtfully shot by Kaye himself, \"Detachment\" is a powerful cinematic experience. Few films I have seen have pushed me right to edge for most of the running time, and then left me dangling at the end credits, only to drop off with tears streaming down my face. Brody gives an amazing performance, and everyone else is in top form. This is not a perfect film, but it does not strive for perfection. \"Detachment\" strives for emotionally raw, intimate portraits of imperfect human beings, and it succeeds. This is Kaye's best work.",

If they were they missed it by a mile.  I think the movie is realistic even if it was a little dramatized.  I went to school in an upscale suburb of Washington D.C. Kids committed suicide from time to time. They sold drugs, they bullied teachers, they started fires in trashcans.  There was a teen-aged prostitution ring.  I knew a 14-year-old pregnant with her second child.  And all of this was in an upscale town where new homes cost 500,000+ and people drove shiny new cars and worked for the government.  I started high school as an honor student.   All the crap in this movie is why I dropped out.   The teachers were sad people who walked on eggshells and were despised if they cared. I despised their lack of authority and the fact that students could get away with being antagonistic to the teachers and pretty much all else.  My  German class once bullied our teacher to the point of tears.  He gave up and left after that.  I feel like going back and apologizing to all the teachers I left that year.\n\nThis film made me think I might be okay with not having kids after all.  I mean, unless I move to a country where people naturally respect each other more and are generally driven to work hard and take their studies seriously, I don't know how I can prevent my kid from becoming exactly like me or worse.  I definitely couldn't blame them if they wanted to drop out.  Many countries allow students to enroll in trade schools at 14 or 16 and really, that's all I wanted. To learn something useful.  To be allowed to learn what I wanted.  I love to learn, but I did not love that four-year prison sentence they call high school.  Some of my classrooms didn't even have windows.",

Although it is a bit too forward in it's messages at some points, Detachment is a powerful film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and moments in peoples lives in a society that is on the decay.  One of the best pictures of the year for me.",
