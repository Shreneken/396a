The journey takes Bilbo on a path through treacherous lands swarming with orcs, goblins and other dangers, not the least of which is an encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and a simple gold ring that is tied to the fate of Middle Earth in ways Bilbo cannot even fathom.",

While there were things missing or altered in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series most were understandable given the need to bring it into the medium of film and it was so beautifully done that I had little problem forgiving them. The Hobbit, however, really needed little to no omissions or changes from the original and was really Peter Jackson's chance to give a faithful adaptation of Tolkien's work, perhaps even one Tolkien's son Christopher would have approved of. Instead there were changes and additions galore that did little but extend the run time of the movies and butcher Tolkien's vision. While still cinematically beautiful and so wonderful to see Tolkien's world brought to life again, the often ridiculous changes and completely unnecessary additions made it painful to watch and often honestly just pissed me off. Unfortunately Peter Jackson will now forever be my tarnished Hero for bringing the Lord of the Rings to live action film so beautifully but then so utterly betraying that vision with the Hobbit.",

I particularly loved Bilbo, Gandalf and the Dwarf King and thought their relationships were very touching.  I happen to be very fond of British actors \u2014 I think they are more nuanced than American actors. Martin Freeman did an excellent job as Bilbo Baggins; he has such wonderful facial expressions. Of course Ian McKellan did his wonderful job as Gandalf, full of wisdom. Richard Armitage was great as Thorin Oakenshield, King of the Dwarves, his mad scenes were very convincing. Thumbs up for Poldark Actor, Aidan Turner as a love-struck Dwarf and Evangeline Lilly (Lost) as his beloved Tauriel the Elf. I especially liked the Elf King (Lee Pace); very regal and arrogant and of course Legolas, his son (Orlando Bloom). \n\nI have a debt of gratitude to Peter Jackson for creating all six of these films. They are family-friendly, inspiring and heart-warming. They speak of eternal truths like friendship, and loyalty and bravery, among so many other things that I appreciate. \n\nThank you all for the wonderful legacy you have left us in these films!",

The soundtrack was awesome. The cinematography was very good also with great intimate scenes and sweeping shots when needed seamlessly. The editing was well done also. The pacing suffered at points through the middle as it felt things were dragged out a lot at times. My biggest problem throughout this was how uneven the character development was outside of Bilbo & Thorin. Everyone else felt they just blended in which wouldn't be a big problem if not a lot of time was spent on them but a huge amount i. Also the special effects start to get a little too reliant on CGI and it feels oversaturated towards the ending. That being said though everything overall was solidly done despite the significant character problems, some pacing issues, some acting issues and special effects at the margins. A classic movie in the franchise for sure and a good start for sure.",

The soundtrack by Howard Shore is incredible. The cinematography is breathtaking and the story is great. The characters are all awesome. Very great start to the trilogy. What this movie lacked compared to the Lord of the Rings was that it felt so long, even though it's around the same length of the Lord of the Rings. The reason is that there isn't multiple storylines going on at once. It's just one story that we follow, whereas with Lord of the Rings we cut between Frodo and Sam to Aragorn and that crew and then to the hobbits. The many stories made the long length better. I don't think this movie should've been that long and definitely should've been trimmed down. Also because we have only one storyline with so many characters, so many of the dwarfs get excluded and we know nothing about them. Basically the only dwarf we know anything about is Thoran Oakenshield. Despite the flaws, this was a great movie.",

Yes there are great action scenes and wonderful sets filled with all kinds of eye candy and the many scenes depicting Bilbo and the Dwarfs, especially the meeting at Bilbo's home, are amazing and add some truly touching and funny scenes to the film.

The main character, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, goes on a big adventure with the dwarves to fight the big dragon Smaug and take back the dwarven castle. On their way there are many dangerous adventures, but they endure all difficulties and eventually win. Of course, I recommend other people to watch this movie.

The movie is long especially extended edition, but it has good action set pieces and the pace for me at least is pretty decent. \nThe biggest flaw for me is the humor does not always land and often comes off as forced for me and some of it is obviously targeted at a younger audience the atmosphere is a lot less dark than LOTR trilogy and more light adventure fantasy-style instead of a fantasy epic in this movie,but it works okay for this movie. Overall it's a very good addiction to LOTR lore and is pretty good well written fantasy movie with solid CGI and good acting while flawed if you are into LOTR lore and want to see more solid world-building it's worth watching atleast once. 10/10",

While there may be some truth to these claims, the films do not deviate as many would like to believe.  In the years following the publication of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien struggled with the idea of revising The Hobbit; many changes had already been made to the Riddles in the Dark chapter shortly before the release of LOTR, but he wanted to change it even more.  As is detailed in Tolkien's later drafts of The Hobbit, as well as a chapter in the Appendices of LOTR called \"The Quest of Erebor\", the author of the Middle-earth legendarium wanted to tie the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings together, to make it darker and more adult.  Tolkien would sadly never get to create this new version of The Hobbit; it was either discarded out of necessity or left unfinished after his death, but Jackson saw in these unfinished tales (pun intended) the path to making a faithful (in theme and message, not always literally) but fresh story.\n\nJackson has tied the rise of Sauron into The Hobbit trilogy, making the story feel grander and more epic.  Additionally, the improvements in modern CGI have allowed for beautiful vistas complimented by the superb acting skills of Martin Freeman, Ian McKellan, and Richard Armitage, and... everyone else in the film.  Nobody phones in a performance, not even the extras or body doubles.  The action is fantastic, taking on a more whacky and hilarious air than the LOTR films; this feels like the perfect way to tie in children's book to a great story of epic adventures (LOTR), because The Hobbit always felt disconnected with the themes of the rest of Middle-earth.  With Jackson, that is not present.  Everything about this film feels like an homage to Tolkien.  It is not a cash-grab, but a letter of admiration to all the fans of Middle-earth.  Despite its poor reception by less understanding or diehard critics, I feel this film truly honors The Hobbit.  Adaptations should not just repeat a book, they should build on them.  That is what Jackson does.",

The acting is good as usual, and the costume design and world building is as good as ever. However, the overdone CGI and need to make this film 3D really bogs this film down and takes away from the environment that made \"Lord of the Rings\" seem extremely aesthetically pleasing. Still, the story does a good job explaining the background of what was rumoured in \"Lord of the Rings,\" with some great action sequences. The amped up goofiness and childish jokes also bog this film down much more, yet it doesn't feel as terrible as the CGI and some of the plotlines. Overall, this adds a more childish addition in the \"Middle Earth\" franchise, though I don't really view that as bad as others might view it.

I actually loved the changes Peter made to flesh out the story into a trilogy; it did cause the runtime to bloat more than seemed necessary, but The Hobbit is actually one of the worst-written books I have ever read in my life and I've held that opinion since the first time I read it at age 12. If I hadn't read it myself I would have never believed that anyone, let alone a vaunted GOAT writer like Tolkien, had ever written a book whose entire purpose is building toward the excitement of the Dwarves' showdown with the dragon at the end, only to hastily cram in a different character in a single chapter and have him be the one to kill the dragon. My hatred of Bard the Bowman has colored my entire life since then, as I have a heightened sensitivity to perceived deus ex machina and I dislike Luke Evans as an actor because he played him. The only other gripe I have here is that Thorin was portrayed as rude, entitled and aggressive from the very beginning here, making his eventual heel turn completely unsurprising and his redemption arc ineffective at making me like the guy.

It has some well-choreographed action that makes creative use of the environment, it's visually dazzling and I know people have a problem with the overuse of CGI in these movies but this movie is innocent in that complaint and it's great seeing old locations like Rivendell and new locations as well as new creatures like goblins and it was a joy being back in middle earth, which is what I wanted. It can be funny and supenseful and a lot of amazing character moments like when Bilbo rescues Thorin and Howard Shore delivers an excellent score again. There's a lot of filler like the stuff with trolls and stone giants and it does drag in lots of places. There's no need for this to be nearly 3 hours long and it also lacks the suspense and stakes of the original series we're not 100% invested in the dwarves's journey as the consequences of failing won't be big.

Yes, it does a great job with world building and cinematography.  Even the acting and plot is well done.  But the fatal flaw here is it is trying to set up something that has already happened (Star Wars prequels, anyone?)  LoTR was an expansive world-ending extravaganza, whereas the Hobbit (at least the book) was supposed to be one quiet hobbit's experience with the outside world.  The movie flips that all around and makes the Hobbit quite a big more expansive (and longer) than maybe it should have been.  Doing this movie first, and scoping it (for die hard fans) probably would have helped.  But still an excellent film.",

As for the casting, I like 'em. Martin Freeman (Bilbo) is, like Elijah Wood, an actor I've always found hit-and-miss, but I really did enjoy Freeman's performance here - the humour is his usual schtick, though the rest of his showing is strong.\n\nIan McKellen (Gandalf) returns and is as much a joy to watch as before. None of the others, though all good, stand out massively, James Nesbitt (Bofur) does bring decent comedic stuff.\n\nHopefully the two sequels to this are just as fantastic!",

There's a lot of whimsy and humor that's not in the later Lord of the Rings films, and that lets it be more true to the source material than the initial LoTR film trilogy was. That aside, it's a beautiful high budget movie with good acting and enough comically implied brutality that's become a Jackson staple in his action movies. It still feels too long and takes a long time to get its little feet moving. Also, what's up with Gandalf's makeup? I always liked that they include the singing.",

I also appreciate the emphasis on family, in that each dwarf has at least one other close family member along for the ride, and therefore more of a vested interest in the overall journey. It makes it that much easier to empathize with them, I think, since not all of us have close friends or significant others, but we all have families. Furthermore, none of the families are 100 percent perfect, but that makes them all the more relatable because come on, is there really such a thing as a perfect family?

There was terrific action pieces in it, but they were so few and far between. Many of the old characters you liked how they were revealed. The new characters, there was only two of three of them that mattered. What's revealing is that you can't figure out who's who. What's their ability, and why are we rooting for them. Basically it's like the background characters only they aren't given much to deal with. You sort of figured you'd be rooting for them eventually, but after watching all three you didn't really care about them at all. Basically, it's the Dwarve characters. They were just there and that was it. The story is thinly brought out in an already short book. Nevertheless, it has real good moments in it and it should've been two movies instead of three.
