However, the team's cover is blown, and Tama offers sanctuary to every criminal in his high-rise apartment block in exchange for the cops' heads. Now Rama must take command and lead his remaining team on an ultraviolent charge through the building to complete -- and survive -- the mission.",

They knew the building was a fortress with an army of goons and yet they send such a tiny squad of men, most of jerks and only one can fight.  There's a reason why everyone only talks about the fights because there isn't much of a story.  It's not horrible but it's not good either.  No where near as good as \"Dredd\".

Garett Evans' filmmaking and fight choreography are brilliant.   The film grips you from the first moment and does not stop.

The fights are so well choreographed, all the strikes, be it with the, hands, legs or weapons seem like they actually have weight behind them and hurt. There are some pretty brutal scenes, so I do not recommend watching this with the average girlfriend/wife because mine didn't enjoy it at all due to the graphic, well shot, in your face violence. It's bloody as all hell and I will never look at a fluorescent tube the same way. The story is ricepaper thin, it's functional, just there to give the characters some motivation but it doesn't really need one. The story is almost exactly the same as Dredd, locked in a building full of gang members looking to kill the swat team that wanted to Raid them. The swat team gets almost completely wiped out in a short time making Rama (Iko Uwais) having to fight his way to the top of the building, to find the man they came for, a gang leader/slum lord and arrest him, in order to unlock the building allowing the few men left a chance to escape with their lives. That's it, a synopsis of the entire plot, there are some twists along the way but that's the gist of it. It's not very story driven, and that's fine. This is like very violent fast food, it'll satisfy your hunger, but anything consumed directly after it seems less tasty. It has some tense scenes that are pretty ingenious, like hiding behind a fake wall while some gang member is randomly ramming a machete in it looking for the few surviving swat members, or a pitch black stairwell where some heavily armed gang members are just a few feet away from the swat team, on different floors listening and watching for any sign of movement or sound to open up on them. This movie knows how to create tension and does it very well by keeping the pace pretty slow during these scenes, it ramps up dramatically during the hand to hand fights which are some of the best fights you'll see in a movie period! This movie did ruin the John Wick movies for me, the fist John Wick still holds up pretty well compared to this, but those sequels don't. Both of \"The Raid\" movies are just more visceral, dirty and raw than those. So if you like unflinching violence, actors that are real fighters and non stop action this is the movie for you, just don't make it the first action movie of the evening if you plan a movie night, because almost every action movie will seem kinda tame, or slow after this.",

            "content": "The Raid is one of the most engaging Action films ever made, featuring a very simple but very effective premise, excellent lighting and cinematography, absolutely amazing fight/shootout sequences and a strong dedication of Show-Don't-Tell storytelling.  What makes this film unique is that it's the only Action movie I can think of that plays out almost like a Horror film -- There have been Action/Horror films in the past, but all other examples I can think of are Horror films that play out with loads of Action, rather than an Action movie that often times plays out like a Horror film.  The Characters are in a situation more bleak than I can think of when compared to virtually any other Action film, and because of this, the Action sequences play out with an unparalleled vigor and desperation, and this makes them far more brutal than almost any other Action film I can think of.  The hero, played by the charismatic Iko Uwais, fights like a trapped animal doing things like slashing attackers' legs and arms open to take them out the equation as quickly as possible, as he is assaulted in all directions in a few sequences, so this works narratively as well as cathartically, and the fact that it's all executed by groups of people that perform it in such a complex manner with perfect timing makes it worth seeing if just because each fight, like classic Jackie Chan fights, are almost like multi-person Rube Goldberg machines.  And that is why I recommend this movie to everyone -- If you don't appreciate it for the intense atmosphere or the brutal and satisfying action, then you can at least appreciate the craftsmanship behind the film's execution, and the fact that this was made for $6M only makes it more impressive (for reference, Justice League, on average, cost $2.5M per minute of runtime..).  It's intense, it's fast-paced, it has some good twists and it leaves you incredibly satisfied, especially upon subsequent re-watchings.",

            "content": "The most brutal action film this decade.\n\nGareth Evans' Indonesian action crime thriller The Raid (2011) is an insane festival of carnage. Evans' direction is impeccable as he rivets you with creative ways to shoot essentially one long action sequence within one apartment complex. Evans' direction takes you on a police raid into a crime lord's hideout building, cutting between extended hand to hand combat and outrageous shootouts in equal violent splendor. The Raid is super entertaining and an intense watch. Gareth Evans' editing actually makes sure that The Raid does not waste a single minute of its solid 101 minutes with his slick barebones crime drama that leads to endless fights.\n\nI have to hand it to the entire stunt team for The Raid for pulling off the two against one fight in the meat locker that goes on and on with unbelievable athleticism and intensity. It's been years since I've seen action scenes as exciting, cool, and dangerous as The Raid. You'd have to watch the John Wick series or classic Jackie Chan Police Story films for such exhilarating action. You really need to see The Raid.\n\nIko Uwais is incredible as the fit, young police recruit who ends up single handedly taking on scores of bad guys in unreal knife and hand to hand combat sequences. His martial arts are very impressive, similar to Donnie Yen or Tony Jaa. Joe Taslim is great as the police commander Jaka with a crazy hand to hand choreographed sequence against the fearsome Yayan Ruhian's Mad Dog. Yayan is outstanding and the standout actor in The Raid. His villain Mad Dog is so fast, ferocious, and exhausting that you are amazed that he can pull off absurdly fast kicks and punches. He's jaw dropping in The Raid. Donny Alamsyah is equally impressive as the fierce Andi with brutal fights.\n\nMatt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono's cinematography is awesome as I don't know how they managed to film any of the fight sequences in The Raid. The close up hand held camera makes you feel like you are stuck in this hectic building with the cops, while the steady camera shots down hallways are very pretty and engaging. The fast wide shots during combat is stunning with excellent editing from Gareth Evans for the fights.\n\nI have to mention that it is extremely cool that Gareth Evans got Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park to compose the score for The Raid. His blend of hip hop, industrial, electronica, and classical work wonders for the suspense and intensity of The Raid's atmosphere.\n\nStop whatever you are doing and watch The Raid!",

The fights are, generally, good enough to carry the picture single-handedly. They're intense and climactic, from the manic four-on-one rumble that kicks off the pandemonium to the nigh-invincible boss battle that concludes it. There's a jarring sense of harsh finality to The Raid, with a steady stream of weaponry in play and every duel culminating in a killing or crippling blow. There's no limping off, bruised ribs in-hand, to fight another day... these guys are visibly finished.\n\nIn lieu of a deeper, less generic plot, it's that brutal efficiency which gives the film its identity.

            "content": "The Raid is a movie about a SWAT team that goes on a mission to infiltrate an apartment complex controlled by a drug dealer. This ultimately proves to be a dangerous, possibly suicidal mission for them all. It is very light on plot, because other than one kid who\u2019s new to the team and his connection with someone in the building, there isn\u2019t much to the story beyond what I described. However, the movie isn\u2019t all about story, it\u2019s all about action. The Raid moves at a break-neck pace, as we are bouncing from one brutal Kung Fu fight to the next. The fight choreography is stellar, and Iko Uwais is a force to be reckoned with. I appreciate that he was powerful in a fight, but it also felt like he was fallible and might not survive, so there was always a risk factor. The other actor who stood out was Yayan Ruhian who plays a ruthless killer nicknamed Mad Dog. His intensity was a sight to behold, and he almost sold me on the tired clich\u00e9 of a man who wants to kill with his bare hands even when he has someone dead to rights with a gun. It seems somewhat obvious that Alex Garland cribbed some things from this film when he wrote the screenplay for Dredd that came out the following year. Both have a similar setup, but I actually preferred what Dredd did slightly more. I thought that film utilized the setting and had better variety in the threats they faced. While the fights in The Raid are awesome, it is almost all a flurry of punches and kicks which can start to feel like you\u2019re watching a video game instead of a film with a story. It\u2019s a great game, though. My only other complaint with The Raid is the ending. I was hoping for a satisfying conclusion to wrap it all up, or a surprising reveal that changed the nature of the entire film. It didn\u2019t deliver on that, instead it was a fairly straightforward ending and a somewhat bland send-off for our heroes. But none of my problems with the film were significant because the movie accomplished what it was aiming to do. The Raid is a thrilling film that takes you on a brutal journey and leaves you practically out of breath at the end, as if you had been involved in some of the action too.",

One minute in and our main character is punching, elbowing and kicking a sand bag at 100mph. Bam! I was ready to sit back and watch a heck load of hand combat unfold. 40 minutes later, still no hand combat scenes...I was growing agitated. Thankfully though, the film turned around and our main character was battling his way through using only his body and knives. I'm talking full annihilation. Complete decimation. The residents did not stand a chance! Wham! Bam! Kapow! Swish! Slice! Followed by continuous noises as our characters fights to death. \"Ah! Ehh! Phwoarrr! Hai! Ohhh!\"...you get the gist. The action is pretty relentless, well executed and rapid. The choreography is insane. INSANE! There is one scene where two good guys are against one bad guy (apologies for the bland description) that goes on for six minutes. I have never seen so much flipping, kicks to the head, jump punches and head smashes to the floor...in my life. The bad guy in that scene is like the Indonesian Terminator, he just wouldn't die. The directing was good overall, not many quick cuts although the camera was particularly shaky during the first half. My problems with the film are with the plot conveniences and predictability. I don't really want to dive into it for spoiler reasons but if our main character is in a tricky situation, something would always happen to get him out. Any \"twists\" that were executed, were predictable and poorly constructed. Also some fight scenes in rooms have all the furniture right next to the walls, therefore leaving a massive open space for the fight. I would like to have seen them use the furniture to their advantage. Plus, I literally just watched it and don't know the main character's name. At all. Greatest action movie ever? No, but it's good!",

            "content": "I actually missed this first time around and didn't watch it till very much later after it's general release. In fact, only hearing about it because of the hype that came after. You could easily been mistaken and think it's a martial art version of Pete Travis' Dredd in 2012 but no, The Raid was released some months before. In fact, the Dredd film was already in production before The Raid, by four months, but The Raid Director didn't get wind of their story until they were already in post-production. I still think of this as a recent release, like a couple of years old and yes, it kinda is but I actually find it hard to believe this came out before Dredd, and that was five years ago! \n\nIt's not the first to receive such after-hype success either. The Thai film Ong Bak and the French parkour film District 13 that both came out in 2003 both probably received greater admiration after their general releases, once the hype had got around. District 13 even getting a poor American remake as Brick Mansions. This film has some slight similarities to District 13 in terms of premise, and of you haven't seen it yet I suggest you add it to your watchlist if you're an action junkie. \n\nWhat is different from the above mentioned films, is the person behind the camera. Different being he's not native to the film's country of origin, that being Indonesia. Gareth Evans is a Welsh director, writer and screenwriter who graduated from the University of Glamorgan with a MA in scriptwriting for Film and Television who went on to receive high acclaim for his short film Footsteps which got awarded best film at the Swansea Bay Film Festival in 2006. His next project was a documentary about Pencak Silat, the recognised fighting style of Indonesia and this is where he met  the stars his next venture, his main feature in Indonesia, Merantau in 2009. And then, the Welshman brings us this. \n\nYou can tell Evans is a massive fan and great appreciator of the genre, his vision being perfect using clever and intense angles that increases the tension. The suspense is almost borderline horror when waiting to be discovered. I remember actually holding my breath during specific scenes. \n\nThe premise seems simple and done before, about a elite police task force carrying out a raid on a building block that is protected by the inhabitants of thugs and gangsters, and it's crime lord Tama, played by legendary Indo actor, Ray Sahetapy, who lives on the top floor. He's the target for their mission, but ends up as some crazy, brutal fight for survival. Our protagonist is Rama, of the elite police agents played superbly by Iko Uwais showing incredible skill that appears to rival other kung fu greats like Jet Li or Tony Jaa. Yes, we've seen it before with films like Die Hard or Under Siege and though Evans had more aspirations for the film, time and budget was a major factor. So, a single location was ideal. \n\nIt looks like a typical martial art, kung fu flick on the surface, but Evans' use of camera angles and the editing actually boast more of the western style of fighting films. There's no double takes like we see in Jackie Chan or Jet Li films which emphasises what's going on but instead it's more like the Bourne films where the fighting is furiously fast and violent. Editing in the traditional Hong Kong  style would have only ruined the overall effect. The camera work here is astonishing, creating seamlessly, fluid sequences which must have taken quite some planning and choreographing. There's running shots, rotation shots, close-ups, overhead and tracking shots all perfectly captured and cut together. There's some slow-mo, but again, it's used to create a different effect of looming death as oppose to exaggerating action.\n\nThe fighting is some of the best I've ever seen on screen, and I've seen a fair amount of decent fight scenes. And there's more than a few incredible sequences worth a mention. The initial corridor brawl, the coke factory fight and especially Mad Dog's fights. They're so fast but still perfectly lucid making each blow make it's impact, but this could be because the fighting is real, yes choreographed, but because of time and budget again being a factor, many fight sequences meant the stars actually going for it; mostly without protection. \n\nMad Dog is played by Yayan Ruhian who incidentally taught Pencak Silat, the Indonesian martial art, to both the Indonesian military police corps and the presidential security forces in his younger years, also helped choreographed this film along side Uwais and Evans. You can't doubt the man's talent and his character reminds me greatly of John Woo's Mad Dog in Hard Boiled. Possibly the most lethal and dangerous character, an antagonist, but has a code and a strong sense of honour about him. \n\nIko Uwais wasn't an actor when he met Evans whilst during them researching for the Silat documentary. He was a telephone salesman who happened to be one of the students practising. Evans and his wife was so impressed they approached him and the rest is history. Talk about being in the right place at the right time. \n\nThe rest of the cast are superb, with a mention of Joe Taslim who plays the police sarge. Some of you might recognise him from Fast 6 as one of Shaw's henchmen, the one that fights Roman and Han at the London train station. This is definitely a film that has got these people noticed, and rightly so. Uwais and Ruhian even got cameos in The Force Awakens as space pirates. \n\nThere's actually a little more to the film than just bloody violence. There's a working storyline offering a little more than the basic raid premise. Some sibling rivalry, some interesting characters and even a slight sting but seriously, it's all about the action that just doesn't let you catch your breath. \n\nAlso what really works here is the score, a collaboration between Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese. The music really gives the film a great essence of suspense and heightens as the violence increases to an eventual bloody climax. It's certainly one of the most noticeable scores for an action film of this calibre. \n\nIt's an immediate classic that deserves all the praise of gets. Plus, I see it as a great tribute to the Martial Art genre. \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 9\nStory: 8\nScript: 7\nCreativity: 9\nSoundtrack: 9\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a total refreshing addition to the Martial Art genre. \n\n89% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

We follow an Indonesian SWAT team as they break into a fortress-like tenement building that is home to a notorious criminal/drug dealer.  Once the action starts, it never lets up - hundreds of baddies pour out of every doorway and stream down every hall.  The ultra-violence quotient is cranked up impossibly high - blood spurts and squirts everywhere and the martial arts fighting (Pencak Silat) is rough and brutal; this film is not for the squeamish.  However, you'll probably find yourself thinking more about the stunt coordinator and the mechanics of making the action look realistic than worrying about the real hurts involved.  Still, the ruthlessness is a downside for me, as I much prefer the Jacky Chan-style of fighting film with some comic relief thrown in for good measure.  Then I can enjoy the choreography without grimacing too much.  Here, the relentlessness can be rather grinding (and the thumping soundtrack heightens the effect); you also have to wonder (and worry?) whether there are people who get off on the violence of it all.  Nevertheless, if you are looking for a visceral rush and can look past the broken bones and machetes to the throat, this is a taut action film.",

            "content": "Martial arts has always been a fascination to the world at least in the movies since Bruce Lee's foray into Hollywood. The same enthusiasm has been carried forward by Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa and the likes in their own style while adapting to changing times. Thus far, the primary combination has always been that of martial arts, modern technology and modern crime world along with a healthy dose of PG entertainment thrown in with occassional fantasy setups and animation. With 'The Raid: Redemption', it is taken to a whole new territory of gore, grit and overall graphic violence which marks a definitive shift in its target audience while putting the Indonesian movie industry in the global map of cinema along the way.\n\nRama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie in the tactical police team which has been assigned to engage a crime syndicate operating from an apartment building. The team is led by Jaka (Joe Taslim) based on the intel procured from Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) and the operation was expected to be quick and silent. The mob boss Tama (Ray Sahetapy), his muscle Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) and brain Andi (Donny Alamsyah) along with a huge network of spotters (generally children), surveillance cameras and mercenaries was underestimated by the tactical team. The whole operation goes downhill as soon as it starts with body count rising and a never ending barrage of bad guys popping up in every corner. Rama and Wahyu have their own agenda amid all the chaos. Can they make it out alive?\n\nYou get a similar scenario as that of 'Black Hawk Down' where a large and sophisticated military team go into Somalia for a quick and clean mission but end up losing many men and the rest scared and desperate to get back in one piece. 'The Raid' isn't about getting back in one piece but to pursue on relentlessly and at the same time playing for the masses every opportunity it gets. The graphic violence and the gore is on another level compared to movies of this genre. Even though there are a lot of gun battles, there are even more fist and knife fights which is where things get murkier. Skulls crushed, arms and legs broken, spines twisted, jaws cracked, torsos slashed and blood everywhere. Definitely not your average action movie. \n\nConsidering the entire story is just the movie's namesake - a raid, even though the twists, revelations, human relationships etc. are all projected with the right intensity and strategically timed - it is the visual display of those martial arts combined with graphic violence that wins big for it. The action choreography is very innovative where the kicks and punches come in lightening pace and bodies are crushed in ways a normal viewer wouldn't have imagined. Complementing it is the excellent cinematography where each kick and punch is captured and projected with the maximum intensity for genre audience's pleasure. Generally the acting in Asian movies are a little overboard, but 'The Raid' makes sure the standard is very different from normal by maintaining the correct tone and the actors are to be commended for it. With a short runtime, crisp screenplay and enough twists in the script to keep the viewer engaged, the movie is a complete package for whoever can stomach the gore and violence.\n\nNot your average martial-art themed action flick, but every other can become a child's play after seeing this.",

The movie clocks in at 1 hour 40 minutes and has action for over an hour.

The overall story of the movie is a bit unoriginal and doesn't really keep you guessing, with the exception of a plot twist towards the end of the movie, but it's kinda what you would expect from a movie like this.

Their orders, to take down crime lord Tama. It sounds simple enough but Tama offers a safe haven for any notorious and dangerous criminal who can pay along with the civillian residents.  So almost everyone in the building is ready to stop the incoming force.  When most of the team are eliminated it falls to Rama to find a way out back out of the building alive.  Rama also has a vested interest and is in no rush to escape.\nIt sounds mad to say that this is directed by a welsh man, Evans, and set in Indonesia but it works brilliantly.  As most of the reviews say it really is non stop action from start to finish.  it's jam packed with gun fights, knife attacks and some extremely dynamic martial arts sequences.  Yes some of the violence may seem over the top but it's totally at home here.  The movie only lulls briefly from the action to build tension into the next succession of action.\nSuperbly made with a decent but not over complicated plot The Raid rages across the screen and is fully entertaining.  The sequel will have a lot to do just to match the body count!",

            "content": "''The Raid: Redemption'' is an indonesian made martial arts/action thriller that is all about violence. All violence. Wall-to-wall violence. Against many of those walls, heads are pounded again and again into a pulpy mass. If I estimated the film has 15 minutes of dialogue, i think i would be generous. \nBut then again, what does my opinion matter, it is highly rated on every movie critic site on the planet and it is hailed as a breakthrough for martial arts.\nI dont mind violence at all, nor do i mind a movie that tells its story visually, but the director (Gareth Evans) doesnt take the effort to make it a well-made film, it's basically 100 minutes of non stop action, with no plot, no characters, barely any dialogue, and just constant hard-driving, butt-kicking, pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, skull-smashing, bloodcurdling and largely a hand-to-hand, fist-to-face, foot-to-groin battle, with a few machetes and guns tossed in for good measure. Which is a formula Evans clearly knows is a large audience for, hence the obviously high ratings, and movies like this just dont entertain me at all. It's basically you watching a well-made realistic martial arts mission-type video game.\n\nDetailed criticism: Why does the movie establishes that the ''lead role'' is a muslim in the beginning of the film? They do nothing at all with it after the opening scene. It seems pointless, except as a cheap, failed attempt in some sort of character development. But it is pointless to even attempt at something like that, no one in the film has a personality, they are all relentless fighters with no brain in their heads. \nAnother cheap plot point that was extremely predictable: one of the gangsters that is helping the drug lord that is camping out in this massive squat, is Rama's brother (The ''leading man''). Thus it is ofcourse inevitable that they eventually will hold each other's lives in their hands and resolve deep childhood feelings to their satisfaction at the end of the film, and that they obviously both survive and go their ways in the end...\nLike i said, ''The Raid: Redemption'' is basically a well-made video game: a ruthless fighter stands in a corridor and destroys an enemy. As the enemy falls, another jumps into position from around corner, ready to be destroyed in turn. Then another, and another. It's like they're being ejected by an automatic victim dispenser.\nAnother small detail: What the hell does \"Redemption\" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is \"redemption\" just one of those title words like \"reloaded\" or \"destiny\" to help people tell movies apart? Seems a bit stupid in my humble opinion, but i think i read somewhere that Gareth Evans is making the third installment of the Raid trilogy (yay) and he said that the 3rd film will take place before the first ''Raid'', so probably something will happen in that film that needs redeeming..\n\nAnother thing, this movie is inconsistent and unrealistic as hell, not just because something ridiculous like this would NEVER happen, but also because most people they ''kill'' go down by just getting kicked in the stomach, or getting slammed into a wall, or getting dropped on a table, and then there is a final fight with ''Mad Dog'' where he continues to fight for at least 5 minutes whilst having a fluorecent tube stuck in his neck, and before that he's been kicked and punched to absolute pulp. But he just continues to fight. \nIt's inconsistent as hell\n\nThe only reason i gave it a 2/5 instead of giving it lower, is simply because, i can't deny that the stunts and fight choreography isnt fantastic, and the way they killed (some) people was quite creative.\n\nAll in all, movies like this simply dont entertain me, no depth, no story, no characters and just constant neck-breaking action, but that's what it's meant to be. Something like this just doesnt quite suit me.\nCan't dare expect the redemption from the sequel for what I found lacking here. Yet I guess I'll give it a go. (yay)\n\"The Raid: Redemption\" will be most successful for people with A.D.D. or just generally short attention spans, but then again, that's what it's aimed at.",

This is Pencak Silat, a unique and brutal knife fighting technique developed in the island regions from which they hail. I must admit I had never heard of it before I saw this movie, and most of my martial arts film collection focuses mainly on Japanese and Chinese cinema with a few Thai films here or there, but this one blew me away.\n\nThe story is about a SWAT team entering a small and dilapidated apartment complex run by one of Jakarta's most brutal drug lords. Every resident is a victim, dealer, or criminal, and every room is rented. They are here under the command of their Lieutenant, in a 20 person unit headed to the top floor to bring down the leader of this loose organization and bring him to justice, or so they think. You are introduced to Rama at the beginning, a man who trains hard, has a wife, a police officer and SWAT unit member with some experience. He has heart, and you get that right from the start, but there is something about him that he hasn't told anyone is his unit, and it's a secret he must keep. The leader of the unit is head strong and sure fire, but things don't go as planned and what follows is a non-stop battle of knives, guns and fists throughout.\n\nThis movie is a absolute must for actions fans. Even if you don't like foreign cinema, this movie has a lot to teach Hollywood in terms of how you don't need a huge budget to create a fantastic film. Interestingly enough, the movie 'Dredd' (2012) with Karl Urban, came out about a year later. Some critics noticed the similarity in plot between the two films, with 'The Raid-Redemption'(2011) only coming out only a year before. The plot devices are so similar, that the movies could have been interchangeable if not for the characters, time-line, and budget. If you watch those films back to back (I did), you might be surprised at just how these two movies match up in terms of story, events, and theme. Both have cops raiding and apartment, both have drug lords ordering the residents to go after the cops, both films have their character's allegiances tested in similar ways, and both have a floor by floor filming style as they ascend their way to the top level.\n\nAlthough not known for it's movie production and cinematic influence (outside of a few notable documentaries), Indonesia has a lot to be proud of with this film. This one proudly stands right up there at the top. I would certainly love to see more of these actors and their unique style of fighting come out of their homeland.\n\nNon-stop Action From Start to Finish.\n\n4/5",

Run by a ruthless drug kingpin, its not long before the halls are littered with with his army of killers and thugs. \n\nGareth Evan's noisy blood lusting crowd pleaser is a stylistic throwback to the grind house genre. It is expertly paced with ferocious tenacity. Evan's never runs out of inventive ways to kill somebody. \n\nA little late to the party with this one... let's not lie, we all have that list of movies that we know we should have seen, but haven't yet. Action is a tricky genre to hold my interest, most times I find it becomes repetitive and uninteresting. Fortunately, The Raid does not fall into that trap. The Raid is a true triumph of marital arts choreography, the camera work dances around the fight sequences in long wide combative takes. The scores pulsing synth does well to play embellish the playful use of set design allows the camera to impressively follow the action everywhere it goes - dropping through floors, circling around doorways and walls. \n\nThe plot is simple enough, get in, get out. It doesn't weigh down what the film is really about. A showcase of the impressive martial art of pencak silat. My only question for the film would be in the title itself. The Raid: Redemption? Who or what is redeemed? \n\nThe Raid: Redemption is brutal and bloody. So relentless in its action, it's a never ending visual spectacle.",

While the villain in this film is a bit underwhelming, the action is brutal and terse throughout. The setting is a giant apartment complex, full of impoverished tenants, tens of hit men, and a small army of police officers. Every action sequence includes intense bouts of kung Fu fighting, gunplay, and gruesome violence. What set this apart from other action films is its use of setting in the action, and the sadness of the characters' impotence in the face of this huge, immovable villain. He really is underwhelming, because the film starts with the raid itself, and gives very little background as to why he must be taken down. Still, watching the fighting by the main officers, and knowing the stakes for them to get out alive, really drove the action forward.

The Story follows a young man named Rama, who is the newest edition to a SWAT team tasked with raiding a run down apartment complex in order to bust a powerful crime lord. Shit hits the fan, and soon the team finds themselves in an all out slaughter between themselves and the swarming army of thugs and killers. The story is incredibly fast paced, wasting no time introducing the characters, and throwing you straight into the action. One would think that this would sacrifice character development and emotion, but it honestly doesn't feel like it. Through the entire affair, you'll remember the character's faces, and root for them the entire way. The action sequences are completely mind-blowing. Not in their SFX, but just in the sheer grit and brutality they display. Everything is extremely well choreographed and shot, WITH NO SHAKY CAM! I didn't even know it was possible at this point to have a fight scene with smooth, beautiful cinematography, that actually allows you to see the action on screen. It's enough to move any action junky to tears.\nBottom line, if you're an action movie fan, then this is a must see. This little film puts most of its blockbuster HollyWood counterparts to shame.",

Bad guys in a building, on many floors, and their boss lives in the penthouse suite. Sure there's some extra intrigue involving corrupt police, and siblings working on both sides of the law, but at the end of the day, The Raid is mostly about the action!\n\nOn that front, this film is quite frankly amazing, and is clearly a movie made by an avid fan of the action and martial arts genres. Writer, director, film editor, fight choreographer and Everton* supporter! Gareth Evans has clearly taken a look around at the shoddy action offerings we've had to endure over the years and said, 'enough!' He's crafted a simple yet effective narrative that allows for all forms of mutilation and mayhem, then simply let his talented performers and stunt people do their thing.\n\nI loved how the hand-held camera work panned and snapped into place over the action, and how the fight sequences were intelligently edited to allow each martial artist time to demonstrate their skills. There was a great artistry to how each set piece developed too. First the quiet before the storm, as the players in the next battle assemble and take their positions. All this is beautifully lit too by the way, as we wait for the spark that will ignite the action. On one occasion, that spark was an ultra slow-motion blast from a shotgun, and the way it exposed a group of police officers as shadows against a wall, right before all bloody hell broke loose, was just amazing to watch.\n\nI would also be remiss not to mention the lead in this fantastic film, Iko Uwais. Amazing to watch in the film's many fight scenes, Iko also brings a great vulnerability to his role as the honest cop, in over his head. He's someone you can root for, which makes all his hard-fought victories, and this film, that much more satisfying.\n\n* Everton Football Club, England.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're an action and martial arts film fan, then I think you're going to really enjoy this film. For those that care less about this genre, expect rapid well filmed inventive action and brutal violence. This movie most certainly wears its R rated badge with pride!\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a great film to watch in the theater, but at home a HD viewing on a nice big TV is the way to go. It would be a great film to watch with friends too. Watching this on a laptop, tablet or phone is not advised.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nCertainly the close quarter action scenes are the main reason to see this film, and out of those, I really enjoyed the sequence in the drug lab. There's a great battle involving the character Mad Dog a little later on, but the lab sequence really used the space well, and provided plenty of walls and props to use as weapons!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/the-raid-redemption-2012/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

The riffs of the shredding guitar of that song, is identical to the full blast action of \"The Raid: Redemption\". Definitely the most bad ass Asian action flick of 2012.I mean it has the most intense and brutal close quarter combat in a film. A nail bitter, very gripping, bone crunching and \"on the edge of the seat\" moments that has an intense action scenes that you had never seen before. It's hard to watch sometimes. Like for instance, the chopping scenes where the knife daggers beneath thru others body parts. And you can still hear its sound. It's violent as hell. The only issues I can see throughout are those shaky cams, it would be better if they use steady cams instead. It's more of an action rather telling its story, yet the actors are good in acting in terms of dramatization. The action scenes are well choreograph with well made executions of martial arts moves. For action movie aficionados, this will feed your apatite 100%. 4.5/5.",

Featuring some intense, high-stakes action sequences, \"The Raid\" succeeds at delivering thrills. In turn, it establishes itself as one of the finest action films ever made.\n\nAs the film begins, we are quickly introduced to rookie cop Rama, whose wife is pregnant with their first child. We soon learn that his S.W.A.T team has been assigned to take down one of Jakarta's most ruthless crime lords. The elite group of cops quickly (and silently) begin to raid the crime lord's apartment building, but they are soon discovered and one exciting, extended action sequence unfolds before our eyes.\n\nFor starters, the film is captured perfectly by some impressive camera work, which always helps to keep us in the midst of the action. The background music also adds to the tension and is never distracting. The editing is also top-notch as well, which is unlike many of today's action films. All too often, the editing in these films will slack and the action scenes will become an incomprehensible mess. Thankfully, that is not the case in \"The Raid.\"\n\nThe film's only weak spot, however, is its plot, which is a bit half-baked. As a result, there is minimal character development. Despite this, the cast still does well with their roles. However, the story isn't what made us watch \"The Raid\" in the first place. It's the fight scenes that caught our attention, and boy, do they deliver. Throughout the majority of the film, we witness gunfights, martial arts showdowns, and brutal takedowns. Expertly choreographed, the action scenes are viscerally intense and highly entertaining. Our hero Rama (Iko Uwais, operational driver turned actor), is the star here and he delivers throughout, dispatching thug after thug using the Malaysian martial arts technique \"pencak silat.\"\n\nAll in all, \"The Raid\" is one of the best action films ever released. Despite a mediocre plot, it succeeds at delivering thrills with its impressive camera work, mesmerizing choreography, and brutal and relentless action scenes. It might not appeal to everyone due to its intensity and carnage, but for action aficionados, this is sure to be a treat.\n\n9/10",

The action is relentless and the film contains some amazing, close up fight choreography; some of the best I've seen quite a while. I also loved that the plot is not overly complicated, nor the characters overly cheesy and clich\u00e9. It doesn't try to be anything than what it is; a thoroughly entertaining, bare bones action film. I recently watched Dredd (2012) an while it was a similar concept, it was no where near as well executed as this.

Many parts of this film are full of cliches, and use them as character development. Though they can be tedious, it did really work. You can't go into this movie, expecting a great story like the Shawshank Redemption or Taxi Driver, it's almost a completely straight up action flick, with some elements of the thriller/horror genre, due to it's straight up brutal fight scenes. What I got with this action movie was a claustrophobic, intense, and glorifying experience. Though I've seen many of it's cliched story elements before, the uniqueness of this movie strives in it's action, which really makes up for it's faults and makes this one of the most enjoyable viewing that I have had the pleasure to see in a while.

The late great Roger Ebert was one of the few critics who gave this film a scathingly negative review, and that's because for him films didn't just need to work within their perspective genres; they needed to work as artistic and meaningful statements about the human experience. His review posits this more articulately than I ever could, but we certainly are coming from a similar direction. \"Shallow\" isn't a word I'd use to describe this film. \"Empty\" is more fitting.",

In the wake of recycled '80s action porn like The Expendables and A Good Day to Die Hard, however, The Raid offers an unapologetic straight-ahead kill-or-be-killed story that you've kinda sorta seen before and somehow makes it seem brand spanking new. In fact, when this breakneck flick stops to catch its breath and - gasp - forward the story, it feels like the script stepped in molasses. Not to worry though--it's soon up and high kicking, which is important considering that this urban high-rise ascension tale must keep moving or die.\r\n\r\nIn this R-rated adrenaline-laced piece of popcorn, an Indonesian S.W.A.T. team becomes trapped in a tenement run by a ruthless mobster and his army of murderous thugs. \r\n\r\nWhat brought Welshman Gareth Evans (V/H/S/ 2) to Indonesia? Who knows? Maybe he fell in love with John Woo shoot-'em-ups and Hong Kong chop socky as kid. Regardless, Redemption marks a hard-charging feature debut exploding with style. It helps that he puts forth a roughneck leading man to follow through on the ballsy premise. The fast and furious fists of Iko Uwais literally keep the punches and action flying ever forward. \r\n\r\nBottom line: Block Rocking Beast",

            "content": "Classic kung fu action films of the 1970's were a brilliant mix of expertly crafted choreography and intense action. It is since become a lost art form due to the complications of filming such intense one on one combat between actors. While these satirical kung fu films had exhilarating fight, they largely lacked an emotional core or even a decent story not ridden with clich\u00e9s. Fortunately there are still action directors today who are up to the excruciating challenge of constructing these incredibly difficult to shoot kung fu films. Director Gareth Evans truly understands how to construct several minute long fight sequences between actors that are not only visually appealing but also undeniably compelling to watch. Often many kung fu films of old as well as some more recent films, have filmed there action scenes in one take, which is, as you can imagine, one of the most difficult things a director can shoot. Evans rarely keeps the camera on his actors for more than ten seconds due to the constant pace of the film which is always continuous; he instead opts for dangerously close framing of his scenes with his actors, as they relentlessly cover each other with bruises and cuts. Undoubtedly the stand out sequence of the film is the fight in which Rama, played by Iko Uwais, is backed up in a corner and must face down four men with machetes. Because the film never abandons all of its realism, the fight is truly an on the edge of your seat, nerve racking experience for its nearly five minute run time. This fight perfectly shows off the skill of the actors, the majesty of the choreography and the expertise of Evans blocking, lighting, framing and overall direction. Obviously because The Raid: Redemption is a foreign language film, there are two mass produced versions of the film, the English Dubbed version and the English subtitled version. Like many foreign language films that were dubbed in English, the dubbing for The Raid: Redemption is simply awful because of the overacted voice work that in no way matches the characters themselves or correctly syncing with the actors lips; the experience of viewing this film will be far better if it is viewed as it was originally intended. Surprisingly the film also comes with two different soundtracks, the original score and the American Lincoln Park produced soundtrack; again the original soundtrack is far superior because it fits the atmosphere and tone much better compared to Lincoln Parks upbeat techno remix which simply sounds out of place. Finally, this leaves the screenplay written by director Gareth Edwards... First the good, I appreciate how Edwards directly takes us into the action with no delay, leaving previous engagements with Rama up to interpretation; starting the film this quickly also helps enomorusly with the pacing. However, when the actual plot starts to form the clich\u00e9s starting popping up from left and right, \"I have to get back to my wife because she is having a baby\", \"Brother I have to get you out of this lifestyle\", etc. really eye rolling stuff; overall a lackluster script with excellent pacing. The Raid: Redemption is an excellent showcase of brilliant stunt work and choreography, yet a miserable attempt at story telling; overall a good film. Hopefully the sequel, The Raid 2 Berandal, is far superior to The Raid: Redemption.",

Sometimes I watch a certain kind of film, whether it's drama, romance or in this case, action/martial arts, and I'm completely spellbound. \n\nFor what this film lacks in story, it makes up in unbelievable eye-popping choreography. The fight scenes simply have to be seen to be believed. Moments of shouting at the screen happened frequently as I cheered on the elite police to take down the gangsters controlling the block. This was a sure sign I was way too involved with this film.\n\nBreaking down all the elements for a perfect action film, The Raid has everything. The Hero, the Villain, fights, guns, even a twist, which I never saw coming. Elements aside, what really makes The Raid so successful is its pacing. It knows when to calm after a fight scene and when to pick you back up and fight back again. \n\nWhat did I think? it's a visual, fast paced piece of cinema that refuses to be ignored. I loved it. Best action film of the last decade? Without a doubt. You'll be hearing about The Raid for a long time to come.",

The techniques are endless and this \n'Swat' Team is in for the surprise of their lives while trying to capture a Drug Lord in a 15 story building.  What calls our attention is where in Hell so many well trained Indonesian fighters have gathered for this ultimate showdown. There is no respite in this film and when it is about to end you are already breathless. Never before I have seen a showdown of this magnitude comparable to the confrontations of large armies against larger armies.

The bread and butter of the film is the action, which is all shot and edited in a manner that runs counter to a lot of contemporary action.  We can see everything that is going on, and all the fights are performed and edited to stunning effect; it's like watching ballet.  Indeed, what 'The Raid' might lack in terms of storytelling, it fairly makes up for with beautifully staged, visceral action sequence that really deliver.  Whilst using mainly the art of silat for the fight scenes, with various members of this extremely fit cast mastering their own styles, no one sequence feels too repetitive, a seemingly conscious effort on the part of Evans.  The film is not subtle, but it packs a hell of a punch and puts on display physical performances which are tiring just to watch!  A simple, satisfying start to what looks to be a fantastic trilogy, and the sounding off of a potentially fresh voice in action cinema.",

            "content": "\"The Raid: Redemption\" is a thoroughly satisfying martial arts film with spectacular stunts and jaw-dropping action. The movie begins with a really ingenious premise: a group of police officers go into an isolated apartment complex to take down a top-of-the-food-chain criminal, only to find that when they get in, they're going to have a really hard time getting out. The officers start off with their weapons but as their numbers and ammunition dwindles, it becomes a struggle for survival and a quest to get some justice too.\n\nThis premise really works because it makes for logical escalations in the action; as the officers run out of ammunitions and resources, they're forced to rely on their wits and hand-to-hand combat skills. This escalation means that no two fights are the same and the movie becomes a real thrill ride to watch. It's constantly topping itself with new opponents, new stunts and will consistently have you groaning as you imagine the pain that the characters in the movie are feeling (not to mention the stunt men). It also helps that the characters in the movie are very intelligent, constantly outwitting each other and playing with your expectations. There's also some good twists and revelations throughout the movie, ensuring that what you see at first isn't what you get in the end and that there's a lot more to the movie than just people beating each other with their hands and feet. While the story is simple, the characters are well drawn and you get attached to them quickly or in the villains' case, they genuinely scare you. When the main villain of the film Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy) is introduced, there's a quick shot where you see him choose the method of execution for a poor soul. In that split second where he hesitates between two weapons (one of which is much more horrible than the other) there's a lot of tension and it actually tears you up a bit. You want to see him taken down, but you also pray that the officers performing the raid are never going to get in contact with the man because he is truly despicable. Even if you are the kind of person that can't stand to read subtitles, the plot is pretty self explanatory and you'll be so impressed with the physical performances and the violence in the film that you will be able to set aside your prejudices. If you're a fan of martial arts or action films this is going to be a real treat and you'll be thrilled throughout. Iko Uwais as Rama, our main character is a real find here, performing some truly spectacular stunts and actually creating a character that you genuinely like. Once the movie is over, you'll want to watch it again and share it with your friends so you can see the looks on their faces while they see the bone-crushing action take place. It's terrific fun. (Original Indonesian with English subtitles, on Blu-ray, April 26, 2013)",

            "content": "Being a critically acclaimed action film with a powerful sequel, The Raid: Redemption was a film I needed to see as a reminder that action films were not dying everywhere.\n\nEssentially the first thing that audiences bear witness to in The Raid: Redemption are the incredible fighting skills of Iko Uwais. Waching him throw a mercilessly quick series of punches against a punching bag immediately reveals the extent of his fighting skills. From there, the film has nothing to do but improve and that is exactly what it does.\nUnilke every Hollywood action film today, The Raid: Redemption serves as a throwback to a time when action was revolutionary by reinventing the genre. It is not a perfect film, but that's because Gareth Evans' sole ambitions are to create a simple powerful action film and a showcase for the Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat. To do that, it creates a plot which is essentially an amalgamation of the story in Die Hard and the real life story of Marcus Luttrell as chronicled in Lone Survivor, with elements of The Warriors. I'm fairly certain these similarities would be coincidental because the simple plot in The Raid: Redemption ignores the over the top narrative devices of western cinema and relies simply on solid action and intense atmosphere to move the narrative along. I use the word solid very loosely because the quality of the action in The Raid: Redemption is something the West has not witnessed ever before. Since the mainstream acition in western society is build predominantly on PG-13 action dominated by excessively choppy editing, shaky camera work or an excess of reliance on visual effects. Instead, The Raid: Redemption relies solely on the amazing action choreography skills of Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian as well as the powerful work of the cast they trained which is all captured with cinematography which relies on extensive shots of stable cinematography and minimal editing which does not censor the realistically brutal nature of pencak silat combat with all its blood and gore. It is not over the top, but the powerful quantity of blood is striking enough in its realism to force viewers to confront the real brutality of the story, effectively rendering The Raid: Redemption an experience with the power to shock audiences in the most entertaining way. As an excercise in the martial art of pencak silat, The Raid: Redemption is an inspiring film and a much needed change of pace for martial arts films which have laid dormant for far too long. \nTo put it simply, The Raid: Redemption is essentially this generation's Die Hard and Enter the Dragon rolled into one. In that sense it may not have the most original story and may be rather simplistic, but it more than makes up for it as a showcase for pencak silat which leaves viewers forever in a debt of gratitude to the existence of Gareth Evans as a film director. He is one of the few filmmakers living and working with the courage to show the true violent nature of a good fight scene with proper technical characteristics and not bury it beneath an excess of quick editing which continuously proves a challenge to get away with in modern society. But even though the technical aspects of The Raid: Redemption are a key factor in the action being succesful, it is the cast that pulls it off.\nIko Uwais is an absolute revelation in The Raid: Redemption. The Raid: Redemption is a clear sign that Iko Uwais is a born action hero and the next great martial arts star as his skills are beyond the achievements that any western star can reach on screen. Iko Uwais has the swift movements of a John Woo character and the creative versatility of Jet Li on a level which practically beyond belief. My jaw dropped at the sight of the skiolls Iko Uwais displayed in The Raid: Redemption. And yet, he is so much more than just an action hero. In The Raid: Redemption, Iko Uwais also captures the truly intense nature of a police officer under fire throughout every second of the story. He is always on edge as if death is a single step away, and you can see it in his eyes as he pummels his way down the hallways filled with gangs Iko Uwais is with the character every step of the way in The Raid: Redemption through the scenes which require him to act and the ones which demand his fighting skills, and he works to make it a perfect action vehicle for his talents.\nYayan Ruhian is also thoroughly impressive. With the natural look of a street rat, Yayan Ruhian immediately serves as a convincing villain for the story. And yet, he goes beyond his appearance with pencak silat skills which put a new meaning on the phrase \"don't judge a book by its cover\".Yayan Ruhian makes an amazing villain and a powerful challenge for Iko Uwais to face, primarily because his speed is unbelievable and his technique is almost poetic in how well it flows from his body. Yayan Ruhian essentially combines the flowing movements of a ballet performer with the relentless grit of a sadistic criminal which means he is both marvelous to look at and intimidating as hell. Yayan Ruhian is as much of a villain as Iko Uwais is a hero, and the fight scenes that he shares with the cast are an unbelievable amalgamation of talent which shows that he is as important in bringing attention to pencak silat as Iko Uwais is.\n\nSo The Raid: Redemption has a rather familiar and simplistic story, but with fight scenes so unbelievably well choreographed and filmed with precision, The Raid: Redemption is a brutal and exhilarating action film which is likely to leave viewers faithful that the action genre survives and wanting to learn the amazing martial art of pencak silat.",
