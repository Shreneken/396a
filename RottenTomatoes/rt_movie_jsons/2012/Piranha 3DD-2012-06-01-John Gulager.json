    "summary": "Though it was once a wholesome, family-oriented attraction, a water park owned by Chet (David Koechner) now features a nudist pool and aquatic strippers. Chet's daughter, a marine biologist named Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), is unhappy about the changes but is powerless to stop the grand reopening. However, when a school of ravenous, prehistoric piranha migrate over from nearby Lake Victoria, Maddy must somehow prevent the park's patrons from becoming fish food.",

            "content": "One of the worst films ever made - and not in a good way\nThe first Piranha surprised audiences in 2010 with its wit, over the top nudity, and excessive gore. It never took itself seriously and had a solid cast. This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.\n\nWhy is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.\n\nSo which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters \"Welcome to rock bottom.\" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.\n\nAnd also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.\n\nI have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully). Don't waste your time.",

First off the acting is lazy, the effects are cheap, the story is not that creative. The biggest complaint I have is that this film recycles shots from the first film. There is actual shots of the piranha from the first film, put into this film and they are pretending like people would not notice. This is easily one of the laziest films I\u2019ve ever watched, which is disappointing because if done right this could have been a great sequel. ",

It's not a typical role for what I'm used to seeing her in, but she's does a great job as she's a quality actress.\n\nDavid Koechner leads the humor (and he's good at it) of the movie with some solid help from the rest of the cast.  David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames even make cameos.\n\nThere isn't much to this movie, there's water, fish, and people, and some combination of them to various degrees of humor and horror.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD is an ok sequel to the superior 2010 gorefest remake of Joe Dante's classic of the same name. Its not the best due to the film's problems and issues which resulted with a bad execution and when compared to its mighty predecessor this film is no match against its super bloody predecessor. This film takes place two years after the events of the first film. Its been two years after the massacre at Lake Victoria when the Piranhas attacked a lot of party goers. Lake Victoria is now abandoned and quarantined after a lot of people where injured and killed in the incident. When Maddy a young lady who owns a water park returns home for the summer after College in studying Marine biology where she reunites with her friends and ex boyfriend who is now a police officer. She finds out that her stepfather took over as the owner of the park and has renew the entire water park with lifeguard water strippers along with a celebrity life guard and has also made a new adult theme water park on the other side which Maddy does not like despite her objections against her step father. Soon the Piranhas are now back and this time they are going to create further bloodshed in the newly themed adult water park on the day of its opening as they travel through the pipes leading to the park. It is now up to Maddy and her friends to prevent the bloodshed from happening and they must find a way to deal with the situation before the same incident happens again just like with Lake Victoria. Ok when I first heard that there was a sequel already to the 2010 gorefest in development I was hoping to see what  the filmmakers can do next for the sequel either it will surpass its predecessor and will be more successful than the first film or it will stay in the same line as its predecessor and will be just as successful as its predecessor. The result is neither. Its a total bummer. This sequel seriously became a total bummer as it goes down the drain quickly from the beginning until the end. When I saw the trailers for this movie it looks like it will be just like the first one but I notice some problems when they showed the promos. It looked like the movie was gonna be more of a Direct to DVD movie or a Made for TV movie for the Syfy channel. That's when I suddenly found out that there was a problem already with this sequel right when the negative reviews started coming and it flopped at the box office at the same time back in 2012. When I had the chance to watch it. It is an epic fail and total bummer. I knew that when I watched this film there was already a problem after an interesting moment in the first half and guess what. The film is problematic and it goes down the drain as you can expect. This is a disappointing sequel that's trying its best to stay true to the spirit of its successful gore threshing predecessor. But at least it is still a bit enjoyable to me aside from having loads of issues that made me completely disappointed. One of the things I did not like about this movie is the way it was executed. Since the first film was more of a homage to Steven Spielberg's Jaws and it is super bloody and has less humor. This one puts the humor up in the worst possible way and oh my goodness! The film looked more of a spoof other than a Horror movie. I could not believe that this film ended up being extremely bad in the execution and it really looked like a spoof just like Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. But where Freddy's Dead was so awful due to its annoying and pure awful moments from the beginning until the end and it destroyed the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. Piranha 3DD at least worked a bit more but it is still disappointing and bad nowhere as bad as Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare but at least its just an average or ok film to watch if you're bored. The other problem with this movie is that this film suffers from a lot of pacing issues from start to finish. The movie is packed with loads of slow and dull moments that seriously ruined the entire film and don't expect anything good happening in several scenes after the first half of the film so there's nothing special later on in the next half of the movie until the end. One of the other issues with this movie is the bad soundtrack. If the first film had lots of pump dance party songs this sequel is packed with loads of awful songs that did not fit well in the movie plus the film is also packed with loads of awful CGI effects. It felt as if the Syfy channel worked on the movie and instead of releasing it in cinemas they just released this film straight to video or air it as a Made for TV film owned by them. What else is bad about this movie. Oh yes there's also two more issues with this film. The worst thing about this sequel is budget being lower than the first film. No wonder that this sequel received bad reviews due to the lower budget and straight to video look it really could have been better. But the worst part about this movie is the gore. I cannot believe what I just saw with my two eyes. The gore in this movie looks so cheesy and fake looking(just check out the scene where all the people in the water park are getting eaten by the Piranhas and the way they die along with several characters the gore in those scenes are so not good even the deaths were stupid and cheesy looking) because in the first film you get to see loads of over the top gore and graphic scenes like close ups of the Piranhas eating towards every person's flesh and a shocking and super disgusting sequence where a girl's hair gets caught in a boat propeller and the top of her head gets ripped off in a violent and gruesome way here the gore looks so tame and fake looking combined with some horrible CGI Piranhas and its a big shame that the CGI here were so awful since the first film had lots of incredible CGI Piranhas here the Piranhas looked so fake and very Syfy looking. Worst comes to worst the film also suffers from poor 3D effects that almost ruined the movie. Seriously there are only two amazing 3D scenes in this film(The scary Piranhas leaping towards the screen and the opening titles leaping on the screen) the rest are lame and so dull looking. Ok there are only a few things I like about this movie. The first is a few good scenes in the first half(The opening scene where two farmers one is portrayed by Nightmare On Elm Street 2 actor Clu Gulager getting eaten alive by Piranhas and the other two scenes where two girls are attacked by the Piranhas in the lake but were able to survive along with the intense sequence where the first two victims in the yellow van are eaten by the Piranhas first before the dull and lame climax oh and I forgot to mention the fun Nightmare On Elm Street bath tub scene) the second is the incredible editing and the third is a few funny scenes that were way better than the other scenes in the film. Now the acting gave me a mixed feeling. Some of the casts were ok with their performances in this film. While I like seeing the three actors like Paul Scheer reprise his role as the cameraman from the first film along with Ving Rhames reprising his role as the deputy who luckily survived the events from the first film and he was so funny in this movie, I love the super funny scene where he throws the cameraman in the pool and last but not least I seriously love Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as the Emmett \"Doc\" Brown like scientist in this film and he is way funnier and more over the top in this movie than in the previous film(\"Take that Laughing Diarrhea Baby\"). Ok out of all the new casts only Danielle Panabaker delivers an outstanding performance in this film and she is pure gorgeous and so grown up after her film debut with Sky High along with Nightmare On Elm Street 2 actor Clu Gulager even though he was killed and eaten by the Piranhas in the beginning of the film while David Hasselhoff has a fun cameo in this movie despite that he is too old already yet he is still funny in this film. The rest of the casts were bad and just plain awful and I did not like David Koechner as the annoying stepfather of Maddy and he was just awful in this film along with Chris Zylka(who is well known for his performance in The Amazing Spider Man as Flash Thompson the bully who always makes fun of Peter Parker) as the corrupt police officer and ex boyfriend of Maddy only two of the new casts did a good job with their performances in this movie the rest were really bad. Director John Gulager seriously didn't have a clue when he was gonna make this movie. I don't think he understood the formula of what made the first movie famous and from what I can tell since I read that Joel Soisson was brought in to produce and re write the script written by Saw IV-VII writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan I knew that the film was gonna be in a bad direction. And this film seriously felt as if John Gulager doesn't know how he will make the film work and so he quit and left the project and Joel Soisson took directing duties from Gulager and it also felt as if he also brought in Freddy Got Fingered actor and director Tom Green and together they both rewrote the script by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan and they made the movie look really bad by adding so many scenes that are not funny or makes no sense at all.  I can't believe that neither Pete Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg and Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur(the team behind the successful 2010 gorefest predecessor) had any involvement in making this film. I would truly appreciate this movie if it had a better director like Chuck Russel(who was originally set to direct the previous film and made some uncredited rewrites in Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg's screenplay) direct the sequel and at least have James Wan and Leigh Whannell(the guys behind the Insidious movies) write the sequel along with some rewrites from Chuck Russell's collaborator Frank Darabont(A Nightmare On Elm Street 3; Dream Warriors script writer) work on rewriting the script for the sequel I would truly appreciate this film if they at least hired these guys to make the movie work as its predecessor. Overall Piranha 3DD is a disappointing and bland sequel that fails to capture the spirit of its successful blood shed predecessor. But at least it is watchable for me if I'm a bit bored just to kill some time. This movie gets a 5.5/10. If you're bored and you have nothing better to do just keep your brain calm and watch this film and of course enjoy it.",

Rhames and Lloyd return, with David Koechner as a sleazy water park owner (basically if Champ Kind owned a water park) the opening cameo spot taken by a suitably insane Gary Busey. The rest of the cast is made up of not particularly likable good looking youngsters, the most recognisable being 'her out of Tucker and Dale'. \n\nIt's a predictable retread of its predecessor and neither as funny or as fun as last time out. It's not quite as bad as, say Sharknado but it does occasionally flirt with SyFy Original Movie territory. \n\nHowever, there's some guilty fun to be had thanks to David Hasselhoff appearing as 'himself', a combination of his Baywatch character and Brad Pitt's moronic stoner from True Romance.",

Katrina Bowden is alright doing her best with the thinly written material, but the sex scene featuring the penis eating Piranha is ghastly and one of those moments that will leave you saying \"what did I just see?\". The issue with these types of movies is that if the first is successful and gains a fan base, they'll thrown in a sequel that lacks the thought and fun the original had, it genuinely does feel like a quick cash in. Despite bad writing and a bland story filled with disposable characters the 3D effects are utilised brilliantly, boasting effective depth both underwater and above, the water threatens to leak out the screen and there are a tonne of leap in your face effects that are so much fun to experience, but when you realise that the 3D and two actresses are the only good point of a movie there's concern.",

It's obvious from the outtakes that the cast and crew had a great time making it, but only some of that comes through in the finished product. There's not much of a story as the film relies on the original to do most of the set up for this film, and the special effects are mostly sub-par.\n\nThe blood flows freely, but a lot of the deaths aren't very convincing and the film features one of the phoniest decapitations in recent memory. Maybe if I had seen the film in its intended 3-D format, it wouldn't have looked so fake. The film is filled mostly with fresh faces, but thankfully it's also peppered with some veterans who provide the few laughs this does manage. The fact that Ving Rhames even returned for the sequel is hilarious, but so is his performance, and David Hasselhoff steals the show here playing himself. His comic, self deprecating turn is the absolute highlight of this otherwise forgettable effort.\n\nEven the plentiful nudity is disappointing mostly because everything looks surgically enhanced. When a movie fails at gratuitous nudity, there's a problem. \"Piranha 3-DD\" is a breezy, fast-paced time-killer that does everything to excess.

Don't get me wrong, this film isn't great, it's not even good but it just about squeezes in enough gratuitous wobbling body parts, awful jokes, ridiculous death scenes and, most importantly, appearances from Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff to make this throw away comedy better than you've read about in the press.

There's not quite as many gratuitous 3D DD breast shots as some might expect, and the violence isn't nearly as rough and graphic as that seen in the first film. This is a largely humorless, excessively juvenile, and dramatically vacant film. The last in the list doesn't really matter seeing that nobody goes to Piranha 3DD expecting a smart movie, but even the supposed \"good stuff\" flops as badly as a fish out of water.

And frankly, satire needs no sequel.\n\nThe plot dynamics seem less half-assed in their construction than in Piranha 3D, and the script is frankly too insulting and unintelligent that it diverts Piranha 3DD from satire to being a self-parody with lame jokes and the only laugh coming from an inside joke between me and friends that coincidentally occurred at a low point in the script. Although the script is already low enough, it sinks lower. So low that the piranhas might as well tear it up for invading their below-earth caverns.\nAnd another problem is the incessant waiting that it takes until the \"climactic\" final moment. Piranha 3D recognised that it was ideal for the action to start big and to continue on that path, but instead in Piranha 3DD there is small scaled failed attempts at thrills until 53 minutes in when the scale makes its overdue jump to what is at best a medium scale gore fest which constantly ignores and forgets about what is happening to the point that things have apparently stopped occurring. Piranha 3DD acts like it doesn't take itself seriously but on the surface it unintentionally attempts to establish an atmosphere that actually does, proving to be the film's major downfall.\nPiranha 3DD is merely painful to watch, not because of its horror, but because it is horrible. The first 36 minutes feel like they've run for twice that long since the plotting is full and directionless thanks to John Gulager's lack of job as director who in his best attempts to work with a $5 Million budget merely ends up with a film that is terribly cheap and utterly stupid with significantly less entertainment value than its predecessor, as well as less tits, rendering the tentative titled Piranha 3DD misleading. Basically, the scale for this film is too small and its utterly so stupid that it ends up with the qualities of a Sci Fi Channel low-budget horror movie that happens to have been filmed in 3D. Alas, this misleads viewers to think it may be somewhat better than the expect. This is a reason that people should follow their instincts.\n\nAlthough, certain scenes in Piranha 3DD are reminiscent of the original 1978 Joe Dante film Piranha which started the whole legacy which spawned Piranha 3D and this sequel to it which was decent. And some of the celebrity cameos weren't half bad, such as Gary Busey, David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and badass Ving Rhames.\nPlus, Danielle Panabaker was a decent lead actress in Piranha 3DD.\nBut to put it simply, the D's in Piranha 3DD stand for dumbfounded and disastrous.

Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer, and Ving Rhames reprise their roles while Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff are given cameo roles.

And now there's the next instalment, Piranha 3DD. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return for a another blood soaked, tittiefest. Using their network of underwater caves and rivers the piranha have migrated to another town where they find their way into a heavily populated waterpark... a SEXY waterpark. This might not have the same impact of the previous movie but its a very worthy sequel. It's got every cliche in the book, loads of big bouncing boobs, flesh chomping fishies and yes, another dick gag! Its super fun and exactly what you would hope to see, well me anyway. Add to the cast a cameo by Gary Busy, a self referential David HasselHoff (who has a great Baywatch moment) and David Koechner as the dickhead park owner. I was half expecting Piranha 3DD to be a cheap direct-to-dvd stinker but it maintains most of the quality of the last one... it was directed by the guy who made the 'Feast' trilogy, which was cool... oh and it has a wicked final frame, CHOMP!",

            "content": "I really liked the first Piranha 3D.  It was a great homage to B-movie creature features.  Lots of gore and stupid characters getting eating in gruesome ways.  It had tons of really great deaths and even some characters you actually kinda liked.  So when the sequel came out (geniously name Piranha 3DD!), I had to see it.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to see it in 3D in the theater, but I finally found it ona Redbox and snatched it up.  And I must say... It is quite a disappointment.  3DD is less of a homage and more of a parody.  Which is fine, but it veers into Scary Movie territory and turns into nothing but a bunch of cheap pop culture references and unfunny gags.  The biggest offense is that the gore is ridiculously toned down.  It's obvious that this movie had a tiny budget and it really feels like a direct-to-video B-movie.  It has a few decent deaths, but most of the gore is hidden behind cloudy red water and anything substantial is replaced by people just running with red water all over them.  The huge Piranha invasion doesn't even happen until the last 20 minutes or so of the movie and the rest of it is wasted doing pretty much nothing.  It spends way more time showing naked girls then what you really want to see, which is people getting eaten by fish.  It's odd that the movie is hampered by budget and unable to do with better makeup effects because it's directed by John Gulager, who made the indie horror movie Feast, which was pretty good and had some good gore in it as well.  It could have been because this one was shot in 3D... I would have much preferred this be made in 2D and post-converted and had way better gore.\n\nAnother weird thing is that either the makeup department sucked in this movie, or the actors are purposely made up to look washed up and old.  Danielle Panabaker and Katrina Bowden, who are usually both very attractive and young-looking, both look old and washed up here.  What happened?\n\nAnyway, the only thing this movie has going for it is that it's a direct sequel to the Iraq movie with some call-backs to it and even some recurring characters.  I'm not sure why they ditched to giant piranha thing the last movie ended with, though.  This movie again ends with a cliff hanger with the piranhas evolving, but eh, I didn't really care.",

If you thought PIRANHA 3D was in poor taste, you ain't seen nuthin' yet! The creative team behind the cult-classic FEAST takes over in this direct-to-video sequel, and they have really nailed it this time. PIRANHA 3DD shoots way over the top with its crude humor and exploitative fun, throwing political-correctness to the wind along with plenty of limbs and bikini tops. Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way. If that weren't enough, PIRANHA 3DD unleashes the one-and-only David Hasselhoff in a brilliant self-parody for the final act.

This is one of the drawbacks as it doesn't have the great Florida Spring Break setting working for it like the original so every aspect of the story is on a smaller scale. The nudity seems slightly unnecessary this time round, not that male viewers will do much complaining. Takes a light-hearted approach to horror, a direction that really works in its favour in the final scenes at the water park where some of the silly jokes conjure up a few laughs. Commits the sin like practically all the 3D messes out there and inserts little 3D bits that appear tacky. Luckily, it doesn't bombard you with them. Can be enjoyed with some buddies when something easy is required but it is nothing to scream about.",

When your movie has a scene where a piranha decides to take a nap inside a girl and come out of her vagina and bite a mans penis, your movie is awful. There is not one redeeming quality in this movie. Why did I even see this movie you ask? Because the I heard some rumors that this was one of the worst movies ever made, and I felt like I had to see it for myself and I saw it for free on YouTube. And yeah, it did not disappoint.

Some of the acting was acceptable for the type of movie it was, including David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd, Gary Busey, and Danielle Panabaker, who played the protagonist pretty well. Also, the film has some jokes that hit the right spot, as well as certain scares or high tension moments that do leave you on the edge of your seat. However, a crummy story, bad character development, terrible effects, and a horror of a directing job all make this film a mediocre horror/comedy, which should've gone straight to DVD. Where this movie excels is in the pre-advertised nudity that the film presents from the very title. Topless women and random moments of humor based on sexual themes are put in the place of an actual compelling script, which keeps male audiences watching, but not truly interested in characters or where the story could go. Overall, I'd say it's a fun movie to watch with friends, if you've had a few drinks and/or don't mind watching a movie for the laughs of how bad and outrageous it is.",

            "content": "Piranha 3DD doubles up the ante, breast, gore, and cameos, but is a half*** film. Piranha 3DD continues after the bloody massacre in Lake Victoria. Swimmers and sun bathers retreat to the waterparks for safety, but that will no longer be any help since the piranhas have found a way to infiltrate it. Piranha 3DD includes a number of cameos from the previous films: Paul Scheer, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd. However, new guys step in like Gary Busey, David Koechner, and David Hasselhoff. Marine biologist student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) returns to her old job at a water park for the summer. Among her friends, she is pleased until she discovers that her favorite water park has been turned into some sleazy sex pool for adults featuring topless babes and cameras by the ladders to capture shots of the female body, classy. All of this is from her stepdad Chet (Koechner) as he remodeled the place for his own appetite. Lifeguards are replaced with certified water strippers, swimming area for adults, and did I tell you the location of the camera? This sleazy perverted recreation is the least of Maddy's worries as friends begin to disappear at a nearby lake. Where could have they gone to? Well, it is discovered that piranhas are the culprit, so she goes to her friends who are also competing for her love: Barry (Matt Bush) and Kyle (Chris Zylka). They too are puzzled, so they go to the one man that will know the answers, Mr. Goodman (Lloyd). He warns them that piranhas are powerful to bite through steel and be attracted to chlorine for an utterly confusing reason. She pleads with Chet, but he is the least interest since tomorrow is the opening day, wow. Like said, the piranhas manage to infiltrate the water park and turn Big Wet into a Hometown Buffet. Piranha 3DD is the sequel to Piranha 3D which served as a revision rather than a remake. The film was fantastic and fun, but here Piranha 3DD is similar and a closer remake to the original film by Joe Dante. I still do not understand how the film is a parody of Jaws, but whatever. It is entertaining, wet, and wild, but also falls really short to being a completed film. I was quite disappointed with the writing and story. The acting is unintentionally funny with other laugh out loud, but feel bad moments. I wanted a little more closer with the characters and timing with girls in their bikinis. I also wanted to have a little more fun watching the Big Wet before the massacre because the film is only two parts: prior Big Wet's opening and the massacre. The piranhas were brought in a little too early.",

Given the 2 year expanse between the original film, I was expecting a higher quality of horror, gore and a sick sense of comedy, but upon watching it I was incredibly ashamed to have ever wanted to see this. The redesign of the piranhas was a total and complete let-down, the cameo of Gary Busey at the very beginning was completely wasted! A favorite comedian of mine and my girlfriend's to show up in an Arizona bayou, only to be devoured by these bottom-rate revamped piranhas (I wouldn't even call them third rate the design is THAT bad! ) is a complete waste of his talent! The \"lifeguards\" being sluts due to the oh-so-over-used \"perverted old man\" gig and one male lifeguard (David Hasselhoff) who doesn't even care about anything but publicity and beautiful women, it's just completely sickening! I would have to say that the only good things about this film are very few and INCREDIBLY far between. A horror-comedy? HAH! What a joke... Sorry to spoil it for any readers out there, but COME ON! A perverted old man reopens a water park, replaces all the GOOD lifeguards with \"water certified\" sluts and David Hasselhoff, the step-daughter hates him, and, what do you know, he's illegally pumping water into the park from a piranha infested lake. The two timing \"cop\" who's to chicken to even do anything, even to save the girl he's in love with, was just in it for the money, and the entire \"plot\" DARE I call it that, was completely skewered to these cheap-as-fuck, ass-wiping over-gore! \n\nI am just so appalled that they would dare call this a sequal, and to think, they left it open for a TRILOGY! WHAT THE HELL IS FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU?! Okay, I admit, I'm GLAD that they brought back the old marine biologist, Mr. Goodman, back, though they made him a little crazy and it was just terrible that they reused scenes from the first movie! We've already done the \"get the slut from under the round floatie\" thing. Why ruin something that was even better in the original? \"Fish That Walk Among Us\" hm... I do believe they, oh, I don't know... ALREADY EXIST ON THIS PLANET CURRENTLY! There ARE fish that can breathe air and \"walk\" on land for periods of time people! You don't need to make these cheap ass, failed remakes do it too! Another GOOD thing they did in this movie was bring back the sheriff, Ving Rhames \"Deputy Fallon\", from the first movie who kicked ass in the original at the cost of his legs. BUT they made him a total pussy, who's afraid of the water until the piranhas return, where he gets his original vamp back and saves some innocents, despite the fear. There was nothing really \"funny\" or \"comedic\" about the movie at all. The ONLY reason I laughed was because of what happened to Ashley, because, I'm \"so mature.\" Come on, a piranha swam up into her, proceeded to tear her up from the inside out, then bit her fuck buddies dick! that's really all there was to that. \n\nWhy? Why did you have to go and ruin something that, personally, was good and try to ruin it for me? Seriously... What a total disaster. Whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THIS F - - MOVIE!!!  You have better uses for your money and time.\n\nThe only good things about this movie: the cheesy-as-fuck love scenario where the guy does something he's afraid of most to save the girl (well, doesn't that sound like EVERY movie out there now-a-days?), Mr. Goodman, Deputy Fallon and his kickass-ness, the cameo of Gary Busey and the fact that the fat guy fucking blew up the water park with ammonia and chlorine, two extremely flammable chemicals, that's really it. The rest was just a waste of a movie and funding.\n\nIt is not worth any time to consider this movie at all for any kind of \"good time.\" You'd be better off watching some other horror-comedy if you want to get your sick kicks. Or better yet, just watch some horror and comedy separately. Go watch Mirrors or The Exorcist or SOMETHING! This is not worthy of anyone's time.",

It's almost like he tied a flip camera to a dog and let it run around a water park for an hour and whatever turned up he used. There are a couple shots in the film where for some reason the resolution of the camera just turned to shit. Like the scene where the cop car is driving down the road and the camera zooms out and the screen gets all fuzzy and blurry. Maybe i got a defective dvd or something, but I doubt it. The CGI is also horribly fake and honestly it kind of irritated me. You might think the only saving grace in this film would be the boobs, but guess what? Most of those aren't even fun to look at. They're mostly just gross saggy stripper boobs. This is probably the worst movie of 2012.

Maddy is home from summer vacation hanging out with her pot smoking (Paul James Jordan), slutty (Meagan Tandy), virginal (Katrina Bowden), virginity-taking (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), past-lover (Chris Zylka), and new love prospect (Matt Bush) friends. She is trying to save her family's waterpark and warn people about the fish, which shockingly fall on deaf ears. Deaths ensue, usually gory, some sexual, and the credits roll.\r\n\r\nAnytime the plot brings up something that could be interesting, it reverts back to its trajectory. The chewed penis is brought back in the most elaborate inconcieveable way possible. The love triangle between Maddy, the ex, and the prospect actually had both guys be alright at the beginning, but they set the ex up to be secretly a bad guy by the middle because you're supposed to root for him (even though he can't swim). By minute 10 I was counting down to the bloody end, and it would be fine if the end was really pulpy fun. Instead it tries to set up too elaborate sight gags with little payoff. Several characters meet their end, and Koechner's is the only one kind of funny and shocking.\r\n\r\nPiranha 3D had two of the best cameos in recent memory with Richard Dreyfus at the beginning and Jerry O'Connell as a Girls Gone Wild type. Offed in the first movie, they are replaced with Gary Busey (not great) and David Hasselhoff, the one bright spot, playing a bored version of himself who condescends to how stupid his own fans are. He gets most of the best lines, and was the only character I was rooting to not die. Christopher Lloyd reprises his character in the first with better lines and more fun. Paul Scheer and Ving Rhames are cute, but do not get enough screen time.\r\n\r\nTo spend more time talking about Piranha 3DD would mean that people would think I am recommending it. To earn your DD, just watch the first Piranha twice. The only saving grace of Piranha 3DD is that Piranha 3DDD needs to build their story around David Hasselhoff's movie script he was writing throughout the movie. That will be amazing.",

While the previous had tons of people getting eaten and ravaged by piranhas, the pool setting had maybe 20 or so and it came off really weak.  It was a huge lost opportunity but I really blame that on the bad script and story.   That being said, I did enjoy it for what it was worth.  I was just hoping for a bit more.

I found the 2010 Piranha to be a sheer blast of campy entertainment, with some world-class gore effects and a game cast. I was actually terribly excited about a sequel; I'm ashamed to admit it now. Where did things go so horribly wrong? Much like Expendables 2, the movie's tone shifts from tongue-in-cheek 80s throwback to meta self-awareness. The movie becomes more of a lousy comedy with some absurd violence rather than a horror movie with a nasty sense of humor. The entire premise is so labored, that a water park would become piranha-infested, and the characters are so unlikable; to dub them one-dimensional is to be too kind. The acting is abysmal even by bottom-of-the-barrel B-movie standards. The celebrity cameos feel wasted, with David Hasselhoff soaking up every second of desperation. The tension is next to nil and the gore effects are pretty cheesy, trading gallons of blood for ingenuity (many character deaths occur off screen, like Gary Busey's). Then once the piranhas strike, the movie just completely abandons any sense of reality and becomes a gonzo comedy of the absurd, with characters behaving like idiots from another dimension. There's even one character that gets decapitated by a simple string of flags. It's at this point that Piranha 3DD drops any slapped-together sense of purpose. And yet this ghoulish mess can only barely make it to a scant 70 minutes (good luck getting through the abominably unfunny end credits outtakes). Reportedly, 3DD had almost the same budget of 3D. Where the hell did that money go? Piranha 3DD completely misfires on every level, failing as a horror movie, a horror-comedy, a comedy, a gore movie, hell, as a suitable movie. Whatever the metric, this movie blows. If you're hard-pressed for gratuitous nudity soaked in blood, watch the superior 2010 Piranha film instead. I'm going to start drinking heavily and forget I ever looked forward to this monstrosity on taste.\r\n\r\nNate's Grade: D",

I didn't like the chicks they cast for the virgins trust me they are not believable as virgins and besides the cameos you don't care who lives or dies. As for the cameo's it's a nice set witch makes this movie worth the watch David Koechner, Gary Busey, Paul Scheer, from the first movie Ving Rhames, and David Hasselhoff as HIMSELF! With Christopher Lloyd as the crazy scientists witch is a mix of doc brown and uncle fester. The movie should have been seen in 3D but if you are in the mood for a cheesy B-movie with blood gore and boobs the check out PIRANHA 3DD......cheers and life will never suck as long as there is a movie to watch\n \n5.5 out of 10 \n@mikes_moviepick",

Poor plot and filled with nothing but nudity and violence thrown right in your face (even more so in 3D) However, with a title like Piranha 3DD, that's kind of what you'd be expecting and that's exactly what I was hoping for.\nI've also heard alot of people complaining about the special effects in this film. That I simply do not understand. The CGI is pretty much on par with it's predesessor and on top of that, DD has gone to the effort to use pupperty and animatronics. Which is fantastic!\nThe plot follows Maddy, a young girl whos step father has turned her family waterpark into some kind of x-rated strip club pool thing. Anyway, this former waterpark has now been invaded by the pre-historic killer piranhas on it's grand opening. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return with brilliant cameos, but the best has to be Hasselhoff's hilarious performance as Hasselhoff.\nPiranha 3DD is definately not the kind of film to be taken seriously. This is the kind of film you put on if you just want to sit back and watch some boobs, gore and David Hasselhoff",

Gary Busey biting the head off of a baby piranha (even if it is only for a mere few minutes) and David Hassellhoff self-parodying himself (as he says, this is pretty much the lowest of the low). Sex, tits, blood, entertainment and laughs, but basically the whole thing is just one massive set-piece. There's a beginning (the lead-up to this adult waterpark's opening) and there's a middle (the piranhas entering the chaos) but there's no end. The writers have shoved in all the bullet point notes of what could be brilliant here and they've not worked to develop an ending. That mishap's a shame, but it's still just over an hour of bloody good fun and violence (hell, it felt like half hour to me!)!

The gore is nowhere as awesome, the jokes are putrid (and they repeat them; there's only so many times that slow motion is funny), the characters are stock and stupid as hell, and it's barely a movie as the last ten minutes are terrible outtakes and extremely long end credits. Even though the first was extremely campy, it had a great cast that included Elisabeth Shue, Richard Dreyfus, and Eli Roth... this one has Gary Busey and about a million horrible David Hasselhoff jokes. Who honestly thinks Davide Hasselhoff is cool? They tried to doing for him what they did for Mike Tyson in The Hangover, but it's eye-rolling and an embarrassing waste of time.\n\nThe first was smutty, but it was a great self-parody. DD removed all of the funny and upped the smut to unenjoyable levels. There's three editors for this turkey and it shows... there are a lot of scenes that feel rushed. I can't remember any of the teen character names; they're all the same stupid dead teenager character you've seen in a million slasher flicks. Piranha DD is stupid, but not the amusing kind of stupid... it's infuriating. Making a sequel to a fun campy movie shouldn't be this awful.

            "content": "Back in 2010, a sleeper hit called Piranha 3D hit theaters and treated viewers to a teenage wonderland of carnage and gratuitous nudity.Personally, the first film was not perfect, but it knew what it was and had fun with it making the movie fun to watch.  Needless to say it appealed to enough people to inspire the sequel Piranha 3DD a significantly horrendous film that takes everything remotely enjoyable from the first movie and makes it vile and not fun in the least bit. I can not express enough how much i personally loathe the film. There is nothing remotely entertaining about this film and there was a few things going for it but it was all held back by logic, script, plot, and how much it relies on cameos and nudity. The overall point of being a sequel is to somehow continue the story in a linear fashion. They mention the first movie at the very beginning and about three quarters of the way in, but the logic for the sequel doesnt make any sense. They say that this piranha attack would be worse than the one in the first film, but the attack takes place in a decently populated water park and the first was at a lake during Spring Break. In what world does a water park out weigh a massacre at a lake during Spring Break? It just doesn't make sense. The they revealed theat there were giant piranhas in the last film, but they are nowhere to be found in this one but somehow they evolve. The story is just sloppy to say the least. The story revolves around a piranha attack in a water park, but theres a bad love triangle and typical horror movie cliches that dumb this movie down below the point of cheesey horror. Plus the addition of terrible cgi blod and piranhas just make the story even more of a hard sell. On top of the worst logic imaginalbe, the script is not helping this abomination. The dialogue is so bad, i found it hard to even laugh at how bad it is. The dialogue revolves around profanity when the jokes arn't landing and then they try and throw in as many  jokes as possible to try and pander to the college audience. It doesn't work at all because the movie is that bad. The main problem i had with this movie is how much it relied on cameos and nudity. There are great choices for cameos mainly with Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff. Great choices because they are univerally funny, until they made this garbage. They don't work, Busey is too serious and Hassellhoff comes off as a jerk rather than a funny cameo. The main cameo that bothered me  was Ving Rhames. They made his chracter a legless veteran that wears his same clothes he did in the last movie and is now scared of water. It's not funny, its sad and poor writing. The movie's main sell is on the amount of nudity that is in it. In their defense, they didn't lie. There is a large amount of female nudity, but it was to the point where they relied on it to make people like the movie, but the camera work is so shoddy the nudity even looks bad. Let me rephrase, granted these girls make a barbie doll look like a real person, but still, it takes extra effort to make nudity bad in a teenage college movie. Overall, i can not express my hatred for this pile of filth enough. It isn't funny, it isn't entertaining, the gore looks bad, this is just a terrible excuse of a movie and will porbably top my list for the worst movies of 2012. I hate this movie and can not express how much i reccomend you don't watch this movie.",

The gore and cgi all look very cheap and dull and the result is some pretty horrendous scenes that are directed really badly, make no sense, and just really fake. When piranhas would be feasting on a bunch of people, the camera would just move around so much that you wouldn't be able to see what was going on and at other times the camera zooms in too much when they are eating people. Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, and David Hasselhoff are all completely wasted here and their cameos didn't make the film any better. A thing this film really likes to show off is tits, all the boob scenes are just stupid as hell and the only reason why they are in the movie is just to give teenage boys hard ons, if I wanted to see tities I can just google them instead of having to watch this crappy ass movie to see them.

            "content": "Sequel to last year's Piranha 3D (Which in itself is a remake) is nowhere near as fun but, it is also not as bad as it's been made out to be. Problem is, director John Gulager seems to take the material a little too seriously despite a script that replaces Piranha 3D's wit for blatantly stupid. And stupid would be fine in the case of a story about prehistoric piranha who travel from the decimated Lake Victoria through an underground river to a sleazy water theme park, if, director Gulager took the ball and ran with it like Alexandre Aja did. His cast is fine but, again only David Hasselhoff is in on the joke and the rest of the cast, including pretty lead Danielle Panabaker, are just too straight faced for a goofy flick like this. I do understand that the budget was smaller and thus the film's scale and carnage lesser but, look how fun the low budget original was without the budget and carnage of the 2011 remake. Joe Dante knew to play it serious to a point but, all the while letting the cast and audience in on the fun. When you open a film with Gary Busey and a dead cow that farts piranha eggs, there's no point in pretending you're directing Jaws. The gore effects are fine although the CGI is even weaker then it's predecessor but, despite it's faults, there is some entertainment to be had. The cameos from some of the survivors from the last entry are fun and there are some funny bits, most involving The Hoff. It could have been a lot better but, Piranha 3DD did pass the time and I actually feel that with a better script and more serious story, John Gulager might actually deliver a decent B-movie. An OK time waster but, far short of the deliriously fun remake that precedes it.",

            "content": "Just when you thought it was safe to go to your local water park, \"Piranha 3DD\" is released on not-so-innocent viewers. The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success \"Piranha\" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.\n\nA school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.\n\nRoger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine \"Jaws\" if it took place in a water park the kids in \"Porky's\" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching \"Piranha 3DD.\"\n\nThe CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.\n\n\"Piranha 3DD\" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware. A great high-definition transfer and a few interesting special features make this a recommended buy for fans of Roger Corman creature features and the likes. \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

Gary Busey's character literally disappears early in the movie with absolutely no mention later.  And- David Hasselhoff from the trailer looked like he'd be playing a spoof of his baywatch character.  But I was hoping for the nicer, cooler side of that character- instead he plays the ultimate scumbag and media whore.  I know they're trying to play up the \"love to hate\" type of character but he was just annoying and unfunny.  Some of the lead women actresses in this were nice looking but the beach bimbos they get topless and naked in this look like second rate porn stars.  Some of them just looked repulsive and freakish.

All of a sudden David Hasselhoff walks into the movie. He's one of three big name cameos to make an appearance and is easily the only good part in the movie. Even the outtakes in the end are not funny at all. I can only speak for myself but I must say after enjoying the first part this sequel is a sheer disappointment.",

            "content": "So I thought that I needed to start reviewing movies properly again... So what better way than with the one and only Piranha 3DD. Now this movie has been completely and utterly ripped apart by critics and audiences a like, and I can see why, but after all these reviews, my standards were so low that it did surprise me on the main factor that I didn't think this movie was boring and I actually thought that Hasselhoff was the best part of this movie and actually created a few funny, and even clever moments. Now saying that he is 'the best part of the movie' isn't the biggest of compliments, I can appreciate that, but this movie isn't as god awful as some have said, and I think it is justifiable sequel to the first movie, although there is a lot of bad in this movie don't get me wrong. With pretty awful directing and some of the worst lines in recent movie history, it was bad on that scale, but, for me, it surpassed the scale of just being bad, but enjoyably bad. I enjoyed it enough that I don't hate it and that is down to a few parts here and there that just made it better, e.g. Christopher Lloyd, The Hoff and Gary Busey, apart from that that the performances are pretty god awful, but it is only 70 minutes long with actual story, so it isn't exactly slow, but I expected so much worse and just settled for a less than average. The only reason this isn't lower is because of the funny cameos, although it was depressing to see them in a sequel to Piranha out of anything else, but this will have to do for now.\n\nThe direction in this movie is pretty messy, with a lot of choppy editing and some shots that generally just look bad. It did seem to lack some of the real funny moments from the first one and I would have to say, similar to the first, that the first 30 minutes or so are just god awful, with some scenes that are so ridiculously gory and stupid that it just puts you off the movie, and then lines that followed that were made for laughs but just came off as lazy and stupid. That is the main problem with the direction here is that everything just felt a bit lazy, especially in the first half of this movie, as people ponder around, a few set pieces, but there are so many scenes with awful acting from the nobody actors and actresses of the horror industry, that you just watch and start to roll your eyes, line by line. The main problem here is that the ending is set up throughout the movie and you are waiting and waiting, then it happens, and then you are waiting and waiting and waiting. Credits. And that is it, you just experienced something that is respectfully risky but equally grotesque and slightly over the line. But still there is so much more fun that could have been had here, as they bring these interesting side characters in, who are so much more interesting and fun compared to the main characters, and they don't get much to do, and it reflected so poorly on the film.\n\nThis is the problem that I almost feel bad for giving this film a higher rating as I am truly aware that this is a bad, bad movie in a lot of ways, but I strangely enjoyed it at the same time, although being aware that everything that was happening was bad. The script in this movie was pretty awful and I think some of the lines just fell through, and I remember one line that David Koechner to his step daughter that is so childish and obviously lazy that is really off putting to watch on screen. Added to this, there are a few things that happen that just feel unnecessary, as some people who were bad first then find resolutions who are then killed off etc, and with a mildly amusing ending which brings it back to the feeling of the first film, where it gets that exploitation feel. It then ends. And it just feels a bit empty, and you then realize that this movie was extremely short, and should have probably just been a straight to DVD, or Straight to 3D Blu-ray. Also, I will say that I thought the 3D was fine and there were a few moments that worked well, but there seemed to be a few scenes that were a bit messy, and other scenes that seemed to be lacking in that real 3D effect.\n\nThe movie as a whole is simply down to how much you are bothered by the complete stupidity of the film, and how much you enjoy turning your brain off. I agree that you shouldn't have to. and especially to this extent, but if you have that ability, whenever Hasselhoff or Lloyd is on screen you will probably have a reasonably good time, but then the main characters will start speaking. And then it will just end.",

That just made it funnier, that's one damn hell of a hilarious movie, seriously the 1st one is just awesome, this is just not, the acting on some parts is really horrible, like the guy who has a piranha stuck up to his butt, now come on seriously?, the story buildup is just not quite what i've expected, just them going to the lake. found a piranha, though it may come to the waterpark and poof! where is the intense part there?

He's got strippers as lifeguards, underwater cams to film all the hot action in the pools and even invited non other than David Hasselhof to the opening day.

When a couple has sex, the man gets his penis bitten off by a baby-piranha that is inside the womans vagina... I admit: I had a few good laughs, so it's more comedy than horror.

I was excited to see the red band trailer with the realization that Project Greenlight horror director, John Gulagar was taking the helm.  The film's marketing promises more bustier bikini-wearing girls losing their tops to escape the flesh eating fish, and it lives up to it's promise.  However, don't go into the sequel with high expectations because neither the story, the CGI of the Piranha, nor the quality of fleshy women even come close to its predecessor.  \n\nMaddy, Danielle Panabaker, is a college coed with a wicked stepfather who perverting her mother's water park, turning it into an adult themed fun land.  Meanwhile, the prehistoric piranhas have found a way out of Lake Victoria into the stripper-filled cesspool, and it's Maddy who leads the charge to save the water park guests.  It is not a bad premise, but there is a lack of development and introduction to the characters in the story.  Matt Bush is perfect to play the nerdy kid infatuated with Maddy, but he's given no satisfying character arc.  Although he needs to be pathetic, a redeeming quality should be revealed to convince the audience and Maddy to fall in love with him.   \n\nThere are some good casting choices in the film.  Christopher Lloyd returns as the scientist who studies the fish; he was a wonderful surprise in the first film.  David Koechner is perfect for the role as a sleazy stepfather.  And David Hasselhoff was actually hilarious reprising his role as a Baywatch lifeguard.  However, a travesty was committed when casting the most important roles.  There may have been double the D's, but they cast girls of the hard plastic variety.  I find it appalling that the director didn't spend more time casting these most vital roles to the movie.   \n\nOn a more serious note, Piranha 3DD is missing a scenes that portray an interesting evolution of the fish or a scientific discovery from studying other predator fish.  It would have been exciting to see a school of piranha come up against another predator like a shark or an alligator.  I could imagine a shark swallowing a Piranha, only to be eaten from the inside out by the nasty fish.  Another example is the fish that can sense urine in the water and swims up a man's penis.  This would add a reason not to pee in the pool.   All this would add to the terror of swimming with a school of these fish in a pool.  \n\nIn the end, the film is an obvious melodrama about the dangers of promiscuous sex although the producers blatantly use tantalizing tits and astronomic asses to sell a ticket or dvd rental to thirteen year olds who still haven't figured out internet porn.  Piranha 3DD needed more story elements that furthered the mythology and evolution of the piranha, characters the audience care about, and more authentic bouncy buoyant boobs.  That being said, I still secretly hope there's a Piranha III 3D.",

This is even worse than Piranha II: The Spawning, and that was kind of a mess.  Originally, this series was all about being a Jaws spoof, but now it's all about crowbarring in as many terrible special effects and bad sex jokes as possible.  Everything about this is harebrained, from the terrible decisions every character makes throughout to just green lighting this atrocious script; it's more than obvious they didn't have any ideas for this, so why even make it?  Apart from David Koechner, who will be in anything for a paycheck, all of the stars look alarmingly distraught to be here: from a Gary Busey cameo to the Ving Rhames reprisal (didn't he die in the last movie?), and from Christopher Lloyd's five minutes to David Hasselhoff completely selling his soul for about two dozen Baywatch jokes, it is all just a sad sight to behold.  The dialogue is just awful, and the acting is even worse, and on top of that, there is also the fact that this is really poorly shot.  Most direct-to-video movies are better than this, and it is just offensively bad.",

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Piranha 3-D so I was a little letdown by this sequel.  The fact that the film makes fun of itself knowing it's bad is what made the first film so enjoyable.  3DD has that but it's just not as good a second time around.  The plot is paper-thin but really, it doesn't have to be Inception here.  The script itself is full of cheesy dialogue although there are some quotes here that I will never forget, especially one from Katrina Bowden.  Like the first film, it's more of a comedy than it a horror flick, but there are some very gory and bloody scenes.  Some of the moments here will have you rolling your eyes but there are some kills here that are flat out hilarious.  There's also a lot of nudity, unfortunately not from any of the main characters I wanted to see. The cast includes Danielle Panabaker as Maddy, our heroaine, Matt Bush as Barry, the guy who likes Maddy, David Koechner as Chet, the sleazy owner of the water park, Katrina Bowden as Shelby, a dumb blonde virgin, Chris Zylka as Kyle, Ving Rhames reprises his role as Deputy Fallon and Christopher Lloyd is back as well as the wacky Piranha expert.  One of the highlights of the film is a fun cameo from David Hasselhoff.  Make it clear, Piranha 3DD is in no way a great film but it did it's job of entertaining me and it was still better than Battleship.\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: MEH\r\n\r\nyoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nfacebook: facebook.com/westroopalist\r\ntwitter: @WesAlist",

            "content": "Well the story of the film is pretty much Jaws 3-D, just with Piranhas. The Piranhas from the first film find a way to get in a water park and wreak havoc. \r\n \r\nPiranha 3DD doesn't really hold much in terms of deep storytelling, special effects etc. But viewers who just want to have fun while having spare time and money could enjoy it.  The film contains comedy, nudity and lots of gore. And gore hounds may cheer with joy when they see this. But I don't think the amount of gore rivals that of its predecessor. \r\n\r\nThe film benefits from some recognizable faces such as David Hasselhoff who played Mitch Buchannon in Baywatch and Christopher Lloyd who played Dr. Emmett Brown in the Back to the Future films.  David Hasselhoff plays a parody of himself in this film, expressing a more killjoy persona while Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Mr. Goodman. Seeing both these characters in film gives a viewer like me a sense of nostalgia which added to the overall enjoyment of the film. And the two give funny and enjoyable performances, David Hasselhoff in particular. Danielle Panabaker plays the main heroine for the film. Panabaker is a pretty seasoned actress, appearing in films such as Sky High, The Crazies, The Ward, as well as a bunch of TV shows such as the Guardian, Law and Order Special Victims Unit etc. Panabaker does an okay job of portraying her character, though her character here doesn't leave that much of an impression in my eyes. The film also benefits from some scenes with Ving Rhames and Garey Busey.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is probably not much to behold. But I think the movie does a good job of having the viewers forget their troubles for a few minutes, and I think that's what it's supposed to do.",

So why make it, probably because the creators of piranha 3-D thought if this movie is did good we should make a sequal. They also thought if it was in 3-D it will make just as much money, but guess what, Piranha 3DD turned out to be a big box office bomb. This movie is so horrible I dont need to explain why this movie stinks. So overall my review/rant explains this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I would give Piranha 3DD a half star out of five. No i would not recemened this for the blood fearing part of the audience, in fact I wouldn't recemened this for anyone. Its double the dumb, double the cheap thrills, and double the boring. As the tagline promises, double the action, double the terror, and double the D's. I would beg to differ there my friends.",

The first installment was bad that it was good, and overall great fun, but \"3DD\" was just a disgrace. Filled with terrible acting, a dreadful script, mediocre plot and effects, and not to mention David Hasselhoff, this flick can rest on the bottom of the lake with the piranhas for all I care.",

I'd watch it again!",
