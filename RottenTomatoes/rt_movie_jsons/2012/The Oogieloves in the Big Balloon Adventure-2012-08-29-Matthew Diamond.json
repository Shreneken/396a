But, when the last five magical balloons in LovelyLoveville are lost, Goobie, Zoozie and Toofie must find them, or the party will be a disaster. Along the way, the Oogieloves meet some interesting characters (Toni Braxton, Cloris Leachman, Christopher Lloyd) who help them in their quest, but will the three friends find the balloons in time to save the party?",

            "content": "All this because the head of the American distributor of the Teletubbies wanted to make a Teletubby movie.  Somehow I doubt a the movie would be any better with the Teletubbies instead of the Oogiloves.  Speaking as someone who remembers his childhood pretty well, even as a 5 year old I still would have hated these terrible annoying condescending dorks.  And the whole idea of an interactive movie in theaters was a bad idea.  But other media for little-little kids like \"Sesame Street\", the \"Electric Company\" or hell, \"Mr. Rogers\" didn't feel like they were talking down to kids.  Kids media today, like this turd or \"Barney and Friends\" or \"Dora The Explorer\" really treat kids like morons.  But this turd isn't even educational.  How the hell did the Oogiloves get Christopher Lloyd, Cloris Leachman and Toni Braxton?  I really don't care if I'm not the target audience.  I don't care if this for basically toddlers. This is nothing but condescending pandering noise that no human being should see.  This is no passion project this is a cash in on annoying pop culture kiddie stuff.",

            "content": "I have no point of reference here. Not being a parent, the Oogieloves are a new experience for me, and at first glance they seem to be no more or less irritating then the stuff I pass by while flipping channels on my way to something else. My kneejerk reaction is to call their movie \"harmless\" yet something troubles me. At the very beginning of The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure the titular characters inform the kids in the audience that this movie requires an interactive response. When the movie signals you - by way of butterflies floating across the bottom of the screen - that you are to stand up and dance and sing. In other words, the movie is asking your kids to do the very thing that we have been taught all our lives not to do. It can only be hoped that this does not become a trend.\n\nIf you've heard of The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure then you've probably heard of it's now famous legacy, released on August 29th 2013 on 2000 screens it quickly became one of the worst selling movies of all time taking in around $500,000 on it's opening weekend on a $12,000,000 budget.\n\nNot knowing what I was in for, I did a quick internet search and discovered that the movie is based on a TV series called \"My Bedbugs\" featuring the adventures of three colorful child characters called Gooby, Toofy, and Woozy. To be honest, I have no idea which one is Gooby, which one is Toofy or which one is Woozy and I only finished the movie 20 minutes ago - not that I was struggling to keep up. I have no idea how this movie ties in with the show, but having seen the movie, I'm not exactly killing myself to investigate further. I can see from an IMDb search that \"My Bedbugs\" was only on two seasons and ended its run in 2005 which means that the intended audience for this movie probably wasn't even born when the show ended. Are the parents flying blind?\n\nThe story of the movie is basically a hanger on which to hang a bunch of musical numbers and songs and interactive bits for the kids in the audience. The journey follows the Oogies as they are preparing to celebrate the birthday of Schluufy, the pillow that sleeps on their couch. But the magic balloons they bought for Schluufy float away and we are told that they are the last magic balloons to be found. The rest of the movie is a song and dance journey to find the five balloons before Schluufy wakes up. The journey takes us through a malt shop, a travelling sombrero, a bubble truck etc. etc.\n\nThe world the kids live in is not a million miles removed from \"Pee Wee's Playhouse.\" Their guardian is a vacuum cleaner named J. Edgar (who bears a nearly litigious resemblance to The Rug Doctor) and a window named Wendy who is their view of the entire world. The look of the movie seems to be a distant cousin of the Sid and Marty Krofft style of the 1970s most notably \"The Banana Splits\" only without the zaniness or the aura of the 70s groovy time capsule. The characters are adult-sized costumed actors with big eyes that move and mouths that barely move when they talk. They look like lesser versions of The Muppets and inspire you to wonder why this movie wasn't animated.\n\nNaturally my own reaction was kind of indifferent, though I was surprised by an incredible amount of celebrity cameos, some of whom looked game but many of whom looked baffled and confused. There's Cloris Leachman, Toni Braxton, Christopher Lloyd, Jamie Pressley, Chazz Palminteri and Cary Elwes.  Elwes is the most baffling, playing a guy named Bobby Wobbly who looks and acts like Jim Carrey. None of these actors appear as themselves, and none is on-screen for more than a minute or two. They are there to sing a song and move along.\nWill the little ones enjoy it? Probably. It's bright and it's colorful and it has a lot of motion and music. But it's not anything you would need to see in a theater. It's a perfectly serviceable DVD where the kids can interact with it in their living room. Again, I'm not sure I am comfortable with the idea of a movie that requires children to sing and dance and act up in a movie theater. And again, I'm not a parent. I would be more comfortable putting a child in front of The Wizard of Oz or My Neighbor Totoro or Toy Story or Mary Poppins. Those movies will stay in your kid's mind for the rest of their lives. Oogieloves will stay with them as long as the DVD is still running.",

I will be the first to admit that it is very silly, and yes--I'll say it--corny as well.\n\nBut you see--that is really the beauty of this movie. This movie wasn't designed to have \"something for the whole family\" in it--it was specifically targeted to 2-7 year olds--and what they find funny I just don't (or I hope I wouldn't, haha--though I thought J Edgard's name as the Vacuum was cute and clever--Hoover, get it??). So by being over the top crazy and goofy it made my 2 and 4 year old laugh, dance, and giggle--and I enjoyed it simply because they were enjoying it--not because it would be the kind of movie I'd watch alone with my hubby. (RatedGGG remember?!)\n\nThese days children's movies act like they have to be some Blockbuster thriller that you'd go on a date, sans kids, to otherwise they're no good. And while I'm the first one to love and watch movies like that--I really don't feel like every kids movie can or even should meet that.\n\nSo I recommend the The Oogieloves in the BIG Balloon Adventure as exactly what it is supposed to be--a super silly, funny, goofy 88 minutes that your preschooler will love and that you can all have fun at--not worrying about having to shush or tell anyone to stop wiggling during it.",

The most \"inappropriate\" event is that one character's pants are always falling down (and the kids are prompted to yell at him for it \"Goofy Toofie!

When the movie was over she sat through the credits bouncing in her seat along with the credits music, then when it was over she looked to us and said, \"More?\" After being told it was all done and there was no more, she frowned for a second, then brightened and happily exclaimed, \"AGAIN!\"  \n\nWhat else do you need to know. :) It was loads of fun to watch the kiddos laugh and sing and dance around. They were so into it! And Moms and Dads, if you're worried your little one won't be able to sit through a whole feature length movie, ours barely makes it through a half hour cartoon, but every time she started to get squirrely it was time to get up and dance again.

Took a 2.5 yr old to the film, and she was engaged for the whole thing (it was her first movie).  The movie is not for adults at all, and I must admit it annoys me when critics don't get not every film needs to be for all ages.  This was a cute, simple film for very young people.  It worked perfectly, and was a great first movie for the intended age group.",

Best of all, you dont have to tell you kids to \"be quite\" or \"sit still\" as this movie expects kids and parents to dance and sing along.",

We were the only people so I didn't care that I had to dance every 5 minutes.  I did not like it but I am an adult. My daughter LOVED it. When we paid they gave her a glow stick to wave when the butterflies flew by. She got excited when she predicted the butterflies arrival correctly. Loved the turtle run across the screen that told you it was time to sit down. After it was over she was singing the songs and couldn't stop talking about the ooogies all afternoon. \nFrom an adult standpoint I could feel my brains rotting from all the terrible acting and the creepy big headed oogies. I think kids will love this movie but the parents are not going to subject themselves to this in a dark room with nothing to distract them from it.  It reminded me of h r pufnstuf. But my memory is fuzzy of what it's about.",
