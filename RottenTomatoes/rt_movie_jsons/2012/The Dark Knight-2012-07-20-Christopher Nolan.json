    "summary": "It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale), in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), vanished into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed everything for what he and Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.",

            "content": "A very solid conclusion to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Ledger's Joker performance puts the Dark Knight ahead of this one for greatness... and Hardy's Bane voice is silly and distracting, so that's a strike against it... but, again, the script, directing, score and cast are all fantastic (including some nice additions like Joseph Gordon Levitt, Matthew Modine and Anne Hathaway).",

            "content": "I think this is the weakest of the Christopher Nolan films, because it just tries to say too much and introduces new characters while also trying to close out the trilogy and the other characters. But this just goes to show that even Christopher Nolan's weakest film is an epic blockbuster with a bunch of great practical effects and amazing stunt work. I think the film has the best opening scene out of the 3 films and bane is a very intimidating threat for Bruce. Catwoman I'm not to fond of but Anne Hathaway did a good job with what she was given. The last 10 minutes are quite intense and pretty great pay off. 8/10",

This film had amazing action Sequences and Tom Hardys portrayal as Bane has redeemed the villain since Banes appearance in that horrible Batman Movie Batman and Robin. I\u2019m Grateful for this film but I\u2019m sad it was the last one ",

            "content": "It's an All Time Classic. The acting is very good. bane is a very good villain, Bale is very good also although I have the same problems with him as Batman vs Wayne as the others. The supporting cast is phenomenal including JGL. The main problem that holds the acting back from being amazing is Anne Hathaway feels miscast as Catwoman and honestly the character feels like it shouldn't be in the film. Talia should have taken her place. The cinematography is very good loaded with amazing practical effects, action scenes, amazing camerawork, memorable scenes with the only problem is there are several questionable scenes that ask you to suspend your disbelief. One could argue there is ALOT in this film, but me personally there are only a handful (some more than others) that I couldn't do it for. The main ones  were punching his back into place and firing live missiles at a truck carrying a nuclear bomb. I know a lot of people have complaints about other scenes but I felt they were done so well that I had no problem believing them. The editing and pacing is excellent in this. this doesn't feel like a 3 hour film and it keeps very focused throughout. This is definitely something everyone should check out. It's not the Dark Knight level of perfection but its imperfections are so minor it doesn't matter.",
