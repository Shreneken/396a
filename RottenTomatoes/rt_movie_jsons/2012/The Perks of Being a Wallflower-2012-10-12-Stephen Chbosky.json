            "content": "The film \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is based on the same titled novel by Author and director Stephen Chbosky. It follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a sixteen-year boy, through his first year of high school where he makes friends, finds love and grows up. There he befriends the Stepsiblings Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), with whom he spends the majority of his time. Charlie is a very self-conscious and inexperienced teenage boy with just a few friends. To change this, he decides to befriend Sam and Patrick, who gladly accept him into their circle of friends. With his new friend group, Charlie has his first experiences with alcohol, drugs, love, and a variety of other things. Over the time he develops feelings for Sam, but decides not to act on them, because their friendship is too important to him, and he sees Sam as more mature and experienced than he is.\nWhat I like about the film is, how close to the reality, but also the novel it is. A lot of the scenes are directly adapted from the Novel, but I feel like a few very important things, that show Charlies character, are missing in the novel. For example, his \"relationship\" to Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). My favourite scene has to be of course the Tunnel scenes but I also really like, how the pictured the rocky horror picture show. \nMost of the characters are how I imagined them reading the novel, like Patrick or Sam. Although most characters were casted great, I think they could have done a better job casting Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman). I still loved the character, but the actress didn't fit the role in my opinion. \nIn conclusion, I think the movie is really good, but after reading the novel it was a tiny bit disappointing. I still would recommend watching it, even though I would recommend reading the novel first, because it helps understand some of the scenes.",

Many scenes were taken from the book and look exactly like what I‘d imagined them while reading. The movie is well made and I really liked the setting of the movie from Charlie's room to the school to, obviously, the scenes in the tunnel. \nThe characters are also very similar to what I imagined and are well-developed. I really liked Sams character but she looked nothing like what I imagined. Emma Watson doesn't look as bossy and confident as Sam seems in the boob and I think that they could've chosen a better actor for her.\nThe only thing I didn't like about this movie has nothing to do with how it was made but rather with how well developed some characters are. I loved characters like Patrick but I can't stand Charlie and Mary Elizabeth. Both of their characters seem a little „too much\" for me, since Charlie is shown as so helpless that I find it hard to believe that people like him really exist. Mary Elizabeth is the opposite since I‘ve met people like her before and I did not like them. She talks too much and is a realistic but an annoying character to me.\n\nIn conclusion I think that the movie is definitely well made and worth watching especially for people who have read the novel. However since I didn't really like Charlie's character I don't think that I will ever read the novel or watch the movie again.",

Fist of all is he a very shy guy and can barely new friend before Highschool. Second his favourite aunt Helen died. He was very sad, but a the end he get to know, that he had a really bad past relationship with her. \n\nThe Movie has a lot of serious topics. First of all the book talks about. Sexual assault, bulling, drugs and low self lover. The Book has also way more topics. \n\nIn my opinion is the Movie good, but i find the book way better. In the book you can feel the feelings from the actors more and also you have a complete other feeling when you read the book. If you really like to read the books, you can first read the book before watching the Movie, but if you do not like to read books the Movie is a good alternative.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS/TW(sa, mental illness)***I've seen tons of reviews on many websites saying that this movie is cliche, it's not.  People probably say this because it's about an outcast who finds new and amazing friends but it's more than that. The story of this movie and book is so meaningful and well written. Some may find it comforting that this shows that those who have been through similar things aren't alone. The fact that it doesn't come out and say that Charlie has PTSD and depression but the story shows it very well tells you how well written this is. It was so heartbreaking to find out what Charlie's aunt did to him, for most of the story she seemed like she was very nice and she was the one who he looked up to. But when the audience found out how disgusting she really is I couldn't help but break down in tears. I started crying even harder when he called his sister after he walked home and it just showed how easy it is to fall back into that dark place again. He has been through so much. This story just accumulates how you never know what someone is going through and although some may look like they're doing okay but in reality they are hanging onto life by a thread. It's also very encouraging to see that even though it gets really bad sometimes, things can get better. As a whole I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone(make sure you have plenty of tissues) on any movie night occasion with friends or just on a quiet night by yourself. This book and movie is so well written, although I haven't actually read the book I am definitely going to within the next few days. Just remember things do get better and you are loved and you deserve the whole world!!",

Admittedly I'm not the target demographic but the screenplay is the most empty, hackneyed, pretentious, cliched garbage I've ever sat through. Yeah, it exposed a bunch of kids to The Smiths but it also connected The Smiths to a bunch of whiny, hyper dramatic, melodramatic kids who were all void of any real character and even a hint of  depth: \"OMG, you read books? You're so quirky and different! Being a rich, white kid is just sooooooo hard, I think I'm going to have a breakdown as I grow into an age where I understand empathy and try to take on all the pain of the world because my aunt went to buy me a present and died on the way there, OMG.\" Ugh. Honestly, it's offensive to the basic ideas of youth and discovery and likely created a big chunk of kids who grew up to be young adults who still think that reading Cather in the Rye is some kind of experiment in soul searching and that edibles are a gateway to expanding your mind. I'm glad I grew up in the generation before writers gave up and started just pumping our commercial garbage for the sake of sales and profit. But I think it speaks volumes that this movie weakly references all kinds of 80s pop culture because that generation literally doesn't have any of their own. They still prop up Salinger because writers since the early aughts have written garbage like Perks of Being A Wallflower. Think that book will ever be referenced in a coming of age movie about finding yourself? Exactly. God, let's hope things improve on that front because it's sad to think the best days of culture, intellectualism, writing and art are behind us and all the next generation has to look forward to are simpleton money making profit vehicles designed to make even the most puerile emotions seem complex and life changing. Poor kids. Keep mining the past, seriously. Because if this is the best that generation had to compare their lives to in terms of some kind of complex development , it's no wonder that none of them vote, live with their parents and think that college degrees are a waste of time.

This movie is cliche, has corny quotes, below average cinematography, it's boring, and the comedy doesn't land. This movie has many side characters that aren't fleshed out which makes you not give a shit about them. The acting in this movie is terrible and it feels like you're watching theatre kids from behind the scenes when they're not at school. Many things in this movie are brought up only to not be properly explained or brought up again including Charlie abruptly saying his friend killed himself, Derrick cheating on Charlies sister, Charlie wishing to become a writer when he grows up, Patrick being revealed to be gay, and Charlie stating that he killed his aunt. None of the character relations to each other make any sense. Charlie randomly befriends Patrick and becomes a part of his friend group when they've never interacted with each other before other than being in the same class. Charlies friendship with his teacher is sporadic and the teacher is seen giving Charlie books which are never shown or explained. Sam and Patrick are stated to be step siblings but are then seen kissing each other on the cheek and dancing together during school dances. The love triangles in this movie are the worst I've seen in all of cinema. Sam explains to Charlie that she likes Craig which is another character who is never introduced or fleshed out. Right after she kisses Charlie and says \"I love you.\" Charlie decides that he's now going to ask Sam out to go to the dance but instead goes to the dance with Mary although there is no build up between the two. Charlie then lies and tells Mary that he loves her and the two start dating. After this he kisses Sam right in front of Mary and both Sam and Mary get angry at Charlie and storm out while Patrick vaguely explains that the both of them have had beef in the past which is never properly explained. Mary and Sam are then seen eating lunch together the next day despite what just happened, Mary gets a new boyfriend and seems to get over Charlie quickly, and Sam and Charlie are now randomly cool again without addressing the situation as if nothing ever happened. Patrick then brings Charlie to a forest and explains to him how his boyfriend broke up with him because his dad found out he was gay and then randomly kisses Charlie on the lips without warning and this situation is never brought up again. This whole movie takes place over four years of high school when it really just feels like one continuous year. Charlie goes from being a freshmen to then graduating in what feels like a matter of months. Sam and Patrick then move to a different city after graduating but then randomly show up to Charlie's door while he's eating dinner without warning. Sam and Charlie end up together at the end of the movie when there was no build up for it especially with all these love triangles. This might be the most disorganized movie I have ever watched and it truly felt like a project made by a film student who had no prior experience or interest in film. It seriously confuses and worries me how this movie has such a high rating on both the tomatometer and more importantly the audience score.",

They end the movie with a confusing, yet clearly stated moral. It seems irrelevant to the story of the movie as a whole.

Poor guy had to go through so much at such a young age. I will say there are a few trigger warnings with this movie so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It includes very heavy themes that the actors did amazing at displaying. This movie put me through a rollercoaster of emotions that left me in tears by the end. It had me forgetting that this was a movie as it just felt so raw and real. I personally think this is a cinematic masterpiece and deserves more recognition.

            "content": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a superb film that made my heart race, sink, and laugh. It tends to be an accurate representation of the way of living of a great number of teenagers and adds to the relatability of this movie. The characters are really touching and very endearing. Released in October 2012 and directed by the author of the book it was inspired by : Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower stars Logan Lerman, in the main role of Charlie, Emma Watson, as Sam and Ezra Miller, as Patrick.\n              Charlie, a sixteen-year-old teenager, is nervous about entering high school in his freshman year. After being discharged from a mental health care institution, he wonders if, with his shy and antisocial nature he is going to make some friends. That's his encounter with Patrick and his stepsister Sam, at a football game that is going to change his life.\n              The main trio manages to capture the essence of teenage years while still showing the gap of two years between Charlie and the two seniors, more mature and experienced in a way. Lerman achieves to portray the mindset of a traumatised being and manages to move its audience in exposing and showing how his past impacts Charlie in his present. Patrick is well represented as a queer person; he is portrayed by Ezra Miller as a non-stereotypical gay and comes as a very touching character. His personality stands out when Miller falls in love and shows his love for his friends, which feels real and is outstandingly believable. Patrick is the comic element of this movie, but there is still a depth in his soul and a past in his life. The fact that we learn to know every character throughout the film is amazing because we learn their past, and their traumas, their lives. Sam is portrayed as a strong young woman by Emma Watson, struggling in her love life, and finding comfort in music and becoming really close to Charlie. Their love for each other feels so natural and it is nice to see movies in which characters really seem to love each other in the ways we would feel in real life.\n              For the filming techniques, some scenes are really moving, touching, and filmed in such a way, that you feel like taking part of the movie. There is for example, towards the end of the movie just after Sam's departure, when Charlie questions himself and has a mental breakdown where he is tempted by the idea of suicide. This scene ruled by anxiety is interspersed with memories and traumas that aggravated his state and shows us how he became in such a state. There is also a lot of music throughout the whole movie, notably is the iconic scene in the tunnel, in which we understand that Sam enjoys feeling the wind on her skin, feeling more free and more infinite than ever.\n              This movie conveys a message, first and foremost of love. But is also talks about serious topics like domestic and child abuse, the LGBTQ+ cause as well as just being accepted as who we are. Charlie is a wallflower, he is seen as only part of the decor and doesn't really mean anything, and Charlie has trouble fitting in socially, so he is a wallflower. But in the eyes of his friends, as Patrick once says in the movie : \"You see things. And you understand. You are a wallflower\", addressing Charlie. It conveys a message of acceptance and tolerance. They are delivered smoothly throughout the movie, making you cry and laugh, impacting you in such a way that it is impossible to feel indifferent about.\n              As a teenager, it is hard to identify and not to feel lonely in the things we are experiencing. It is why we mostly rely on our friends, our age, who have a real impact on our lives as they understand what we feel and share our feelings. My evaluation of this film may be a little false because I have not lived that much trauma in my life but it truly gives off good vibrations in the end and could help more than one, feeling unsure about themselves and bad in their bodies. I truly recommend this stunning movie.",

Also, the book also got straight to explaining Charlie's struggles by telling the reader that Michael, Charlie's friend killed himself whereas, in the movie, it wasn't mentioned until more than halfway through. Overall, the book and movie are both great but I like how the story was told more in the book.",

            "content": "Perks of being a wallflower, a film directed by Stephen Chbosky in 2012 starring Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and Ezra Miller is the coming of age movie. This film was perfectly designed, from the imagery to the actors' chemistry towards themselves and their roles. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, coping with death, loneliness, and the pressures and how hard trying to fit in can be. This film is truly refreshing in all aspects so much is not spoken about, but the images and scenes set up in this film provide the viewer with ‘insider' information that really keeps the viewer focused on the film. The director, Stephen Chbosky is also the author of the book version of this film, also he is the screenplay writer. The different themes are quite recongnizable and easy to catch on to: first love, drug use, homosexuality, sexual abuse and friendship. The film starts out with a freshly new freshman loner Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) who actually carries the heavy weight of dark secrets. Luckily, unique and strong-minded seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her homosexual stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) take him under their wing and invites him to their friend group. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) developed feelings for Charlie and his laid back English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) spots great potential in his work and encourages him in the best ways. The screenplay in this film is by far one of the best I have seen, it takes you on a very emotional rollercoaster. One moment you find yourself caught in a dramatic scene, then a sad one, and then funny all within seconds. This film really highlights the true feelings and how introverts go through their thought process and all the perks of embracing being a wallflower. \nThe imagery and acting in this film gives a strong sense of real life. The three leads perform so many memorable performances in the film that you can't help, but to feel the emotions that they are portraying. The topic of highschool kids struggles is very cliche, yet this film does such a great job at providing realism on how it was to be a highschooler in the late 80's/ early 90's and the struggle of offbeat kids who appear to be disengaged, but  still manage to find the positive side of this and have some fun even with all of the troubles with family, social conventions, and the discovery of one's sexuality during the painful adolescent phase that everyone can relate with because everyone has or will have to go through similar phases in their lives. \nThe soundtrack to the film also helps captivate the emotions that are being shown in the film, it really helps bring the film together so you get a sort of ‘vibe' for what each scene is kind of like just a presumption. This film also has some flashbacks of Charlie's past experiences which helps the viewer identify or get insight on what he went through in life and events that lead him to where he is at. The novel had a lot of buzz and was highly cherished when it was first released and some would argue that ‘the books are always better than the movie', however in this case there is no doubt that the statement is inaccurate in regards to this film. Both the novel and the film flatters each other in the best way. I personally think this is one of the best coming of age films to watch. Simply because the scenes are so intense and are very thought-provoking. Everyone fell in love with the film as they did the novel. I feel as though this is because it truly captures a little something for everyone, meaning that this film can connect people of all different kinds of backgrounds, races, and religions to its raw story. The film also has such a good group of supporting actors that help build the momentum throughout the whole movie. I feel as though with all the aspects shown in the film the imagery still has to be my favorite part of the film because it is personal and natural. I imagine most of the credit for that is due to the author because for any writer who wanted to take hold and keep the film of his novel true to the novel and become the director who also worked very hard on his own to make the screenplay for this beautiful film. A very abundant amount of  a sense of ownership and detailed  perception which really sets a very real performance of what he wants to reveal in the film. Chbosky created such raw and memorable dialogue along with some crazy good interplay between the characters that again makes the film feel that much more relatable. The film does include a lot of dark humor here and there, I feel as though that was Chbosky's way of really including those more in-depth emotions in the film. The storyline deals a lot with a person who is mentally ill and the emotional harm that was placed on him from his past experiences. \n\tIf I had to rate this film from 1 (being the worst) and 10 (being the best) I can honestly score this film a 9. I give this film a 9 because even though the imagery was great I felt as though there could have been more intimate scenes between the characters because that is a huge part of the highschool experience and finding your ‘funk'. I do highly recommend this film for anyone who seems stuck in their tracks at the moment and wants to reconnect with themselves. The film is so well put together and with the jokes and all the way to the upsetting parts it truly takes you on a ride with your emotions. The quotes and metaphors mentioned in the movie are also very thought-provoking and stay with you, Chbosky was very clever with how he wrote his screenplay. Again this film is very high up on my recommendation list and watching this film if you haven't already is something you should put on your bucket list.",

Furthermore, everyone was good looking, the probability of so many people suffering from child abuse is unlikely, and the focus on child abuse led to a strange ending. Then the film seemed to be promoting the use of drugs during adolescence and contained the gay kids getting caught cliché. The acting was fine, although Emma Watson's American accent sounded inauthentic, but the comedy was rather cringeworthy, and the pacing could have been better because the events were largely repetitive. On the other hand, the cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were all decent. However, there were no perks of being a wallflower.",

But the placement of certain events in the story that is supposed to get you emotional, just didn't do it for me. The choices the characters made were not logical and felt like just put there randomly to try if the audience would fall for it amidst the confusion that was displayed and be done with it. Lack of inspiration is the best thing to describe this movie, which is a shame with such a talented cast, but I didn't felt invested. Big disappointment for me",

            "content": "Coming of age stories are centered around teenagers as they try to cope with the possibilities of life, even if these possibilities can be good or bad. Charlie has had a traumatic past, and throughout the movie, we know he suffers his fair share of demons which culminates in his anxiety and blackouts. We're led to assume that his mental health issues started because of his best friends suicide, but that was there to distract us from the truth and become unaware of the bombshells that the movie likes to set up for the audience member. And the writing also helps disguise this, with its focus on the main group of characters, which I'll call the Wallflowers.\n\nThe group dynamic of the Wallflowers was wonderfully executed and their interactions felt genuine. Their group had their highs, like the Christmas party, and their lows, like when Charlie broke up with Mary Elizabeth. Because of these highs and lows, the group was constantly changing and pushing the story forward with new plot threads such as Brad breaking up with Patrick after his dad discovered them in bed one night. Although we don't get as much character development on Mary Elizabeth and Alice, we get lots of character development for the others!\n\nReally quick though, I need to address the absolutely stacked cast list this movie has. The directors did such a good job with casting these roles and I loved each person included. We got Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller, and surprisingly Paul Rudd? His inclusion surprised me but it was a welcome surprise nonetheless. \n\nLet's start with Patrick (played by Ezra Miller). When we are first introduced to him, he is basically told by the workshop teacher that he is \"Nothing\", but Patrick doesn't even flinch and makes a snarky remark back at him. After this, everyone at school starts to call him nothing, which always sparks a similar reaction out of Patick. The only people that don't talk to him like this (that we see) are his sister Sam, the Wallflowers, and his secret boyfriend Brad. The first time we see him break his confident barrier is when Charlie finds Brad and Patrick in bed for the first time. Patrick is nervous about being outed makes Charlie promise to not say anything about what he saw. (Sidenote. I loved how the best friend actually kept a secret, and this wasn't used as a cheap tactic to cause drama between Brad and Patrick).\n\nBut this nervous breakdown was only the foreshadowing his character arcs climax, where Brad and Patrick break up in the school cafeteria. When Patrick tries to explain to Brad his feelings, Brad gaslights Patrick and denies everything he says so he doesn't get embarrassed in front of his friends. And the nail in the coffin hit right when Brad called him nothing. \n\nIf I know anything, it is that harsh words hurt when it comes from someone you love. Just like Patrick, I can shrug off an insult from a random nobody on the street but what I can't shake is hearing that from someone close to me. So when Patrick finally punched Brad in the face, I bet that Patrick felt relief in that moment, letting go of his emotions all in a single punch to his stupid face. (If you can't tell, Patrick is my favorite character)\n\nLooking closer at the story, all that Patrick wants is to be himself and accepted for who he is, but society keeps telling him he's nothing and that because he's gay there's something wrong about him. I'm glad that he has friends who accept him for who he is, and my heart goes out to the people who don't have the same support system as Patrick. I hope he finds love in due time.\n\nAnother favorite character is Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). The movie wastes no time establishing that Charlie is an outcast, that he's quiet, and that he is struggling to find his place in the world (which at this point is high school). I think the characterization of Charlie was wonderfully executed because these traits make him a relatable character for lots of people, especially those who are going through their own mental problems in their life. Not everyone is an outcast and not everyone is quiet, but I believe that everyone can relate to the struggle of finding their place in the world. When I watched this movie, I could relate to a lot of these things so I found myself really engaged with his character arc. Also he's a writer and I'm trying to get better at writing too so we have a similar goal in mind.\n\nA piece of foreshadowing of Charlie's past with Aunt Helen, was when he was witnessing Ponytail Derek slapping his sister Candace (played by Nina Dobrev) in the face. He automatically went to defend his sister from Derek until Candace stopped him from coming into their room. I think that this was great foreshadowing for the eventual reveal that he was sexually abused by his aunt. I'd like to think that his motivation for protecting his sister wasn't only because they were siblings but rather because he didn't want her to go through the same thing. I wish we saw more of Candace, but her role in the story was pretty great, and I would assume it'd be hard to include lots of screentime to Candace since she wasn't a part of the Wallflowers. \n\nSomething that surprised me about the story's execution of telling Charlie's story, was how it kept the causes of Charlie's anxiety a secret until the end of the movie. We have little indicators here and there that might suggest the true cause of why he ended up like this in the beginning of the movie, but nothing concrete until the end. And even by the end, the answers given to us are pretty vague and they leave a lot to our imagination. I believe the director decided that the movie had to keep the truth from the audience, just as Charlie was keeping the truth from everyone else. What the director wanted us to do was focus on how his anxiety and depression was affecting his life and relationships, showing audience members what their lives can be like.\n\nHonestly, this character has a bunch of quirks that I could talk about in their own separate paragraph, but I think that this character works because of Logan Lerman's performance. All those little quirks wouldn't be there if he didn't pour his heart and soul into his performance.  And when your character is quiet by nature, the actor that plays this character needs to be able to tell the audience who they are, by using body expressions. So props to you Logan, you really did something great with this character. Now what about the third member of the main trio?\n\nSam (played by Emma Watson) was probably my least favorite character of the trio but I'm not saying that to make fun of the character. Sam doesn't really have a lot of character development to go through, so she plays the role of a mentor/guardian and love interest to Charlie. Seeing her in these roles are not surprising, but she still gives him advice even when she is dating another guy (I forgot his name sorry lol). But even when she wasn't even good friends with him, she helps Charlie from doing anything stupid and when her friends get Charlie high and she takes him upstairs to mellow out. Or when she learned that Charlie had no friends after his best friend committed suicide and made him a part of the wallflowers. \n\nSo if you're wondering why a character with no big character development is in the story well I have to tell you that her character is absolutely crucial to the movie's success. First off, she is the glue that keeps the Wallflower's together, through a lot of their lows. For instance, she is the first to console Mary Elizabeth when Charlie kisses Sam in front of her, and she is the person to eventually invite Charlie back to the group after he saved Patrick from being to a pulp. \n\nThe second thing is unrelated to the actual story, but I wanted to explain how her character affects pacing. Sam gives Charlie advice and consoles him multiple times, and if you stop to think about it, she is really the catalyst that starts Charlie's change as a person. If Sam was removed from the story entirely, the writer would have to create a new character to fit this mold so they can spark character development for Charlie. So while this isn't the most revolutionary character ever made, this character was perfect for the movie it was made for. Also Sam has a cool taste in music so that's pretty gnarly.\n\nSpeaking of music, this soundtrack SLAPS! This isn't just because they give us quality songs from the 80s (which is the best year of music, don't @ me), because these songs contribute to establish the time frame when this movie took place, which was some solid world building. Also the song Heroes by David Bowie, has always been a 10/10 song, but whenever it is used at the end of a movie or series to give it that last emotional moment, I will always have chills. \n\nSo if you couldn't tell, I loved this movie. 10/10",

(Written by Bryce)\n\nAlthough I gave the film a rating of 8/10, to me it's one of my all-time favs. and the reason why I gave it that rating and not more is because I rate films based on specific criteria and this film is missing some important elements like directing. But, overall this film is highly recommended. \n\nThe film's story is very emotional and touching. The story of the three characters (Sam, Patrick, and Charlie) is being told very well and in a way that was very smooth. The film has so many topics to discuss from depression to suicide to homosexuality and there's even more. But, the result was more than beautiful, it's challenging to be able to discuss too many topics in just 1h 48m. The film also has its happy/funny/cute moments that are fit very well and to jump from these dark topics like suicide and depression to these happy/cute/heartwarming topics/moments were done very well. Overall the plot of the film is more than great and grabs the attention from the very start and it's going to make you want to know what will happen or where will they end up being at the end of the film.\n\nIn my opinion, the directing is the only thing that ruined the film. To have the author of the novel that the film is based on direct the film is a huge thing because no one will be able to do it better than him, It's his story, his novel, his film. Stephen Chbosky was able to write the screenplay perfectly, the dialogues were more than great and the story was being told well. But, in my opinion, he failed as a director. There were some scenes that were unforgettable like the famous tunnel scene and the cinematography was able to capture the skyline of Ptssburing in a great way. But, sometimes I felt like it was too dark and I was having trouble seeing the facial expressions of the actors/actresses like it was filmed by a very old camera, the film was released in 2012 but I felt like it was released in 2001 because of the very bad camera quilty. \n\nThe music choices were more than perfect and did fit every single scene that they were in perfectly, especially \"the tunnel song\" that will make you cry. \n\nTo sum up, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is \"NOT JUST A HIGH-SCHOOL FILM\" but it's way more than that. It has a story that is told very well from start to end. I \"highly recommend\" this film and promise me it will become one of your favs.\n\nMy rating is: 8/10",

It's about a boy named Charlie dealing with his depression in the only way he knows how. He's shy so he's always watching from the side lines. Until he meets two people that change his life, Sam (Emma Watson) and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) help Charlie discover the joys of friendship, first love, music and more, while a teacher sparks Charlie's dreams of becoming a writer. However, as his new friends prepare to leave for college, Charlie's inner sadness threatens to shatter his newfound confidence. Charlie was sexually abused by his Aunt, who later committed suicide. He was in an awful place, and high school being his worst enemy didn't help. He was afraid people would find out he was hospitalized the summer before high school started. He was a true wallflower. Until his friends changed his life. The story is confusing. I had no idea he was molested by the words he said. I knew his Aunt killed herself, but not why. So I would say that this is guided for older viewers. Especially since it deals with Suicide, Sexual abuse, and Depression. There are a lot of wide shots, trying to show us Charlie's world from his view. The movie definitely had an amazing screenplay. They wanted to shed light on these issues, which 100% could happen. There are some moments that I didn't see the purpose of(her sister's relationship issues, especially since his sister was sort of a side character). The movie was all over the place, kind of like a depressed mind. Whoever wrote the screenplay definitely had some knowledge of this particular mental illness. I thought it was cool how they used a lot of low camera levels, trying to make things look bigger. I would definitely give the camera shots a 10/10 purely because we experience it as Charlie. The editing deserves an 10/10 as well because of the way they made his injuries look after the fight in the cafeteria. They could improve on the scatteredness, but I imagine that was designed.",

            "content": "People wouldn’t think it to look at me, but I’m a pretty easy mark when it comes to tearing up at the movies. With just a little investment in the story, a genuinely sad or extremely happy moment can have me reaching for a tissue to dab my eyes. In fact, I often consider this a good sign for a movie, and will rate/rank the movie higher because I was emotionally impacted by it. As I’ve gotten older, my resistance to these moments has increased somewhat (possibly because I’ve become more jaded, or desensitized to them.) But when a movie gets a few well-earned tears, I find it cathartic and pleasurable, which I hope doesn’t make me sound odd. I say all of that in order to set the stage and context for my review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, because this film had me crying more than I have in a long time. I’m not talking a single tear running down my face, either. I was sobbing to the point that I had to pause the movie for a moment. There’s a strong chance that The Perks of Being a Wallflower was the most relatable coming-of-age film I’ve ever seen. To be clear, I don’t say that because I experienced the same kind of trauma that the characters in this film endure. But I’ve been the outsider, the onlooker, and the one who needs a friendly person to reach out in order to feel like I belong somewhere. I’ve lived my life in the same introverted bubble that Charlie has been trapped in, and I know how suffocating it can be. I also know what it is to love a person despite the fact that they remain unavailable, and never finding a way to express those feelings. While there are extreme elements to the story that make this more cinematic than my life would be, I think there are universal truths (that can touch so many people) contained within this story. Whether you see yourself as a Charlie, a Sam, a Patrick, a Brad, or whoever else, this movie is chock-full of relatable characters. It certainly helps The Perks of Being a Wallflower that the cast is basically perfect. Logan Lerman does some remarkable work as the main protagonist, Charlie. There’s an authenticity to his performance that is hard to beat, and he does it in a role that could easily be cold or off-putting from a lesser actor. Emma Watson proves that she has grown into a great actress, and has a top-notch American accent. She brings so much more than a pretty face when Sam that could have been a manic pixie dream girl in a lesser film. Ezra Miller is nuanced as Patrick, a role that could easily be over-the-top and a parody of a gay teen. His performance feels like people I actually know who have struggled with being gay in a society that fails too fully accept them. It seems everyone in the cast gets a moment to shine, and if I were interested in writing a full thesis on this film then perhaps I would take the time to wander further down the cast list, but let’s just say I appreciated everyone. It’s kind of astounding that a studio believed in the author of the original novel so much that they allowed him to direct the film adaptation. Even more astounding is the fact that it worked this well. It’s clear that Stephen Chbosky took the time to recreate his story exactly as he envisioned it when writing it down. Watching this film helps me to understand why it was a best-selling novel, because it feels like a story that you are witnessing firsthand, as if you are part of this circle of friends or are inside Charlie’s mind struggling along with him. As you can tell by the extensive amount of praise I have lavished on The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I loved it. It is on a short list of films that I wanted to watch again mere minutes after I was done (and I would have if I had the time that day.) I’m sure others disagree, and some critics probably label it as derivative, manipulative, or even trite. Frankly, I don’t care what anyone else thinks, it’s a film that affected me in a powerful way, and will quickly become one of my all-time favorites.",

This is a teenage coming-of-age film, with a perspective of depression and anxiety and how it affects someone. This story follows the life of an introvert boy, Charlie, struggling to make it through his first year of high school, but with the help of some senior friends, he is able to feel encluded and loved. But when his friends go off to college, he finds life difficult again.  \nHonestly, I didn't really know what the film was going to be about so when I first watched it, I was preparing for anything. I believe that the movie seemed very natural and as if it were real. I feel the actors were correctly cast and the roles fitted perfectly. The actors portrayed the characters in a realistic way, especially Logan Lerman as Charlie. I enjoyed it very much and there were quite a few moments where I got teary eyes. I feel the more sad and dark parts were some of the best parts because it really built up the story and made it more powerful. I really enjoyed this film and I believe it is best suited for a young adult/teenage audience because they could most relate to the film, but really, anyone should watch it.",

It may have been about suicide, child abuse and the difficulties of being gay, but none of these were given any serious coverage... with 12 minutes to go the child abuse aspect was expanded upon as an afterthought, mostly via voice over, the suicide was never actually discussed, and being gay involved either campy fun or getting beaten up, but nothing particularly distressing. They were all very boring with nice houses and nice cars and got into good colleges. What ruined it for me was the music, which was one jarring inconsistency after another... no-one who was into the Smith's (mid to late 80's) would have thought that Come on Eileen (top ten hit from early 80's) was \"good music\", rocked out to Cracker (MOR rock from early nineties), but not recognised Heroes, especially as they were supposedly kids with a favourite record shop who spent there time making mix tapes.",

For what seems like astronomical probability, he fails up into a group of seniors, as a freshman, and seems to be make legitimate friends as well as the attraction of multiple seniors.\n\nI'm not saying this is impossible, but it plays with the suspense of disbelief for a movie set in such a realistic world.  Once you get past that, there is a lot of fun in it, and because its a multi-threading of something like 6 difference people, there the focus shifts up quite a bit and the story stays fresh.\n\nI think there is a lot of message in this one, and it is quite enjoyable, but it's not one that you're going to watch over and over.",

Though happened in a similar atmosphere as many other high school movies, the psychology background and story line was laid out very naturally. It triggers my deep resonance with the protagonist. The twists in the end, more like climax, are quite grasping but presented in a natural and not so surprising way. This makes the whole story coherent without falling flat. I like it a lot, in terms of story, lines, and music.\n\nWhat I feel strongly after watching it is how our secondary education suppresses introverts. In fact this issue seems to exist at all levels, even in college. These wallflowers are usually intellectual talented kids who knows to think critically, and they are punished for not following the popular trends in schools, just like Charlie in this movie. Of course they may not have suffered sexual abuse as the main character here, but they may still develop serious mental problems from how other students treated them in high schools. More importantly, the culture of chasing popularity in schools is actually hurting the personal and intellectual development of kids. They become used to only pursuing the popular things, caring less about other people. In this movie, how many of the students even try to understand their classmates sitting next to them, other than partying and drinking? It also hurts our society by making it more divided, because we started to lose the ability to tolerant and understand different views even in high schools.\n\nWe should all work hard towards the day when a smart introvert like Charlie won't have to feel so lonely in high schools.",

Maybe there are \"perks\" to being a \"wallflower\" if you're a rich supermodel, but in reality it's a hard life with a lot of mental anguish. I just can't believe this kind of drivel in movies, because people are far more cruel in real life- the actual misfits and outcasts of this world don't wind up with the beautiful girl, they aren't invited to parties, they aren't treated with basic respect, and they sure as h3ll won't ever be cast in movies.

To take that source material to the big screen whilst upholding the cinematic quality expected in such a film is something even seasoned and experienced directors struggle with.\n \nThis film is simply a perfect capture of real-life struggles. It very much has you 'feeling all the feels' and really is a beautifully told YA Story. An excellent job by all involved.",

            "content": "Perks Of a Wallflower stars Logan Lerman as Charlie,  Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick. Based on the best selling novel by Stephen Chbosky, Perks of being a wallflower is about growing up, friends, love and loss. The coming of age story revolves around Charlie, a 15 year old boy struggling to find his place in life and high school until he meets Sam and Patrick befriend him and changes his life. \n\nFirstly, I want to talk about the themes shown in this film. Some were brilliant some were rushed especially towards the end of the film but for the most part they played out well. These themes included things like loneliness, heartbreak, friendships. During the start of the film the way they portrayed Charlie's loneliness worked very well and Logan made it a very real it felt somewhat relatable and you wanted to symphyse with him. We could also see depth into the characters that weren't quite there at first. For instance Sam had a troubled history and we can see how damaged she actually is inside and the way she acts come from. Although I liked those themes there were some that were terribly rushed, especially Charlie's mental breakdown I believe that could have been a great opportunity to dive into mental health but they missed it. I believe they should have focused on that more than his loneliness mainly because a lot of teen dramas focus on things like loneliness and it's getting quite repetitive. \n\nA part of the film I did love was the music. They hard some great music that complemented the film well for instants during the tunnel scene with Heroes by David Bowie or Come on Eileen. Music was also a big part of the film, they had old mixtapes, vinyls, talks about bands, good music vs bad. It was refreshing in a relatively new film having a soundtrack that was mostly based songs from the last few years. A big part of this film is that it seems very real and you weren't watching a film it seemed like you were there with them. The dialogue was great this way and could capture you instantly. The only part of the dialogue that didn't sit well for me was Sam's accent slipping from American to English at several points of the film. The best thing about this film is that it's not just a teenage film targeted to teenagers it's a film that can target anyone in some way.  For the adults I feel like they can look back on the film to get some nostalgia from the music and the new discoveries Charlie goes on. \n\nOverall it was a very good heartfelt film, that can relate in some way to everyone. I would highly recommend it. The story is good the subplots are great and the surprises were shocking. Really enjoyed it.",

            "content": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a brilliant portrayal of teenage life through all the love, friendship and tears that it holds. This film plucks on the heart strings perfectly to keep the audience engaged and feeling what the characters in the movie are actually feeling. The movie is brilliantly directed by Stephen Chbosky who also wrote the book relating to the movie. From my experience of reading the book it was a mesmerizing read and I didn't want to put the book down but the movie was even better. This movie takes on twists and turns and emotional journeys you didn't think you would be experiencing going into this movie. The actors did an amazing job as well adapting Chbosky's writing to the big screen. Logan Lerman as Charlie was a perfect casting he was wonderful in the lead role and played the role of the socially awkward outcast that just wants to fit in and have friends to perfection. The character of Sam played by Emma Watson was very likable character because of the work Emma Watson put it to acting this role she was magnificent as well. Even though Paul Rudd only had a small role in this movie he stole the show when he was on screen his character was inspiring and you could really feel the connection between them as him being a role model of a teacher. But if I had one oscar to give out for this movie it would easily hands down go to Ezra Miller for his portrayal of Patrick. Every time he was in a scene he stole the show whether it was a witty joke or an emotional moving scene he did it all. His jokes were all hilarious and he had a few tear jerking moments that could easily deny the audience of holding back their tears, excellent performance his best of his career for sure. The themes in his movie are so touching and believable that it makes the movie feel real. There are some important messages being shown for teenage or mature audiences. To summarize this movie is an excellent, captivating way of showing the ups and downs of life in high school with themes that could touch a wide variety of age groups and performances that really make you believe the story and events and tugs on the heart strings. This movie is worth re-watching over and over again because every time it's like you don't know what to expect because even knowing what's coming it can still captivate you and play with your emotions.",

With coming of age films, the character development has to be there and with this film it does that right in every way. The directing and editing in certain scenes can be so meticulously crafted and convey the story in such a way that's genius. It's difficult not to be moved by each performance especially with Logan's who does a phenomenal job. But the themes that this movie addresses about alienation, love, friendship, expressing ones feelings, trauma, acceptance, and much more, all these themes are well expressed and realized.

In this movie it talks about Charlie's ups and downs in life struggling after the death of his Aunt Helen and the suicide of his best friend from middle school, Michael. Charlie struggles all through the rest of his middle school days, and the start of his freshman years in high school. He starts to grow a bond with his new friends, Sam and patrick, and he seems to slowly gets better. But near the end, his past slowly starts to catch up to him. And he'll have to face it as it slowly crawls back to him.\n\tThe main characters in this film are Charlie, Sam, Patrick, Charlie's sister, and Mary Elizabeth. I like these actors a lot, because they show so much emotion that is expressed in the original novel. They really play out their character well.\n\tMy favorite part of this film was the part where Sam and Patrick went to go see Charlie and they feel so free and so happy together going through the tunnel for the second time after discovering the original song they had. This just shows so much of their friendship together and their happiness just spreads onto the viewer.\n\tI like the book more than the movie, because the book gave so much more details about Charlie's life and the same things that really put the book together. The movie just put together only the main parts and the small parts that may be funny, interesting, or significant to the storyline.\nIf I were to rate this movie I would give this 4 out of 5 stars, because it could have included more info on the novel and it would have brought the whole book together. The more details, it would have then made it easier to follow and fully understand all the little details in the movie.",

            "content": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a revealing drama which alludes to the memories of adolescence where it is shown this transition from childhood to the next stage. The story is based on the novel by the writer and director Stephen Chbosky. The narration can be seen very close and can easily move their target audience, however, everything seems too generic.\n\nThis adaptation of Chbosky repeatedly falls into the use of mainstream sentimentality that works so much in so many feature films. The unlimited clichés with which the film conforms give life to Charlie (Logan Lerman) who recently enters high school and who now faces different difficulties with himself when trying to fit in his new surroundings. Charlie is the typical misunderstood boy who is unable to relate with people: he is intelligent but socially incompetent, he is not even able to participate in classes to make his opinions known. He is a nerd who likes \"old\" music and spends his time inadvertently counting every day until finally he can leave high school. Hence, this character is the classic boy of which they mock and of which they abuse of because of his intelligence, but that at the same time is destined that one day everything will luckily change for good.\n\nIn short, and as the title implies, this wallflower will change from being nobody to a beautiful flower. The young actor, characterized by an innocent profile, full of ingenuity and with a deep fear to be able to express himself and to transmit his triumphs, manages to become friend of an extravagant rebel (Ezra Miller) and its half sister (Emma Watson). The first is the typical gay character, friendly, social and smiling who never shuts up on what he thinks, and Watson is the pretty girl with academic problems who guess whom will fall in love with her...\n\nWith a correct use of cinematographic qualities, the rhythm of the film is good and even engaging. The experience of the director is notorious with this work and the reality is that, although the story is bad, manages to carry with precision and details what he wanted to complete through this project. Together, these friends face a series of challenges, typical of their age, addressing their low complexity moral desires and conflicts, but come on, they're just a few young guys. Anguished, but with a lot of hope and desire to get ahead, the film reveals the reasons why Charlie is as he is, bringing to light the problems he had in relation to his childhood. Since everything seems an obsessive attempt to convince the audience with the transmitted material, the tale seems to be bent on erasing any sense of originality, since each element complies within a checklist that today's cinema insists on including: a gay athlete who does not rebuke his secret, a friendly English teacher, failed relationships, severe parents, suicide attempts, drugs, parties with the usual format, emotional problems, abuse, and the question of 'what am I going to do in my life?' You will surely feel the power of this film of Chbosky, living the drama with tears, some laughs and many smiles, which come from a highly personal and semi-autobiographical project, but this set of elements are not enough to raise the sense of a film which begins with the content of always and whose conclusion is so repeated that I would even like to erase my memory to enjoy many movies like this one here. You will say you have seen this movie before and many, many times. 55/100",

            "content": "There are many ways to relieve pain. There are ways we know from what we see and experience -- the stories, the movies, the articles, the news, being the victim -- and there are the peaceful ways that are just as powerful: individual people who brings attention and awareness to mental illness, those are the people who changes the world. That is the kind of courageous resistance Stephen Chbosky show in Lionsgate Films 2012 film The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, rated PG-13. This film is about the story of a young teenage boy named Charlie, who has clinical depression due to childhood memories, is a movie everyone must see, so we can be inspired and strengthen the awareness for mental illness.\nEver since Charlie was little, his aunt has always been his favorite person until she passed away. He has never been mentally stable since but he tries to adapt the normal lifestyle of being a young high school student. Charlie is uneasy about beginning his freshman year because he has difficulty making friends and he's very shy. The only person he connected to at school was his english teacher, Mr. Anderson because he makes Charlie feel like he belongs in the school when Charlie feels like he doesn't belong anywhere. He meets two seniors, Sam and her step brother Patrick at a football game, they invite him to go out to eat and go to parties and such. At a party, Charlie eats a pot brownie and tells Sam about how his only friend committed suicide. On the way home, Patrick drives Sam and Charlie to a tunnel. They put on a song they've never heard of and Sam decides to go to the back of the pickup to enjoy the moment. That is when Charlie begins to fall for her. After realizing that Charlie is falling in love with Sam, he tries to find ways to show her that he cares about her and her happiness. At Christmas, Charlie reveals that he have never been kissed before. Although Sam is with someone else, she kisses him and tells him that she loves him. When Marie-Elizabeth asked Charlie to the Sadies dance, he tries not to hurt her feelings so he goes with her. That's when Marie-Elizabeth started falling for Charlie and somehow they began to date but keep in mind that Charlie is only dating her because he doesn't want to hurt her feelings but he gets more irritated with her as the relationship goes. At a party, Patrick asked Charlie to kiss the most beautiful person in the room and he kisses Sam unintentionally, hurting Marie-Elizabeth's feelings. Patrick recommends Charlie to stay away from them for awhile but Charlie starts having flashbacks of his aunt's death when he was seven years old. When Sam and Patrick goes away for college, Charlie experiences a flashback of his aunt's death and something else about his aunt that he wasn't sure about. He calls his sister and his sister realizes that he needs help so she calls for help. Charlie passes out and wakes up in a hospital. He then reveals to his doctor that his aunt has sexually abused him when he was little and that's what he has been scared of saying out loud for the longest time.\nFrankly, I thought that this film is incredibly amazing. Chbosky really brought attention and awareness to mental health and why this issue is really important. Anything and anyone can really make you feel like you're trapped inside sometimes it's even yourself making you feel this way. I agree that people who supports others going through this, helps a lot. Everyone always needs someone to talk to and to make sure that they're okay. This movie has inspired me to bring more awareness to mental illness and help individuals who are going through this. Some people might not understand why mental health is as important as any other illnesses and this movie has many very important parts about mental illness since you get to see Charlie's point of view. Finally, I have to admit, this film is one of the best films I have ever seen. For example, one stereotype would be: she's only depressed so she could get attention. No, mental illness is a serious issue and no one should say anything like that because no one knows what she's going through. I recommend everyone to watch this movie. Not only will it raise awareness but it will put the audience in Charlie's shoes to show what he's going through and how much pain he has trying to fix himself.  \n\n-- Hera Tran",

The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, starring Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and Nina Dobrev, captures the highs and lows of growing up. Charlie, a socially awkward teen in high school, has never really had any friends. When two older classmates take him under their wing his whole life changes. He takes part in his first party, first kiss, and first girlfriend, all while experiencing the trials of growing up and moving on. The movie hides nothing and bears all, captivating the audience with first hand not-so-magical high school stories, However, the plot can be a bit heavy at times. While the director tried to keep the movie as true to the book as possible, there is an obvious separation from the original story. Overall, I would give this movie four out of 5 stars, a must-see for those who enjoy inspirational coming of age stories.",
