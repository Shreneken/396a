    "summary": "When James Bond's (Daniel Craig) latest assignment goes terribly wrong, it leads to a calamitous turn of events: Undercover agents around the world are exposed, and MI6 is attacked, forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. With MI6 now compromised inside and out, M turns to the one man she can trust: Bond. Aided only by a field agent (Naomie Harris), Bond takes to the shadows and follows a trail to Silva (Javier Bardem), a man from M's past who wants to settle an old score.",

It's author, Ian Fleming, was a kind of upper class alcoholic who hit upon a \"commercial fiction\" formula that foregrounds false privilege, escapism and of course violence and misogyny disguised as adventure. Similar to other pulp hits of the hardboiled crime genre, plot logic means more than plot, somehow - as beneath the formalities of the Bond tropes and story goal there isn't exactly a lot of heart.\n\nThis iteration of the (same old) espionage/ticking time bomb structure has some great stunts and is more socially progressive, but the story - focused on Bond's efforts to thwart a creepy villain is mostly quality production skills. Giving people a story that actually matters in anathema to the franchise's well worn code.",

            "content": "MI6 is under attack in Daniel Craig's best Bond film by far!\n\nDirector Sam Mendes' espionage thriller Skyfall (2012) delivers upon Craig's 007 promise of a serious spy with enthralling romance and the fascinating intrigue of spy versus spy action. Mendes' direction is not only gorgeous, but also gripping between massive action set pieces, exciting chase sequences, deadly shootouts, and shocking conversations. Skyfall's two train sequences are brilliant, bomb threats shocking, and shootouts are fierce. I adore Mendes' choice to stage Skyfall's final confrontation in Scotland between Silva and 007 at James Bond's childhood estate Skyfall and their local chapel ruins. It feels intimate and suspenseful.\n\nMendes takes time for Bond to learn from his stern talks with M, cheeky rapport with Moneypenny, romance with Severine, wise meeting with Q, encounters with his foe Silva, and reuniting with Kincade again from his childhood. Mendes' patient drama, complex spy narrative, intricate action choreography, and sleek style is refined with a piercing elegance for Skyfall. Mendes was the perfect director for Daniel Craig's modern James Bond to finally give him a classic. Skyfall is inarguably Daniel Craig's greatest James Bond picture.\n\nWriter John Logan's story for Skyfall's cunning antagonist Silva is phenomenal as he combines The World Is Not Enough like villain wanting revenge on M, the bad guy turning himself in from Se7en, the glass prison interrogation and escape from The Silence of the Lambs, Home Alone's house trap defense, The Dark Knight's Joker speech in the station as well as the police assassin disguise. Logan brings a unique tale of spy revenge and consequences of M's past choices in MI6 to Skyfall. I like the lone gadget of a distress signal, a Walther PPK, and a new Q finally! Seeing Bond's childhome of Skyfall is wonderful and a sweet tribute to Ian Fleming's stories. I'd expect nothing less from John Logan for Skyfall, who wrote Gladiator, The Last Samurai, The Aviator, Rango, and Hugo's scripts.\n\nHaving Bond's family home Skyfall be the namesake of the film is cool and a neat reveal. I like having an aging Bond, recovering from near lethal injuries, emotionally shaken, trigger fingers shaking, and bloodthirsty for his shadowy new enemy striking out from darkness. A worn down Bond facing off against a fearsome spy opponent is the classic espionage story from the Cold War era Bond pictures. Screenplay writers Robert Wade and Neal Purvis also return to write more one liners for Craig and help keep the consistency of Craig's Bond run with neat spy twists, MI6's operating procedures, and Bond's personal journey. Skyfall is something special.\n\nEditor Stuart Baird has a thankfully coherent cutting style compared to the breakneck cutting pace of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace that was so annoying to me. I love how eased back the editing pace is that keeps Skyfall moving along steadily for 143 minutes. He cuts only when necessary during Bond's close quarters combat, so you can see all the punches and kicks for once. I like how we're allowed to see every shot, movement, and perspective as Bond fires, runs, and gazes at his target.\n\nCinematographer Roger Deakins continues to provide a stellar moody atmosphere with his precise framing, creative use of shadowplay and silhouettes, and brightly lit illumination surrounded by shadowy darkness. Deakins always brings stunning visuals to every film he shoots and Skyfall is no exception. His wide shots of Macau are so pretty. I love Deakins' still shot framed beyond Bond for Silva's introduction that slowly zooms in as Javier walks towards 007 during his big monologue. The striking framing for Bond shooting at Severine during Silva's cruel taunt at Bond's marksmanship test is something else. The way he holds onto close-ups is suspenseful like when Silva reveals his teeth. Skyfall looks extraordinary!\n\nDaniel Craig is captivating as James Bond in Skyfall. Craig is finally fun as an older 007 out of sorts. His anger at dead agents and a lady victim feels righteously indignant with a calm presence. His composure as Bond is cool as he nails fight after fight and delivers as a James Bond to remember. Skyfall is why people really love Craig's Bond that proves he can lurk in the shadows and charm in daylight. Craig's dramatic performance is riveting as James Bond.\n\nJudi Dench gives a fantastic and memorable performance as a stern, scolding, and stunned MI6 head M, who is shocked by her past. Her care for Bond is nice and foolish stubbornness fits Dench's portrayal of M for all these years. I appreciate how Skyfall is also about coming to terms with M's shallow MI6 approach that's like \"the end justifies the means\" motto in regards to M sacrificing secret agents for Queen and country. She's touching in her chapel farewell to Bond. Ralph Fiennes is great and funny as chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee Gareth Mallory, who becomes the new M. He gets neat jabs to provoke and scold M for her failings. Naomie Harris is charming as MI6 field agent Miss Eve Moneypenny with her poor sniper rifle marksmanship and pleasant teasing of Bond.\n\nJavier Bardem is transcendent as one of James Bond's fiercest enemies named Raoul Silva. Having a 007 villain be an ex-MI6 agent, seeking vengeance against M for his unimaginable torture and cyanide pill experience. Bardem delivers a delightfully playful performance in his homoerotic introductory monologue, twisted taunting speech as he murders Severine, threatening imprisoned monologue to M, and his vicious finale attack on Bond and M at Skyfall. Bardem is clearly having a blast portraying another iconic villain from him. He's hilarious and frightening as Silva the psychopath. Silva is certainly one of 007's most memorable espionage foe.\n\nFrench and Chinese actress B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe is drop dead gorgeous as Bond girl S\u00e9v\u00e9rine. Her backless black dress is jaw-dropping on her, but it's her hurt and worried eyes that portray S\u00e9v\u00e9rine's trauma. Albert Finney is hysterical and lovable as Scottish caretaker Kincade. His blunt quips and earnest Scottish comments are a pleasure to witness on the silver screen. Ben Whishaw is funny and likable as MI6 quartermaster Q. Now a hacker to be useful to Bond rather than a gadget maker. Rory Kinnear is fun as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. Ola Rapace cameos as Silva's mercenary Patrice. Helen McCrory cameos as MP Clair Dowar with her fun dressing down of M's failure of leadership at MI6.\n\nProduction designer Dennis Gassner creates a Macau casino, underground MI6 headquarters, and Scottish manor estate for Bond's childhood home. I love Anna Pinnock and Harley Wilkinson's sparse set decoration for Skyfall itself and the lavish adornments for the Macau casino. The visual effects for the neon lights, massive explosions, and gunshots all look incredibly realistic and stylish. Costume designers Jany Temime and Funda Buyuktunalioglu give Craig a stylish black suit, Bardem a slick tan suit and black sweater jacket combo, and Fiennes a sleek blue three piece suit. I found Marlohe's see-through black dress mesmerizing.\n\nComposer Thomas Newman crafts a suspenseful symphonic score for Skyfall. His haunting melodies slowly creep into the sonic palette with exhilarating rhythms for the action and eerie music for all the drama. I adore British singer Adele's James Bond theme song \"Skyfall.\" Her already iconic baroque pop song is magnificent. The rising crescendo of orchestration is lush and cradles Adele's massive vocals with her soaring melodies. Skyfall may be Adele's best song. Skyfall's sound designs mix all the music and noises with a loud and balanced mix. I appreciate being able to hear all the dialogue clearly, even Silva's whispery taunts. The make-up department did stunning work for Marlohe's carefully wavy hair and dark black eyeshadow.\n\nIn all, Skyfall is entertaining, but made with real love and care that continues to astound me every time I revisit Skyfall.",

It's a tough call. \n\n The Craig bond movies blend in together so much they feel rather interchangeable.   \n\nThe producers have  turned Bond films into standard generic action movies mixed with generic super hero angst and origin/back stories.  It's a terrible direction.  \n\nI just didn't care about Bond's origin story.  Never once wondered what it was.  It's like explaining the Force in Star Wars.  Some things are better left unexplained unless less you have a hard time sleeping and/or are a masochist.   You're supposed to leave those things to the imagination.  \n\nThe old formula worked.  The movies were one-offs with only light references to past movies.  They had style, zany  villains instead of horror movie villains, beautiful women,  interesting and unique side characters, and locales ...they had humor, along with the dashing Bond and a simple plot that built up  sometimes with some interesting twists...they had personality.   \n\nSomewhere along the line after Moore left, the movies started slowly becoming more and more just standard action flicks.  And they sucked away any and all personality from the Bond experience.  They  got away from what made Bond Bond.  \n\nNow we get dark, brooding, angst-ridden monologues instead of fun, cool, interesting, dashing, light, exciting, humorous, ... movies.  \n\nI think the key to reusing the old formula is not let the audience know you are reusing the old formula.  Don't make it so obvious.  Don't make it so it becomes a parody of itself.  Maybe that means no double entendres.  \n\nBut I know it doesn't  mean introduce dark, brooding, angst-ridden yawn-inducing personality-less monologues.  \n\nsorry I am light on why I hated Skyfall.

            "content": "What a great way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the James Bond saga with Skyfall! As Quantum was focused on the Bond character coming to terms with events at Casino Royale and consolidating him, Skyfall still focuses on Bond and keeps developing the character. It's the first time we see a human 007 who is trying to come back to who he was: an efficient, cold killing instrument. But his body and mind are not responding, as he is not sharp and has lost a step.\n\nI think the plot is brilliant, bringing modern thematics to the saga, such as hacking and information warfare. The villain has complex layers of motivation, you get to understand what drives this damaged but efficient psychopath.\n\nRight until the attack on the committee hearing, the pacing was exciting and the execution just right. I loved the new direction and editing as they excel in everything Quantum did wrong with shaky cams and half a second cuts, cheap tricks to make the action feel authentic, but you can't tell what is going on. In Skyfall, they went all-in with long action sequences without a single camera cut, perfectly achieved. Daniel Craig is the best Bond for me, and Skyfall was his best performance, at least in the action play.\n\nThe ending just kills the movie for me. That's why I gave it an 8 instead of 10. The mansion setup is just slow and dumb, and the villain cannot accomplish so much and play such a dumbass role at the end. The goons at the end drop like flies at the hands of two old-timers who have never seen combat. If you have an attack chopper, why not level the whole place before sending the only strike team available? The mansion is a sniper paradise as there is not a single tree in miles, you can see an enemy assault coming from every direction. Even though the defenders were armed with old shotguns, the strike team goons approach the target in the open like sitting ducks, they didn't know what the defender's capabilities were, and they walk up there like amateurs. After completing so much and getting MI6 on their knees, I can't see them perform such a dumb role at the end. It just kills the experience. It is like they were trying to get us to sleep with that slow pacing.\n\nI loved the movie, just wish they skipped the last part, so I could give it the 10 this masterpiece deserves.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI have a fondness for James Bond and for most of the movies. My favourite Bond is Sean Connery and my personal favourite Bond film is Goldfinger. To cut to the chase I do like Daniel Craig as Bond, he is very charismatic and has truly magnetic eyes. Skyfall for me is his best outing, I liked Casino Royale and didn't care at all for Quantum of Solace, and one of the best of the series. Craig himself is spot on, both of the qualities I mentioned are here, and he brings to the role charm and sophistication yet ruthlessness and grit, paying homage to all the Bonds before him. Craig is not the only actor in the cast who impresses. Albert Finney is always watchable and here is no exception, and Naomie Harris is very alluring. It was nice to see Ralph Fiennes too, who I've always liked and in recent years I have wished that there were roles that played to his strengths rather than waste them and thankfully his performance displays the former.\n\nEven better are Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Dench is outstanding as M, who is more complex than she is before, then again I wasn't surprised as she has always set a high standard in everything she's been in. Silva I don't think is quite in the same league as Goldfinger, Blofeld, Rosa Klebb and Jaws, but more than holds his own, as he is ruthless and always has a plan. Almost reminiscent of a lecherous and somewhat campy Hannibal Lector, Bardem has all the best lines and brings a sinister edge to his performance. I have always had a fondness for the Bond girls especially Pussy Galore, Solitaire, Vesper Lynde and Elektra King. Severine is a worthy Bond girl, enigmatic and the very meaning of glamorous.\n\nSkyfall is the epitome of class in every other way as well. The cinematography is very polished, while the scenery is breathtaking. Anybody expecting action scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat, you will not be disappointed, as the pre-credits sequence in the Grand Baszar(Istanbul) is truly thrilling. Fans will also love the inclusion of the original Astin Martin DB5. Like with Craig's performance, it was another successful homage to the previous Bond movies. Sam Mendes as director was a risk, his directing could either have been great or awful. But it was a risk that paid off, as Mendes keeps everything perfectly, having a style that plays to his forte while incorporating the classic Bond elements to great effect.\n\nHe is helped further by a hugely compelling story, the action is beautifully judged but what was also special was how human the drama felt. Even the Brosnan films or the previous two Craig outings didn't have the complex relationship between Bond and M, that is done to intense and moving measures. The ending was a complete surprise, in a shocking and heart-rending way. The theme song was also wonderful, maybe not quite classic status like the those of Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Diamonds are Forever and On Her Majesty's Secret Service but infinitely better than those of Die Another Day, Quantum of Solace and Octopussy. Singer Adele sings meaningfully, and it is on the whole very emotionally charged, which I loved.\n\nThe score is also excellent, John Barry it isn't, then again I wasn't expecting it to be at that standard. It succeeds on bringing the right amount of thrills, pathos and jauntiness. And to top it off, the script is very intelligently and wittily written, Bardem has the best of them but everybody has lines to care about without coming across as questionable. Overall, a triumphant Bond outing in every way, after Quantum of Solace I was dubious but after a film this good I have no need to worry now. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "(September 4th, 2022) Well, I think I paid for all my sins with this movie now. I won't deny that \"Skyfall\" was complicated to watch and required the spectator's full attention, but the final prize is worthful, the second best James Bond film of all time, only behind \"Casino Royale\". In my \"GoldenEye\" review, I said that Alec Trevelyan (006) was the spiritual predecessor of Mr Silva, Javier Bardem's character here, and I was completely right, but Silva takes a step forward. He's an absurdly intelligent psychopath, and I maintain what I previously said, he remembers Riddle (Paul Dano) from \"The Batman\". And now, the podium of 007 villains is officialized: P1 for Le Chiffre, P2 for Silva and P3 for Goldfinger. Something I loved in \"Casino Royale\" and also happens here is the deconstruction of the classic James Bond elements; in that film, Bond was entirely rebooted, and the \"shaken, not stirred\" was introduced in a very different manner, the agent at that moment doesn't really care about his drink; now, the two remaining characters of the classic MI6 who weren't introduced in Daniel Craig's era are properly presented: Ms Moneypenny (Naomi Harris), who gained a past, more personality, but she's still Bond's \"impossible love\", and Q (Ben Whishaw), who despite being at least 40 years younger, respect all traces of the legendary Desmond Llewelyn, but without imitating him (there is still a little tribute to the past era, as Q refers to a gadget that Bond used in \"GoldenEye\"). Ralph Fiennes is also introduced here, and M says all, he's a bureaucrat. M, by the way, is the character who receives more attention in the script alongside, of course, James Bond. She, even more than the agent, is the soul of this production, and it solidifies Judi Dench as the best M of all time (sorry, Bernard Lee). And Daniel Craig still gives a show as a vulnerable but compromised with the service James Bond. Film after film, even with the disastrous \"Quantum of Solace\", he's consolidating himself as my favourite 007. Oh, and S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Mahone) is a nice Bond girl. Yes, she is discardable, like Agent Fields (\"Quantum of Solace\") and Paris Carver (\"Tomorrow Never Dies\"), but the difference here is that the screenplay knows that and uses this as a joke, her death wasn't in vain like these two previously mentioned. \"Skyfall\" is another perfect entry in the James Bond saga, and Adele's song gives me chills.",

Judi Dench thank you for showing us your talents, we all love M.\n\nWhen talking about cinematography and camera work it's where i really loose it. Roger Deakins is a master at what he does and is probably the best cinematographer alive. He fucking rules. Every single shot was incredibly well put togheter. The colors, the mirrors, the reflections, the big explosions, the faces, the shadows, everything had so much care and so much work behind it. Deakins is the real MVP.\n\n\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d is my favorite Bond movie. It has the best score, the best cinematography, the best writting, the best direction and the best Daniel Craig performance.",

All the The Dark Knight stuff are great. I am a huge Batman fan and absolutely hate Joker especially his oversaturation in the DC universe, but in this he actually works as the main villain. The score, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. Deakins did unnecessarily use yellow more than need, but fantastic otherwise. It's when the film turns into Home Alone that I have trouble suspending my disbelief. Silva exposed all double-0 agents, but 007 because he was presumed dead, But MI6 have only 9 field agents? Where are the single-0s? If there were ever a time bond would NEED to work with someone else it would at the Skyfall property. Some snipers in the off distance trees, some in the house, another in the DB5 (that unfortunately was destroyed... again. I hate when movies think it's ok to destroy timeless cars). Some other times in other Bond movies I think \"maybe this would have been better with another double-0 by his side, perhaps not\". In this one I'm thinking \"bring in the cavalry\". Yes, I get it, they can't trust anyone especially how M's bodyguard of 15 years tried to kill her in Quantum of Solace, but then why trust Bond? He was presumed dead for how long, not know how much he's changed or feels betrayed still about her practically shooting him and doesn't know how much Silva's word affected him AND even acknowledges how little she knows if Bond is being influenced by Silva by abruptly feeling the need to stop and explain her actions involving Silva. \n\nI am also not really a fan of the film constantly asking the audience if the franchise is relevant, particularly M's scenes in the courts. Every single EON productions James Bond film, all 25 of them, have made money, even with new actors in the protagonist role where customers are not used to the new shoes yet, those sometimes make even more than the last one of the previous actor. Skyfall itself grossed over a billion dollars in 2012. So to answer the redundant question, yes, it's relevant. \n\nThere also are some weird plot holes involving Silva. How exactly did he know the train was going to come through the wall when it did or how did he plan to kill M years in advance when the hearing was only set up 3 days beforehand.\n\nHowever, this and Casino Royale (2006) are the only Bond films where James gets character development, so that is a plus.\n\nI'm torn. Not a fan of those to particular writing things, the Home Alone part being a bigger deal for me really, but man, even though I spent like a sentence or two on the positives, they do really boost up the overall quality. The cold open, the fight against the sniper in the skyscraper, and the subway (tube) foot chase are some of the best action set pieces in Hollywood history. The tense gripping atmosphere of the mystery behind who is is hacking in MI6 before the villain is revealed is absolutely expert filmmaking.\n\nI do really think the positives outweigh the negatives here.",

            "content": "Skyfall is an incredible movie with many astonishing aspects that make this film feel like a genuine spy thriller. Sam Mendes does a magnificent job directing this movie, as he creates this obscure yet exciting tone throughout the whole screen duration. The solid script helps support Mendes' vision with a prominent central story. Skyfall nailed down the story perfectly, as this is the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to feel like the world of a spy. Both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace struggled to capture the elements of a James Bond. However, the screenwriters perfected it here in this movie. Having the central storyline being an attack on MI6 while mixing in some of the personal elements of the characters is excellent for this franchise. Where the script falls flat was the misuse of the Bond girl. The poor treatment of S\u00e9v\u00e9rine is very noticeable throughout the film and makes Skyfall suffer significantly. It is not necessarily wrong to not have a Bond girl, but to have one and completely butcher her character arc is wrong. Skyfall is visually stunning, with the exquisite cinematography stealing the spotlight at times. Roger Deakins does an extraordinary job here as the director of photography. Many shots were remarkable and captured the worldbuilding exquisitely. The editing is also the most potent of the first three installments. There are a few scenes with slightly choppy editing, but it is not as detrimental as the first two films. The score is also very compelling as it elevates a lot of the scenes. Thomas Newman knows how and when to make the music match sonically with what is on screen. The cast of Skyfall is strong, with a lot of great performances all around. Daniel Craig is smooth and has a lot of fun quips that make this movie special. While he may be exceptional in the role, his performance in Casino Royale edges his performance here just by a bit. Javier Bardem is phenomenal in this film and had the best performance out of everyone. The emotion Bardem put into creating Silva was comprehensive, and Bardem never overacts in any of his scenes. Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are both prominent in their respective roles. They each stand out in all the sequences their characters are present in. Lastly, there is Judi Dench, who knocks it out of the park. It is Dench's most excellent performance in all the Bond films, as we really get to spend time with the character and not just see her tell people to eliminate the enemies. Dench still keeps that aspect alive in her performance, as it is an influential aspect of M's character arc. However, it never becomes too over-the-top. Skyfall is the complete embodiment of James Bond as the film holds every aspect a spy thriller needs to be a great film. The story is easy to follow yet has this slight complexity to it that still makes it shocking. The cast is perfect, with no bad actors bringing down the film. What does bring down the film is a messy subplot that looms its gloomy shadow over the film. If it were not for that terrible treatment of S\u00e9v\u00e9rine, the film would have been perfect.

I personally don't think any Bond movie should end like this and I actually regretted watching this outing.

Like the meditative wide shots of the landscapes in 2049? Oh do they have you covered in Macau. Like Adele? Covered.\n\nThis film challenges Bond in a way no other film has. He's weary, battered, and no longer as fit for superspy espionage as he was in his earlier years. But the one woman who has been a constant in his hectic life, his boss and surrogate mother figure, and the person who gave the \"take-the-shot\" order than made Bond end up in the drink, Judi Dench's M is at risk. The best bond villain to date, Javier Bardem's Anderson Silva, is not trying to take over the world. He's got a personal vendetta against the one person Bond has any real attachment to. What's more, he's a dark mirror to Bond. A former 00 and M's previous favorite, Silva was the Bond before Bond who also suffered from \"mother's\" decision to prioritize the mission over the agent. He's not only a formidable foe for Bond, but he's an effective foil.\n\nThis is also the best fusion of the modern, gritty, grounded Bond and the gadget-laden, seductive, classy elements of early Bond. It pays homage to hallmarks of the olden days (Moneypenny, Q, etc.) yet breaks new ground (we visit Bond's home, we change M's, etc.)\n\nThis is truly prestige bond. Doesn't get better.",

The chemistry between the two is wonderful almost as a mother and son relationship and Craig faces his most challenging antagonist until this point Silva played by academy award winner and spanish actor Javier Bardem. Bardem kills this performance and brings a similar aurora to that he brought to No Country for Old Men. Bardem is psychotic, mild mannered, and out for revenge in one of his most iconic roles. Lots of great action here as always but is the drama between the characters and the great relationship between M and Bond that makes this movie so incredible to watch with a climax that keeps on the edge.  With Adele singing in the intro, great direction by Mendez, a great script, and an incredible performance by Javier this movie is almost a masterpiece.",

The ground has fallen out from beneath Bond's well-cobbled feet and, despite the klaxon warnings of chicken littles like M, the firmamental sky is falling in turn: Democracy does not die in darkness but in the bright glow of light, when the shadows are made blackest. In turn, gone is the stupid pretense from the previous Craig films about a spectral new world order of shadowy strangers who secretly control the world, and instead the danger is entirely internal and cannibalistic (rather than cabalistic), little British chickens coming home to roost. Bond thus must reconcile with his (and imperialism's) past, the originary trauma which brought him into being, which means sublimating\u2014if not entirely abandoning\u2014the masculine fantasy of little boys and resolving his Oedipal complex, not by denying castration but by accepting it.",

Skyfall re-introduces some of the elements that made the original films so great, with enough restraint to keep it fresh: a sassy new Moneypenny, now an MI6-trained operative who assists Bond on his missions; a new young Q who issues Bond with significantly simplified gadgets as well as manage the IT department at MI6; and an appearance by the silver Aston Martin DB5 seen in 1964's Goldfinger. Skyfall marks the end of an era with the departure of Judy Dench's M, and it feels like the entire film storyline was built around that. As a twist on the usual \u2018now Bond blows up the villain's lair' scene, thus time it's Bond's lair that goes up in flames!

There's not a single bad performance in the bunch with Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem being the standouts, who plays an incredible villain with a personal connection to Bond and M (as well as being threatening) and that's a great thing about Skyfall. It's a more personal movie: seeing Bond's old home as well as M being more of a character and her role getting questioned is really compelling and leads to a really emotional 3rd act with M's death. It's not flawless though. The runtime is definitely too long with dragged out scenes in the first hour, there's not much action sadly and the ones we have are mostly just gun shootouts and it could've had a better mix of darkness and humor like CR and I wish we were in more locations instead of cloudy England and Scotland most of the time (no offense to any British folk) but still, a great return for this franchise (A)",

Negatives include random and gratuitous sex scenes, and a plot seeming wildly implausible yet too familiar at times, especially in the middle third. As the fiftieth century of Dr. No, the film's obvious attempt to return to basics undergoes a few hiccups but mainly delivers upon the basic thriller concept with a few classic Bond touches.",

When Bond is on the hunt, he is shrouded in shadow while his environment is coloured with a single, dominating hue, it hides even his silhouette from the camera even though we know exactly where he's standing. There is a gentle but urgent rhythm that lures you into each next scene, and keeps you going from one stunning set piece to the next, I put this movie on in the background but after the first action scene, the thrilling plotline kept me going until the third act, which is where this movie slows down considerably. Sam Mendes tries to explore Bond's past and learn a little more about his life before joining Mi6, but we're really only given little bits and pieces that don't give much new insight into his past. Skyfall is really about 007's future, and how a spy like Bond can fit into the modern world of tech and cybersecurity. What makes this movie great is that Bond struggles, he's kept out of the loop, he's constantly played and he's one step behind for so much of this film that you can't help but wonder whether he really is obsolete like the film suggests. All this makes Skyfall my favourite Bond film to date, 9/10.",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n10/6/16 \n\nSkyfall Review \nSkyfall has a brilliantly crafted script that adds plenty of colorful characters and a biography for James Bond.  The film pays honor to previous Bond films with the 50th anniversary of the James Bond franchise.  However, it does fall short with clich\u00e9s and plot holes, none of the acting disappoints. Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, and, Daniel Craig had memorable performances, even if his acting in this film isn't quite as good as it was in the Casino Royale.  The music in the picture enumerates elements that really advise you to pay attention. The music expresses excitement, energy, honor and significance.  It's a beautifully shot film that proves that cinematography isn't just about camera movement but also about how location is shot and how color is used. \nIt's not only the score of Skyfall that advises audience to pay attention, but also it's screenplay with its rich characters and uniquely structured story. Skyfall creates authentically rich characters even if it's reintroducing characters that have already been introduced before. While the Bond franchise was rebooted before with the James Bond film Casino Royale, it's being rebooted even further in Skyfall by not just making it, so just technically one character besides Bond is reintroduced in Casino Royale's case, or literally just one character besides Bond being is reintroduced in Quantum of Solace's case, but having three characters' precisely being reintroduced specifically: M, Moneypenny, and Q. The idea that diversity is brought to the table makes previous characters being reintroduced rich. M is later played by a man again, Moneypenny is played by a black person for the first time, and Q is played by a young person for the first time. Q, Moneypenny, and Tanner are played by young actors, in fact actors that are even younger than Daniel Craig, and if you really think about this it's actually very logical because when anyone would be recasting these roles they want to cast good actors of course, but also actors that would be so vibrant and energetic that there would be a big possibility that they could be invited back to play the same characters in other Bond films in the James Bond series, therefore you wouldn't have to be going through so much trouble with finding different actors to play the same characters. One may argue that casting an older actor than Daniel Craig to play M doesn't make sense after what has been said about the actors in the other roles, but one could also argue that it makes sense because M Bond's boss is supposed to be thought of as being Bond's mentor. \nThe screenplay of Skyfall surely realizes that what made Casino Royale's screenplay so absorbing, was that it enabled Bond to be defined more by having a plot about his first mission as an agent by having a plot about Bond's life story. Casino Royale really went into Bond's origin with how it was for him to be officially becoming an agent or spy for the first time and dealing with inexperience. Skyfall is well I wouldn't go so far as to say better but even more compelling than Casino Royale by covering Bond's origin even more, and going even deeper than what's necessary to go into it by having a title that refers to an estate that Bond lived on as a child with a groundskeeper named Kincade, which was in Scotland and what this proves is that James Bond is Scottish even though he works in England, and also that there shouldn't be too much controversy to have an English or Scottish actor play James Bond, in fact the first actor to play James Bond Sean Connery was Scottish. \nSkyfall as has many other Bond films has made an authentically interesting distinction between James Bond in the Bond films and Jason Bourne in the Bourne films. James Bond only kills for England when it's absolutely necessary or at least when he feels that it's absolutely necessary even if England disagrees with him, and the James Bond film License to Kill has a whole plot that covers this, and Casino Royale also covers this to an extent.  Jason Bourne is brainwashed into killing for America and tries to do everything he can to avoid killing for America but seems to always end up killing for America in the end. \nThe other cleaver thing that the film does is that it brings more dignity to the Bond film series than usual to honor the 50th anniversary of the Bond series by giving, reference to an abundance of previous Bond pictures. James Bond is presumed dead at the beginning of the picture by the characters when he is shot, and this is a reference to the James Bond picture Thunderball, when he is only presumed dead by the audience when a coffin at a funeral is shown at the beginning with James Bond's initials on it. It also has a reference to Thunderball when Bond has a love scene with a lady he's met named Severine in the shower, because he has a love scene with a nurse he knows in Thunderball named Patricia and the lovemaking scene is in the shower. The certainty that James Bond is supposed to be dead in Skyfall is definitely a note to the Bond film You Only Live Twice where the entire film is focused on Bond being supposed to be dead. \nThere is also a scene at the opening of the film that gives note to the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only where James Bond gets involved in a car chase in a town. The reason why this is a nod to For Your Eyes Only is because he gets into a car chase in a town towards the beginning of For Your Eyes Only. There is also a scene where Bond is questing a terrorist named Patrice as he's hanging from a rooftop, and this is a reference to The Spy who Loved Me which also has a scene where Bond questions a man hanging from a rooftop. There are tons of Bond films that use a female character or female characters as just eye candy and not as a major character in the film, and this is done many times with a lady that James Bond makes love to at the beginning of a Bond film Live and Let Die and The Spy Who Loved Me to name a couple. Skyfall brings this factor back when we see a woman that James Bond makes love to at the beginning of the film whom isn't even given a name. There's a throwback from the Bond film Dr. No when James Bond is at an outdoor bar in the film, which is what he was at in the film Dr. No. When Bond gets into a fight on a train with the terrorist or henchman Patrice it's a throwback to when Bond got into a fight on a train with a henchman in the Bond films: From Russia with Love, Live and Let Die, and The Spy who Loved me. When Bond jumps on one of the alligators' in Skyfall it's homage to when he jumps on a bunch of alligators' in Live and Let Die.\nThe picture shows homage to how previous Bond films defined who James Bond is by being the kind of man that every other man would like to be or fanaticizes about being by being handsome and getting all the girls. One could argue that James Bond is loosely based on Superman because Superman is the kind of man that every other man fanaticizes about being, but too a more extreme extent by being handsome and all-powerful or powerful beyond belief. One could also argue that James Bond is loosely based on Bruce Wayne because Bruce Wayne is the kind of man that every other man dreams about being by being rich, and being able to date lots of women. Skyfall also shows what previous Bond films showed with James Bond being the kind of man that every other man dreams of being by not just by being nice looking, but also by being able to have a romantic or sexual relationship with any woman they want including a married woman, and this is shown in the James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies and Casino Royale, and even having this kind of relationship with a female that your in a professional relationship with, and this has very much been shown between James Bond and Eve Moneypenny in the James Bond pictures From Russia with Love and Die Another Day. Skyfall also shows this kind of bonding as well when Bond flirts with Moneypenny by saying \"I didn't order anything not even you,\" and he also even hits on Moneypenny in the film when he tries to take off her shirt. Worship is compensated to the Bond picture Goldeneye when the villain Silva is grounded in lots of mystery as many evil characters are in general. He's grounded in so much mystery that we even question as to whether he's bisexual or not when he feels Bond's chest and legs and then kisses Severine afterwards, and this is done with the character Xenia Onatopp in Goldeneye when she tells the character Natalya Simonova as she tries to attack her \"wait for your turn\" as she's raping James Bond. \nIt even pays homage to the previous James Bond film Quantum of Solace by using a similar rooftop that was used in Quantum of Solace when Bond and Patrice have a motorcycle chase on a rooftop.  \n There's tribute paid to the best James Bond film in my opinion Goldfinger when the Aston Martin is reintroduced and also the tracking device from Goldfinger is reintroduced. Worship is also shown to Goldfinger when it's proven that M is not a good shot towards the end of the film, because it's proven in the middle of Goldfinger that a character named Tilly Masterson isn't a great shot. \nThe script isn't perfect of course it does fall short of clich\u00e9s with a villain named Silva who makes being caught part of his plan to get away, and not having James Bond shoot at Silva another time after he says after he's shot at him many times before \"I won't miss next time Mr. Silva\" because the filmmakers of the film couldn't carry out the plot of the film very easily without an antagonist if Bond were to kill Silva in the middle of the film. There are plotholes in Skyfall that can easily be found such as when Bond says \"open the door\" a couple of times when the operator of the train is staring at him when he's holding on to the train after he's jumped on it and saying \"health and safety\" after she eventually opens the door all of this makes people wonder why didn't he say health and safety before she opened the door? James Bond at the beginning of Skyfall tears off the back of a train with a tractor yet there's never someone who tells the operator of the train to stop the train after he does so. Silva the antagonist of the film doesn't show up until the middle of the film, which makes it hard to figure out who exactly is the antagonist. \n\tThe acting in Skyfall not surprisingly does not disappoint the reason why I say not surprisingly is because many of the actors in Skyfall are English who specialize in acting, and the actor who plays Silva Javier Bardem is an Oscar nominated as well as an Oscar winning actor. Judi Dench plays M in an authentically logical manner she always acts appropriately when it's, crucial such as during scenes in which she frowns when her character realizes that she's lost plenty of agents. Judi Dench during the final scene between M and Silva enables M to look frightened all while Javier Bardem enables Silva to look frightening, which is something that actor Anthony Hopkins does with the character of Hannibal Lector in the film The Silence of the Lambs. \nJavier Bardem really makes the character of Silva his own by not only making him frightening but also making him nutty by making him have a nutty grin on his face like the classic evil Batman character The Joker such as when he's held captive because he knows he'll come up with an insane idea to escape. He also makes Silva have more of the qualities of The Joker by giving him a nutty laugh or a laugh that comes across as if he's happy that he's made the world more: miserable, troublesome, and evil such as when he walks away laughing disguised as a policeman. Bardem contributes all of the qualities of a villain with Silva by making him look as if he's angry and disgusted with how the planet is, such as when he looks at Bond as if he's disgusted with him and what he stands for, and he also makes him look like he gets mad when things don't go his way such as when he's walking out on to the streets of London looking mad because he wants M dead because she's betrayed him. \nDaniel Craig adds a bunch of creativity to the character of James Bond in Skyfall even if he doesn't do it quit well as he did it in Casino Royale. He makes Bond extremely: focused, determined, and serious when he's chasing Patrice while he has stolen a hard drive at the beginning of the film, and also when he's sneaking up on him in a building in the middle of the film. He makes James Bond disgusted with Silva when he sees him at the beginning and end of the film. \nThere surprisingly is flaws that can be pointed out with Craig's acting as James Bond although if you had to rank all six actors who play James Bond it would go: Connery, Craig, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and Lazenby. When Roger Moore played James Bond he was best at making James Bond joyful and humorous and when Timothy Dalton played James Bond he was best at making James Bond serious and intense, and the reason why Connery is ranked number one amongst the actors who played James Bond is because he was able to be well balanced with both of these styles and do a combination of both, and Daniel Craig does this genuinely well in Casino Royale he particularly makes James Bond joyful, and humorous in Casino Royale by giving him a genuinely cheerful smile which he doesn't give as much in Skyfall. Daniel Craig does make James Bond comical and cheerful with a smile in Skyfall but he doesn't smile as much or have as big of a smile as he did when he played James Bond in Casino Royale. He plays Bond more on the lines of Timothy Dalton than Roger Moore by making Bond more: focused, fierce, persistent, and deliberate. It would have been better if he was able to do a combination of Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton just as well as he did in Casino Royale or even better than he did in Casino Royale. \nSkyfall not only never bore you with its script but also with its music or score. Skyfall's score brings a lot of: energy, excitement, honor, and significance. There is authentically energetic and exciting music that is in synch with the action that happens in the picture such as when Bond is going through a big chase in Istanbul and London and also when he gets into a fight in a casino at Macau. There is extremely honorable kind of music that plays throughout the film such as when M gives a speech about honor at a hearing and when Gareth Mallory wants M to retire from her job with honor and also when a very respectable person and very respectable people die in the film. There is as has been stated before plenty of significance added to the title of the picture not just with the plot but also with the theme song at the beginning of the picture. The theme song at the beginning of the film really describes what kind of place Skyfall is and what to expect from it in the film and the singer of the theme song Adele really articulates what Skyfall is with her voice and vocals. \n12 time Oscar nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins has done a splendid job with how the film is shot. He uses colors for the film in a blazingly manner by not overusing them but also not underusing them as well. A great example is when James Bond is in a building and many colors of neon lights is used in the background and foreground of many windows: blue, green, and yellow to name a few. There is another blazing shot when James Bond and Patrice are fighting in the building specifically over a gun, and a blue background with a jellyfish is shown, and: cinematography, chorography, score, and sound effects are uniquely mixed in together. There are an abundance of beautiful shots in the film such as when James Bond and M are looking upon beautiful foggy hills when they're in Scotland and when we get a nice shot of the city of London with a bunch of UK flags as Bond is standing on a rooftop. \nI actually would put Skyfall on my top 3 lists of James Bond films just below Casino Royale and Goldfinger. The whole production of Skyfall really comes together despite a bit clumsy acting from Craig and a slightly unadapt screenplay.",

The certainty that James Bond is supposed to be dead in Skyfall is definitely a note to the Bond film You Only Live Twice where the entire film is focused on Bond being supposed to be dead. \nThere is also a scene at the opening of the film that gives note to the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only where James Bond gets involved in a car chase in a town. The reason why this is a nod to For Your Eyes Only is because he gets into a car chase in a town towards the beginning of For Your Eyes Only. There is also a scene where Bond is questing a terrorist named Patrice as he's hanging from a rooftop, and this is a reference to The Spy who Loved Me which also has a scene where Bond questions a man hanging from a rooftop. There are tons of Bond films that use a female character or female characters as just eye candy and not as a major character in the film, and this is done many times with a lady that James Bond makes love to at the beginning of a Bond film Live and Let Die and The Spy Who Loved Me to name a couple. Skyfall brings this factor back when we see a woman that James Bond makes love to at the beginning of the film whom isn't even given a name. There's a throwback from the Bond film Dr. No when James Bond is at an outdoor bar in the film, which is what he was at in the film Dr. No. When Bond gets into a fight on a train with the terrorist or henchman Patrice it's a throwback to when Bond got into a fight on a train with a henchman in the Bond films: From Russia with Love, Live and Let Die, and The Spy who Loved me. When Bond jumps on one of the alligators' in Skyfall it's homage to when he jumps on a bunch of alligators' in Live and Let Die.\nThe picture shows homage to how previous Bond films defined who James Bond is by being the kind of man that every other man would like to be or fanaticizes about being by being handsome and getting all the girls. One could argue that James Bond is loosely based on Superman because Superman is the kind of man that every other man fanaticizes about being, but too a more extreme extent by being handsome and all-powerful or powerful beyond belief. One could also argue that James Bond is loosely based on Bruce Wayne because Bruce Wayne is the kind of man that every other man dreams about being by being rich, and being able to date lots of women. Skyfall also shows what previous Bond films showed with James Bond being the kind of man that every other man dreams of being by not just by being nice looking, but also by being able to have a romantic or sexual relationship with any woman they want including a married woman, and this is shown in the James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies and Casino Royale, and even having this kind of relationship with a female that your in a professional relationship with, and this has very much been shown between James Bond and Eve Moneypenny in the James Bond pictures From Russia with Love and Die Another Day. Skyfall also shows this kind of bonding as well when Bond flirts with Moneypenny by saying \"I didn't order anything not even you,\" and he also even hits on Moneypenny in the film when he tries to take off her shirt. Worship is compensated to the Bond picture Goldeneye when the villain Silva is grounded in lots of mystery as many evil characters are in general. He's grounded in so much mystery that we even question as to whether he's bisexual or not when he feels Bond's chest and legs and then kisses Severine afterwards, and this is done with the character Xenia Onatopp in Goldeneye when she tells the character Natalya Simonova as she tries to attack her \"wait for your turn\" as she's raping James Bond. \nIt even pays homage to the previous James Bond film Quantum of Solace by using a similar rooftop that was used in Quantum of Solace when Bond and Patrice have a motorcycle chase on a rooftop.  \n There's tribute paid to the best James Bond film in my opinion Goldfinger when the Aston Martin is reintroduced and also the tracking device from Goldfinger is reintroduced. Worship is also shown to Goldfinger when it's proven that M is not a good shot towards the end of the film, because it's proven in the middle of Goldfinger that a character named Tilly Masterson isn't a great shot. \nThe script isn't perfect of course it does fall short of clich\u00e9s with a villain named Silva who makes being caught part of his plan to get away, and not having James Bond shoot at Silva another time after he says after he's shot at him many times before \"I won't miss next time Mr. Silva\" because the filmmakers of the film couldn't carry out the plot of the film very easily without an antagonist if Bond were to kill Silva in the middle of the film. There are plotholes in Skyfall that can easily be found such as when Bond says \"open the door\" a couple of times when the operator of the train is staring at him when he's holding on to the train after he's jumped on it and saying \"health and safety\" after she eventually opens the door all of this makes people wonder why didn't he say health and safety before she opened the door? James Bond at the beginning of Skyfall tears off the back of a train with a tractor yet there's never someone who tells the operator of the train to stop the train after he does so. Silva the antagonist of the film doesn't show up until the middle of the film, which makes it hard to figure out who exactly is the antagonist. \n\tThe acting in Skyfall not surprisingly does not disappoint the reason why I say not surprisingly is because many of the actors in Skyfall are English who specialize in acting, and the actor who plays Silva Javier Bardem is an Oscar nominated as well as an Oscar winning actor. Judi Dench plays M in an authentically logical manner she always acts appropriately when it's, crucial such as during scenes in which she frowns when her character realizes that she's lost plenty of agents. Judi Dench during the final scene between M and Silva enables M to look frightened all while Javier Bardem enables Silva to look frightening, which is something that actor Anthony Hopkins does with the character of Hannibal Lector in the film The Silence of the Lambs. \nJavier Bardem really makes the character of Silva his own by not only making him frightening but also making him nutty by making him have a nutty grin on his face like the classic evil Batman character The Joker such as when he's held captive because he knows he'll come up with an insane idea to escape. He also makes Silva have more of the qualities of The Joker by giving him a nutty laugh or a laugh that comes across as if he's happy that he's made the world more: miserable, troublesome, and evil such as when he walks away laughing disguised as a policeman. Bardem contributes all of the qualities of a villain with Silva by making him look as if he's angry and disgusted with how the planet is, such as when he looks at Bond as if he's disgusted with him and what he stands for, and he also makes him look like he gets mad when things don't go his way such as when he's walking out on to the streets of London looking mad because he wants M dead because she's betrayed him. \nDaniel Craig adds a bunch of creativity to the character of James Bond in Skyfall even if he doesn't do it quit well as he did it in Casino Royale. He makes Bond extremely: focused, determined, and serious when he's chasing Patrice while he has stolen a hard drive at the beginning of the film, and also when he's sneaking up on him in a building in the middle of the film. He makes James Bond disgusted with Silva when he sees him at the beginning and end of the film. \nThere surprisingly is flaws that can be pointed out with Craig's acting as James Bond although if you had to rank all six actors who play James Bond it would go: Connery, Craig, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and Lazenby. When Roger Moore played James Bond he was best at making James Bond joyful and humorous and when Timothy Dalton played James Bond he was best at making James Bond serious and intense, and the reason why Connery is ranked number one amongst the actors who played James Bond is because he was able to be well balanced with both of these styles and do a combination of both, and Daniel Craig does this genuinely well in Casino Royale he particularly makes James Bond joyful, and humorous in Casino Royale by giving him a genuinely cheerful smile which he doesn't give as much in Skyfall. Daniel Craig does make James Bond comical and cheerful with a smile in Skyfall but he doesn't smile as much or have as big of a smile as he did when he played James Bond in Casino Royale. He plays Bond more on the lines of Timothy Dalton than Roger Moore by making Bond more: focused, fierce, persistent, and deliberate. It would have been better if he was able to do a combination of Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton just as well as he did in Casino Royale or even better than he did in Casino Royale. \nSkyfall not only never bore you with its script but also with its music or score. Skyfall's score brings a lot of: energy, excitement, honor, and significance. There is authentically energetic and exciting music that is in synch with the action that happens in the picture such as when Bond is going through a big chase in Istanbul and London and also when he gets into a fight in a casino at Macau. There is extremely honorable kind of music that plays throughout the film such as when M gives a speech about honor at a hearing and when Gareth Mallory wants M to retire from her job with honor and also when a very respectable person and very respectable people die in the film. There is as has been stated before plenty of significance added to the title of the picture not just with the plot but also with the theme song at the beginning of the picture. The theme song at the beginning of the film really describes what kind of place Skyfall is and what to expect from it in the film and the singer of the theme song Adele really articulates what Skyfall is with her voice and vocals. \n12 time Oscar nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins has done a splendid job with how the film is shot. He uses colors for the film in a blazingly manner by not overusing them but also not underusing them as well. A great example is when James Bond is in a building and many colors of neon lights is used in the background and foreground of many windows: blue, green, and yellow to name a few. There is another blazing shot when James Bond and Patrice are fighting in the building specifically over a gun, and a blue background with a jellyfish is shown, and: cinematography, chorography, score, and sound effects are uniquely mixed in together. There are an abundance of beautiful shots in the film such as when James Bond and M are looking upon beautiful foggy hills when they're in Scotland and when we get a nice shot of the city of London with a bunch of UK flags as Bond is standing on a rooftop. \nI actually would put Skyfall on my top 3 lists of James Bond films just below Casino Royale and Goldfinger. The whole production of Skyfall really comes together despite a bit clumsy acting from Craig and a slightly unadapt screenplay.",

            "content": "Bond movies date back to the year 1953 and are known as movie classics. With a fresh one coming out in April it is just the right time to take a look back on arguably the best Bond movie, Skyfall. This thrilling adventure goes beyond the usual action packed 007 movie, exploring the agent's past and going deeper into the modern world of espionage.\nThe movie starts with an excellent action sequence in which the British agent tries to recapture a stolen hard drive, from a baddie. He fails and gets himself nearly killed in the process. Thus it makes our beloved James Bond imperfect and gives an ideal way to further develop his character.\nBut the film is not only about the secret agent. His superior \"M\", played by Judi Dench, has a vital role in the upfolding of events. Skyfall also saw the return of Bond's technical assistant \"Q\", played by Ben Wishaw, and introduction of a new co agent Miss Moneypenny, played by Naome Harris. All these characters have a little rocky relationship with James but they manage to gain each other's trust by working towards a common goal.\nThe villain of the movie is brutal, yet much suffered Silva, played by Javier Bardem. Being a former MI6 agent his actions are motivated by personal revenge towards his former colleagues. Silva is truly a great villain, even to some degree admirable.\nThe movie is directed by Sam Mendes and is full of aesthetic shots and beautiful scenery. The adventure takes us to many locations from rainy London to shiny Macau and Shanghai. The culmination of the movie takes place in James Bond's childhood home, Skyfall manor. Of course we must not forget the astonishing soundtrack, written by Adele, which is still blowing me away. \nSkyfall is one of the greatest achievments in cinematography to date. The movie has many layers to it, full of great characters, breathtaking action sequences and it never fails to surprise with some new little details you had missed the last time.",

This movie has some of my favorite action scenes, for example, the train and the motorcycle. The song they made for this movie I love and it fits the movie very well. This movie has my favorite opening sequence in any bond movie. This movie shows a broken bond and he is out of his prime and even if he is out he can still do the things he did before. This movie has my favorite cinematography in the whole franchise and this is my favorite work of cinematography in all of film . Javier Barden gives an amazing monologue when he meets bond. This movie adds so much more character to Bond and we care about him because he isn't in his prime.\n\nThe acting in this movie is very good and they have a stacked cast. Like I said before the cinematography is amazing and Roger Deakins should have won cinematography for this movie but he didn't. The lighting in this movie is amazing and in one scene there are lanterns and it looks beautiful, the colors they use looks amazing and it is just outstanding especially when they go to his old house the use of brown and greys looks fabulous, The action scenes are amazing and the choreography is amazing. They create tension very well in the second act. The score in this movie is my favorite in any movie. The final fight is amazing and it is my favorite in cinema and the buildup to the fight I love so much and the final fight the fight in the church is amazing and it is a good send off to M. The script and dialogue is very good and it is true to the established characters. Overall I absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

The plot in this chapter is much deeper while maintaining the classic car chases, gun fights, and hand to hand combat to keep us on edge.

I love what he brings to the table, he is outstanding as Silva. Naomie Harris is a welcomed addition, I would've liked to have seen her given more screen time in truth. Small shoutout to Ben Whishaw also, he makes for a very good Q.\n\nIn terms of the plot, I think it is one of the best from the series so far. Although, I will say it wraps up pretty surprisingly - given what the entirety of the film spends doing beforehand.

            "content": "A brisk, broad, stuffed, slightly clever, sometimes stupid, post-Dark Knight psychological action thriller. Its brutal editing blasts through scenes, each one fun in a new and different way. There are some lovely, series-high dialogue scenes and some series-high creativity and set-pieces.\nI'm troubled by some things; Thomas Newman does a good job but I miss David Arnold as his music was unnoticeable and scene-perfect, and Naomie Harris is insufferably bad; miscast likely in a blockbuster due to how excellent she usually is, but conversely, an en vogue Javiar Bardem chews the fuck out of the scenery.\nLots of stupid stuff happens, plenty of holes and contrivances, but it's a heck of a lot of fun, a sort of reboot/rehash, retro-throwback and modernising update all at the same time, not as elegantly classic as Casino, and may age worse due to being influenced by the big films of the time, but it reinvented the franchise once again in Craig's tenure and the accomplishments of the film (action, cinematography, costume design, character arcs, introduction of series staples such as Q, etc.) far outweigh the flaws (like some of the jokes really not landing, and some tenuous leaps of faith and boring subplots).\nSkyfall tries hard, sometimes too hard, but at the end of the day you notice, after seeing it countless times, moments like the sound of the glass cutter pitching up and down to match the music in the jellyfish scene, and you remember that it really is a film of quality.\n\nI really think Daniel Craig, recognising that Bond spends a large percentage of his films in action, plays each iteration of Bond in the action sequences according to the kind of Bond he is supposed to be in the film. Casino saw him a smirking smug rookie, Quantum a dead-hearted laser focused grief stricken man and in Skyfall he's a grumpy, tired, ageing man whose mystique is slowly being destroyed. One imagines to an extent Craig sympathises with this Bond most. Not unlike Spectre where Bond is a burnt out, bored, uninspired husk. \n\nThe fit for work montage culminating in the word association is the first great sequence of the movie. I won't wax lyrical too much about this technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking, suffice to say that for all it's flaws, the film builds its ancient franchise mythology sensitively and adds new breath to the franchise already pretty high off of Casino Royale. Bond had a beard, Ben Wishaw is a cracking addition and the focus on closing M's arc is a clever left field one. \n\nJavier Bardem is predictably joker-like and he ties well in to the central drama between Bond and M. But the real stars of the film are the locales and sets, gorgeously photographed by master Deakins and the action, the art house action, built and shot by someone trying to create the best sequences available. \n\nIt's long and stuffed and cheesy in places. But so was Casino. It excels in mood and manages to produce a balanced, broad, arty action blockbuster with flourishes of tender moments, tight dialogue and all the bravado and fistpumping  beats an audience could desire.",

I thought Javier Bardem was a great villain in No Country for Old Men, but here he just failed to be intimidating.  There is a lot of blah-blah-blah in this movie about how scary his character is supposed to be, but in the end, he's about as terrifying as an untied shoelace.  Usually in an action movie, there is a big climactic action scene to cap off the movie, but in this movie, the final confrontation between Bond and Silva is about as anti-climactic as can be.

Despite of being the most personal and emotionally driven content, the mano-y-mano perspective let's you fill in on their shoes giving you the up close 3d experience with three dimensional characters which none of these hokum comic books extravaganza can give. This is also probably the first complete script of James Bond, in the sense that the linearity is easily followed and synced with crisp relevant action.\n\nThe Bond girl Berenice Marlohe leaves a resonant message in her brief appearance, also since this is the only Bond girl with almost no flirt talk, her fear makes her hand and voice shake and the film takes a steady U turn. This is where we catch up with Javier Bardem, who is celebrated with no care in the world by the writers, where you can see them bending the rules and even the script to make sure, he comes off as a magnetic righteous leader.\n\nAnd if he is poised in every step of his plan, M, played by Judi Dench, makes him rubble every time, he encounters her and this cat and mouse chase is spiced with a love track that you not only don't see it coming, but also practically go wolfish to have some more. And amidst all the new recruits to the old employees striking horn for some noble agenda, Daniel Craig, gets overshadowed which too is foliated nicely by Mendes making him the empathetic character, just like Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049 or even Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry to some degree.

The theme song is the best one yet delivering haunting and grim visuals and the only song by Adele that I like (sorry Adele lovers, but I have only heard three of her songs). From there on Skyfall is a thrill ride delivering great scenery and visuals as well as making you think along the way. The climax at Skyfall is one of the greatest climaxes ever and that fight alone deserves a best picture nomination. Craig is the best Bond (yes, I have seen EVERY 007 film) and those that doubt him (unless you favor Connery, than I see your point) than i don't trust your judgement. Some people are going to hate me for saying this but this is kind of underrated. This is the Dark Knight of the spy universe and that 86% Audience Score I am not convinced with. In the end, Skyfall 007 is one of my favorite films to date and deserves recognition all around.\n-10/10",

Humanizing Bond follows in the footsteps of other franchise films leaning on \"realistic\" elements of stories rather than larger-than-life ones. Yes, there was still an amazing opening sequence that seemed completely unreal, but that is simply Bond. Javier Bardem was the perfect villain as a rogue agent, which is much better than some other international terrorist. Skyfall \"borrowed\" components from many other films like \"Dr. No\" and \"Dark Knight,\" but that may just be a sign of the times. In fact, Javier's character borrowed many things from Heath Ledger's Joker. I've stayed away from other articles about Skyfall, but I can only assume I'm not the only one who caught Javier's message \"Think On Your Sins\" spelled the anagram TOYS. Javier mentions his toys later, but never explained the anagram. I saw a lot of Heath's portrayal in Javier's. As an all-around Bond flick, though, they don't get much better than Skyfall.",

I still can not understand why anyone can like this movie and still am still shocked to see how many people worship this movie. That people love this movie is bad enough but that they praise this movie as much as anyone else that is the biggest tragedy\n\"Skyfall\" contains no suspense the drama is passable but the effects are funny there is no real plot I third of the movie is just jumping from one place to the next and so I really really took a long time to follow the process of the movie It's always going to be bad if you only see an action movie but you have to read through the Wikipedia article to get the plot (I mean that's not Blade Runner what the complicated storyline?), but I'm a lot more baffled the train that arrives so well on the ground nothing done dirt that has no special quality or anything special.\nI even go so far as to say that the film would not even have received a third of the money of praise or prizes if not for the brand name James Bond.\nEverything in this movie is stupid the characters you suffer can die all the ones you do not like die sometime later but then not in a good way, Javier Bardem looks like they painted him the visage, and the movie is literally anti-climatic you because the entire last third is even more boring than the rest of the movie. So the movie starts okay, then gets annoying then gets boring and ends in just awful.\nI do not understand today it was the people who loved this movie so much and I honestly lost interest in the answer, of course I know the tastes are always different and not all like that but if he changes me half a puzzle want and say that is the most beautiful picture in the world although over half missing and what you see looks like ass then I miss the words.\nMy conclusion, of course, is that the James Bond films are not always the best in the world and I know that they are made for entertainment only because none of these films will get you an Oscar or be represented very much in the general movie encyclopedia but Skyfall is absolutely shitty, Direct are pretty stupid, the drama is tolerable, the record is super stupid, the end is a single insult and the music would be pitiful even for a Disney musical.\nThis movie should die.",

Very funny!\n\nThe restrained and perfectly delivered banter, especially between James and M, is as extraordinarily clever and dry as only the Brits can do.\n\nEveryone puts in star performances, but as I expected, Javier Bardem steals the show from Craig, Dench, Fiennes and the beautiful French Bond girl, Severine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe). After No Country for Old Men I thought he would be hard pressed to play as interesting a character. I was wrong. As Silvahe is absolutely mesmerising to watch - the way he walks, smiles, contemplates life, flirts with Bond and threatens M.\n\nSkyfall is the quintessential James Bond movie with glamour, worldwide locals, gorgeous girls, over-the-top action and dry humour; but it also has depth, honour and wit. It raises issues such as blind faith in your country, loyalty to others and yourself, and personal responsibility.\n\nThe bad\n\nI cannot tell you without giving away the film. It does revolve around M, though. You will know it when you see it.\n\nSummary\n\nAll three Bond films starring Daniel Craig have been exceptional.

He can display Bond's emotions and character changes with the most subtlest of facial ticks and movements - and boy, does Bond go through the wringer in this movie. \nIn Skyfall, Bond goes through a rebirth - both the franchise and the character. Bond faces off against Silva, who was also abandoned by M, and thus, Bond takes on a mirror image of himself, an incarnation of what his alcoholism and bitterness could possibly turn himself into. It's never fully implied if M intended to sacrifice Bond - or Silva - and that's the beauty of this film; it has a certain ambiguity to it that allows you to truly think. Bond doesn't just beat up baddies - he goes through a test of bravery and trust that is emphasized in this movie. We don't just see Bond's struggles, we see him as a person - his humanity, his flaws, the fact that he isn't Mr. Perfect Agent.",

This was Mendes' first crack at a Bond movie and is BY FAR one of the best Bond movies ever made. Forget that 'Quantum of Solace' trash; this is Bond in his alcoholic prime and by God is it amazing. Daniel Craig is still one of the best Bond's and really sells the depressing, broken aspect of his character. Skyfall is probably the best shot Bond movie and looks visually stunning in every single sense of the word. This is a very character driven story and I love how well it was written. That said, in typical Bond fashion(for me at least), all the scenes and set pieces don't feel connected despite the fact that they are. In spite of this minor hurdle, this movie is a blast from start to finish and contains all the great action to feed action junkies, but also supplies a heartfelt story for people who actually care about plot. I know it's 2017 and no one cares about PLOT(what a childish thing) but for those of us with more than one brain cell, the story is great and possibly the Best Bond plot but I can't say for sure.\n\nJavier Bardem is like that creepy priest you saw when you went to church that one time. He'll sometimes crack a joke(which you'll laugh at just to comfort him) but at the end of the day, he's just gonna try and get you alone in a church after dark. Regardless, Bardem provides a chilling performance and actually makes Bardem's motivations make sense. Silva was also a great Bond villain and proved to be a great foil for Bond and worked well in today's current computer/hacked based climate. Judi Dench provides a heartfelt performance as the wonderful M and makes M the heart and soul of the movie. Ben Winshaw was a great choice for Q and aligning Q with the current computer based climate was also a genius idea. That said, both Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris' roles in this movie were kind of pointless. Not to say that their performances were lacklustre but their actual character and purpose made no sense.\n\nThis is the most visually stunning Bond. Every shot is masterfully composed and lit. Every scene is masterfully edited and directed. Every frame of this movie provides atmosphere and makes this movie a true joy to behold. \n\nThis movie's action was outstanding and it brings back all the classic Bond-isms. Despite that, the Bond Girl was completely useless and the Bond car was virtually non-existent(aside from a mini segment). I'm not saying this takes away from the movie but if you're gonna include them, at least go all in and try to make them interesting. \n\nSkyfall is probably the best Bond song. Say what you want about Adele or even this movie but you cannot die that song is incredible and the lyrics actually have meaning instead of just filler.\n\nSkyfall is one of the best Bond films. It's beautifully shot, well acted, masterfully directed and deserves a spot on the Bond hall of fame. Javier Bardem is one of the best Bond Villains and Skyfall is one of the best Bond songs. All in all, this movie is well worth a watch for old and new fans alike and I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10 Creepy Priests.",

            "content": "For a franchise turning 50, Skyfall is a surprising and amazing acheivement. Too often in my last 20 years of film-going, have I gone to watch the latest 007 adventure, only to be somewhat disappointed by how the films rest on their laurels while subtly creating the illusion that they are moving with the times. This constant push and pull has resulted in some confused stories and occasionally (The World Is Not Enough, Casino Royale) I have not seen the latest installment until the DVD release down at Video Vision (a great little rental store which has now closed down). Daniel Craig's third Bond film however, was a different story and I walked away from the cinema feeling like I had seen something familiar but truly unique. A familiar theme in the Bond series when efforts are made to shake up the formula is the one where Bond goes AWOL and becomes a rogue agent, resigning or being told to hand over the Walter PPK. This plot device has been used in You Only Live Twice, OHMSS, Licence To Kill, Die Another Day, Casino Royale, and now Skyfall. What is different about this film though is the effort that has gone into making the most perfect Bond film that can be made in these times. Craig made an immediate impression in Casino Royale and the follow up but Skyfall is where he truly owns the role. His physical agility is only matched by his steely doggedness as the superspy. Skyfall is also one of the best looking Bond films with some stunning cinematography, cooly-lit scenes, and enough nostalgia to satisfy the purists. Some humour has returned as well, especially during Bond's exchanges with the villain Silva (Jarvier Bardem). Thankfully, the recurring MI5 characters Q and Moneypenny have returned too. Judi Dench again plays Bond's superior M and this is her most emotionally invested performance. Her scenes with Bond have an emotional quality rarely seen in Bond films. Skyfall does quote many scenes from classic Bond films but unlike Brosnan's Die Another Day, it never does this in an obvious, tacky way.This may be attributable to director Sam Mendes whose stylish touch has given us something we never thought we would see again- a Bond installment that is also a great film.",

In \"Casino Royal\" he was just starting to dip his toes into the waters of espionage, and the film was fast and wild because of it. But here he's been swimming around for a long time, and his toes are incredibly pruned. The movie is hardly prune-ey, obviously. But there's\u00e2?? a definite jaded edge to it. Maybe toes and water weren't the best analogy, but either way \"Skyfall\" is the perfect film to end Daniel Craig's run as Bond. There is another film that succeeds this one, and possibly some more after that if his contract doesn't expire. But it still feels like the end of an era.

Redford. There is sizzling homo erotic tension between Daniel Craig's perfect Bond and Javier Bardem's Silva, a villain the likes of which have never been seen in this franchise. Dame Judi Dench's marvelous \"M\" is set up for retirement from the onset of the film. Dench, who has portrayed M for seven Bond films--a record- -is given the screen time she deserves to honor her character. While Craig's \"Casino Royale\" remains my favorite with its bloody and raw portrayal of the spy business and most tender Bond romance since \"On Her Magesty's Secret Service,\" \"Skyfall\" is full and satisfying and among the best films of its kind released this season.",

            "content": "\"We are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are. One equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\" (IMDB). This quote is said by M, played by Judi Dench, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie, Skyfall. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, and Naomie Harris. Along with director Sam Mendes, the screenwriters are Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan. Skyfall is an enjoyable movie because the plot is enhanced by the action.\n\nWhen James Bond goes into hiding after a mission goes wrong, MI6 is attacked by an unknown terrorist. The leader of MI6, M, is determined to find the person responsible, but she knows she needs Bond's help. Armed with skills and intelligence, Bond must find the villain before it is too late.\n\nThe suspense in the movie helps to make it more exciting for the audience. It makes the audience ask, \"What is going to happen next?\", and keep watching. For example, the beginning of the movie begins with James Bond and Moneypenny chasing a bad guy. Bond and the bad guy end up fighting each other on top of a train and Moneypenny has to shoot the bad guy in order to save Bond, but she does not have a clear shot. In this scene, the suspense reaches its peak when M, the head of MI6, demands Moneypenny to take the shot. As a result, Moneypenny fires but the bullet hits Bond by mistake. Another example is when Bond fights a bad guy in a skyscraper in Shanghai. Bond pushes the bad guy out of a window, catches him in the nick of time, and demands to know who he works for. In this scene, the suspense reaches its peak when Bond loses his grip and the bad guy falls to his death. Lastly, another example is how the plot reveals Bond's past. When Bond and M are in Scotland, M asks Bond if this was where he grew up. After Bond says yes, M says that \"orphans always make the best recruits\". The audience can infer that Bond's parents died, but the movie does not tell the audience the cause of death. This scene adds to the mystery of Bond's past.\n\nThe action in the movie helps to make it stand out among the other Bond movies. Also, the elaborate action scenes that the Bond movies are known for puts the audience at the edge of their seats. For example, Bond uses a crane to jump into a train car and fixes his sleeve cuff. These out-of-the-box actions help Bond create an identity for himself as a risk taking secret agent with charisma. Also, the action in this scene helps the movie stand out among the other Bond movies. Another example is when Bond captures Silva on a remote island. Bond defeats Silva's henchmen, but Silva does not think that Bond can arrest him on his own. Meanwhile, Bond used a radio to call in helicopters in order to bring Silva and himself back to London. This is a good example because Bond outsmarts his enemy in a dramatic way.\n\nThe characters in the movie help to engage the audience by cheering on the good guys and loathing the bad guys. In addition, each actor and actress play their respective role expertly from beginning to end. For example, the villain, Silva, does not present himself as a stereotypical movie bad guy. On the outside, Silva likes to manipulate people in order to get what he wants with his arrogance and sense of entitlement. However, on the inside, Silva is a cold, calculating maniac who seeks nothing but revenge. Another example is James Bond. After what happened to Bond in the beginning of the movie, Bond went into hiding in order to recover from his injury. However, he chooses to use alcohol to forget about the mission and he feels betrayed by M. After seeing news that the MI6 headquarters was attacked, Bond decides to pick himself up and travel back to London. Bond goes back to London because he knows MI6 needs his help and he wants to exact revenge on whoever attacked the agency. Another example is M, the head of MI6, because she is trying to do the best that she can for the agency and for her country. When she meets with Mallory, a chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, M tells him that she will retire when they find who was responsible for the attack and convict the terrorist. M stands tall because she takes pride in her work and wants the best for her country.\n\nThe dialogue in the movie serves to set the tone for a scene or have the audience believe that something will happen. Also, the dialogue reveals more about a character's personality. For example, Bond is chasing Silva in the subway tunnel. Silva says, \"Well, you caught me, now, here's your prize, the latest thing from my local toy store, it's called radio.\" An explosion ruptures a hole in a wall near Bond and he shouts sarcastically to Silva, \"I do hope that wasn't for me!\" Then, Silva says coldly, \"No. But that is...\" and a train car crashes through the wall almost hitting Bond, in the process. This scene with the hero and the villain makes the audience want to see the moment when the villain gets his comeuppance. In addition, Silva uses cruel irony when he mentions the \"radio\" because Bond used a radio earlier in the movie when Silva was arrested. Another example is when Bond returns to London and M catches him in her home. M is told by Bond, \"So this is it. We're both played out\", and M replies, \"Well, if you believe that, why did you come back?\". Bond says, \"Good question\", and M answers that question by stating, \"Because we're under attack. And you know we need you.\" Bond says rudely, \"Well, I'm here\". By this scene, the audience can tell that Bond is still walking around with a chip on his shoulder because he was shot, by mistake, on his last assignment. Also, Bond knows that M is right and he should focus on the problem at hand.\n\nWhile Skyfall has received critical acclaim from critics and fans, one critic, Cameron Williams, gave negative feedback on Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond by saying, \"Craig's Bond is a dull, advertising meat sack. The franchise has always been plagued by product placement but when he's slowly pulling back on a specific brand of beer or randomly putting on designer sunglasses while being held hostage it's clear that Craig's performance as a walking billboard is as good as it gets\" (Williams). However, this claim overlooks Craig's performance as Bond because Williams only focuses on the advertising aspect of the character. Williams gives little to no credit on Craig's acting and effort. An example of Craig's performance is the scene at the casino between Bond and Severine. The audience can tell that Bond wants to help Severine, but Severine warns Bond that her employer is an evil man. In this scene, the audience sees that Craig's performance of Bond expresses genuine concern for Severine. Another example of Craig's performance is the scene where Bond is interrogating the assassin in Shanghai. The audience can tell by Bond's actions and choice of words that Bond will do anything in his power to know who the assassin works for. Bond is furious that he loses his grip and causes the assassin to fall to his death because it will make it more difficult for Bond to know where to look next. Another example of Craig's performance is the scene where Bond meets the new Q in an art gallery before going on another assignment to Shanghai. The audience can tell that Bond and Q jokingly throw witty remarks about each other's age before formally introducing themselves. Also, the audience can infer that by this meeting, Bond and Q can trust each other in future assignments.\n\nCameron Williams delivered another negative claim about Skyfall by stating that, \"Instead of forging ahead with something new, the film relies on gags and references to previous Bond films with familiar cars, gadgets and one liners that proves it's only as good as your fondness of the franchise will allow\" (Williams). However, this opinion generalizes Skyfall as \"just another James Bond movie\" because the movie scratches the surface on Bond's past. Also, this movie marks the final time Judi Dench plays as M in future James Bond movies. The audience learns about a new person who takes the role as M and a new person who takes the role as Q, the quartermaster. New characters in Skyfall helped to make a clean slate for the movie and its sequel. Skyfall did not make use of one liners, but the dialogue did use elements of dramatic irony and quick-witted conversations. An example of dramatic irony is when Silva is running from Bond in the subway tunnels. Silva mentions \"the radio\" in the same way like when Bond uses a radio to capture Silva on the island. An example of a quick-witted conversation is the meeting between Bond and Q, the new quartermaster, at the art museum before Bond goes to Shanghai. Bond and Q poke fun about each other before getting to the matter at hand. Another example of a witty conversation is when the doctor asks Bond about word associations during Bond's tests. Even though Bond cooperates, he manages to insult M without hesitation because he is still angry about the failed mission early in the movie. In addition, Bond walks out on the test when the doctor says the word, \"Skyfall\". The audience can infer that Bond does not like to mention the word, but the audience does not know why.\n\nSkyfall is a must see movie for any fan of James Bond movies, young and old. In addition, it is a superb action movie for anyone who likes the action genre or is simply a casual moviegoer.",

Intriguing and subtly framed by contemporary political and social circumstances, Skyfall raises questions about the outmoded relevance of traditional espionage in a time where villains can attack and hack at any time anywhere and in doing so smartly ensures the franchises survival. \n\nRespecting its predecessors of the last 50 years, the ever present trademarks of Martini's, Aston Martin's, snazzy gadgets, tailored suits, unabated flirting and quick quips are accounted for but the overall style is modern and more Bourne than Bond. \n\nMaintaining tensions, Director Sam Mendes' has delved deep into Ian Fleming's novels in an attempt to bring an element of engagement though uncovering snippets of events that shaped Mr. Bond. Allowing Daniel Craig to bring a never before explored vulnerability to the ultra-suave character. \n\nOn his last assignment in Istanbul , British secret agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and his off-sider Eve (Naomie Harris) pursue a man in possession of a stolen hard drive containing detailed information exposing crucial undercover agents identities within terrorist cells around the world.\n\nUsing Bond as a human shield and preventing the clean kill, Eve is ordered by the steadfast agency head M (Judy Dench) to make the shot, taking out Bond in the process. The fateful decision places M under the scrutiny of the Intelligence and Security Committee, challenging her methods, the new Chairman, Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) calls for an end to M's tenure through imposed retirement. \n\nWhen MI6 headquarters is hacked then attacked, Bond is stirred out of his wallowing stupor. Dormant for months, 007 has lost the edge and suffers mentally, physical and emotionally from the injuries he sustained at M's instruction. Compromised equally from both inside and out, M must rely on the one uncomfortable ally left she can trust to save the agency - the unfit for duty, Bond. \n\nTaking back to the shadows on the trail of the mysterious Silva (Javier Bardem), Bond proves that an oldie is always a goody as the villain's lethal motives are closer to home than expected. \n \nCraig's physical prowess is outstripped by Dame Judy Dench's eloquent words. One of the best actors of her generation, Dench's presence as the Machiavellian matriarch adds a poignant layer the 007 world. Bardem is a bizarre balance between cartoon and repulsive megalomanic. Whilst the underplayed Fiennes and younger than expected newcomers Harris and techno-freak agent Q (Ben Whishaw) will obviously get their due screen time in films to come. \n\nThe verdict: An intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, from the wonderfully haunting title song by Adele to its accompanying eye-popping opening montage credit based on the films content, this unforgettable (unlike its most recent predecessor) offering brings an invigorating relevance to the franchise.\n\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 30/11/2012",

Even if, like me, you have never seen a single James Bond movie, you are probably familiar with the tropes, I mean, they are pretty much referenced every day. This film doesn't just have the tropes, it completely flips them on each other. The acting by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench is spectacular and shows a very interesting, albeit complicated, chemistry. This film also has a great villain, who I refuse to spoil anything about, and also a very beautiful soundtrack. In the end, Skyfall will appeal to almost everybody. A great villain, a great soundtrack, a great premise, beautiful direction, amazing dialogue, create a near-perfect masterpiece, and my only gripes with it are just pure nitpicking.",

Great plot, having 007 fake his death and have to come back for something big really worked for me, as well as him not being 100% and needing some training! All the performances are phenomenal, especially Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem! Javier Bardem's character was perfect, and used so well! The writing was excellent! The mystery was great and I was intrigued the whole time, and it payed off well! It's surprisingly funny too! I think if they would have cut some of the scenes that at some points got a little slow and made it feel longer, it could have been better, but they didn't take away from the experience, and you never really feel bored either. You just want it to move forward and get back to the good stuff!",

            "content": "Easily the most entertaining Bond movie I have come across and the best after 'Casino Royale' which only beats it for its trend-breaking factor. A Bond movie is basically an action-thriller and the thriller part has been forgotten for so long until the movies with Craig started and this one complements it to the core. It got most aspects right with a good balance of dramatic elements, subtle humor (occasionally Q misfires not with the bad taste of jokes but the wrong timing), a villain to match, brilliant visuals and action sequences (I especially liked the silhouette fight in Shanghai), pulsating background score (the one with the rapid violin mixing Adele's tune and Bond's theme) and a strong climax (though the final action took forever). \n\nBond (Daniel Craig) is presumed dead when a pursue mission goes bad. He comes out of his exile when he learns about the bombing of MI6 headquarters by a former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who is planning to exact revenge on M (Judi Dench) for betraying him during his time with the agency. M is under scrutiny for the security breaches from Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and she wanted Bond so badly that she puts him on active service even though he fails all his tests. With the body count rising, Bond resorts to isolate Silva to take him on individually going against odds with little firepower and no backing from the Agency. \n\nIt is not without its flaws even with all the positive chatter for example, the bad guy getting caught intentionally has been overdone these days and the editing during some action sequences did not look studio standard and so are the numerous obvious continuity errors or goof-ups. Craig looked old and may not suit for another installment but fits the part perfectly as the story recognizes his aging. The Bond girls share too little screen time unlike its predecessors. It was a surprise for me when I heard Sam Mendes will be directing a Bond movie but he actually did a fantastic job by having a good story, developed characters but also mixes all the craziness associated with the franchise. \n\nA very well made action thriller not just for the Bond fans",

            "content": "Sumptuous and splendid, Skyfall takes James Bond in a whole new direction for his 23rd official big-screen adventure. Looking exclusively at the way the film concludes, one might think we'd gone back in time to the Bond of the 1960s, but what precedes it is very much a Sam Mendes character piece. The stakes are incredibly personal, and as such, the megalomaniacal foolishness that typically comes with the territory gets thrown out the window. It's replaced with a frightening sense of chaos and legitimate questions over characters' survival. It's a great film on so many levels, and though its highs don't quite match those in Casino Royale, it's one of 007's finest hours and arguably Mendes' strongest film to date.\n\nExcepting brief sojourns to Istanbul and Southeast Asia, Skyfall takes place entirely on the home front. MI6 is under attack, and its most effective agent is out of the picture. Presumed dead after a failed mission in Turkey, Bond (Daniel Craig) elects to lay low, stay of the grid. But his loyalty toward M (Judi Dench) draws him back into the game as she faces official inquiries over a disastrous security breach that occurred right under her nose.\n\nSkyfall is easily the least action-oriented of the Bond films; Only the pre-credits train fight stands out. Mendes has loftier things in mind, and he makes up for the lack of action with stunning character development. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were dealing with Bonds who were uncharacteristically weak, but Skyfall's Bond makes them look like Sean Connery's Bond at his most infallible.\n\nAnd it's a much different kind of weakness. Bond faces no heartbreak in Skyfall; His relationship with Naomie Harris' Eve is-excepting one extra-close \"shave\"-strictly professional. Instead, we're dealing with someone who can't adapt and isn't equipped to face the challenge at hand. He's lost a step, and though, as one character reminds him, there isn't any shame in admitting so, Bond is far too proud for that. Even more frightening, though, is the technical sophistication today's villains-as well as its heroes-are utilizing. Dismantling a government, devaluing a currency, blowing up a building-all done with the click of a mouse. And to stop enemies like this, whiz kids like Q (Ben Whishaw, relishing the opportunity) are significantly more valuable than brutes like Bond.\n\nThen, of course, there's Judi Dench's M. The Dame gives perhaps the finest supporting performance this franchise has ever seen. She facing questions about her relevancy, as well, and the evidence against her is quite damning. Men and women are being killed on her watch; In fact, the more she tries to evade Javier Bardem's Silva-a prized former agent who claims to have been betrayed by M-the more people are killed. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but she carries on the only way she can-with quiet dignity and a bulldog's tenacity.\n\nSpeaking of weaknesses, Silva doesn't seem to have any. Yes, he has a physical disability; His \"betrayal\" by M caused him to try suicide by cyanide, which failed and left him with a disfigured face. When it comes to effectiveness, however, you haven't ever seen a Bond villain like him. It's been a weakness of a series of late, but Mendes and screenwriters Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan put Silva one step ahead of MI6. What ensues has been compared a little to The Dark Knight, and it isn't hard to see why. The stakes aren't as high as they were with The Joker in Nolan's film, but the fear in the eyes of our heroes is very real.\n\nSkyfall tends to drag at times-a consequence of its lack of memorable action sequences-but even during its slower moments, you'll be completely arrested by Roger Deakins camerawork. The Shanghai and Macau sequences especially will take your breath away. Another newcomer to the series is composer Thomas Newman, who blends Bond music of old with his own original work brilliantly.\n\nIt'll be curious to see where this character goes next because this is such a monumental piece of work and it also puts a bow on all the rebooting that's taken place since Craig stepped into Bond's tuxedo. A straightforward action-adventure seems like it's in the cards, but that'd almost betray the character Craig and company have established-a character that maybe isn't your father's idea of James Bond, but one who nonetheless feels more fully formed than any previous incarnation. It's almost hard to imagine him leading the charge against some diabolical supervillain who's hellbent on world domination.\n\nBut wherever he goes, you'll want to follow. Skyfall is a sensational motion picture-exactly the kind of film big studios should be striving to make. It's powerful, but crowd pleasing. It's complicated, but exciting. It looks great, but its effects are practical. It's old-fashioned, but very much of our time. And it proves that, in his 50th year, Bond is still golden.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/skyfall-review/",

            "content": "So after the huge debacle of MGM going bust and trying to destroy every loved franchise ever, succeeding with The Hobbit sadly, James Bond returns in Skyfall, a film that is not only the strongest in Craig's time as the ravenous spy, but also the entire Bond canon. It's evident that some breathing space was needed, after the writers clearly didnt want to let go of an idea that had died by the end of Casino Royale, but decided to plod along anyway throughout the next installment. During a botched mission, Bond is left for dead and the details of undercover operatives at large. With an ever mounting pressure on the MI6, Bond soon steps into the fray, to stop a maniacal terrorist who has only one goal, destroy MI6. Skyfall has 2 cards up its sleeve, Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins, who deliver the best looking and weighty Bond, the series has ever seen. Mendes is clearly a fan, taking extra special care when crafting his mighty epic, continuing down the road of the Craig era, while trying to steer Bond in a direction of familiar territory. Luckily, he never leans to heavily on either avenue, making Skyfall matured. Mendes goes to town while casting, Craig and Dench are joined this time by Bardem, Wishaw, Fiennes, Harris, Finney and Marlohe, all of them giving effortless performances, which fit perfectly into the world of Bond, with Bardem stealing the show anytime he's on screen. Its clear everyone is enjoying themselves here and they should be, with the amount of talent behind this film. Skyfall is utterly jaw dropping to witness, visually Deakins crafts some next level work as DOP, leaving Bond looking as stunning as he should. There are a wealth of inspiring and cinematic moments stuffed in here visually, Silva's introduction as one long take it blissful to watch, a silloetted fight in a high rise is eye porn and the fire laden hills of Scotland are a marvel to behold, Deakins has always been miles ahead of the rest and finally a blockbuster film receives the care and attention money can buy. All this would be worthless if the script wasnt up to much, luckily Skyfall is as strong thematically, as it is visually, the main story arc is weighty and intriguing, with a web of intricacies crafted throughout, Skyfall also has a brilliant sub plot throughout, a sub plot that thankfully never takes away from the overall experience and is wrapped up gorgeously by the final act. The material on offer here is golden and although the ball does get dropped from time to time, its a drop in the ocean in the bigger scale of things. As mentioned, Skyfall's biggest flaw is its glaring plot holes, plot holes that luckily dont effect the overall piece, but are present enough to pull you from the experience on multiple viewings. Plot holes like, Bond stumbling across an avenue to contact Silva and randomly pursuing this avenue, while guards are aware Silva may be in trouble, however dont check a very small boat thoroughly, which is on its way to Silva's island. Or Silva hatching an escape plan, so precise that if any one of a million things had been done differently, it would have either been pointless or unsuccessful. The film travels at a wonderful pace for these to matter, however on repeat viewings, Skyfall is can be picked apart very easily. Finally, Mendes opts for CGI from time to time, during instances where a Bond film would usually go for the real macoy, Komodo Dragons anyone? These things are thankfully forgivable, when you consider the films strengths. Skyfall is a brilliant Bond movie, its action packed, visually stunning and well directed, the plot can be picked apart if you have the energy to and the inclusion of CGI animals cheapens the overall package, but considering the amount Mendes and co get right, who cares.",

What really makes the movie so enjoyable is the story of James Bond in this particular film, with a story of \"Old dog new tricks\". Daniel Craig plays this mentality perfectly, especially as struggles with the decision made by M at the beginning. While mentioning the focus on her as a plot point is brilliant, and Judi Dench shows off her incredible acting chops. The last standout performance I will mention is Javier Bardem as antagonist, truly gripping and terrifying when needed. Blending all of these characters as the main throughpoint keeps the pace on point and engaging. And to top it all of this movie is gorgeous in its presentation, making sure to emphasize the natural beauty of its locations. \n\nThe only significant flaw that I felt this time around, as well as the first, is that it runs a little long. Even though the last confrontation is vital to the story and is treated with respect it drags on, perhaps because of the longer run time by this point. I know there are some plot points that many people like to mention as silly, but I try not to ding movies too much for those things even when they are apparent like in this movie. \n\nOverall this is how you make standout in James Bond films, and in the genre period.",

You have one of the best theme songs in the series' history with Adele's Skyfall, strong female characters led by the expanded presence of Judi Dench's M, and one of the best villains with Javier Bardem's Silva.  I may like Casino Royale a little bit more, but it switches on a day to day basis.  The important thing is that Skyfall isn't just a great Bond film, it's a great film.\n\nRight from the opening pre credits sequence it's clear we are in for a ride.  It's also clear that this film will focus on M and Bond's relationship which has been so well documented in this series of films.  I love that M tells Naomie Harris as Moneypenny/Eve to take the shot even though she doesn't have a clear shot.  Then seeing her reaction and emotions unfold as she believes Bond to be dead.  It's been clear ever since Casino Royale and through his rogue adventures in Quantum that she has a fondness and a soft spot for James.  In many ways Skyfall completes the Bond origin story into the Bond we have known throughout the years to be.  This film is absolutely a deviation from the typical formulaic process to Bond though.  But trust me, it was a good change.\n\nBardem as Silva showed shades of Loki and Joker in that he's always one more step ahead of MI6.  He's also going after them instead of them going after him for most of the film, and in particular, he wants M.  I genuinely believe Silva belongs up there with the best of the Bond villains.  There's just so much emotional undertone mixed with a strange sense of humor that fits so well opposite Bond.  To go along with that, I think Skyfall is probably the most emotional Bond film to date.  There is a real sense of heart to this movie that most of the other entries don't have.  \n\nWhat's more impressive is that there is still the fantastic action that we love from the series to go along with the heart and terrific character writing.  This film is definitely not for every Bond fan, in fact I don't think hardcore fans would find this to be as good as the casual fan.  Even though I consider myself one of those hardcore fans, I can acknowledge the deviations the film took.  For one, Bond doesn't sleep with every flipping lady in the film, and two the villain doesn't have global aspirations.  But that's why the film works so well, it's so fresh and exhilarating.  Something I hope the franchise continues to be.   Wow, and that concludes my 2 month long Bond marathon in preparation for Spectre.  Here's hoping it's good!\n\n+Fantastic villain\n\n+Changed up the formula\n\n+Focused on the Bond & M relationship\n\n+Theme song\n\n+Brillaint action\n\n9.5/10",

M ordered an unqualified agent to take the shot from over a mile away to kill the bad guy because they were searching for information. When you are searching for something you aren't supposed to kill anyone but this is the dumbest M in the history of the series. Bond gets shot and falls too far into a river to possibly survive.  No one is around to pull him out or help him and Bond ends up stuck in the mud. His being stuck in the mud is a theme though out the movie.   After he comes back he it turns out that he is in fact dead. Not dead in a cool way like a zombie but dead in the sense that he is too stupid and weak to do anything useful like be an agent.  They test him of course and fails every test. It is clear that Mr. Bean could kick his ass.  Everyone at the agency said it would be better if he stayed dead and they were right.  Of course M in her unending stupidity  puts him on case against the latest bad guy. Earlier they put a bad guy in prison but he escapes because they never searched him, a new directive by M no doubt.  The bad guy sends a virus into M's computer and instead of turning it off she follows its instructions and blows up headquarters. Neither Bond nor his agency could protect their headquarters, Parliament, or Bond's family home.  The movie ends up with M killing herself out of embarrassment, Bond crawling around in the mud begging for mercy and the villain allowing himself to be killed because he could not achieve his life goal of defeating the real James Bond because Bond had already died.",

The villain is the best since Le Chiefe, and he is both menacing and entertaining to watch. The opining scene is great, with the animation being incredible and the song by Adele being absolutely enchanting. The whole film is intense and the ending left me in chills. This is one of the best spy/action films in years and is an absolute must see for James Bond fans and action/soy fans alike.",

            "content": "The 23rd installment in the James Bond franchise and the third in the Daniel Craig era is among the best spy thrillers in cinema history. Skyfall is indisputably the most successful Bond film, as the first to gross over a billion dollars, and the first to win two Academy Awards, \n\nPart of the 21st Century Bond\u00e2(TM)s signature style is preposterous chase scenes that would absolutely never happen. The third-straight installment to open with a rooftop chase scene, I would say it was getting old if it hadn\u00e2(TM)t been the best one yet. If you can look past the absurdity of driving motorcycles on top of buildings, then you\u00e2(TM)re liable to have a good time.\n\nEve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) makes her Craig-era debut in the opening sequences as a field agent helping Bond pursue Patrice, a mercenary in possession of a stolen hard drive with the identities of MI6\u00e2(TM)s undercover agents. Moneypenny is ordered to take a desperation shot at Patrice, but hits Bond, who goes off radar and is presumed dead. \n\nBond returns to London three months later following a terrorist attack on the MI6 headquarters. Continuing with the aging operative narrative hinted at in its predecessor, Bond is sloppy, inaccurate, out of shape, and unfit for duty by textbook standards. Craig wears it well, handsome as ever despite his newfound surly ruggedness. \n\nCraig's Bond has been one of the best since the very beginning, but in Skyfall he takes it to a new depth and really establishes the character as his own. The third installment in the current arc is easily the best of its series, and arguably the best Bond ever. Skyfall establishes Bond as a human being, exploring the darker places of his past, beyond the debonair walking weapon and sex icon.\n\nRaoul Silva (Javier Bardem) is your classic Bond villain. A former MI6 agent, back from the dead to seek vengeance on the agency that betrayed him. He also returns the franchise to its tradition of deformed antagonists, wearing the scars of a failed suicide from his days in captivity. Silva excels in the role of semi-psychotic genius, and you can\u00e2(TM)t help but feel empathy for his story. \n\nThis is as much a film about M as it is about 007 and Silva. Judi Dench's performance was outstanding and a worthy final chapter to her time in the Bond franchise.\n\nAs the Academy Award indicates, Adele\u00e2(TM)s \u00e2Skyfall\u00e2? is without a doubt one of the best Bond title songs ever. It was the fourth Bond song to be nominated, but the first to win. Unfortunately the title sequence is on the lesser end of Daniel Kleinman\u00e2(TM)s work. \n\nSkyfall also won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Cinematography. \n\nIt has its flaws and lapses in narrative flow, but as a whole, Skyfall blends the best of modern gritty action with some of the more memorable antiquities of the earlier Bond films, to create a tapestry of brilliant cinematography and story.",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: 'Skyfall' is not only one of the most ambitious films of the decade, but amazingly, it's also one of the most succesful. Yes what Mendes decided to do with his first Bond movie was naturally something un-conventional, and the way in which all these cogs turn to create such an incredible and interesting experience is frankly unprecedented.\n\nNow what he did so well of course was to build a set of narratives that challenge the audience to look deeper and decide for themselves where the good and bad really lies. When you do so, it's very much a film about the system and authorities, which only makes it all the more brilliant that Mendes constantly tries to get us to look beyond what we think we know to question the system - or in this case, question the Bond formula.\n\nIn other words then, Mendes is trying to teach us to question what we see, but in order for him to do that, there has to be a surface film for us to enjoy too, and Skyfall most definitely has that. Yes this film contains reams of great action sequences, beautiful cinematography from Roger Deakins, some brilliant humour and and many plot points that can be interpreted in which ever way you wish, and as a result it is a film that you can thoroughly engage with without looking too far into any of it at all.\n\nWith all that in place, Skyfall could have already been brilliantly intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable, but it's elevated even further by its emotional subplots that run through the whole film like a heartbeat; binding each side of the film together and creating something that not only makes sense with all interpretations of the story, but also emotionally engages you in it all as well. Now we know from countless experiences that it's very easy when discussing themes to forget about character and emotion, or to treat them as separate entities, but here the emotional sub-plot is very much a reaction to the themes themselves, and as a result, you can truly play them out through your head. The fact the plot is so interpretable though, also means these reactionary emotions equally make sense if you're following on top, and the way they come to their head at the end is truly heart-wrenching which ever way you look at it.\n\nIn many ways then, whilst Thomas Newman's excellent score is very much a reaction to all this, it probably serves as the most accurate embodiment of everything one can say for Skyfall. Sure, there's plenty of exciting moments on the surface, but underneath there's something rather unusual - a mysterious heartbeat that both represents a set of mysterious ideas that are only there if you look for them, or an emotional core that binds the whole film together. In other words; it's a beautiful masterpiece that does so much so well, and not only becomes the best Bond film of all time, but also one of the greatest films I've ever seen.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: With so much for it to deal with, there's bound to be some niggles with the surface plot, but frankly that's not something you care about when you're so engaged with the themes and ideas. The only complaint thereafter is that the pacing is perhaps a little fast.\n\nVERDICT: Comparing this to the other Bond films doesn't do it justice; I genuinely believe 'Skyfall' is one of the best and most ambitious movies ever made, and I absolutely, whole-heartedly adore it.",

More likely, he still preserve the old fashion way but on this one its all about James Bond and to redeem MI6's past. Still a brilliant performance from Daniel Craige and yet we to have to loose a very well beloved character (though I'm not gonna spoil it).

The new characters are really good, and the villain is a lot of fun to watch. It has some funny moments, and it has some nice touches to the past James Bond series. The fight scenes are amazing to watch, especially the end which it gets more exciting, and does the Home Alone traps which are cool to see.

Very gritty and real.Yet,with Bardem,brings back classic elements with restrain.\n\nThe introduction is fitting but Bond getting into the excavating machine planning to do who-knows-what and the bad guy just standing there shooting instead of running was goofy,as was the whole perfectly-timed train crashing on Bond scene,exposing itself as written just for the sake of a \"Bond moment\".\n\nI would have liked Bardem\u00b4s character to be just a little less flamboyant/gay,and it takes away a bit from the character just by remembering we\u00b4ve seen this before with Sean Bean in Goldeneye,but nonetheless he was great.The female agent played an interesting role,the scene where she shoots Bond being a high point in the film,but she\u00b4s not very visually compelling or powerful.I don\u00b4t remember seeing Ralph Fiennes be so brutally boring in a film.Even in The Constant Gardener,where he played a considerably boring person,he was appealing.Here it\u00b4s like he\u00b4s trying to be a boring old englishman,which the original M never was,but it certainly feels like a regression going from Judi Dench as M to boring,droll,stuffy old englishman M.\n\nJudi Dench as M is as always great,but this brings us to the mentioned flaw in the film.All of this,all the chases,explosions,intrigue,as great as it looks...is to kill M?...\n\nThat\u00b4s it?The single point of the movie is revenge?The villain is not planning to destroy or overtake the world,or even MI-6,or London.It\u00b4s all about killling 1 single person?This weakens and deflates the entire thing.SInce Casino Royale we have been treated to a more realistic,21st century depiction of Bond.This is a welcome evolution,but never before have we seen a Bond movie be so personal and irrelevant to it\u00b4s own world.James Bond always saves the world,or England, or London.Something is always in the balance,the villains he stops are always a menace to world peace,stability,economy,geo-political structure.Wether motivated by their own desire and ambition or by something else (Sean Bean, Robert Carlyle come to mind),they are a threat to millions.Javier Bardem\u00b4s Silva is a threat to 1.Sure,he places bombs and concocts dangerous plans,but it is all with a very specific target in mind.M and no one else,and this makes this Bond film,quite simply,not be a Bond film.\n\nLike with the previous 2 films,they could have woven the Quantum storyline into it,in any way,it would have been very easy.Silva funded by the organization,the plan to kill M being originally theirs and executed by him,anything.Instead they just drop it like it never existed and focus on 1 man trying to kill 1 woman.\n\nIf there was more of a background to the villain\u00b4s plans,something more than just 1 person\u00b4s life in the balance,I would give it 1/2 a star more.As impeccably old/new Bond as the film is,owing everything to the perfectly contemporary Bond of Casino Royale while going a bit further (that scene with the assassin in the building,wow),we are in fact supposed to be dealing with a James Bond movie, and this is not one.",

With explosions\ngalore and a plot also deeply explored within, you can't help feel\nafter watching why critics so loved this movie. It could be said it is\nslightly overrated but I'll get to that, It was firmly an impressive\nfilm and here below is why.\n\nThe story is big, and by that I mean epic with it's more exciting\nscenes merging well with the more dramatic scenes to create one film\nthat not only epitomises Bond but also the entire spy genre thriller.\nIt really does start to get fast toward the end and any resentment\nagainst the film for being too slow at the start need only be temporary\nas James really kicks into action and manages to also not go over the\ntop on the 50 year anniversary clich\u00e9s.\n\nDaniel Craig performs well yet again as Bond and although in Quantum\nhis performance was overshadowed by a negative reviewed film, he really\nbrings a much more dark yet emotional portrayal of Bond, far beyond\njust the cars and guns. What can I say about Javier Bardem other than\nthat man runs this film, his portrayal of Silva is one of the best\namong Bond characters and he beautifully masters the role that only\nsomeone like him can. Cast members such as Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes\nand Naomie Harris bring this movie to be one the best acted ever in the\nfranchise and all credit to the producers.\n\nSam Mendes directs well yet it can slightly seem like he does slow it\ndown just a little when it ought not to, no real complaint though as he\ndoes a great job in the end. The writers really excel here and Neil\nPurvis, Robert Wade etc do a job that is not easy, make Bond actually\nsmartly written. The cinematography and the stunts are beautifully done\nand they all really come together including the effects to make one\nmemorably looking Bond film, just adds to the excitement.\n\nMy critical eye you may think would be over my perceived slow start to\nthe movie but in truth the only criticism I can think of is slightly\nwell, silly parts. There are scenes which just don't need to be done\nand add too much extra time to the movie, I think they wanted an all\nround blockbuster but some parts make it seem like a slow moving drama\nfilm, manages to just wriggle out by the end.\n\nIf you love Bond then this won't go a miss, it stacks up completely to\nthe very best and should really please anyone who enjoys Bond or even\ndislikes Craig. I think if you are looking for action after action then\nthis probably isn't exactly for you as it just doesn't contain that and\nalthough some parts can seem slightly like that, it still has that\ndramatic edge that some movies really seem to lack.\n\nOverall I gave this a low 8/10 and firmly there as well, not quite a B+ but\nyet again still a fine movie and for me ranks right at the top near\nabouts in a Bond ranking list. Celebrate Bond and this should be looked\nback on just as we look back on Goldfinger which Is usually considered\nthe very best. I will also add that if you want to see an acting\nensemble do well then look no further than this one, just magnificent\nand a truly remarkable set of cast.",

In all fairness, the film-makers actually tried to make this one good. The plot is mildly better, and the production values are clean, crisp, and quite well-done. Most of the time, however, the film opts for gritty colours, which might be appropriate considering the film's slovenly attempt at a gritty James Bond. The performances are all right, and the main villain is something of a stand-out character, but not in a very huge way. Daniel Craig's incarnation of the James Bond character also doesn't show any sign of improvement, but then again, neither does anything else except for the production values. To be honest, this isn't a terrible movie. It's just boring, and the fact that it tries to not be mediocre makes it even worse. At the very least it was better than listening to the Skyfall song.",

This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he earlier played well in \"Casino Royale,\" not so well in \"Quantum\" -- although it may not have been entirely his fault. Or is it just that he's growing on me? I don't know what I expected. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating\"",
