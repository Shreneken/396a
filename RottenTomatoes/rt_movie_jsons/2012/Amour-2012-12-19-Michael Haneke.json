            "content": "Probably director Michael Haneke's most restrained, compassionate, and sensitive film, Amour is the story of Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva), and elderly couple, deeply in love and devoted to each other without reservation.  However, their lives change forever when Anne suffers a stroke and the couple are forced to come to terms with an unimaginable future.  As usual, Haneke directs the film with an Ozu-like sense of austerity, often using long takes and a stationary camera to tell his story.  However, as stylish as the movie may be, the primary reason for watching are the performances from Trintignanat and Riva, sensitive and heartbreaking throughout.  The film's laconic pacing may not be for all tastes, but patient viewers will find it to be a compelling story of love and commitment.",

I found myself feeling quite sorry for the husband, the situation he finds himself in. This is a bit of a sobering watch but its certainly a good watch. I'd recommend this film, yes.",

Amour confronts what happens when a longtime, co-dependent couple can no longer ignore this closing act, as Riva's Anne suffers a stroke and the slow loss of her physical independence, acting out in anger and fear at her need for care and humiliation despite the continued care from her husband, Trintignant's Georges. Their relationship's decay is not graceful or beautiful on the surface, but it does feel very human. Anne is understandably upset at her condition, being infantilized or treated as subhuman by those around her. It's the strength of the underlying bond between the pair that gives the film its heft, the willingness to continue for as long as possible (and end when necessary). It's uncomfortable and distressing, and that's what makes it great. Riva and Trintignant are both so great, feeling tender and subdued as a result of long careers in film. An unconventional love story whose bittersweet nature gives it a distinct identity. (4/5)",

            "content": "\"Love\" is a contemplative film about the tumultuous feelings of imminent death, in a simple, visceral and raw way the brilliant Austrian director Michael Haneke was cruelly perceptive in his agonizing work, a sad mirror to which we do not like the reflection.\n\nThe script for \"Amor\" is simple, what conquers the viewer are its nuances, character development and narrative choices, the feature tells the story of Anne, a lady who suffers a stroke and begins to have to deal with the consequences of a poor health, the drama over her husband, social cohesion and emotional and physical degradation are very well explored.\n\nTechnically, Michael Haneke is impeccable, with a raw direction, very framed camera, a warm palette and a magnificent composition of scenarios, the director is able to give a total background of the characters only with the details and scenarios of the apartment in which they live, that detail added to the director being able to express suspense and tension of simple moments reminds me a lot of the director Roman Polanski, Michel doesn't want to situate his viewer, we just watch parts of a story, there are several movements of the narrative that are simply not graphical, and that is well, we didn't get a chewed content, what we received is a work that at first sight was simple but then we realized how deep it is, we have an incredible subjective ending and despite the foot on the floor of the film we still have a subtle and deep touch of the divine.\n\nThe performances are another show apart, although the film has few characters, the central couple of the drama delivers a spectacular performance, with emphasis on the late Emmanuelle Riva who delivers a passionate and painful character to watch, with a performance full of details and love , and also highlight for Jean-LouisTrintignant, who delivers a sober and very powerful performance, the actor, even physically representing a feeling, manages to overflow the character's intimacy only when walking and looking, these are two classic performances.\n\n\"Love\" is not an impeccable film, its only flaw is perhaps its pace that seems to be purposefully slow, prolonging the anguish, Michael Haneke has always been a director who likes to disturb his audience, and this shock usually came from violence, but here the director reinvents himself and the discomfort comes from impotence. A great work. Grade 9.5 / 10",

            "content": "Movie done in poor taste. I have a father who had a massive stroke at 55 and I work on a stroke unit. This film makes it seem like u should just kill urself if u have a stroke, when initially her only problem was just being paralyzed-many ppl do just fine paralyzed like my dad. Then when its obvi her condition has deteriorated fast following a second stroke where she isn't alert anymore, can't talk and refusing food/drink/etc..., instead of doing the humane thing and putting her on hospice her husband suffocates her to death, bc of a promise made when she wasn't in the rite head space. This movie should've been called how to handle a stroke/elderly illness poorly versus amour. This film was obvi just an oscar grab thats another overly depressing  and slow French film w/ little knowledge behind the actual material.  It was so overly dramatic and torturous my God couldn't take it n barely could finish the film-like a nightmare version of the Notebook. The only valid point it makes is that nursing homes are in a sorry state in this country and prob others in that ppl would rather suffer at home than get proper medical care.",

            "content": "Amour opens in a way that suggests you may be about to see a police procedural film of some kind. You aren't - but there is something of that genre to this remarkable film as after the first few minutes we go back to understand the series of events that have led us to find an aged woman lying dead in her bed, surrounded by flowers. \n\nThe film is replete with lengthy shots from a stationary camera, meaning that we start to feel as if we actually live with the central character, and also to allow us to meditate on small details as opposed to simply focussing on grand gestures. The couple' life together is reshaped when the wife has a stroke and we witness the gradual deterioration of her health and her concurrent forced dependence on those around her. In showing this dependence, the film is almost unbearably sad in its portrayal of the frustrations and indignities that all (not just the one who is sick alone) experience in these situations. \n\nBut it's not just sad. It's also incredibly beautiful; these multiple times a day indignities come laced with small, almost sacramental acts of devotion and love, even as the family's relationships are stretched to near breaking point. \n\nAs we near a conclusion, the film becomes shocking and upsetting; but it has earned the right to be this by the unflinching honesty and compassion with which it has shown us all that has gone before. There will be sharp divisions in how viewers react to the last 30 minutes or so; but in showing us so much with such care, we find ourselves led to somewhere very few films manage to get to. \n\nThis is a profoundly empathetic film, one that has the rare courage to give us real insights into what ageing is and is not, a group which is so often voiceless in the world of the arts, and society as a whole. It's a film I'm glad to have seen and would encourage many to see, but we should do so aware that this is no comfy watch, one that both upsets and yet also has profound insight into love in later life. Glad as I am to have seen it, I may not see it again; but whether I rewatch it or not, it will stay with me as long as I have a memory.",

            "content": "Often hailed as one of the best films of the decade for the compassionate way in which director Michael Haneke explores the love that comes with a long marriage and the pain of growing older. I loved the film even as I was hesitant to watch it as so many people had told me it was emotionally devastating and a very hard watch. This proved to be correct as I did cry while watching the film and found it's ending cathartic but also a sad reminder of what is lost in death and the hope that is gone when the people you rely on lose their strength and vitality.\n\nRetired music teacher Anne Laurent, Emmanuelle Riva, lives in Paris with her loving husband Georges, Jean-Louis Trintignant, while their daughter Eva, Isabelle Huppert, lives abroad. Their quiet life changes when she has a stroke and has surgery that causes the right side of her body to stop functioning. Georges feels resentful as he is forced to help her perform all of her daily chores and fails to keep her happy and give her contentment in her day to day life. She tries her hardest to maintain a normal appearance in front of the people she knew before her stroke and feels that she needs to perform in front of them. One day she informs Georges that she wants to die to escape the misery she feels as she faces her condition. He is hesitant to do this as he realizes that despite his frustration at caring for her  he loves her and wants her to remain with him as he nears death. The return of their daughter brings more difficulties as she wants her mother to enter an assisted living facility but Laurent had requested that her husband take care of her so he refuses to give up on her.\n\nThe performances of Trintignant, Riva and Huppert are incredible but the film itself has the feeling of being hermetically sealed and chilly. This is typical of Haneke who enjoys shocking his audience with surprise twists that often involve violence or psychological torture. To me this whole film felt like his experiment as he wanted to lull us into believing that he was going to make a film in which he genuinely cares about his characters and feels sympathy for them before torturing them in the way that he does all of his other characters. This approach works with a film like The Piano Teacher (2001) because Erica Kohut was similar to the director and took pleasure in seeing those around her face punishment but this couple appear to be gentle and delicate so it does not make sense for them to take such a drastic action. I wanted Haneke to give up this malicious streak for once and present us with an ending that felt true to the story we had followed for two hours and not like one big joke.\n\nWhere I also felt that the film was lacking was in it's portrayal of the lives of the Laurents as they are mere sketches of characters and not fully formed characters. On the page they are thin and exist to evoke our horror but not our sympathy. It is Riva, the old stalwart who made her name in Hiroshima, Mon Amour (1959), who makes Laurent a living, breathing woman who has a zest for life before her tragic stroke and is not just Haneke's play toy. A small smile plays at her lips at many points in the film and we sense that this was a loud, passionate woman before she was confined to her bed. Then there is Trintignant who moves from suave leading man of the 1960s to elderly man struggling to retain his dignity as he watches his wife fall away from him and can do nothing to help her. He has a compassionate face and even as he is forced to commit awful acts by a poorly written screenplay he has conviction behind his faraway gaze. \n\nThe best scene in the film features one of Laurent's former students, Alexandre, Alexandre Tharaud, as he comes to visit her and is visibly shaken by seeing her in her condition. We feel the discomfort of all of the characters in this scene and for once Haneke does not seem to be cackling over all the misery as through Tharaud's eyes Laurent is somebody to pity but also somebody to respect. We see her fight back against the pain to retain her ability to speak and feel her pride as she gets through her exchange with Tharaud without breaking down. More of the empathy that Tharaud brings to the film could have been used but sadly Haneke has a short supply of this.",

Despite of having such bold moves on the chess board, none of them seems to have broken any sort of rule; the audience is never left cheated which often happens whilst leaping few turns. \n\nThe chemistry is without any doubt, some of the best that the cinema had to offer to the audience and not due to its soothing tone and sweetness involved in it but its three dimensional perspective towards each little things. \n\nThe writing is genuinely moving, emotionally manipulative and adaptive which leaves the audience in an awe of it; the metaphorical pigeon will haunt you even after the curtain drops. It is rich on technical aspects like the d.o.p., camera work and detailed production design. \n\nSmarter sound designing, alluring background score and the ingenious structure of the script are the high points of the feature. Haneke; the screenwriter-director, is in his A game where his script does meet its brilliant execution skills which is rare and exquisite. \n\nBut in the end, it's all about the act, it's all performance, and boy what an act they have staged. Riva and Trintignant are; similar to their characters, dependent on each other flaunting their behemoth talent on screen that can make viewers' eyes pop out. \n\nAmour is chillingly beautiful to the core and not for its knack of drawing out the emotions from the audience but for its loudness that it demands to be seek upon.",
