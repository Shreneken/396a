            "content": "I usually love the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, but Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is in my opinion one of his lesser works. This movie deals with so many themes – suicide, police work, obsession and some Russian literature elements are sprinkled throughout as well. But the movie ended up being too dense, structurally loose and as usual overlong. Some conversations are excellent and quite deep, but watching the movie as a whole, it failed to attach all of its diverse elements into a cohesive whole.",

            "content": "This Turkish film, as films go, is long. But when it ended I was left with the wistful \"But what comes next?\" concerning numerous characters I had come to care about. Virtually every actor in the great ensemble cast was distinctly limned with depth so that they were clearly the centers of their own dramas, and not merely bit players in the protagonist's. The film is effortlessly atmospheric, in its use of natural light and darkness, in the sounds of the wind, the cars, the birds. No special effects needed here. It reminds me of my favorite scene from Spielberg's \"Jaws,\" where Captain Quint recounts the sinking and aftermath of the battleship Indianapolis. Lit by a single, swinging, bare bulb, with listeners spellbound, eyes wide.  Much of this film has that feel.  For a movie with virtually no music, the soundtrack was nonetheless powerful and haunting. \n\nBased on only this film, director Nuri Bilge Ceylan has vaulted onto my list of great artists, and I cannot wait to see more of his work.",

This movie is very simple, about 15 men set up in 3 cars to look for a body that one of them confessed to killing. While the search goes on we're getting to know more about some of these men. It's nothing bombastic, one is fighting smoking, another has problems with family life (well, maybe more then just 1 man), someone has a weak minded brother that needs his care. It's all little things that many of us have to deal with through our life and this movie makes an astounding picture of it.\nP.s.- make sure to pay attention to the very 1st scene- when 3 men eating, the fat guy there i think gives the performance of the movie, so simple and yet so touching",

            "content": "Those who don't take much stock in the old saying \"Patience is a virtue\" will likely have a hard time with Nuri Burge Ceylan's Grand Prix-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia. The film, frankly, doesn't tell much of a story, and it takes its sweet old time not telling it. You'll feel every second of its 150-minute running time, and by the end of it, there's a good chance you'll feel like that time was wasted. But those who allow the film to simmer (I have for a few days, actually, before starting to write this out) will be rewarded. It's not the biggest, best, or most satisfying reward, but it definitely validates the whole experience.\n\nThe entire film is based around a man named Yasar, his death, and those he's left behind. We don't know much about him, but his killer-Kenan (Firat Tanis)-buried his body somewhere on the vast and desolate steppe of Anatolia and is now working with those who have him in custody to recover the body. But Kenan was drunk that night, and the area is awfully nondescript, so what should be a routine matter turns into an all-night ordeal.\n\nOn the journey with Kenan are an irascible officer (Yilmaz Erdogan's Commissar Naci), a ponderous prosecutor (Taner Birsel's Nusret), and an unassuming doctor (Muhammet Uzuner's Cemal), among others. They travel-in the dead of night, mind you-from stop to stop trying to jog Kenan's memory, and along the way, they share stories, opinions, laughs, and a few troubling on-the-job memories.\n\nOne of these memories comes from the mind of Prosecuter Nurset. He became involved in a case about a woman who accurately predicted her own death. It was ruled a heart attack, but Dr. Cemal, upon hearing the story, informs his friend that there are drugs that, taken in certain dosages, could mimic the symptoms of a heart attack. This story actually becomes essential to the way the rest of the film plays out. Ditto the relationship between the prosecutor and the doctor. The film, which has two distinct sections, uses this anecdote as a jumping off point for questioning the value of the truth. To say how would be to spoil the film's rather brilliant conclusion, but what I will say is this: Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is perhaps the subtlest morality tale you'll ever see. That subtlety is a detriment at times, but more often than not it's an asset, and it's definitely the biggest reason the film lingers with you.\n\nVisually, Ceylan is working on a level few other filmmakers working today are capable of. Though Anatolia has a majestic quality, Ceylan is more interested in capturing its less-than-desirable qualities. It's a mean, unforgiving landscape, where the air is cold, and the ground crunches mercilessly beneath one's feet. The film contains a number of clever sequences presumably meant to briefly liven things up. We watch an apple fall from a tree and, in one continuous shot, fall down a steep hill into running water. It's a lovely visual and quite ironic in the moment.\n\nUnfortunately, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia's penchant for gorgeous visuals is matched only by its potency as an Ambien alternative. Though cinematographer Gökhan Tiryaki's vision of Anatolia after dusk is spectacular (especially as it's realized here-lit only by the headlights of this caravan's vehicles). The problem, however, is that watching a film that's essentially about tired and irritated people driving around during the night's darkest hours is neither easy nor fun. This is a boring, boring movie. When the sun comes up, some interesting developments take place, but by that point, you've spent nearly 100 minutes desperately trying to keep your eyes open. It's hard to truly connect with characters under such circumstances.\n\nThe acting is fine. The screenplay (written by Ceylan, his wife Ebru, and Ercan Kesal) is sharp and incisive. And Ceylan's assuredness behind the camera is almost enough to save the film. But as much as I admired aspects of Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, I keep coming back to how bored I felt watching it. I had a harder time watching this than I did Battleship, which was indescribably terrible but was also mercifully shorter and moved much more quickly than this. Slow-moving movies aren't a bad thing (I don't want to sound like a 14-year-old; My favorite film ever is 2001: A Space Odyssey, after all), but Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, despite a few standout moments, isn't quite good enough to support its bloated running time and sluggish pace.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/once-upon-a-time-in-anatolia-review/",

(The others were Distant and Winter Sleep). This time, in the context of a perfunctory police investigation (finding the corpse after the killers have confessed to where it is), we are privileged to an on-again, off-again conversation between The Prosecutor and The Doctor that rather accidentally leads one to discover an unpleasant and personal truth.  This bit (which might be the \"point\" of the otherwise discursive script) has been adapted from Chekhov (apparently) but Ceylan takes it one step further (into the autopsy room).  Despite this glorious nugget buried at the end (or in addition to it), the film is still a beautifully shot panorama (in night colors) of the Turkish foothills with what must be a conscious nod to Kiarostami (the Wind Will Carry Us, Close-Up, others), who has a similar way of inserting thoughts in the viewer, as if by prestidigitation.  Somehow the way the film is shot (those slow zooms?) has the ability to concentrate your attention on its details (relevant or not) and this can carry viewers through the epic length.",

There are entire, !long scenes that could have been cut or shortened without losing anything vital. For example, the camera follows an apple as it rolls down a slope into a stream. Lovely, yes, but does it add to the story. Story? Did someone mention a story of some sort? What I found admirable is how the prosecutor slowly comes to realize that (spoiler alert!!!) his wife committed suicide as revenge for his infidelity. It is marvelous how this realization is brought about. The rest of the film, a police procedural, is what brings the prosecutor and the medical examiner together, and as a frame for the conversations between the two men, it is far too detailed, far too long, the point of which completely escaped me.\nIt ends because, probably, they ran out of film.",
