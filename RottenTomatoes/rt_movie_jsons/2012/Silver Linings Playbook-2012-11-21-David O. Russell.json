Russell's finest works adapted from the best selling novel even after 10 years Such a terrific cast of Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert diNiro, Chris Tucker, and Julia Stiles Cooper stars as Pat Solatano, he's jobless and divorced He winds up living with his parents and wants to rebuild his life and reunite with his wife, but his parents would be happy if he just shared their obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles Things get complicated when Pat meets Tiffany who offers to help him reconnect with his wife, if he will do something very important for her in exchange (mainly doing a dance together) Pat seems psychologically unstable being on medication which is a big burden for his folks and Tiffany seems really out of touch too with her own baggage of failed relationships Both of them of course start to butt heads with their personal issues seeing who's more royally screwed up, heck Tiffany might be just as filtered as him The film has you sympathizing and understanding how Pat came to be while also looking at the downsides of mental health like paranoid schizophrenia This man doesn't know how to function but he has a good heart and a good soul, it's hard to convince himself Russell creates characters with such depth and understanding calling them out seeing how other individuals are affected Cooper and Lawrence have amazing chemistry together and tight performances The film succeeds too revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed, injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire It's got amazing casting, fully fleshed out people, scary at times, and the dynamic between the father and son is handled very well A terrific character piece too next to a complicated love story ",

Then I read the book. Sorry to say, eh. Which is to say, Oh, what an awesome story writer/director David O. Sullivan's constructed on a sorta bare bones blueprint. The movie simmers a bit until Deniro enters the picture, then it explodes when Lawrence comes in.

            "content": "Silver Linings Playbook, a romantic movie about Pat, played by Bradley Cooper. After he almost beat the lover of his wife to death because of his bipolar disorder, he got sent to a psychiatric institution where he was hospitalised for eight months. His mother got him released, and he returned to his parents' house. Throughout the movie, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who's also mentally ill, and who's ready to help him win back his wife. \n\nThis movie was a perfect way to shed light to the love life of people with mental disorders without feeling sorry for them. A lot of movies about those kinds of people are made in a way that it feels like you're watching a pitiful animal. The director of this movie did a great job by making it a comedy/romcom. Most of the conversations are filled with humor, so you're far from bored watching this. \n\nEven though it's a comedy, it's a little too unrealistic. Almost every single person in Pat's entourage has some kind of mental issue, but it's just not mentioned. They behave in a very strange way, but only Tiffany and Pat are seen as mentally ill. The director should've made some of the characters \"normal\". That way, the movie would've been more realistic.  \n\nMusic plays an import role in this movie. The songs that are being used have a meaning. \"My Ch\u00e9rie Amour\" from Stevie Wonder is played multiple times throughout the movie. The iPod scenes, the fact that he's triggered every time he hears a specific song, the matching background music ... It's impressive to see how the makers of the movie really paid attention to the music. \n\nThe name of the movie itself, Silver Linings, has a special meaning. It means that there is always a bright side, even when things are going bad. The ending of the movie confirmed this, so the title is really thought out. \n\nBradley Cooper's performance was excellent. In real life, he's not bipolar or socially awkward. He still made it seem more than real, unlike some other movies. The movie is encouraging for people who also suffer from mental disorders. Jennifer Lawrence acted a little bit too dramatic in some scenes, like when Pat walked her home for the first time. \n\nIn general, this movie is a good one. The actors act well and the storyline is funny but sometimes a little too predictable. I'd definitely give Silver Linings Playbook a 7,5/10.",

But this movie makes a mockery of it. And it's no way funny enough to get away with it.  It could have been great, if it had been written and directed differently! The premise is potentially interesting. It even descends into a make or break dance competition at the end. Yep, that's the kind of idiotic movie this is. 2 star is almost worse than one star. 1 stars you turn off. 2 stars you get to the end and feel a bit gross about it.

The actors Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro in the movie are shown as the people with mental disorders. They play their roles so well, that you are starting to feel like If they are living their characters, and at some point, you even forget that they are actors. I feel like that is what the director wanted to make everyone feel: like if they are watching a real life story. The movie keeps the viewer at suspense all the time. As we see how Pat is always in conflict with nearly everybody in the movie, as he cannot live through his trauma of his wife, Nikki, cheating on him. We see how he falls in love with Tiffany but fails to except that he does. And this is exactly what the director wants. He wants for the viewer to basically cheer for Pat, to understand his feelings and what he is going through. The characters in the movie are described so well, that even the side characters make you want to adore them. Director also adds a conflict between Pat's communication with his father and Tiffany, as they hate each other basically. And the viewer really wants to know how it will end and whom will Pat choose. As well as the final scene conflict, where the suspense on who will Pat choose is so huge, I myself felt I couldn't handle it, as at this point the ending was unpredictable, and the ending that was given in the end, is what I think, is a true masterpiece. It made me feel joy and happiness, as well as a little bit loneliness. However, the thing that makes the movie so relatable towards the viewer is the love factor. Both Tiffany and Pat have gone through some sort of conflict that lead them to who they are, but they have succeeded In not falling apart, they helped each other and started new lives by being together. The idea that the director is trying to tell is that if you loose your loved one, even if you are going to be lost and stressed, you don't have to give up on life, as there is always someone that will be with you and will support you. In the movie, these characters are Pat's father, Danny, Tiffany, and Ronny, as they support Pat despite his disorder.\nThis movie is an absolute must watch because of Jennifer Lawrence's and Bradley Cooper's performance, as well because of an emotional roller coaster this picture makes you live through.",

While that is intriguing from a psychological perspective, I found it to be more sad than fun, which does make it powerful and worthy of awards and your attention, but it's not a movie that I'm going to re-watch lovingly.\n\nThe writing is excellent: well structured and has good content, with an odd message that it is okay to lie to people when it is in their best interest so that you can get them to a potential to better themselves even if choose not too, and that is what love is.\n\nThe movie also focuses a fair bit on proper etiquette of social interactions, football, and dancing: none of which I'm particularly fond of watching.\n\nSo while there isn't a lot for me in this, objectively, I do believe that a lot of people will like this and it is well worth a watch.",

This was actually my first viewing of Silver Linings Playbook, and while it was definitely an enjoyable and entertaining movie, it didn't have the staying power I had anticipated from all of the hype. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) and Pat's (Bradley Cooper) meet-cute was hilarious. Is that really the etymology of \"OK\"? (Wikipedia says: Maybe?) And I loved Chris Tucker's recurring character, Danny, somehow always finding ways, both practical and legal, to escape the mental health institution. Why isn't Chris Tucker in more things? He was such a breath of fresh air. This was his first film since Rush Hour 3 (2007) and has only done one movie since?! Of course, it wouldn't be a Philly movie without a bunch of Eagles fans fighting, however, I did expect them to fight the other team's fans and not each other \u2014 who are they, the Oakland Raiders?? I loved that Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) was there for Pat Sr.'s (Robert De Niro) breakdown, as all he would likely have to do professionally is say: \"It's that.\" Kher also delivers one of the best lines, \"DeSean Jackson is the man.\" Which is a fact. I liked that they explained the concept of a \"parlay,\" even though I've since learned by listening to the podcast, Pardon My Take. The confession of loveologue (a term I coined rating When Harry Met Sally\u2026, check it) was short and sweet.",

This American romantic comedy-drama movie may be one of my favorites. Even though I normally don't like romantic movies, because they (almost) always have the same endings. A happily ever after. But starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, who were perfect for their roles, made a really good movie out of it. I have to say that I didn't expect it to be such a great movie.\nThe film begins with Patrizio Solitano (Bradley Cooper) getting discharged from the mental health facility, showing how he wants to call the tune to get back on track with his wife, reveals a lot of emotions. Once he got home, the change started. Nothing could stop him anymore and he tried a lot. The only thing that was keeping him away from her was a restraining order. But that, he fixed. Through that, he met Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who he will fall in love with. It's kind of predictive.\nApart from the fact that I liked the storyline, the actors made a quite satisfying outcome with the movie. Every expression, every feeling, every thought. You could feel them all, even if you didn't want to. It was extremely overwhelming and could really mess you up sometimes. In my opinion, there is no way that other actors could have done it better than them (for this movie). I could actually sympathize with what they were going through in the movie. It was breathtaking.\nUnlike many other movies, the songs that were played in Silver Linings Playbook surely did match with the scenes. The music made your feelings combine with the characters. It was like they were fusing together as one. Not every movie has the same well-chosen soundtracks like this one. Another bonus.\nThe one thing that I LOVED about this movie, is the fact that the two people who were supposed to be together, didn't start off like two peas in a pod. Sure, they both always said their thoughts out loud and they were always very direct to others. But they came to blows a lot. I can't even remember one nice thing they did for each other out of their own will. This is a lovely way to separate this movie from the other stereotypical romantic movies. \nHowever, the end was a little bit disappointing for me though. It kind of just downgraded the movie a little bit. Not that it ruined the whole movie or something like that. I just expected a little bit more because the rest of the movie was incredible. I'm sure you all know how this movie will end. I don't even have to spoil it anymore.\nDespite the fact that the end was maybe too predictive and poor, I feasted my eyes on this movie. The actors made the best out of it and I'm pretty sure the director and the producers did their utmost. Not a chance that this movie could compare to the other stereotypical ones. I can say that I am highly satisfied with the 122 minutes of screenplay. If you're someone who pays attention to the little details of a movie, then I would definitely recommend you this movie. Because that's another thing that made this movie ameliorated.",
