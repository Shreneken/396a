    "summary": "On Nov. 4, 1979, militants storm the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran, taking 66 American hostages. Amid the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge with the Canadian ambassador. Knowing that it's just a matter of time before the refugees are found and likely executed, the U.S. government calls on extractor Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to rescue them. Mendez's plan is to pose as a Hollywood producer scouting locations in Iran and train the refugees to act as his \"film\" crew.",

            "content": "An exfiltration specialist masquerades as a Hollywood producer in order to rescue six Americans who are held captive in Tehran during the US hostage crisis in Iran.\n\nArgo is the best picture winner of 2013 and I was definitely not dissapointed by it. Argo follows an incredible story based on true events, which all take place in Iran. I thought that the best thing of this movie, was the editing and for that reason, I think that the editing win at the Oscars is a much deserving win. Ben Affleck directed and starred in the movie and I thought he did an excellent job at both, definitely not the most impactfull performance ever, however it did the job. Some of the tension Argo builds is just incredible, however in there lies its weakness as well. Basing Argo on a true story, with especially the 3rd act, felt a bit overdone, however I cant deny that I was at the edge of my seat, however in reality it must have been close with all the airport checkpoints, but the police on the runway was a bit overdone if you want to keep it realistic. The opening scene is so suspenceful, you immediately know what type of movie you are going to watch. Its like the perfect movie for the Academy awards, telling a true story, with Hollywood elements and having the United States as the hero of the movie, still it didnt bother me as much, as some other people probaly will, solid best picture winner!",

However this was a very well-made movie by Mr. Affleck and he acted very impressively in it as well. I liked the beginning sequence and how the camera shots went back and forth between the actual film being done and on the other hand old authentic-looking footage that made it look convincing for the time it was set in with the 1979 camera-quality. I was thoroughly captivated and was given a fascinating history lesson and I give it a thumb up!",

I don't know how much of it is accurate, but the whole situation is rather unagreeable and the slight stench of a farce is upon the whole movie. However, it is entertaining and has good moments. I do like that it's historical theme, as it's interesting. Probably would have been much better if they had just changed the whole event to make a better story, and maybe while even keeping a good deal of historical accuracy. Alas, it doesn't really try to do this, though it does try to make the film entertaining with some historical inaccuracies.",

There is much drama in how they assumed to be somebody else, i.e. as members of the filmmakers' team producing a fake sci-fi, Star Wars-inspired Argo. \n\nArgo is a fake movie\u2014a foil which Tony Mendez needed to convince Iranian authorities that the consulate staff who escaped are part of the production for a sci-fi movie. An action thriller itself, Argo was concerned more on the action of rescuing the hiding statesmen and escort them back to the States.\n\nIn the movie's climax, the Iranian airport police, despite their vigilance and stone-faced authority, still fell prey to the foil that Mendez invented\u2014Argo's  Star Wars charisma did not fail to lure authorities away from identifying the diplomats, thus serving Mendes' best intentions, as originally planned.\n\nAlthough the Iranians were duped by the pop culture prevalent everywhere in the world, it is admirable how the world of movies served a purpose which should serve man\u2014who himself created the movies.\n\nOf course, Argo the movie within the movie is able to save the diplomats, even as Argo the bigger movie has established thrills in the cat-mouse chase which heightened the tension in the film.\n\nThough the film is said to have made alterations from the real turn of events\u2014 especially for minimizing the role that the Canadian embassy played in the rescue, among others\u2014Argo succeeds in bringing the audience to a heightened sense of thrill, which deserves a round of applause.",

The acting all around was great and extremely convincing. The story felt very unique and unbelievable, with a powerful narrative throughout. There were also many moments of suspense that do a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat. The cast is also perfect, with some big and small names appearing and doing a fantastic job. The historical accuracy of the film is shaky, but that's to be expected from Hollywood these days. Overall, I really loved \"Argo\" and would definitely recommend it.",

And they milk it for all its worth, highlighting the silliness of the Hollywood biz and broaching the fraught international politics of the time all at once. I will say that Mendez' family background (while true obviously) felt like a mandatory story beat to bring in some emotion; I didn't really care for that all. I was much more interested in them figuring out and executing the fake movie plan. I also wish there were greater character dynamics between the Houseguests; we only really get Kathy & husband's story, but not much else about them. I cared for them getting out, of course, but it wasn't out of genuine connection to them as individual human beings but on the principle of them being people being in a situation like that. For a movie, that does dampen things. And the tension-building in some areas (the final chase onto the runway) stumbled for me, maybe because we didn't get a good enough sense of the geography to know how almost-screwed they really were. It was them on the plane not knowing that they're getting pursued until that final moment they look out the window, so they weren't really feeling the tension we were (supposed to be) feeling in that moment. Kinda undercut it. But overall, I loved getting to see this play out, and much of the performances and dialogue were a blast to take in.",

Nevertheless, the best contribution to this film is perhaps the brilliant work of the scenic-, costume-, hair and makeup departments, which makes us believe in a story full of famous actors.

Ben Affleck's direction in particular was superb in my eyes, as well as his performance as Tony Mendez. The supporting cast more than played their part, but Alan Arkin and Bryan Cranston were standouts for me because of the intensity that Cranston brought and the humour that Arkin brought. Both tremendous actors. Yes, the historical inaccuracies halt this film being perfect, but I had a fantastic time watching Argo and 2012 was the year I really started getting into film, so Argo certainly holds a special place in my heart.

The fact that Affleck is able to create the level of suspense that is achieved is remarkable when one considers that the outcome is already known to those familiar with the story.

Agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) hires makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), and a cast of actors to shoot a fake science fiction movie \u2018Argo' in Iran. As realistic as Argo, the main movie, intends to be and despite Affleck's attention to 1970's detail, it plays like a mixture of The Fugitive and an episode of 24. Then again, that's Hollywood's depiction of Mendez's mission, one that focuses on the main man and the \"Canadian\" rescuees. Speaking of, I know this is an American movie for an American audience, but Argo barely gives the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) any credit as in reality Taylor was the main lead behind the mission and the CIA partnered with him. To add more to the inaccuracies, according to Mark Lijek, one of the victims in the rescue, very few Revolutionary Guards were occupied when he and the others left Iran at dawn. However, Argo knows it's pure fiction and it knows that the events on film are altered for dramatic effect. Even its tagline, \"The movie was fake. The mission was real,\" suggests a literal metafictional notion to the audience. Like Braveheart, a film based on a historical account has to take artistic licensing that way a specific audience will enjoy it and the experience in the celluloid environment within will emotionally grab them. Even so, I will prefer Ben Affleck's history over Mel Gibson's history. \n\n(3 \u00bd Star Wars Figurines out of 5)",

The faking of making a movie to free Americans from Iran sounds a paper to be a very silly idea, but the way they create everything and make everything believable is well done. Its based on a true story and  you can see elements have been exaggerated and changed to make the film more entertaining. The dramatic scenes at the airport makes you nervous, will they escape knowing they are one false move away from failing. The film is reliant on a great script which allows all the actors to shine, including Affleck who is mightly effective. There are frightening moments, as the American embassy is invaded and we see only a free escaping. The hostage situation is history very real now and showing what can easily happen tomorrow. Goodman and Arkin are extremely funny as they become the link to the film back in America. They are the humour as we witness the plan in Iran as they try to engineer a safe escape. From each member in Iran having fake roles in the movie from director to locations. The scenes in Iran are very well done and its very believable with the time the film is set. I was entertained and nervous throughout. A very good movie that showcases the talent of Affleck and i am looking forward to seeing more films directed from him.",

Tension was well built, situations were believable, and the humor was well-placed and a welcome addition to the film. But soon enough, much like the titular joke of the film (Argo-f*** yourself), the movie became tedious and repetitive. The final sequence at the airport was a masterclass in how to overdo cliches and force tension where it did not need to be. The constant 'last-second' saves during the 'tense' airport scene were remarkably cliche and done to the point of boredom. I was just waiting for the next scene rife with frantic camera work and overacting instead of the heart-pounding effect the director and screenwriters intended. The humor in these tense scenes was completely misplaced and removes the viewer from the immersion of the scene instantaneously. The ending was also overly sappy and way too patriotic for my liking. Though the film did speak of some of the horrible truths of the US Government's involvement in Iran and the Middle East, it mostly glossed over them in an opening narrative and never touched upon them again. I felt the movie's cliches and poorly timed humor really undermined the fun and creative premise it offered for a thriller. Just watch a movie like Parasite to see how thrilling moments can be naturally produced without the 'last second' saves at every turn. What an overrated and over-hyped film that completely wasted a great premise and first half of a film.",

The shots and the sound design invite us to frame ourselves risking our lives in such a situation, overwhelmed by the intensity of it all. For me, the scene where they walk in the bazaar in particular is such an amazing example of film-making that kept me anxious every single step of the way. This tension is also thanks to a brilliant ensemble (in particular Clea Duvall and not Alan Arkin who's Oscar nomination I do not at all understand) and a score that perfectly complements its film. What really bothered me though, was that scene where some Iranian revolutionaries chased down the plane as it took off. I mean you're welcome to twist the original story, but was that really necessary (not to mention the horrible visual effects that went into that scene)? This, and other scenes depicting the Iranians, paint Iranians as undeservedly evil, to an extent. Especially after having learnt about Iranian history both before and after the revolution, (shoutout to my English teacher Ms Abdes!) I could tell that the movie in (very) few scenes was trying to get us to sympathize with the Iranian's cause. For the rest it, we only see the \"American\" perspective, demonizing them as if they were violent and uncivilized. Truly a shame that Ben Affleck had to take that route in framing this story. Being quite honest, I'm not quite sure how he could do it otherwise though. Either way though, for this to win Best Picture? That's a little beyond me.",

            "content": "They really, really made a mess of it here. They rewarded a film that would have been seen as middling fare in the late 1970s with far more tense fare like Midnight Express (1978) and Escape from Alcatraz (1979) being both critical and commercial successes. This stolid Ben Affleck vehicle featuring questionable racial politics managed to triumph over the likes of Silver Linings Playbook (2012). The popularity of Affleck has always mystified me, yes I like Good Will Hunting (1997) but he has only a small role in it, where other better actors turned directors exist like Ed Harris he was somehow the one who got rewarded. This is at best forgettable and at worst one of the weaker Best Picture winners to come out of the otherwise varied and interesting 2010s. \n\nTony Mendez, Ben Affleck, is a reluctant hero who is sent in to rescue several hostages from Tehran as the political conflict between nations heats up. His big plan is to pretend that they are all members of the production crew for a Hollywood science fiction film called Argo. With the help of Alan Arkin's publicity mogul he is able to get the ruse underway and despite minor regrets about being separated from his family he's a mostly uncomplicated hero. When he reaches Tehran he encounters more problems than he expected and as the hostages, Bill Hader among them, bicker it is up to Mendez to transport them safely out of the country.\n\nThe central problem with the film is weak characterization as Mendez gets the Pocahontas treatment and is personality-less and hyper capable removing all tension from the scenes in which they are clearing making near escapes. We get some backstory with his family problems but these are reduced to shots of his cherubic son and pretty blonde wife speaking softly to him through the phone whilst Affleck\u00ef\u00bf 1/2doesn't emote. It's hard to care about Mendez's plight when it seems like it's no big to deal to him and he'll be able to extract these people easy peasy. Arkin plays the same character he always plays but he was much better used in Little Miss Sunshine (2006) and his shtick quickly wears thin here as the line \"Argo fuck yourself\" annoyed more than amused me. The hostages have very little personality and other than \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~the guy who is always disagreeing with everyone' they are hard to care about.\n\nThe escape sequence is choreographed very well but it's not on the level of a classic suspense thriller and it hardly warrants calling it the best film of the year. I found very little to be interested in the film and that's why I wasn't gripping the sheets as I watched the watched the climactic scene in the film, I didn't care about anybody on board that plane. Affleck's major fault is giving us very little to care about and balancing that with a self-serious tone and too little action, not a complaint I make often. The film makes attempts at being a comedy but it's comedic elements are more often irksome or cringe worthy than laugh out loud hilarious. Gestures at political commentary are also made as we see the encroachment of American culture on foreign countries as two elderly Iranian women eat chicken out of KFC buckets. This is too thin to really be meaningful and it seemed out of place in a film that was glib in it's treatment of the cultural divide between America and Iran for most of the film.\n\nThere are many, many reasons why this wasn't the best film of the year let alone a particularly good film but in the end it's a solid action flick with one very well choreographed sequence that it squeaks by on. I would have given the statuette to Silver Linings Playbook (2012) but I understand that's not a universally well-liked film as there is a large contingency of people who dislike it's treatment of mental health and think it is overrated. Nevertheless I think it would be a decent choice in a year that hasn't produced any classics, come at me if you love The Master (2012), at least it was well-written, acted and extremely entertaining.",

Such is the environment at the time.\nI didn't like how the British embassy involvement was airbrushed from the film.\nAnyway a military rescue by special forces is at fitst ruled out leaving CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to explore other options for evacuation.\nA series of bad ideas is mooted including setting up a fake Canadian science fiction film production using Iran as a location to cover the moon. (Why!)\nMendez actually travels to Iran to rendevous with the six escapees in the Canadian ambassadors house with cooperation from the Canadians and a set of fake Canadian passports to hand to set up the production, Argo as in the title.\nArgo is some fake, rejected Flash Gordon like project.\nThe six eventually come round to the highly dangerous idea and evacuate the country on a commercial flight in a game of cat and mouse at the airport.\nThe film is true and entertaining and I had never heard of the operation, only being revealed under the President Clinton administration years later it is displayed on screen.\nAn average film, but nothing special.

But just in case you are in fact without a pulse, Argo is just what you need to jump start your heart.  Based on the true story of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis where 52 Americans were held captive for 444 days, Argo might be a tad more exciting than the actual escape, but for that I will easily forgive Affleck.\n\nFirst of all, this story line is something to behold. If I hadn't known it was based on a true story, I would have seriously suspected it. Not even Hollywood could have thought this one up. And what about the CIA? Did they really allow their operatives to travel to Iran under the cover of a fake film crew? Yes...yes, they did. CIA extractor Tony Mendez, played by a stellar Affleck, leads a crew into transforming into entirely new people. This not only means memorizing new names, but just about every other facet of a made up life. Just as if they were actually preparing for an acting role. One slip up and they will be executed. Period. This is where the tension starts, but it is far from over.\n\nFunny how even a true story, one in which you know how it turns out, can keep you glued to the screen. Argo does just that. You will become enthralled as you watch them actually convince, not just Iran, but the U.S. that they are making a movie called Argo. The movie is supposed to be a B rated sci-fi flick. If they only knew.\n\nThere is plenty of comic relief throughout. Most notably centered around John Chambers, played by John Goodman. Also, Lester Siegal, played by Alan Arkin, provides a few of his own one liners.\n\nFrom it's real life footage opening to it's harrowing climax, Argo is almost as unbelievably well put together as the story it is depicting. Should you see it? Yes...but first grab some friends so you can argo see it.\n\nSee what I did there? Should have quit while I was ahead.",

Hats off to Ben Affleck, whom I've always felt was an untalented hack, for maturing into a superb director. He also stars brilliantly as the main character.

It's very well written with lot's of detail which recreates this historical event with vivid attention. The direction from Ben Affleck captures every part of this incredible story that's needed to see and he also gives a great performance in the lead role. The performances from the supporting actors Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and John Goodman are all great as well. The film is incredibly tense, exciting and downright suspenseful which is exactly what a lot of audiences will enjoy.",

Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.\n\nThe film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way.\n\nDirector Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination.

This time, he pulled out all the stops and as a result 'Argo' is one of the most inventively put together and well directed films of 2012 (and that's saying something by the way). He really grips you through each creative montage and scene change; it actually feels like the events are unfolding before your very eyes at points, and this journey is often aided by the contrasting performances and tones that the movie straddles. Somehow it's incredibly engaging and exciting, whilst also scarcastically mocking and entertaining at times...\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: As I said, manier contrast this film doth straddle - and whilst it mostly gels, it occasionaly doesn't. I feel the tonal confusion that this creates is mainly apparent in the lengthly set-up, but at least it's diminished by the end.\nVERDICT: What's most apparent is just how well-made Argo is, but that doesn't stop you from properly engaging and having a great time with it.

I remember back at the awards season of 2012, Argo was the film to beat and I never managed to watch it. Having finally now watched this, I can tell you that this was a tense thriller! With Affleck starring and directing, you can tell he was giving his all and he was superb. The supporting cast were also excellent especially veterans Arkin and Cranston. The direction was exciting with crafty camera shots, good editing and a variety of different styles being used, definitely worthy of the Academy Award for Best Director. The introduction was informative, setting up the Iranian revolution and the current state of play in Iran. It did however take a while for the film to get going but once in full motion, the tension just kept building. Overall, a tense thriller based on true events that were only recently detailed but does take a while for the film to get going.\n\nReviewed by: www.themoviediorama.com",

Yes indeed 6 ambassadors escaped the raid and torture of Iranians in 1979, only to realize that their sole hope to escape is to follow US exhilaration specialist Tony Mendez's instructions to act as a Canadian filming crew visiting Iran to find appropriate film locations for a fake sci-fi movie called \"Argo\", which is in the style of Star Wars lol. As ludicrous the plan sounds, as serious  people during the time treated this operation. They set up fake production company offices and namecards, fake movie boards and posters, phony production meeting and even phony advertisements on magazines and newspaper so to publicize this made-up film. The wikipedia page of Canadian Caper contains detailed story of the event while not dramatising it, for the real event itself wasn't really that dramatic and wouldn't make a good movie. However in Argo (2012), Ben Affleck did a good job in retelling the event as a thriller and providing a climax of serious tensions that is a true testament to the abilities of cinema in recounting history and publicizing it.\nThe cast is decent. In the end credits photographs showing ID cards of the  6 US ambassadors involved in the real Canadian Caper were displayed alongside images of their respective actors of this film, and I was marvelling at how close they resemble each other. Ben Affleck is average. He didn't do much to catch my attention or steal the show, and sometimes there was just that dull face occupying the screen. There could be better acting choices but still, thumbs up to him for doing the directorial and production work.\n\nIn some ways Argo is drawn back by its real life adaption, for the first hour was all about background building and setting up for the climax and having little drama and plot. Still the atmosphere is tense and as the climax happened - as the ambassadors followed Mendez through the airport security, Iranians shot glances and the process was interrupted, that was when the filming skills kick off and it made me clutching the edge of the seat. Despite this isn't the movies that shall interest me and others of my age, the thrills and intrigue were real and I felt it, and at the end of the day it was not bad - a easy to understand plot faithful to real life happenings and with big time theme like national responsibility and cross regional conflicts.",

            "content": "\"Argo\" perfectly tells the story of War and Drama. Set in the late 70's early 80's the plot to \"Argo\" is that six Americans that are being held in \"Iran\" and a man named \"Tony Mendez\" portrayed by \"Ben Affleck\" who works for the C.I.A. has an elaborate scheme to make a \"fake\" movie so he can travel to Iran and rescue the six Americans. The opening scene to \"Argo\" shows Iran's downfall and the people's rage being taken out on the \"United States\". The scene is edited to show the real event and the movie, which is edited well. For the most of the movie it shows \"Tony Mendez\" working to make sure that his movie \"Argo\" will allow him to enter and exit Iran. These scenes are interesting and sometimes humorous to watch. When watching these scenes the audience learns more about what type of person \"Tony Mendez\" really is. The climax of the film is very intense  \"Mendez\" and his crew is constantly getting interfered with their plans. One thing that is an issue is \"Mendez's\" son and wife, they aren't really fleshed out as well as they should've been. \"Ben Affleck\" gives an amazing performance as \"Tony Mendez\" and truly deserved to win all of its awards. \"Alexandre Desplat\" does a stunning job at creating sad, dramatic and a suspenseful music score. \"Argo\" for the first hour and a half is filmed exceptionally, but the last half an hour the cameraman uses unnecessary crash zooms, close ups and shaking the camera. If you are a person who enjoys some of \"Ben Affleck's\" films then I highly recommend you watch \"Argo\" as it has amazing acting, a terrific score and a stunning climax. Although the movie is not perfect and does have some issues, these being the last half an hour having close ups and crash zooms and some characters not being fleshed out. I give 2012's \"Argo\" a 9/10.",

The story is based on true events but is so interesting that you wouldn't think it, the performances are great thanks to the film's cast being so superbly well-matched to their characters, the film is slick, stylish, and on point, and it's just the right length for what it offers. \n\nA job very well done. I will say that it did lack the 'wow' factor a little for me (I accept that this is a pointlessly-vague criticism though) as, whilst it was a great watch, I'm reluctant to add it to the list of my favourite films anytime soon. I don't think that's what 'Argo' is really going for anyway though- it simply wants to tell a story, a story that actually happened. In that sense, it is a perfect film.",

Hostage rescue from a hostile territory with no macho action or physical daredevilry requires some smart writing and believable performances which are a plenty as do the period and location attention to detail. Some aspects do look highly dramatized and fictitious especially the last step where the rescue happens just in the nick of time from the Iranian republican guard or intelligence. The dark humor is hilarious at times and background score is superb when required. It is a well made entertaining movie but may not be of Oscar winning worth. Ben Affleck has come a long way surpassing expectation and building a solid reputation for himself as a director with each venture, this time he has done one better by coming out of his comfortable Boston setup. \n\nLoosely based on the rescue and exfil operation of 6 American diplomats who were taking refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the midst of the Iranian Islamic revolution. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) proposes a preposterous plan to CIA to rescue the six American diplomats. It was so farcical that they all believed no one would suspect it and it worked. The basic plan is to setup a fake production of a middle-eastern themed science fiction movie titled 'Argo', pose the diplomats as location scouting crew and get them out. The operation is planned to the T with the help of his trusting superior Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) and ably supported by his Hollywood acquaintances Lester (Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (John Goodman). \n\nTalking of humor I just couldn't control myself laughing for no reason in John Goodman's introduction scene without him even saying a word. Bryan Cranston fits the role perfectly with a new look since the only other role I have seen him and so often is his egotistic manipulative Mr. Hiesenberg. The Hollywood script reading exercise could have been a little toned down, CIA hierarchy and method of general operations felt too generic. In some parts, the urgency and dramatization felt a little forced to elevate the thriller element. Ben Affleck thankfully was superb with no special histrionics and brings a sense of calm which was so required. The actors who play the diplomats were well chosen and bring in their best at the right moments. Last but not the least is the high attention to detail in regards to the gadgets, clothing, sets and location of the period bringing in a highly authentic feel to it. People playing the Iranian guard were also very intense and believable. \n\nDarkly funny, toned down performances and attention to detail makes this a winner.",

            "content": "Ben Affleck's Argo will make you rethink how much you complain about going through customs at the airport. It seems unfathomable that such a typically mundane and slow-moving event could lead to the tensest bit of American filmmaking so far this year, but that's what Affleck does with this, his third film.\n\nOf course, his film does a lot more than just depict people going through customs. Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Affleck's freshman and sophomore directorial efforts, each captured a South Boston with real personality. Neither personality was particularly pleasant, but they added to the atmosphere within those respective films in really interesting ways. His ability to use his surroundings to add to a film's atmosphere has only improved with the move to the Tehran of 1979 and 1980. It's a frightening place that gives a much needed layer of emotion to this superficially cold story and its thinly drawn characters. Yes, Argo has some small flaws, but they're barely worth mentioning when the final product satisfies so thoroughly.\n\nArgo opens with a quick retelling of the events leading up to the Iranian Revolution of 1979, including the overthrow of the shah (a puppet of the West) and the ascent to power of Ayatollah Khomeini. President Carter grants the shah asylum in the United States, and hoards of angry Iranian citizens rush the American embassy, taking its workers hostage until they can try and punish their former leader for his alleged crimes.\n\nDuring the raid and its ensuing chaos, six embassies workers manage to escape and are holed up at the residence of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). CIA and state officials back in America are stumped about how to get these individuals out, as their presence is putting Taylor and his wife at risk. One man proposes they bike 300 miles to Turkey, but extraction specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) knows that plan is shit.\n\nHe proposes a plan so outrageous that a colleague (Bryan Cranston) calls it the \"best bad idea we have.\" Mendez will set up a fake movie studio. He involves two Hollywood hotshots (Alan Arkin and John Goodman) to start production on \"Argo\"-a science-fiction fantasy adventure. Mendez will enter Iran under the guise of a location scout. He'll carry fake Canadian passports for his six marks, and they'll try to escape together-a task that's much easier said than done when thousands upon thousands of Iranians are armed and ferocious in their hunt for Americans.\n\nThe film grabs you straight away with the siege of the embassy, which is at first slow before exploding into something that'll almost overwhelm you, especially when one considers recent current events. The American flag is burned. Innocent men and women are blindfolded at gunpoint. And one man and his wife make a stunning sacrifice for six strangers. Affleck lets these events unfold slowly and with minimal stylistic intrusion.\n\nWhen Argo shifts back to America-Washington and Hollywood, specifically-it becomes quite funny. Arkin and Goodman, in particular, are outstanding and give birth to one of the best catch phrases of any movie in a long time. By the time Mendez gets to Iran, Argo starts to feel a little long in the tooth, but its conclusion is a thing of beauty. The editing and the score maximize tension brilliantly, but it's because we ultimately grow to care about these characters-characters we know so little about personally-that the intensity of their plight is palpable. It's slight of hand few directors could pull off this well, but Affleck has grown into one of the most reliable and talented American filmmakers working today, which seems simply unbelievable but is almost undeniable at this point in his career.\n\nHe's grown as an actor, as well, and though his character could have been some kind of James Bond-esque superhero, Affleck goes low-key with him. It's a smart choice, as the story itself can get the unofficial first billing instead. Cranston, meanwhile, has a nice role that might not earn him an Oscar nomination (the most likely in the bunch is Arkin), but his screen credits are starting to match his incredible television resume.\n\nArgo doesn't stretch the bounds of cinema at all, but it's a masterclass in how to tell a story. It helps that the story Affleck is trying to tell is this grand, almost surreal tall tale of bravery and patriotism. It's dense and ambitious, and its director's steady hand leads to some unexpectedly emotional moments. Argo is being positioned as a big awards play come the end of the year, and it's not hard to see why. It's a old-fashioned, winning film that's greater than the sum of all its parts.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/argo-review/",

Although critically acclaimed, his directorial debut left a lot to be desired, brimming with a quality cast but sadly not brimming with excellent execution. So for his next attempt, Argo, raises the bar in an attempt to provide a much more thrilling and provocative piece of film making, and although his does hit some excellent notes, it ultimately becomes just another thriller, very quickly. Based on a true story, Argo is set during the crisis in Iran, which seen a tyrannical leader seek asylum in the states as the Iranian population staged a massive uprising. In reaction to the states actions, Iranians store the US embassy and take a number of workers hostage, however its quickly realized that 6 members managed to escape and are currently hiding out in the confines of the Canadian embassy. The CIA act accordingly, trying desperately to come up with a plan to hatch an escape, however the only viable option appears to be a wild plot to create a fake Hollywood blockbuster and use it as the basis to get to and from the country. Its premise is indeed brilliantly layered and for a film of this genre, it does tick all the boxes, but thats Argo's main flaw, it just ticks all the boxes. It gets off to a wonderful start, with a tense storming of the US embassy, however Affleck never manages to recreate the same level of tension for the rest of the movie. In terms of cast its got everyone and their mother, Affleck, Cranston, Goodman, Arkin, Cochrane, McNairy, Clea Duvall and Kyle Chandler to name but a few, but regardless of all the star power, Argo's characters never really feel like true portrayals, at no point will anyone convince you otherwise. The performances lack any depth or indeed substance, and the script for that matter never allows any character to fully develop. Luckily Argo bypasses this with some excellent pacing and a filming style that puts your right in the drama, as events unfold you begin to feel entangled in affairs and for that Affleck must be applauded, he may not know how to direct actors very well, but he can construct a scene with a competence that many film makers today just cant fathom. Argo is not without merit, its strong in places and its concept is indeed riveting, however with all the star power, there is no escaping the by the numbers execution of character development and typical Hollywood tropes that make this a painfully average film.",

While the story is pretty interesting, the movie is marred by all the overly snappy and pretentious dialog.  The film's writers were trying too hard to make the sharp banter among the various government officials and film executives be witty, and it came off as overdone and just lame. (Argo has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; I'm hoping it doesn't win.)\n\nAlan Arkin's performance was overrated; it was decent but not extraordinary.  He doesn't deserve the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor he was nominated for.\n\nThis movie in general is overrated.  I mean, it held my attention and kept me entertained throughout its duration, but other than that there wasn't much else to it.  It wasn't a very deep movie, and it felt rather shallow after I was done watching it.\n\nThe movie does have some moments of tension and suspense - like with the ongoing reconstruction of the documents shredded at the embassy that reveal the escapees' identities.  But a lot of the drama feels fabricated, especially all the useless melodramatic whining and moaning we had to endure every time they showed the escapees at the Canadian ambassador's house.  As the escapees were finally leaving Iran, the movie couldn't just let them leave normally (as I'm sure was how it actually happened).  No, the movie insisted on awkwardly shoehorning in a cheesy and ridiculous drama/action sequence that you could automatically tell was fabricated.  Did the filmmakers think anyone would actually believe that an action movie-style runway chase of a departing airplane happened in real life?  What was going to happen next - an Iranian supercop leaps from the pursuing truck onto the wing of the plane and tenaciously clings to it as it takes off into the sky?  Give me a break.",

            "content": "Argo is a political thriller that was released in 2012 and directed by Ben Affleck. The film follows Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA exfiltration specialist, who is put in charge of rescuing six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the Iran hostage crisis that occurred in late 70's and into the early 80's. \n\nIn order to preserve the suspense and awesomeness of Argo, I will not go into any further details regarding the plot. This is a movie that one should watch with no knowledge of what is going to happen throughout the course of the film.\n\nReally, there honestly is not much I can say about this movie that has not already been said. It is utterly fantastic on every level.\n\nThe direction of the movie by Affleck is phenomenal. It is rather difficult to fully put a movie that is set in an earlier time frame (Late 1970's) on camera, while directing in a different year. Affleck, however, was able to accomplish that task and created an accurate representation of his intended time frame. Each scene was carefully executed and all of the details in the background such as the style of the rooms, the televisions used, the character's outfits and hairstyles, were spot on. There was no object that looked out of place.\n\nAffleck did a commendable job and actually surprised me as an actor. I had no idea he was that talented. Perhaps seeing him in Daredevil at an early age turned me away from him but recently, he has emerged as one of my favorite people in the movie industry. Cannot wait to see him in Batman vs. Superman.\n\nAnother positive about Affleck's directing is the fact that he was able to create a spellbinding story that built tension gradually over the course of the film.  All of that tension was put to great use in the film's finale and he literally had me screaming at the television by the end of the movie. I mean, wow. It is mesmerizing how each one of the scenes builds off one another and there are no \"wasted\" moments. \n\nMost thrillers nowadays fail at sustaining tension throughout the course of the film and instead, rely on two or three scenes that are way over the top. Props go out to Affleck for knowing how to direct an effective thriller.\n\nThe editing of the film was phenomenal as well. Everyone involved in the production of the film made sure that the cuts to the next scene and camera switches were perfectly executed. Every scene fit seamlessly together with the next and there was no choppiness.\n\nThe casting of Argo was also tremendous. I mean Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman all did spectacular jobs and added a substantial amount of humor to the film. The jokes were subtle and dark but were absolutely hilarious. Most of the credit for that goes to Arkin, who played Lester Siegel, a Hollywood director. Every one of his lines was carefully crafted and he was such a great addition to the movie.\n\nAs for the other two, viewers sort of know what to expect from them. John Goodman is well... John Goodman. He does great in every role and people know his style. \n\nBut seriously. Bryan freaking Cranston. That guy can act and continues to blow my mind in every movie he stars in. He does such a great job at balancing the seriousness of his character but also rewards the audience by having a few snarky and hilarious lines.\n\nFinally, Alexandre Desplat's score was entrancing. The music fit so well with the scenes and often added to the overall tone of the movie. Never was the music distracting or unnecessarily loud. When the tension was building, the score built as well, adding to the overall excitement and anticipation of the movie.\n\nWhile there are controversies regarding the film, Argo still managed to go above and beyond my expectations for a political thriller. Affleck created a beautifully directed masterpiece that is filled with tremendous acting performances from himself, Goodman, Arkin, and Cranston. This is a movie that everyone should see at least once in his/her life.",

            "content": "On November 4, 1979, Iranian activists storm the United States embassy in Tehran in retaliation for President Jimmy Carter giving the Shah asylum in the U.S. during the Iranian Revolution. More than 50 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and hide in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the U.S. State Department begins to explore options for exfiltrating them from Iran. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist, is brought in for consultation. He criticizes the proposals, but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\" and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who happened to be in Iran scouting exotic locations for a similar science-fiction film. Mendez contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously crafted disguises for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing \"Argo\", a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow frantic inside the ambassador's residence. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and learn that some personnel have escaped. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran and links up with the six escapees. He provides them with Canadian passports and fake identities to prepare them to get through security at the airport. However, time is running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on them... \n\nRotten Tomatoes wrote about \"Argo\":  \"Tense, exciting and often darkly comic, Argo recreates a historical event with vivid attention to detail and finely wrought characters.\" Upon release, \"Argo\" received widespread acclaim, with praise directed towards the acting (particularly Alan Arkin), Ben Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations for the 85th Academy Awards and won three, for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The film also earned five Golden Globe Award nominations, winning Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director, while being nominated for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture for Alan Arkin. It won Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards, with Arkin being nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. It also won Best Film, Best Editing, and Best Director at the 66th British Academy Film Awards. \"Argo\" has also been criticized for its portrayal of events; especially for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger that the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country. As in so many other cases when a movie is based on true events, the filmmakers use their \"creative freedom\" to dramatise and create tension. I have issues with that. Why even call it a film \"based on true events\" then? The historical accuracy in \"Argo\" has been debated and the more you read about the actual event and the film, there\u00b4s a bit too many situations that never occurred in real life for it to be ok for me as a moviegoer. For example, the dramatic flight from the airport with a last-minute chase by the Republican Guard is entirely fictional. In reality, the diplomats showed up for their flight with pre-booked tickets and had no trouble boarding their plane. As the flight was at 5:30am, there were no Republican Guards on duty - even they were not that zealous for the cause. That is just Hollywoodised bullshit. The movie is however made in a competent way. The cinematography, the settings, the set designs, the clothes etc etc, but the true story has been tuned up to something not so close to reality and yes it does bother me. \"But, it\u00b4s for dramatic/entertainment purposes otherwise it wouldn\u00b4t be interesting to see\"... Well, then the true story was simply not that exciting to make a picture out of it in my book. Iran is as well portrayed as populated more or less entirely by fundamentalists and antiamericans, while Iran is in reality a culturally rich and diverse country. We only get to see the American side of the story in \"Argo\" and that \"truth\" has been twisted and turned. Is \"Argo\" an Oscar\u00b4s movie? Not in my book. It\u00b4s an ok \"sort of based on a true story\" thriller with a touch of those classic conspiracy spy thrillers from the 1970s. I did like the soundtrack choices and in keeping with the period in which the film is set (around 1979), Warner Bros. used their \"Big W\" logo in the opening credit.",

The acting is mediocre at best and the characters mere stereotypes. Whilst Affleck appears to be a decent director, his acting prowess is average to poor. Consequently I felt the characters were not engaging enough to care or root for them.\n\nBefore watching this film I anticipated a tense, suspenseful and gritty feature. What I saw instead was something sleep inducing. Too much attention is given to the frankly ludicrous Argo concept, the idea that the hostages shall pose as a film crew to evade the Iranian authorities. Furthermore the scenes shot in Iran were unbelievably  boring and not tense in the slightest. \n\nUltimately this film is over-hyped and nauseatingly pro-American. It is simply a true story that should be of no interest to anyone. I am sure far more compelling stories can form the basis of a film about the Iranian Revolution, but the ridiculous story of Argo appeases all those Americans who are self-absorbed.

They amped up the suspense of course and even though I knew they would be ok I tried to view it as they would NOT knowing if they were going to make it.  What an insane story and you have to give some cred for Affleck choosing this over other source material to make a movie from. Was it sensationalized?  Of course, it's a MOVIE folks, even documentaries get sensationalized and don't get the facts right all of the time. I choose this over Independence Day anytime if I fancy a US saves the world movie. The only part that had me baffled was at the end- I think Kevin Smith snuck in some of his personal SciFi collectibles. After some nice pausing over Chewbacca and Darth Vader figurines I then saw the Argo sketch and I got it.  Original?  Who knows but if so that's pretty cool.",

Affleck is perfect as the exfiltration expert thrown into the fire as he attempts to remove unwilling embassy personnel out of a hostile zone.

The script by Chris Terrio is undeniably stellar, propelling the story forth with tense thrills while interspersed with unexpectedly timely humor.   The film was deservingly honored at the 85th Academy Awards, winning Best Picture and marking a redemptive comeback of sorts for Ben Affleck after his career had gone south following his Oscar win for Good Will Hunting in 1998.

The story is based on true events and tells how the CIA came up with a bold plan to rescue the six diplomatic staff who are holed up in the Canadian embassy in Tehran. The plan involved setting up a fake film production company and smuggling the Americans out on the pretext that they'd been scouting Iran for film locations for a science fiction movie. If this had been a fictitious story, it would be unbelievable. I don't think I've seen Affleck better than he is in this film as the CIA agent who hatches the plan and goes undercover to rescue the embassy staff. He's great. Understated and believable as a somewhat cerebral and cool agent. There's some brilliant supporting roles played by Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber and there's a skilful blend of suspense and moments of levity that stops the whole thing becoming gruelling. Of course the tension does ramp-up as the story reaches the point where the fugitives attempt to  leave the safety of the Canadian Embassy and head for the airport. This is really the pivotal moment of the film and is edge of your seat stuff. There's some disturbing scenes peppering the film showing some of the events on the streets of Tehran and the period setting is well realised and convincing. In particular, I liked the closing credits which featured stills from the film and the real photos that obviously inspired them. This is a well crafted movie which rightly gained several awards including the Oscars for best motion picture, best editing and best adapted screenplay.",

However, with Argo, he more than redeems himself for movies like Pearl Harbor, Gigli, Daredevil, etc. Not only does he give a great performance, but he does a fine directing job. His failure to get an Oscar nomination for Best Director for this film will surely go down in history as one of the most bewildering and egregious snubs of all time. It was one of those rare snubs that caused not just a lot of anger amongst film critics and film lovers, but Hollywood itself. However, he still won an Oscar for producing this film, so he didn't completely go home empty handed. \n\nAnyway, back to the film. This is one of those stories that seems like it couldn't be true, but it is. Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who, during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, manages to pose as a Hollywood producer to create a scenario that he's looking to shoot a science fiction movie called Argo in Iran, and he'll sneak the American hostages out by having them pretend to be members of the film crew. How Mendez pulls all of this off is the basis for this film, and never once, was I bored. Not only is Affleck great, but so is the supporting cast, particularly Alan Arkin as a cranky producer, John Goodman as a makeup artist, and Bryan Cranston as Mendez's CIA co-worker. The suspense is also top notch. My heart pounded non-stop in the last 30 minutes. And, if anyone still thinks Ben Affleck can't pull off playing Batman in 2016, watch this film now!!! 10/10.",

An amazing story lost amongst the chaos of the Iranian hostage crisis, \"Argo\" tells the tale of an unorthodox joint operation between Canada and the CIA to rescue some would-be hostages.\n\nThe result is two hours of captivating narrative.  \"Argo\" combines effective story-telling with bits of humor and satire.  The ever-present suspense is excellent and very real.  And Ben Affleck is fantastic, both as an actor and especially as a director.  Some people might argue that directing a film based on a true story is easy, but under the wrong director these adaptions can go very badly.  Ben Affleck is at the top of his game, and it shows.\n\n\"Argo\" is a simply outstanding movie.",

This tells the untold story of the American hero behind the scenes CIA guy who saved their asses and thwarted a possible war situation. Its incredible that this idea was even thought of or approved and that it actually was pulled off. I've heard of the Iranian American embassy hostage situation taking forever (almost 2 years), but didn't ever hear about these particular hostages who escaped. These poor people are caught in a horrible situation just because of their nationality. The tension was so thick in this film you could cut it with a knife. For that reason, along with the ingenuity and meticulousness of the plot to escape- you can't help but cheer them on. One of my fav Affleck films and while it had some of his \"cool guy\" that tries too hard in the script, it didn't get too heavy handed. Also, unlike a lot of political films this movie was very easy to follow and wasn't bogged down with govt. jargon.",

For example the end when the police cars chase the massive jet liner down the runway, and them just making it to the plane with seconds to spare.  It isn't  action packed, although there is some shooting but we're constantly waiting for someone to discover where the Americans are and kill them.  It has a good cast, combined with a decent plot and makes for a fairely good film.  It dosen't make us believe its what actually happened, but it makes for an interesting movie.",

            "content": "Warning: contains nonsense, pretentiousness, and some mild language.\n\nArgo is a very serious attempt at a very serious movie: a popular hit and critical success, this silver-screen adaptation of the 1980 \"Canadian Caper\" deservedly grossed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and merited numerous Academy and other awards. The clever pacing, relatively dark cinematography, and Hollywood rewriting of history make Ben Affleck's flick a sensational thriller.\n\nAt the start, the audience is immediately taken back in time thirty years or so thanks to the nostalgic visual style. True-to-life reproductions of the past are seamlessly integrated with CGI to create locales and camera shots seemingly recalled straight from a previous era, adhering to a faithful recreation of a fictional reality. The props and other minutiae are accounted for, all the way down to the fine grain on-screen: props to the technical crew. No doubt Argo was meant to appeal to a target age demographic, with its film-like motif, camera shake, wobbly credits, dust and scratches, and overall simulation of an authentic period film.\n\nExploring less the superficial aspects and more of the movie's substance, the plot centers around the removal of six escaped embassy diplomats from a chaotic situation in Iran; its main man Tony Mendez is played by none other than star actor, director, and producer Affleck. He is an \"exfil,\" a term used in armed jargon as an abbreviation for \"exfiltration.\" Basically he disguises a group of hidden American expatriates as a Canadian film crew, gets them the hell out of hell and evades an evidently inevitable grave by radical judge, jury, and executioner.\n\nJoining him is the no-longer-bald Bryan Cranston, who reprises his role as a hair-raising badass, though this time in the guise of a CIA operative. His Emmy-winning performance as Walter White channels its inner rage into his new persona as showcased in a brief clip of explosive frustration: Heisenberg line-drives a mug in one fell swing of his plastic phone handset 9-iron, making office miniature golf just that much more entertaining!\n\nFor contrast and completeness, the international-scale tension is skillfully offset by the comic relief provided by two jovial jokesters, John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Their respective roles as the esteemed John Chambers and fictitious-but still funny-Lester Siegel are mainly occupied by bulls****ing the blockbuster business as the movie's Moe and Larry (the third stooge is merely a cameo by Jack Nicholson). Laughs are to the adage of \"Argo f*** yourself.\"\nLastly, a small mention goes to the fairly convincing look-alikes playing the damsels in distress. All considered, the charismatic cast of characters allows for the audience to really catch on, and is what makes this film truly engaging, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nThis enveloping ingenuity, however, can entirely engross a captivated crowd to such an acute degree that the dynamic backdrop of Iranian crisis is flattened to a metaphorical green screen, with the detached action occurring only before it, and not necessarily interacting with it. Ironically, in the film one Iranian cultural official chastises the American impostors, posing as location scouts, for trying to cheapen their exotic Iranian set to a land suggestive of \"snake charmers\" and \"flying carpets.\" As such, many reviewers praised the film, but also took the time to lend a factual tenor to their own opinions by criticizing Affleck's sensationalized interpretation of true events and prevailing American ethnocentrism. Apparently, the alleged stateside propaganda piece depicts a less-than-crucial Canadian role, rolling out a retold reenactment reducing Canadian Ambassador Taylor to plain wallpaper. The masses really did the fill the streets; the eruptions in Farsi were no farce; but to the ire of certain stalwarts a prime opportunity to relay the people's oppression through Western media was swept under the Persian rug.\n\n(On a more subtle scale, the reference to Battle for the Planet of the Apes against the politically-charged imagery of Iranian protests seems only a coincidental correlation, yet many parallels can be drawn between the picture and the picture within, along the lines of implied barbarism and animosity.)\n\nTo its credit nonetheless, the film ventures to remain historically relevant with its highly symbolic juxtaposition of the script reading scene in Los Angeles amid flashes of footage detailing the concurrent events overseas. The exclusion of detail is, according to Affleck, for the sake of not compromising Argo's cinematic focus. Call it a celebration of artistic liberty. The final verdict is ultimately up to the viewer.\n\nPersonally I thoroughly enjoyed Argo f*** yourself. (If I were to remember one thing from the 130 minutes of nail-biting, that line would be it.)",

            "content": "\"We love the film because its a great film. It's ridiculously well made.\"\n\nYou call a script riddled with one-liners and a final product filled with continuity mistakes a \"great film that's ridiculously well made\"? More importantly, the propaganda element to the intensity shown demerits it from being considered \"a great film that's ridiculously well made\".\n\nAfter being told that this movie is \"fair\" and that \"Americans were given credit for screwing up with the 1953 Coup!\" I decided I'd give a decent breakdown of the social implications of this film.\n\n\n                Firstly, the opening sequence makes mention of how the USA and England engineered a coup to prevent Iranian Democracy from coming about, but even in this story they said the Iranians seized \"US and English petroleum\" which is bull****. It was Iranian, and that was why the people were so upset.\n\n                Secondly, the film did not mention Jimmy Carter's failure in the entire 1979 revolution and how he is greatly to blame for Khomeini's return and rise to power.\n\n                Prior to the revolution, there was civil unrest in the south-east part of Iran. The Sunni Iranians/Pakastani-Iranians had bombed a number of Shieh mosques. The Shieh Iranians asked for Vengeance, but the Shah publicly said no, but SAVAK was secretly tasked with making a counter-strike.\n\n                This was a problem for a couple reasons - the Sunni-Iranians (few in numbers) began spreading that the Shah was a murderer, and at the same time, the Shieh Iranians were calling the Shah a traitor and a coward and non-Muslim. They saw him as a disgrace to the other Shieh's and blamed the deaths of the Shieh-Iranians on him. He became known as a murderer from both sects. Khomeini was one of the biggest Anti-Shah figures, proclaiming that the only solution to Iran's tribulations was an Islamic Republic. He became hostile and was exiled.\n\n                THAT is why the Revolution initially came about - the Shah wasn't a \"murderous tyrant\". His sense of self-righteousness made a mess of Government and he wouldn't correct it forcefully because he felt it wrong. After the CIA and Carter urged the Shah to spill the blood of the protesters, the Shah refused. He left for his first trip to Egypt (discussing solutions with his confident, the leader of Egypt). During his first trip, the smearing continued, with Khomeini saying that the Shah had been sneaking riches from the country into Egypt, calling him a thief. At this point, the CIA/Carter ordered their contacts in the Iranian Imperial Guard to open fire on protesters. Much blood was shed and this added fuel to the flame. \"USA! USA! USA!\"\n\n                The Shah returned to see all of his commanding officers urging him to forcefully fight the people (as per CIA/Carter interference). Once again, the Shah refused. Word had been fast spreading of American involvement and the argument of the Shah being a puppet to the United States was reintroduced. When Carter and his council realised that the Shah would not succumb to their will, they thought it better to back Khomeini. Introduce a new dictator who would stay loyal to you (as the first Pahlavi did and even the second for the first few decades).\n\n                While the Shah was on his second trip to Egypt, the CIA dispatched Imperial Guard Uniforms to Mujahidin and Islamic Militia to once again open fire on the protesters (this time they realised added fuel to the fire would be to their advantage). The Iranians went ape ****, and they pressed on against the barracks and the palace. They broke in, ransacked the palace (with all of the treasures intact mind you) and they began killing the Generals of the Shah (many of which were told to help push forward the coup in favour of Khomeini - pretty ironic). The United-States (through French relations) had Khomeini return to the country and a glorious party.\n\n                Meanwhile, the Shah had been growing weary (he finally revealed that he had been dying of cancer). After being denied entry numerous times, FINALLY the United States allowed the Shah to stay on American soil (not mainland) to die.\n\n                When Khomeini came to Iran, he was allied with the CIA/Carter. \"USA! USA! USA!\", only the University students (including the now President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad) decided that they would raid the American Embassy (unaware of the political pact between the Islamic Republic and the USA), demanding the return of the Shah. Finally they broke in and Khomeini initially ordered that the students piss off. Only, then his advisers pointed out how much it fuelled the students. They had been oppressed by the USA for so long, and now was their chance to remove who they considered to be tyrants.\n\n                Khomeini allowed the Embassy takeover to occur, thinking he no longer needed American support.\n\n                In many reports from the students (who later went on to resent the Islamic Revolution), they were suspected that the American Embassy was a depot of spies - another reason it was a PRIMARY target. The thing with the Shah was just the icing on the cake. Their real prize? Uproot espionage. When they entered the embassy, the students found that documents were being shredded.\n\n                The students took the shreds and meticulously began reassembling them (NOT CHILDREN IN SWEAT SHOPS) and they were proud to do it for their country. This operation helped the Iranian students to dig-out all of the spies (Iranian-American and American) who had been operating (many of which had caused the deaths of countless innocent lives). They held military tribunals (not kangaroo courts) for the spies, and gave them punishment based on their actions (keep in mind, the trials were decently fair as they were still technically operating in a manner similar to the Monarch system (the Islamic system had yet to be established). The film shows it as the Iranians trying to get dirt on the Americans, killing innocent Americans and sending children to sweat shops.\n\n                Furthermore, how many Iranians in the movie were shown as being civil? Most Iranians weren't even in favour of the bloody revolution. Those who were either radical extremists or Militant Communists (or American influenced Imperial Guard). Almost every Iranian portrayed in this film was portrayed negatively.\n\n                What happened with the rescue attempt? Lack of preparation, and the helis crashed into each other in the desert. It was an international embarrassment. The Islamic Republic called this \"an act of God in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran\" - revolutionaries went ape ****. Once again, fuel to the flame.\n\n                When were the hostages finally released? The INSTANT that Jimmy Carter lost the election. The Iranian's way of sending a message that he, the Democrats and more importantly the Americans, had failed. The Islamic Republic proclaimed themselves as merciful.\n\n                Moving on to Antonio Mendez, the MEXICAN C.I.A. agent played by a WHITE American.\n\n                Speaking of Mendez, those \"money shots\" with the American flag were a bit much.\n\n                Now time for the Canadian **** over. The Canadians took responsibility for the Americans at the Ambassador's home and they engineered the escape. The movie completely disregards this. The CIA would handle the cover-up side, as they had access to American resources that CSIS did not. The cover was almost blown a couple of times by journalists, but again, it took CSIS to shut them back up.\n\n                The \"Argo\" cover-up was greatly exaggerated. I'll say about 85% of it was for the purpose of the film. Why do I say 85%? Well, first of all, it made for \"great\" juxtaposition of an all-American rescue mission prep. vs the \"barbaric, child enslaving Iranians\" in a montage sequence, and secondly because it offered an opportunity to make a jab at the current situation in the world, where the United States and Jews are constantly being attacked by the IRI.\n\n                The film focused on the Jews in Hollywood for a specific reason, and that was because it provided an interested political statement in comparison to the current state of things. Usually, the large population of Jews in the Film Industry is taboo in films, running the risk of being labelled \"Anti-Semetic\", but when it's to go \"Hey Islamic Iran, you got outsmarted by Americans and Jews! USA! USA! USA!\" and it requires exaggerating the actual \"Argo\" element of it, it's fair game.\n\nSo let's recap shall we?\n\n\u00b7         The film calls Iranian resources American/British (when in reality, the resources were stolen by the USA/UK and reclaimed by Iran).\n\n\u00b7         The film makes the Shah out to be a murderous tyrant (when in reality, a lot of this bad rap is due to American interference)\n\n\u00b7         Jimmy Carter's betrayal of Iran is not mentioned\n\n\u00b7         The CIA's influence on the Imperial Guard is not mentioned\n\n\u00b7         The CIA's involvement in getting Khomeini back into Iran, not mentioned.\n\n\u00b7         The film portrays the Embassy takeover as without intent, but to steal information on the USA and get \"vengeance\" (when it was about finding the spies and Khomeini allowing this to occur as a message to Carter)\n\n\u00b7         The film portrays the Iranians making children in sweat shops piece together the images (when it was students who took it upon themselves to do this as an honour to their people)\n\n\u00b7         Mendez being white.\n\n\u00b7         American flag money shots.\n\n\u00b7         Canadian's are swept under the rug (when CSIS did most of the work)\n\n\u00b7         Americans/Jews Vs. Iran (specifically at a time where the Islamic Republic is being hostile towards them and the possibility of war looms over us)\n\n                So no, I do not think that I am exaggerating. And ALL of that, is coming from an individual who hates the Islamic Republic more than anyone you've probably ever met. We are facing the possibility of a war with Iran. If that happens, the Iranian people will suffer tremendously and the three decades of healing to the perspective of Americans to the Persian people (not the government) will be completely undone.\n\nA Note on Nationalism:\n\n                I'm sorry if this came off as an angry rant - really not at all my intentions. I'm just trying to show that perhaps when I say \"this film is a load of propaganda\" I'm not doing it based on conspiracy or pride, but rather from a perspective of historical and social context. Americans don't have to love America. Propaganda should be beneath us. Politics and Nationalism are poison to the well-being of the world, and films like this only further their \"progress\". All it does is cause contention, strife and disunity. Having a background where my own people (Persians) persecute those with my beliefs, being someone who refuses to refer to myself as an \"Iranian\", and being denied identity as a \"Canadian\" in the country I was born and raised (Canada) by white Canadians, based on visible differences (when their entire country was founded on illegal immigration and a savage genocide of dark-skinned First Nations), and having been raised with influence of Persian, English-Canadian, French-Canadian and Mohawk culture, I have learned how futile Nationalism is.\n\n***UPDATE***\nUpon taking the embassy over, Iranian students released women, children and blacks first. They did this to show that they would not oppress those whom they believed the American government was (ironic, considering the current state of things...).\n\n***DISCLAIMER***\n\nThe above is based on released military notes, leaked files, reconstructed (once shredded) files from the embassy in Iran, documentaries and testimonial accounts.\n\n\nIran and the West: The Man Who Changed the Word (BBC)\n\n\"The Queen and I\" (It is available on Netflix)\n\nYou can also read Marjan Satrapi's \"Persepolis\" for another perspective of the Revolution. In terms of the book which talks about the students that taped the shredded pieces back together...\n\nTakeover in Tehran: The Inside Story of the 1979 US Embassy Capture (ISBN 978-0889224438)\n\nThose are MULTIPLE perspectives on the issue. The first is of the Western side, the second from the side of the Monarch, the third from the Qajar perspective. \nFor further look into the 1953 coup, you can see this documentary for starters:\n\nThis one is in Farsi (NOT from the Islamic Republic, as they hate him) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Xge4MQtCs\n\nThere's another one floating around that used to be on YouTube before it was taken down. I think that was BBC -",

The cinematography and shots are well presented which gives you both the beautiful side of the foreign country but also the gritty and dark side of the suffering going on. I was also impressed with the use of old archive footage and the flow in transitioning between real and movie footage.\nThe characters are well played. The escaping Americans look the part of the time period and both John Goodman and Alan Arkin clearly make the most of their characters, whilst parodying the nature of Hollywood and its filmmakers. Whilst certain points in the operation was created for the movie, it doesn't take anything away from the actual story told and helps build up tension.

The tagline of this movie kinda fits about the real story and this movie: \"The movie was fake. The mission was real.\" Yeah, it was, and it doesn't matter how it was depicted as long as it tells what happened. I get it, the Iranians didn't chase them while the plane was taking-off...and the Canadians did much more...and the other countries didn't reject them...yeah, but the movie is still awesome. Not because it glorifies America, but because it is a good movie. Not an accurate story, but a good movie, a great one actually.\n\nArgo has great writing that develops human characters that we can care for. They show feelings and they interact. Humans, Iranians, Canadians, Americans, all are great characters nevertheless. The story is well-told in the storytelling department. It has a three act structure, it closes everything it started and has an adequate runtime: just one hour and some minutes...what? It lasts 2 hours? It was so good that it felt short for its own size.\n\nThe performances are great, each character being believable and identifiable. We have Ben Affleck, Brian Cranston, John Goodman, and many other great performances. The music by Desplat fits the tone of each scene, and helps building the tension and thrills that caused us so much attachment to this movie. Even if the story is not entirely accurate, it's still engrossing. It has been a long time since I felt this way watching a movie. I felt this had a Dark Knight-ish feeling towards it; this is what I feel each time a movie engrosses me in every minute of it. Each of the two hours of this movie where good and I really enjoyed the movie. Even with its accuracy issues, Argo is still a good movie, while not a remarkable re-telling of a real mission. This is a great movie and I really recommend it to everyone who has not watch it. You'll be grateful. It did everything it had to do and I liked it. Loved it, actually.",

He does well in stirring suspense, best of all seen in the embassy opening, and the absolutely nail biting airport sequence which had me shouting at the screen in desperation, but the real problem is the pace. Argo has a few slow scenes, and yes they are important to the narrative, but these moments could've had some liveliness thrown in, but that's just me.\r\n\r\nIt's exciting to see what Affleck will direct next, as Argo stands as his best piece of work in years.

It's like no other movie. Argo has encountered some big movies.\nSo it truly stands out high above the rest. Argo is one of the those films that are unforgettable. Fantastic acting at best. \n\nIt's unlike any other film known to date. Argo is a film that the tells the true story of a hostage rescuer pretending to make a movie in Iran while trying to rescue Americans and bring them back to the United States. This movie is top notch and it has everything in store for both audience members and critics. Ben Affleck was in the movie The Town. He was awesome, but he tops his performance by a long shot. I'm a huge movie goer. I know these things. Trust me Argo won't disappoint you. It has a strong cast and crew that makes this movie unforgettable. \n\nI also love the whole fake movie idea. I know that's just part of the movie. But I think it is really a cool part of the story. The cinematography was cool. It went from a documentary style film to being shot in a standard movie look.

It is shameful to lie about Canada, to down play Canada's 90 % role in the whole affair,  it's heart bankrupt!  But however Hollywood in its fashion of film making created another action packed film.  I give the action 8, but the script 4, I would have graded it better if the movie was told as being very loosely based on one the truth! Canada I will let everyone here know  that you were 90%  historically proven responsible for the safety of those 6 Americans.  Thankfully several people from back then, like hostages to President Jimmy Carter made this known.........this loosely truth based movie is good to watch....",

Ben Affleck deserves all the plaudits on this one, i never expected to like this one but due to his raw talent of filmmaking as well as acting he has created a masterpiece out of a little known  but technical story. The end is sheer suspense. That is due to the built up scale of terror and trouble you know these victims are in. You believe these lives to be at risk and that the odds are low, edge of the seat stuff as an audience. Terrific entertainment which is just right, in every sense.",

Real footage is shown from the broadcasts, which makes it all the more interesting. I thought I would have issues with understanding it and violence. Neither was an issue for me, as the movie was very straightforward and there was no gore. However, I agree with the R rating as there are very intense scenes of torchure (sp!), and strong language. The characters are in constant danger which is why I wouldn't recommend this movie for young kids. It's most age appropriate for kids ages 17 and up, provided that they have some background in the subject matter. I would definitely recommend this movie being viewed in conjunction with a U.S History class that covers this topic!",

            "content": "The incredible achievement of being presented nearly 50 awards has not done the film Argo justice. These past few decades, it has been rare to see a person successfully direct and act in the thriller genre of film, but Ben Affleck has proven that it is still possible. Ben Affleck directs, produces, and stars in this historical thriller, which captures its viewers in a whirlwind of suspense with its daring directing and brilliant acting. \n\nArgo is the (almost) true story of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA operative who successfully leads six Americans out of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and into safety by fabricating a movie and posing as a film crew. \n\nAlthough this story is based on true events, know not everything in the film is entirely accurate. Affleck took a praiseworthy risk as the director and changed some of the true events to create an even stronger film. For example, during the actual Iran hostage crisis, flying out of Iran back to America went without a hitch. In the movie, however, the airport scene is the most suspenseful ten minutes of the film, keeping the audience's heart rates at full speed anticipating whether or not Mendez's unusual plan will succeed and bring them to safety. Affleck's choice to change the true events at the Iranian airport into the thrilling fictional scene made the film all the more successful. \n\nThe airport scene was only one of the many moments that gripped the audience with its riveting, suspenseful emotions. Despite the film being 130 minutes, it kept the audience's full attention the entire lengthy duration with its frequent plot twists keeping the viewers adrenaline raised even after the credits finish rolling. \n\nThe incredible acting in the film was also a huge contributor to the films effectiveness. Argo pulled in a star-worthy cast including Bryan Cranston (Jack O'Donnell), John Goodman (John Chambers), and Victor Garber (Ken Taylor), but one actor stood out among the rest: Alan Arkin. He played Lester Siegel, a big-name Hollywood producer. Arkin's performance gave the viewers a source of comic relief in this otherwise intense film. Arkin effectively but subtlety added humor to his serious dialogue through his inflection and tone of voice. It is no surprise that Arkin's performance in Argo granted him an Oscar nomination for best supporting role. \n\nAlthough, Lester Siegel was the only fictional character in the film, Affleck proved himself once again by adding this role into the film. Without it, Argo may have taken on too dark of a story line as many films in drama do. \n\nArgo's incredible direction by Affleck and successful acting contributed to the film's immense accomplishments in the film industry. Affleck's film fully deserved its Oscar for Best Picture. The success and adrenaline-filled emotions Argo generated raised the bar for the entire drama, thriller genre in film for years to come.",

The CIA puts together plans to get them out of Iran.\n\n    The winning plan was to produce a Canadian science fiction movie shot in Iran.  Tony flies to LA and gets together a director, a complete script that they own, a prosthetics genius, a walk-through of the script by a full cast of actors in full costume, and a storm of press coverage.  In Iran, Tony convinces the six escapees to study up on their biographies as his crew.\n\n    The relevant ministry gets the script for the fake film, Argo, and the press releases.  He writes Tony that he wants to discuss locations with his crew the next day.  The six learn their new identities as movie people.  They meet with the minister at the appointed place. This is not without challenges along the way.  Presenting the difference between American and Canadian has to be done now and then.\n\n    In the night before the last day, the day to fly back, Tony grills the six on their backgrounds.  After a long session of this, the movie tells us that Washington pulled the plug on the operation.  So what do Tony and the group decide to do?\n\n    No surprise.  They go through with it.  Jack in the CIA threatens Hamilton Jordan with embarassment if it does not go through.\n\n    The last piece was really delicate.  The only Farsi speaker explains the story boards.  The guard wants to verify with Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, John and Lester are out of their office and blocked by filming.  But they connect just in time, and the guard sees a story about Argo in the papers.\n\n    Still, other parts of Iranian justice are after them, and the suspense continues.  Will they make their flight and get into international air space?\n\n--------Scores-------\n\n    Cinematography: 9/10 Good looking, even on DVD.\n\n    Sound: 9/10 No problems.\n\n    Acting: 10/10 Great performances by Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Ben Affleck.\n\n    Screenplay: 7/10 This account was strongly different than the one given to the public in 1980. At the time, the efforts of the Canadians were assigned roughly 100% of the credit for the plan and the successful execution.  I remember feeling a great deal of kinship toward the Canadians at the time.  Also, reactions from Canada in 2012 mirror the same view.  So, accuracy was not set at a premium here.  Considered as a fiction, however, this is an entertaining movie.",

            "content": "Argo is the best picture of 2012, according to the Academy Awards and after watching it twice it is hard to argue whether it is deserving of it's honor. I have seen most of the films that Argo was up against for Best Picture and I must say that there were much better overall films but none can match the intensity and suspense that Affleck has crafted here.\n\nArgo's screenplay was written by Chris Terrio and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Argo's plot sounds interesting even on paper but it when you watch it, you start to see the brilliance that most people have given this film credit for. The screenplay's strong point is the first half of the film where it focuses on the ridiculousness of the plan and the weight it bares on the lives of 6 people. I do wish that Terrio did a little more work on the film's dialogue as at times feel a bit too straightforward and simple. The other issue I had with the film, particularly in the extended cut, was the small focus on Mendez's family issues which would be fine if the film spent more time with it but the film only slightly focuses on it so watching it subsequent times, it does slow the film down. I love that Terrio has written Siegel (Arkin) and Chambers (Goodman) as comic relief as it keeps the slow moments of the first half to move along faster. A lot of the audience's negative reaction to the film is the inaccuracy of the film's story but to me that aspect is not as important. When a  film takes a biographical/historical approach then it should be approached cinematically. If I wanted a film to focuses heavily on facts then I would watch a documentary.\n\nI have seen all of Ben Affleck's directed films and I can definitely say, at least for now, that Argo is his strongest film. Affleck's direction is the star for this film as it meshes both comedy while retaining the weight and intensity of a suspense film. It may not appeal to everyone but I thought it was effective and it gave the film that style that other filmmakers can't achieve. Affleck's greatest achievement in film is the final 40 minutes of this film where it kept me locked towards the screen and always thinking on how the scene will play out.\n\nRodrigo Prieto is responsible for the film's photography, he is mostly known for his work with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's films and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain. Prieto was able to capture the late 70's effect in the image, particularly in scenes shot in 8mm and 16mm, but still able to retain that contemporary look and style that is found in recent films. The shot choices that both Affleck and Prieto has used for the film is fantastic. The shots that are chosen have definitely been planned and it shows the confidence that Affleck in his filmmaking abilities. I am glad that Affleck has chosen to take a much more patient and stable approach to the cinematography and avoiding the style that Paul Greengrass has perfected with his films, a camera that is constantly moving and have that shaky cam feel. Shots in this film move gracefully and I found this very attractive.\n\nAlexandre Desplat is a composer who has worked with many of the big name films these past few years. Desplat has worked on some of my favorite films like Moonrise Kingdom and The Tree of Life. His work here may not be up to par with those films but his score is able to maintain and support that intensity that compliments with Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography. The score shows it's best moments in the final act where it becomes much more dramatic. If only the score is like this throughout the entire film then I would have given this area of the film more credit.\n\nThe film's cast is amazing. I can't stress enough the amount of familiar faces in this film and is done in a way that doesn't feel over the top and have us retracted from the story. Affleck is the protagonist of the film but there isn't much to the character in this film as the film's focus is the operation and the weight of it rather than having a personal and intimate focus. Bryan Cranston is probably the best thing about this film as he brings something here that I have not seen from him in his other films. I am a fan of John Goodman and he is always good on whatever film he is in and that goes the same for Alan Arkin. Both Goodman and Arkin delivers their comedic lines brilliantly with Arkin giving a much more out there performance. The actors playing the six Americans were cast perfectly and definitely worked well together.\n\nArgo is great overall but it isn't a personal favorite of mine from 2012. This doesn't mean that it should not be given a try as you would be missing out on an experience that you would want to come back to over and over again. I am excited to see Affleck's next directorial effort and hopefully it would at least be at the same level as this one.",

            "content": "A friend of mine once described to me his reaction toward the film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button: \"It was so disturbing. I watched it and I recognized that it was a good film. Its production values were great. The acting was great. The cinematography, the sound design, the script, everything was good. But it just didn't connect with me. I kept saying to myself, 'This is good. Why don't I like it?' I watched it, waiting to care, waiting for that moment that it would all click, that the emotions would fall into place. And then the credits began to roll. Okay, I said, and left. It never connected with me. I never cared.\"\n\nMy reaction to Argo was not quite the same, but it was similar. The execution of Argo is solid. It's alternatively (to my delighted surprise) funny and suspenseful. The acting is realistically subdued. Alan Arkin and John Goodman, playing Hollywood insiders who help CIA Agent Mendez (Affleck) create a fake movie as a cover story, are great, though sadly they largely disappear about half way in.  I was really digging on the mustaches and the overly large eyeglasses, that nice 70s-80s vibe. Everything worked, Argo was all smooth, like one of those awesome slip n slides, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.\n\nBut, and I fully understand this is a straight up bizarre complaint, it was too smooth.  It was too... eugh... Hollywood, starting with the estrangement from wife and son, an over-used, if realistic, method to build sympathy for our leading man.  Suspense was built with great editing, good juxtaposition between our heroes, the Iranian bad-guys, and the CIA agents back at home, yet the suspense felt flat to me, since the movie was so obviously Hollywood (not to mention a matter of historical record) and the ending so obviously inevitable. The real Agent Mendez was not white, yet for some reason Affleck cast himself in that role. A minor detail, perhaps, but indicative of the mindset with which the movie was made.\n\nThe simple truth here is that Argo is very much a thrill-ride.  A RIDE, mind you, set firmly on its rails.  I love roller-coasters.  Love em.  But partake in the thrills of a roller coaster enough times, you start to feel like one rollercoaster is much the same as any other.  It's got the clinky-clangy rise to the top, the sudden drop, the corkscrew, the loop-de-loop, the dark tunnel.  That was my problem with Argo.  Despite it being undoubtedly thrilling, not a single thing occurred in that movie that surprised me. Every character behaved exactly like I expected em to, every plot point that I thought would happen happened, every thrill was expected.\n\nFinal Say: Argo is a good movie, but it's not great. As Ken Taylor himself - the heroic Canadian ambassador depicted in the film - said: it's \"Hollywood play time.\" (via Toronto's TheStar)\n\nHow to Watch It: It's a great date movie, a great movie to see with intellectuals, a nice little bit of history, but it's not something that's going to blow your mind - especially if you're well-versed in film - and you should expect that.\n\nEXTRA: The original postscript (as shown in the Toronto International Film Festival) downplayed the role of the Canadian government, which pissed the Canadians off. Eventually Ben Affleck phoned up the previously mentioned Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor and asked: \"You've got issues?\" Ken replied, \"Yeah, I've got issues\" and eventually Affleck offered to change the post-script to its current one.",

I honestly do not remember any details of the events of this sad episode in Middle East history so I cannot really judge this. As far as I know the general plot is consistent with reality and in this movie it is good enough for me. I fear that, if they would have made it 100% historically accurate, the movie would have turned into a rather boring documentary instead of a fairly enjoyable drama movie.\n\nSurprisingly enough the movie was quite funny at times. The dialogue between the movie-people when they were setting up the fake movie was sometimes quite hilarious. Some parts of the movie was rather tragic of course, like the Iranian mob taking over the embassy and the crazed idiots at the bazar.\n\nOther parts where a bit silly. Why did the Iranian security have to break down their own doors at the airport instead of just calling the tower and stop the plane for instance? And the cars chasing the plane was just rubbish. The plane would have gone much faster than the cars could go long before they caught up with the plane. Also the fact that the cars basically had to panic-break in order not to hit the barrier at the end of the runway meant the plane almost ran into the barrier which, given that it made a normal take-off, is just nonsense.\n\nIn general it is a good movie although it is not really my type of movie and the movie's context, the take-over by the Iranian extremists, is a rather sad one.",

I was interested in the protagonist and his decision to ignore a corporate directive in favor of personal responsibility.  Whatever the atrocities of the CIA (and I know there are MANY) Mendez showed quiet dignity in electing to save the lives of six people in immediate danger.  I don't think Argo was the greatest picture of 2012 but you have to give it credit for being entertaining and suspensful in old fashioned ways.  At least for once it is a movie where the main character lives off his wits, not his fists, a rarity in contemporary U.S. cinema.  Sure I think the movie was somewhat overhyped but it is very well crafted and watchable.  So, thumbs up for me.",

Based on the true story of the rescuing of six hostages from Iran in 1979 (by way of fabricating a fictitious story of a movie being filmed), this is by the book, meat and potatoes filmmaking at its finest. Argo is very well done, has an extremely focused way of storytelling, and provides an accurate look of the late 70's culture. The only misstep in this exercise may very well be Affleck giving the lead role to himself. He plays a C.I.A. infiltration specialist (Tony Mendez) who goes in enemy territory to aid the hostages and get them back to the states. Affleck is not a bad actor by any means. However, when he tries to do two things at once (starring in his movies and directing of course), his performances suffer (this is also evident in The Town). During the two hour running time, his screen presence is somewhat effective but he mugs to the camera quite frequently and delivers his lines in a sort of wooden fashion.\n\nIn the end though, Argo is a safe film. It doesn't take any risks, it's not entirely compelling, and it doesn't grip you like it should. However, the Academy disagreed and gave it 2012's Best Picture award. Again, this I feel, was the Academy being safe just like the movie. There's no doubt that Argo is a solid vehicle. However, it's more of a movie to admire, not embrace.",

Every shot is interesting and believable and the end-credits prove that Ben put a lot of work into the direction of this film. Argo also boasts an all-star supporting cast including John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, and Alan Arkin. All of them deserve nominees for their performances as they all bring something unique to the energy of the film. Great acting, great directing, and an unbelievable plot make this film a true winner. I haven't seen edge-of-your-seat tension like this in a long, long time. The film is done so masterfully that I was breathless at its most nail-biting moments and I was belly laughing at all of the subtle moments of comic relief. Argo is an overall perfect experience at the movies and it was instantly added to my list of favorite thrillers of all time. If this movie doesn't go down as a classic, then I'll be damned.",

Don't get me wrong, this is a screenplay that could and should have gone somewhere. It just didn't. Why? Because Ben Affleck, that's why.

The British took the risk in finding them by driving around looking for them in an orange Austin, the only Austin Maxi in Iran and sporting its GB bumper sticker! That was heroic! Plus, they drove them to the airport. Their ticket had been bought 3 days in advance, before Mendez is there.

Sure they may have been killed if they got caught but also, they may have not. The variables were quite broad & the suspense building on whether someone answers the phone or not, doesn't quite cut it for me.",

The U.S. Government derive a plan, led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), to rescue these Americans who are risk of getting mobbed and killed by the public. Enter John Chambers (Ben Affleck), who comes up with a crazy, insane scheme to film a made up science fiction movie named \"Argo\" within Iran. He seeks help from director John Chambers (John Goodman) as well Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to make up movie posters, designs, characters, roles, even characters for all-for-naught movie. It's to rescue these Americans, and give them alias, who are isolated in the Canadian embassy surrounded by the violent mobs of the citizens of Tehran. As Best Picture winners go, it is just endless fascination that keeps this marvellous movie going for two hours. Historically inaccuracies may derive, but its overall storytelling is excellent and even if it a slight mention of Canada, it still makes me happy. They don't distain them in this film. The congratulate and praise them! This without question is a great movie, filled with many fine performances, including that of Ben Affleck who is the centre of the film high achievement (who also provided the remarkable direction). Another well-deserved winner of the top award. I wonder if 2013's winner will be this good.\n\nNote: Argo was the Last Picture to winner to be seen by me, thus meaning I have seen all 85 of them.",

Ben Affleck as the star CIA agent Tony Mendez plays his role to the best of his ability and you can see it in the movie.

Now this film does focus on how America viewed the crisis mostly, but that's fine since this was an American operation to save their people.

The best part about the film is the pacing, it does perfectly to really give off the suspense and it does keep a grip on you for a long time.

In 1979 after being outraged by action of Jimmy Carter, Iranian activists storm the U.S. embassy in Iran and take over 50 American's hostage. 6 escape and are placed in hiding in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Back in the U.S. the CIA come up with a plot to rescue them by posing as Canadian movie studio executives, lead by Tony Mendez (Affleck), scouting locations for an upcoming science fiction film called Argo.\n\nThings I Liked:\n\nJohn Goodman and Alan Arkin. Goodman and Arkin play the studio heads who assist the CIA. They do something really great in this film by adding an air of comedy to the film. They have their moments of great dramatic tension too but they also play a very realistic sense of using humor to defuse tension. The moments seem very natural and the chemistry between the pair is highly memorable.\n\nThe Tone. This movie is tense! There is this constant anxiety that comes from wondering if these people are going to get out alive and it lingers from nearly the start of the film almost all the way through to the finale. You are on the edge of your seat and there are no moments of action either. No gun fights, no war scenes, no chases, just people interacting with each other, and the way Affleck captured that was done in such a way that you felt every tense moment tenfold.\n\nThings I Didn't Like:\n\nThe Pace. Movie is a bit slow. It does so to build tension but there are moments that feel like they could have been removed and nothing would have been lost. The movie has an interesting story and developed characters and even if the tension keeps building throughout the movie, it can get bogged down by taking too much time to stretch those feelings out. There are other ways to do tension building besides leading minor plot points to dead ends and conclusions that don't completely resolve.\n\nOverall. Overall, the movie is a major success. The characters are all interesting and diverse. The tone is an amazing blend of pure tension with speckles of humor. The plot is interesting and the movie grabs you right from the start and doesn't let you go until it is over. The movie has a few moments that seem like they could have done without, but this is a minor issue in my opinion and overall the movie is a great work that really marked a turning point in Ben Affleck's career.",

The acting from Affleck is some of the best out there, and everyone around him is on point, as well. Writing wise, I'll go out on a limb and say flawless. The film is tense and nerve wracking, but also comedic and sad at times. For it's run time, it feels evenly paced. Overall, Argo was just really damn good.",

When the embassy in Iran gets raided, and seized by Islamic militants, six American diplomats managed to escape and find secret sanctuary with the Canadian ambassador. Months later, Mendez devises an audacious plan to get the six diplomats back to America, posing as a film crew looking for locations to shoot, along with the help of John Goodman (The Big Lebowski, Flight) and Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine).\n\nI feel as a whole Argo is the weakest Best Picture winner in many, many years. Although a technically very sound film, it suggests that the film business can solve the world's problems, including terrorism. For this reason I can see why those in Hollywood love this picture.\n\nThe film is well directed, I am under the opinion that Ben Affleck can direct anything that he is given, yet, for me, Affleck is better suited to Boston thrillers, he should stick to what he knows.  Furthermore, it's interesting that his portrayal of Tony Mendez is one that focuses on his trusting nature and smarts in terms of his mission, yet it fails to question Mendez' separation from his wife. It seems to me that that sub-story is just included so that it will form a nice ending when his wife takes him back.\n\nOne thing that surprised me about Argo is that the story expands in an oddly uncomplicated and non-shocking way. This creates a much more believable environment. If this film was a fiction, and not 'based on truth', there would be many more plot twists, or tense encounters that would dramatise and, in a sense, take the film too far into the realms of a Hollywood, fiction, action/thriller.\n\nAn extremely enjoyable film, although not Affleck's best.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n6.5/10.",

But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, a CIA \"exfiltration\" specialist named Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) comes up with a risky plan to get them safely out of the country.

Audiences are immediately introduced to the situation with great scenes depicting a rebellion on the American Embassy and the film successfully maintains the intensity from there on. Quality writing and a well chosen cast only adds to the enjoyment with Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston delivering some nice quips. Slightly overrated by critics I feel (American/Canadian patriotism may come into it), however there is no reason to let it it fall under your radar as it is one of the top movies to come out of 2012.",

No, \"Argo's\" most notable achievement lies in its use of suspense. Indeed, the reason Ben Affleck has gotten such glowing notices is because -- in a film that could have easily been a plodding, pedestrian snore-fest -- he flawlessly paces and builds suspense throughout the story. Of course he probably has plenty of help from his writer and editor in making this work, but no one should take a director's role for granted in achieving this feat -- especially when said director has helmed so few films. Affleck certainly knows how to tell a story well and keep his audience glued from beginning to end. He almost seems like an old pro at this directing thing.\n\nWriter Chris Terrio should also be commended, however, for his snappy dialogue, his terrific balance of satire and political thriller elements, as well as his deft hand at making this \"historical drama\" palatable. While he may not gain any points for complete realism and accuracy, he knows how to write a movie.\n\nI'll go ahead and echo the words of many reviewers and say that \"Argo\" is practically a textbook example of how to make an engaging film. While the movie doesn't break any new ground, and it may give one pause to examine its political motives as a piece of leftist, revisionist history, it does its job as a motion picture extremely, extremely well.",

Some people didn't enjoy this news or didn't jump with glee like I did, because some people thought that Argo was the Obama's choice, and, well, Obama's rule the U.S. so who better to announce Best Pic than Michelle Obama!! You've got to respect this famous, yet, presidential family!! \nAnyways the experience I had while watching Argo in the theater was an experience I will never forget!!! Argo is an A+!! And yes, I will be using a pun for this movie because it's hard not resist!! So Ar-U going to see Argo on renal, well if you haven't seen it yet, what are you doing, if you HAVE seen and you didn't enjoy it, well how dare you!!!

Six Americans haves escaped the U.S. embassy and are seeking refuge with the Canadians in Iran. The task now falls to CIA agent Tony Mendez, portrayed by Affleck, to come up with a plan to to get the Americans back home. Plans like biking to the border or portraying the Americans as English teachers are quickly discarded for their impracticality and small chance of success. So Mendez comes up with a plan so crazy that it just might work. The plan is to say that the Americans are a Canadian film crew scouting for locations for a science-fiction film called Argo and are ready to return home. Its hard to believe that this movie is based on real events, but it is.\n       The best scenes occur whenever John Goodman, portraying make-up artist John Chambers, and Alan Arkin, portraying movie producer Lester Siegel, are on screen. The two provide excellent performances, offering humor in this deadly serious situation. Arkin received an Oscar nomination for his role. I couldn't agree with the nomination more.\n       The film manages to remain tense and exciting, even though the outcome is already known to most viewers. The most exciting scenes really just involve the Americans standing around, waiting to get through airport security. It is a testament to Affleck's direction that he is able to make scenes like these exciting.\n       Argo is an undeniably entertaining film. It keeps us on the edge of our seats throughout, providing humor the whole time. To make it even better, there are a couple of Star Wars references, which made this particular film critic extremely excited.",

            "content": "Directed by Ben Affleck, Argo (2012) chronicles the CIA's 1979 rescue operation to recover six American diplomats who were unable to leave Iran during the hostage crisis.  Written by Chris Terrio, the film is enjoyable, thrilling, and gripping, but it's not as daring, intelligent, or bold as past political thrillers like Frost/Nixon (2007) or All The President's Men (1973).  The film features an ensemble cast of stars and actors that resemble the historical figures they are depicting including Ben Affleck as the protagonist Tony Mendez, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman.  It should be noted that Ben Affleck least resembles his character within the cast.\n     The film begins with a digital recreation of storyboards as voice-over depicts the history of unrest within Iranian society leading up to the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.  Instantly, we are teleported from these cheap looking storyboards to jarring handheld cinematography within a crowd of Iranian protestors outside of the US Embassy.  The opening scene transitions between cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's camera and 8mm shots from protestors within the crowd which expands the perspective of the film.  This scene feels like everything we've seen on television within the past two years as the Arab spring has sprung, and yet it's \"1979\".  Within the Embassy, the six soon-to-be hiding American diplomats are watching the protesters outside as they break through the gate and invade the Embassy.  Files are getting destroyed, people are panicking, and the six diplomats escape out a back door and manage to find refuge at the Canadian ambassador's home.\n     The news of these events hit the headlines in the states and the young CIA specialist Tony Mendez is called in to assist in coming up with a rescue plan.  Everyone's ideas are too logical, but there are typically factual flaws that Mendez can point out ruining every idea presented.  That night, while on the phone with his son, he gets the idea to make a fake movie when his son says he's watching Battle For The Planet of The Apes (1973) on TV.  The desert landscapes and exotic elements of those films resemble Iran, so he runs with the idea.  In order to get approval, all of the fake pre-production pieces of the film need to be completed so that the film will be a convincing real movie, so Tony Mendez approaches makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) who connects him with Alan Arkin's character, film producer Lester Siegel.  The plan: pretend to be a Canadian film crew shooting a science fiction film entitled \"Argo\" and leave Iran with the six diplomats who will pretend to be the film's crew.\n     It's a fantastic film premise, and so rarely do historical events actually make great Hollywood hits without finessing, but Ben Affleck and Chris Terrio finessed a bit in areas that didn't need finessing but instead needed more realism.  Alan Arkin's character, Lester Siegel, didn't actually exist - and that's the way his character feels on the screen.  All of his interactions with John Goodman are simply there for Hollywood laughs (which all of the jokes were shown in the trailer... not that it really matters).  Additionally, the perspective of the film is constantly changing (sure, it's mostly Tony Mendez's perspective, but sometimes it's the six diplomats', Iranian soldiers', Bryan Cranston's CIA team, and most baffling is the Canadian ambassador's maid who gets her own awkward ending at the conclusion of the film).  On the topic of the ending, the finale of the film becomes every clich\u00e9 \"we did it\" moment in films.  The bad guys are right on there tail, but they're just too slow and incapable so the protagonists get away - cue emotional music and people applauding and hugging.  It's like the Ron Howard film Apollo 13, but unnecessary.  One final thing: those digital storyboards at the beginning of the movie were awful.  Why not have a series of actual storyboards sitting on a desk that could arbitrarily tell the story of Iran?  The narrator's voice was distracting as well - Ben Affleck could have easily read aloud the history of unrest in Iran (or maybe even President Carter).\n     It's easy to pick at the flaws, but this is still a pretty strong film.  The thrills are wildly intense at times, and Affleck's direction feels authentic within this '70s period piece.  The flaws that I mentioned above don't take away from the film, but they are severely problematic.  Had Steve McQueen directed this, it might've felt more like his 2008 debut film Hunger primarily following the six diplomats, and if Ron Howard had made Argo it would have been more of a character study following Tony Mendez, but these are all speculative what-ifs.  Ben Affleck made the film, and this is what it is - and it's not that great, but it's not too bad either.",

Affleck shows himself as master of the camera shots in every scene.  His choices are evident and effective.  The script itself has good humor despite the depressing subject matter.  The effectiveness of the comic touch that is not forced is what makes it an enjoyable film to watch.  \r\n\r\nWhen the US embassy in Iran is stormed in 1979, six employees escape and hide out in the Canadian ambassador's home.  Given the dangerous climate, the US employees cannot go anywhere.  The US must decide what action it will take, if any, to help out the American workers.  Affleck as the real life Anthony Mendez proposes to get them out by assuming the identities of filmmakers who wish to make an inter-galactic film named Argo where the humans must face off against invading aliens. \r\n\r\nThe acting from all actors is efficient.  The most personality comes from the characters by Alan Arkin and John Goodman.  The film itself is more about the event.  The characters are not as essential as \"the event.\"  The event and premise take the centerpiece of the film.  Thus, acting is spot on, but no one is given the chance to really shine or to explore many dynamics within the development of any of the characters.  Also, while some scenes created a greater sense of suspense, they also undermined the tone of the film, because they seemed out of place in terms of the mood of the film.  The final chase sequence is one that threw me out of \"the moment\" as an implausible scenario.  As such, the film is a great experience, but there is not much substance in other regards.  It is definitely one of the best political thriller films.",

            "content": "Way back when, I was not a huge fan of Ben Affleck. I didn't think his movies were that good. I called him a wannabe Matt Damon and The Town was a wannabe The Departed. I still stand by the statement about The Town but after Good Will Hunting Affleck started to grow on me. He is a very talented actor no doubt but he isn't as good as the other actors that are very similar to him, meaning Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg. Then I saw Argo. I hate admitting when I'm wrong but Ben Affleck may as well change his name to perfect.\n\tIt's no secret that Argo won the academy award for Best Picture, and I think it deserved it but after seeing the movie a second time I wouldn't say it is flawless. It 100% deserves the Oscar but there were a thing or two wrong with the movie itself. I will start with the hate before I praise for 80% of this review. The basic plot is to rescue six Americans trapped in Iran during a mass protest and death to America ordeal in the late 70s. Affleck comes up with the idea to get them out using the idea of Canadian film crew. That is a great idea but I wish they spent more time in Iran. The idea of Argo is a cover up and they have that one intense scene and then the climax and the movie is over. There was so much time emphasizing the point of Argo and little work on the actual plan. The second problem is a nitpick and that is the movie only has a real impact the first time you watch it. The close encounters become less intense knowing the ending. I think that is important for a movie but it isn't the downfall of any movie at all.\n\tOk, that is out of the way let's move onto the brilliance, I mean Ben Affleck. This guy has been around the film industry all his life and he directed and starred in this movie. He was absolutely flawless. The writing was near perfect. Each scene flowed into the next so well and there was a lot of emotional attachment to many of the characters. The opening scene into this movie is crazy and sets the movie off in the right direction. The beginning is always important and it does a great job of hooking the audience to the story. That then led into the John Goodman character and the other guy bringing laughs and entertainment which led into the intense and thrilling ending. The ending to this movie the first time is so special. Little words are spoken but there is so much tension and a race against the clock. \n\tI never heard of this story before and I say this because it is historically accurate. These are real people and the fake Argo movie was really thought up. I'm surprised kids don't learn about this in school because the character Affleck plays is a hero and yes, the CIA kept it secret but when the story became public by Bill Clinton I thought schools would have taught it. In the credits of the movie they show real pictures of the events and people compared to the movie and they were spot on. Affleck and the producers did their research and down to the slightest detail made this historical moment come to life. From the shredding to the flag burning to the lady on the mic on TV. \n\tLike I said, the characters are fantastic in the movie. John Goodman plays the funny man in a lot of movie but the fact that he pulls this off in such a serious movie like this is commendable. The six Americans each brought their own likes and dislikes into the movie and they portray the stress of the situation so well. Some of them don't like the Argo plan and how can you expect them to? It was easy to put myself in their situation which made it easy for me to sympathize for them which allowed me to love this movie. \n\tThe race against time and tension of almost getting caught is exciting. Audiences love covering their eyes, praying the Iranian police don't figure out they are American. It is that excitement that was probably exaggerated for Hollywood, especially the end, but this is necessary. This movie didn't have to be 100% historically accurate to be good. I can see people complaining about that but not me. It's a movie, sometimes you have to accept that the reality of the real life situation is not good for the big screen or business. I know the first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat, holding my breath, waiting for the situation to unfold. \n\tOverall, Argo is an Academy Award winner for best picture and of all the movies nominated it was the right choice. Do I love this movie? No, but it was very good and very deserving of the honor of best picture. This movie is a rollercoaster the first time but gets less exciting after that. It is still a great movie and it completely changed my view on Ben Affleck. So, for that I say touch\u00e9 to Argo and give it the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

In 1979 Tehran an angry crowd invaded the USA embassy taking the personnel as hostage (Iran Hostage Crisis that will last several months), however 6 members of staff managed to escape leaving the building through a back door. They sought and received asylum in the official residence of the ambassador of Canada that hid them in his cellar. In Washington in the meanwhile the CIA was desperately trying to come up with a suitable plan to pull out the 6 diplomats out of the country unharmed. Every option seemed bad until special Agent Toni Mendez had an outlandish idea. With the help of two film makers an a B movie sci-fi script (Argo) he set up a fake production company in Hollywood spinning a web of lies as a cover up or his real intentions. He gave the 6 Americans false identities as a Canadian production crew and flew to Tehran. He trusted that his deceit was bizarre enough to save them all from torture and maybe death.\nThe best feature of the film is that it feels unpretentious, a quality Hollywood thriller with an historical background and outstanding performances of actors and a very solid direction by Affleck (that doubles up as actor portraying Mendez). It is real-ish, thrilling and entertaining. The action and suspense is kept constant through the film, never letting you get bored or lost in the intricacies of the CIA bureaucracy. Some voices say that there are inaccuracies in the film and that Canada did risk a lot more that the movie leads you to believe. I couldn't really say what's the real story, but from a cinematic point of view this is a charming picture with a poignant plot that deserved the Academy Award Oscar to Best Motion Picture of the Year.",

Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director and that his previous success with Gone Baby Gone (2007) and The Town (2010) were no fluke. Also, the gritty/grainy look to this film really helps to capture the vibe and tone of the time period it supposed to have taken place in late 70's.  The film provides great tension, suspense, and drama! Oscar for best picture well deserved!",

However, it was blunt and to the point in an almost detrimental way. Nothing really happens apart from some undeveloped characters pretend to be film crew under the direction of CIA agent Mendez, with a suspenseful wait at the airport under close scrutiny of hostile Iranians as the main bit of drama. Even the ending is a bit of an anti-climax. It felt like a very drawn out, but mostly quite entertaining and sometimes tense, sequence from a film, rather than a film unto itself.",

The same thing happened with Braveheart (I'm from Scotland) and U-571.

It's an American movie so the heroes are whoever they bloody well choose! The day Canada makes a similar movie, that's the day they can correct the historical inaccuracies! Let's just enjoy Argo for it is; a phenomenal effort from Ben Affeck, a taut and intense thriller with moments of sly humour, especially from John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and solid acting from the rest of the players.

            "content": "It's a rarity to have a history film come along that actually gets the details correct and still manages to entertain audiences for its entirety.  Some recent releases, such as The Iron Lady or J. Edger, really failed to hold the attention of an audience - quite possibly because the filmmakers tried to stuff too much information into a two hour film.  Needless to say, there have also been many successful, critically acclaimed history films - Glory, Frost Nixon, and JFK come to mind.  You should feel free to add Argo to those success stories.\n\n \n\nBen Affleck stars in and directs Argo, a film chronicling a subplot taking place during the Iranian Revolution of 1979.  Based on a true story, Argo follows Tony Mendez, a CIA specialist who hatches a plot to rescue a group of U.S. embassy staffers hiding out in Tehran.   Aided by the Canadian ambassador to Iran, Mednez attempts to disguise the staffers as a film crew in order to fool the Iranians into allowing them to escape.\n\n \n\nThe film locations look spectacular and the use of old TV news footage, along with Jimmy Carter dialogue, help bring this film together.  However, locations are nothing without the acting in this film.  Simply superb would be an understatement, and while Affleck has taken some heat for playing a Latino, he really is at his best.  This well-rounded cast also includes John Goodman, Kyle Chandler, and Alan Arkin - all of whom deserve to be recognized for their brilliant supporting roles.\n\n \n\nThe bottom line is it's always a huge bonus when you can go to a movie, be completely entertained for two hours and learn about history while you're at it.  Now, not every single detail is correct in this film, but most history films are forced to do small rewrites in order to add suspense.  Regardless, Argo is one of the year's best films and if it isn't nominated for several academy awards, including best film and best director, there is very little justice in the world.",

            "content": "\"Argo-f*ckyaself!\" exclaim Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), John Chambers (John Goodman), and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) the moment they realize their comically absurd idea to rescue 6 members of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from angered Islamic militants during the 1979 Iranian Revolution actually gains some fruitful traction. Now that's something you can see Ben Affleck directing right? If you haven't seen his films Gone Baby Gone (2007) or The Town (2010), or even knew that he actually has directed, you may be answering with a marginal \"Yes\" to a flat out \"No\" to that question. Let's be honest, we all knew Affleck first as an actor, mostly for his great performance in Good Will Hunting (1997) and then...pretty much nothing else. He went down a pretty steep decline from there on with a slew of so-so action films, romedies/comedies, and dramas that, in the course of a decade, earned him 9 Golden Raspberry awards, scathing disapproval from comic nerds for Daredevil (2003) (now your memory is kicking in isn't it), and a declined interest from audiences. Personally, I always liked Affleck, and I actually didn't mind him as Daredevil (it really was just horrible, horrible direction), but I can't deny that the movies he has acted in are of poor substance. Then came his directing career, and I finally felt a rush of hope again for his stamp on Hollywood. His first two films I mentioned above are fantastic and are already a part of my movie collection; they proved that he had the capability of telling stories that were grounded in reality and that capitalized on the story itself and not on big action or insanely intricate set pieces to move it forward. With that being said, class is dismissed for Ben Affleck 101, and it's time to delve into his next great work- Argo.\n\nArgo is a gripping, smart, and well-crafted suspense film that Affleck directs with such admirable attention that it's easily his most accomplished work; what it lacks in emotional substance it makes up for in its humor, acute pacing and structural balance, and entertaining political satire. The film is based on the true events from a former classified CIA operation that took place during the 1979 Iranian Revolution in Iran. During a ferocious mob protest just outside the gated U.S. Embassy of Tehran, Islamic activists, angry with the U.S. for supporting the ejection of their beloved Reza Shah, take over the embassy and all its staff except for six who are able to escape,  and are taken in by the Canadian ambassador in Iran Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). Surely to be captured and killed if found, these six Americans must stay indoors and out of sight until they can some how escape the country. Enter the United States State Department and CIA. Ex-fil and CIA specialist Tony Mendez is brought in, initially for consultation, to put together a plan to exfiltrate, or bring home, these trapped people. With the situation escalating quickly as the Islamic revolutionaries come closer to finding out that there are missing employees as well as the rise of Iranian security around every corner, all initial proposals to extract the employees prove to be ultimately ineffective. That is until Mendez lands on the idea that the best way to get their people back is to make a completely fabricated Hollywood, science-fiction film (along the lines of Star Wars) that requires \"exotic\" locations to shoot, that way he can enter Iran with less suspicion as well as disguise the six U.S. Embassy workers as a part of the film crew and convince the security at the Iran airport that they had been there for location scouting. With the help of two hilarious Hollywood \"somebodies,\" make-up artist John Chambers and producer Lester Siegel, Mendez initiates his plan to fool not just one, but three countries (United States, Canada, Iran), into thinking a science-fiction movie by the name of Argo is actually in production in order to ensure diplomatic peace . Badda bing, badda boom, you got yourself a rescue mission of insanely improbable odds that makes for some heart-pounding and intense cinema.\n\nIf there's one thing this film nailed perfectly, it's tension. Affleck is able to expertly craft rising tension in both the opening sequence as well as the final act. Some of you are probably \"edge of the seat\" standers, but I'm a nail biting kinda guy, and my nails haven't been grossly pedicured by my teeth due to a film in a while, until now. These scenes are truly enchanting, and the key to creating such palpable suspense is by utilizing simple \"cause and effect\" scenarios that hook to large and catastrophic consequences, consequences that are slowly established through the course of the film; this Affleck accomplishes with a natural feel.\n\nYou wouldn't think at first, but this film actually has a large, sort of ensemble, cast. They aren't exactly A-list celebs, but the supporting roles are filled with familiar and respectable actors who you are surely to recognize from television and other film. Shout out to Titus Weliver who played The Man in Black on Lost who makes an appearance here! Love him! The performances all around are solid, no one drags but no one rises above the bar. The best performances I'm going to give to John Goodman, who has never been so good, as well as Alan Arkin, who provide the film with most of its humor as the comedic-relief duo in Hollywood.\n\nAnother feat of the film is the way it is able to tell three separate narratives of different tones and still feel like one solid unit. If you're confused you'll understand when you see it, but Mendez has to go through three different worlds here to accomplish his task: one is in Washington D.C. with all the hammer down political who-ha, two is in the unpredictable and fun Hollywood scene, and three is in the life-and-death war zone in Iran. After knowing this you start to see the ambition of the film, and why Affleck should be commended for his efforts and awarded in their success. It's hard to notice how effortlessly the tone switches from an almost caper-style vibe in the Hollywood setting, to the intense, real, documentary feel in Iran. This is all thanks to a crisp screenplay that knows when not to overstay its welcome in certain scenes and sustains the over-looming idea that every second that passes, and every moment this fake film does not gain enough stability to achieve support from the government, the closer six Americans will be publicly executed leading to some not-so-peaceful diplomatic reformation.\n\nAn area I felt the film falls short in is in its tender moments, the parts where they try to probe at your heart for some tears and full character connections and relations. The theme of marriage and father-child relations is the most prominent emotional idea the film brings forth but it never quite emphasizes on it to the point of needing any sort of further resolution in the end; it attempts the jump but doesn't stick it. If Affleck could have accomplished this as well, the film would have impressed me even more, but as a result, doesn't blow me away. Regardless, Argo is a great achievement for Affleck and a film that should be seen. Although, It is not for everyone, so for those looking for some high-octane stuff, you may find much of it slow and boring, but those interested in good storytelling, solid performances, and attention to detail that will have you glued to your seat, you're in for a treat.\n\nAs a final note, I'd like to call to attention the name of the real CIA hero- Tony Mendez (Antonio Mendez). As you will also see if you watch the film and sit through the end credits, where they give you a wonderful juxtaposition of screenshots from the film to actual pictures of the real people and events, that Tony Mendez is a Mexican American. Hm, Ben Affleck- born in Berkeley, California with Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry. Pretty much everyone else in the film closely matches and resembles their real-life counterparts, but the lead actor who we see the most in the film does not. Just saying! Controversy anyone?",

            "content": "This historically inaccurate drama directed by Ben Affleck was adapted from the book The Master of Disguise by CIA operative Tony Mendez, and Joshuah Bearman's 2007 Wired article The Great Escape. Story is about Mendez who led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Inaccuracies were never an obstacle for receiving seven nominations for the 85th Academy Awards and winning three (Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture) - actually in most recent cases movies with such inaccuracies won lots of awards.\r\n\r\nAffleck as Mendez did his job really well and Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman in supporting roles, were on the same level.  I mentioned the historical accuracy issue, and Argo has been criticized for minimizing the role that the Canadian embassy played in the rescue and for falsely claiming that the American refugees were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies. In the film's narrative there was no adequate historical context for the actual events it portrays, and such errors of omission lead all of the Iranian characters in the film to have unbalanced depiction of an entire ethnic national group. Too much artistic freedom to change the events leaves bitter taste in my mouth. There were too many things which simply never happened: In the film, while pretending to scout for filming locations at a bazaar, the crew face suspicious glances, and are accosted by a few vendors, who suspect them of being American. In reality, this scouting trip never happened! In the film, the crew again encounters suspicion while purchasing plane tickets to Zurich [while at the Tehran check in waiting for confirmation of bookings for the group]; in reality Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from three different airlines ahead of time, without any issues. The film depicts a dramatic last-minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration and a bureaucratic crisis in which Mendez declares he will proceed with the mission. Carter delayed authorization by only 30 minutes, and that was before Mendez had left Europe for Iran! In the film, there is again a tense situation when the crew tries to board the plane, and their identities are nearly discovered. In reality, there was no confrontation with security officials at the departure gate! In the film, before the plane takes off, gun-toting Iranian guards try to stop the plane in a dramatic chase sequence; in reality, there was no runway chase at the airport. As Mark Lijek described it, \"Fortunately for us, there were very few Revolutionary Guards about. It's why we turned up for a flight at 5.30 in the morning; even they weren't zealous enough to be there that early. The truth is the immigration officers barely looked at us and we were processed out in the regular way. We got on the flight to Zurich and then we were taken to the US ambassador's residence in Berne. It was that straightforward.\"\r\n\r\nI still give the movie positive score - but it was just above average with too much imagination for a real event tag!  Enjoy the narration and don't think too much... if you do... you'll spoil the enjoyment!",

The politics that go into picking an Oscar are a little ridiculous.  This selection was probably more fraught with conflict than most.

            "content": "Or: How to Make a Fake Movie and Save the World\ntrevsreviews.wordpress.com\n\nBen Affleck's latest film, Argo, tells the true story of a 1980 CIA operation to get six hostages out of Iran by disguising them as a film crew for a major motion picture of the same name. The film was completely fabricated with storyboards and posters just for the mission. It's an incredible story; so incredible that if it was not real, this film would feel completely preposterous.\n\n   Argo is a story driven film, and that's not meant to be critical. What I mean by that is the major foundation of the film is this remarkable true story. Everything else is just exists to support it. The cinematography is solid, but not extraordinary. It does a good job giving the film a realistic, documentary feel without going over the top. Same thing goes for the editing. There are unique moments such as a scene when the main character is driving through the crowded city. There is shot of Iranians eating KFC and then, farther down the street, they cut to a man who's been hung from a construction crane. Juxtaposing these images together effectively shows the battle over the westernization of Iran in a visual way. Lastly, the acting is adequate. There are not any breakout performances or anything, but everyone is believable as the real life people under the circumstances.\n\n   Munich, Lincoln (review coming soon), and even Hoosiers as well as many other films based on a historical event have an amazing gift of generating suspense even though the audience knows the ending. It's not a spoiler to say the hostages make it out of Iran. It's history. Honestly, Argo would not be nearly as good without suspense and Ben Affleck succeeds the way Spielberg and others have.\n\nBen Affleck has established himself as not just some actor turned director, but a legitimate filmmaker. His previous films, Gone Baby Gone and The Town have won over several critics. Even though I think Argo is his best yet, I feel all three of his films are solid, but not great. Don't get me wrong, I like his films, but none of them really stand out to me. Well, I suppose consistency is more difficult to achieve than one exceptional  film. Just ask M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and John Singleton (Boyz N The Hood).",

            "content": "With more tension found within its run time than a highly strung back longbow, 'Argo' is a history lesson in a beautifully crafted art form - serving both as a way to teach its audience as well engross and entertain. Through being highly exciting, enjoyable and easily compelling 'Argo' as a film is able to outlay the fact with enough depth - to make it thorough - whilst not feeling to heavy - thus detracting audience attention from the content. From the outset 'Argo' takes hold of its audience, captivating them and keeping hold through its entirety, showcasing scenes that not only inform but placed between scenes of utter discomfort. It is this careful balance of scene types - coupled with excellent cinematography - that stands out most from the film come its close.\nStabilizing everything that the film strives to be, Ben Affleck (Director) manages to give across his filmic vision and through this determination to succeed with the film, 'Argo' feels complete in almost every element. Baring all about a human conflict, and the human side of politics, 'Argo' does not shy from the harshness of reality - with a side order of filmic history that may be unbeknownst to the majority of audience members. Much like last years 'The Artist', this film outlays a part of the industry that may not be common knowledge to the plenty - thus those who have interest in the subject matter will find enough to walk away having grasped something. \n\nA historical drama thriller, 'Argo' is adapted from the book by 'Master of Disguise' by CIA operative Tony Mendez. As such it is based entirely on fact - this true story nature of the film really helps deliver the intensity of the plot - and outlines the true story of Mendez - portrayed by Ben Affleck, who during the Iran Hostage Crisis (1979) managed to lead the rescue of six U.S diplomats hiding out in the streets of Tehran. By concocting a plan to stage a fake movie production, 'Argo', a science fiction epic, Mendez pretends to shoot his actors in the troubled country. By connections the CIA had, at the time, with Hollywood and the help of two working professionals, John Chambers (John Goodman) a make up artist and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) a working producer. \nBy risking his life under the disguise of a Canadian filmmaker, with entering the American hating country, Mendez sets about to put his plan into action and help the 6 who are stranded in trying to leave the country. Under the codename 'Canadian Caper' this rescue attempt went down in both film history and that of CIA work. Therefore, the choice to produce this film really feels fitting when put into perspective of the collaborative efforts made by the people involved at the time. A homage to the past, and an outline to the manner in which cooperatively different industries can work to fix a greater matter, 'Argo' is an interesting watch, most definitely, and holds one of the most engrossing narratives of all time. \n\nBen Affleck is a certified screenwriter, having gained recognition for many of his films, he is also an established actor fitting many different roles that have come into his career path. With an interest in directing and producing, his latest ventures have involved this side of the industry also. With 'Argo' the multi-talented  A-lister has been involved on the producing, directing and acting side of the film. To review his contribution to the film is to look into each of these. With regards to the producer role that he played, Affleck has crafted a film that is wonderfully made. A film that showcases the time it is set, whilst delivering a cast of relatively unknown - except perhaps the three main - actors into the films many roles. \nBy choosing to produce this film to reflect real life, as a producer working to craft a film befitting its purpose, Affleck has succeeded in bringing a realism and tension to proceedings. As a director, Affleck has managed to bring his vision of events to the forefront of the film screen. His choice of locations and decision of framings used really manages to bring the narrative to life comfortably. By managing the pacing of the film, and by standing firm to his vision, Affleck is able to direct a film in such a way that characters become compelling to watch, and tension is so readily crafted. \nFinally as an actor, in the lead role none-the-less, Affleck manages to showcase his talent in this art form. Completely in the moment, his Mendez solidifies the threat and risk that he has in doing the job he has to do. Through being realistic in his performance, the empathy of the character is easily found, thus bringing about a connection that most lead characters struggle to hold. A one man army - with some help - 'Argo' is a film that completely testifies the talent held by Affleck in multiple filmic roles. \n\nFeaturing a cast of actors that are found out of the Hollywood limelight, the film feels independent whilst maintaining levels more associated with the larger budget productions. Aside Affleck, the roles that work best within this film are those performed by Goodman and Arkin. With regards to Goodman, his John Chambers feels lighthearted - a great thing to find in such a tense film- and personifies the OSCAR winner in a manner unlike the other roles found. A performance more akin to his more realistic roles, his Chambers is the everyman role - the one in which audience members will find most compatibility with. Arkin is a sarcastic - yet probably realistic - view of Hollywood life and its industry. A confident and overly played character, his producer controls the screen in every scene he features. By holding attention, his character performance is befitting of any acclaim its receives. \n\nDelivering real threat in abundance throughout the film, as well as outlining facts about a less known situation 'Argo' is a great movie that has been produced and directed to perfection. With great acting and an instant engrossment level, this film is an easy sell to promote a watch. Enjoyable, exciting, tense and enthralling 'Argo' deserves its acclaim and the awards it has garnered since release. A",

All in all an unbelievably tense film, a la all good prisoner escape movies. But you also have a fantastic comic turn from Goodman and Arkin.\n\nThe film feels 70s from the period-piece opening Warner Bros. logo, and seems to be a big nod to All The Presidents Men et al. The Twin Towers poster is shown in a lingering scene to remind us where this 1979 revolution is ultimately going to lead us.\n\nThe ending maybe lets it down, as they seem under pressure to deliver some action and a feel-good note.

Neither one seemed to overshadow the other. Just when you think the movie is getting too comfortable when in Iran there is a scene where it ratchets the tension up another degree. \r\n\r\nEven if you are someone who gets bored from academy award movies i highly suggest you check this movie out as it moves along at a pretty good pace",

The film predicates itself upon pounding suspense that should rivet its audience, but it doesn't. Everything seems to be too dramatic and hollywoodized. Not to mention, the film moderately confounds itself during this \"epic\" climax. \nNow perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh, after all the first 20 or so minutes are pretty good. The film makes some nice incorporation of old news footage and makes the raids seem pretty authentic, but from then on you know this is what Hollywood thinks happened, not what actually did. Perhaps the most glaring error in this film though really occurs in the editing, it seemed as if the direction of the film became so murky that it just had no where to go besides ending the thing in cliche fashion. I don't know what people like in this film, besides the fact it makes you feel warm and joyous (sort of). Anyway this is just another example of the Best Picture being far from it.",

We in Canada know of this as \"The Canadian Caper\" because the six were sheltered by Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor and his wife. I was about 16 at the time and can remember the national pride felt and expressed when Canada took credit for returning those six Americans to their homeland. What nobody knew publicly then was that the CIA coordinated their escape by creating fake identities for the six as members of a fictional movie crew on a scouting trip to Iran. Although there are reports that some of the last-minute tension depicted in the movie never happened, it works as a movie and probably accurately conveys how nervous and scared the Americans were that they'd be found out before they could get out of the country. And you gotta love those '70s hairstyles and glasses!",

            "content": "The story of Argo might be hard to swallow if it weren't so wonderfully true.  A lot of movies claim to be based on fact but few ever come off with the feeling that they are anything more than Hollywood hot air.  Argo is different.  Based on fact, it tells a story that would collapse into phony clich\u00e9 in other hands, but under the direction of Ben Affleck, the movie is a nearly perfect thriller about how, in 1979, during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, a group of Islamic terrorists were robbed of a handful of their potential victims.\n\nThe movie opens with the recreation of the takeover.  It says something of the craftsmanship of the film that despite the fact that we know how it ended, this scene develops a scary tension.  We see the revolutionaries breaking the chains of the gates and storming the embassy as inside the Embassy workers rush to shred and burn all of their important papers.  Fifty-two Americans are taken hostage, but six people walk out the back door.  Frantic to find shelter, they find that the only person who will give them shelter is the Canadian Ambassador who hides the group in his crawl space. \n\nBack home, the CIA is frantic.  Tossing out all manner of goofball ideas, they are at a loss on how to rescue their people until one of their specialists Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) gets the goofiest idea of them all.  He will fly alone into Tehran, retrieve the hostages, and fly back out posing as a Canadian film crew who are there scouting locations for a bad science fiction movie called \"Argo\".  In the wake of the success of Star Wars, a rip-off seems perfectly logical, especially one that needs a desert location - hey if George Lucas can do it, why can't they?\n\nThe operation seems doomed from the start, but stranger things have happened.  Mendez hires an Oscar winning make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman) and a laconic producer named Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to help secure financing, make sure that the production is air tight and to make sure that the production makes the news - the Iranians need to be made to think that the movie is the real deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Mendez flies into Tehran and lays out the plan to the trapped sextet who remind him that his crackpot scheme could mean their public execution.  Arriving in town he is reminded of the gravity of the situation when he spots a dead man hanging from a construction rig.  Time is of the essence, the movie repeatedly cuts back the Embassy where Iranian children and elderly carpet weavers are employed to stitch together shredded documents at the same time that the terrorists are becoming aware that six people who are on the Embassy ledgers are missing.\n\nThe final half hour of this movie is a masterwork of pure suspense.  Most filmmakers are satisfied with chases and violence for their effect, but Affleck trusts our intelligence.  He lets us in on a lot of information early on and establishes a well-plotted narrative so that we know what is happening all the way through.  When we get to the final half hour, we know who the players are and what is at stake.  We know the escape plot as the crew gets from one tense checkpoint to the next.  There are small details established in these scenes - a ringing telephone; a stalled bus; a bad computer connection; a locked door; a Polaroid photograph - that build the suspense out of logic, not clich\u00e9.  This film is so perfectly paced that you want to applaud it.\n\nThere are great supporting performances here, and that is key.  Victor Garber is perfect as Ken Taylor, the Canadian Ambassador.  As is Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA contact who acts at a key moment when the mission looks like it will be recalled by the folks at the White House.  Also good is John Goodman as the make-up man John Chambers.  But the best praise goes to Alan Arkin in a wonderful peformance as the cynical, sleepy-eyed producer Lester Siegel who assures Mendez \"If I'm making a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit.\"  Arkin, now 78, has always been a treasure, an actor who seems to occupy a movie with such ease that he almost seems to live there.\n\nAll of these elements come together in a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, suspenseful and at times very funny.  Affleck, with this film and his previous directing efforts on The Town and Gone Baby Gone has a sure hand as a director.  He clearly loves the craft and he respects us as viewers.  Not only that, but he puts himself in the starring role and resists the temptation to make it flashy.  He could reasonably have given himself a heroic posture here, but he lets us know that Mendez is only a key player, that so many people at home and abroad have a hand in this mission.\n\nArgo could have gone wrong is so many ways, but there are sly in-jokes here about the way Hollywood works that you almost feel like rewarding it just for that.  There's a beautiful scene late in the film when the fake film crew show the airport security some storyboards for the science fiction film - they, of course, think the movie is real.  For a moment the young Iranians get so caught up in the magic of movies that they forget their jobs.  That this scene takes place at a moment teeming with suspense says something of the filmmaking and of the pure power of the movies.",

Argo is an edge of your seat thriller that Affleck paces with ease and shoots with an eye of for detail that rivals directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Jean Luc Godard. The true story adds to the suspense even knowing the outcome. Even though he has been ridiculed for his acting in the past Affleck's Mendez is able to portray a sense of confidence and fear with a single glance at the camera.

            "content": "The Academy loves a Hollywood comeback and in this case it was that of actor, and now reputable producer and director Ben Affleck in his resurgence as one of the industry's hottest and in-demand stars. After a number of box office disasters and Razzie wins and nominations, Affleck is able to demonstrate that although his position  as an actor may not be as one of the greatest of modern-day film, his presence behind (rather than in front) of the camera is something to be looked upon.\n\nThe winner of the Oscar for Best Picture truly encompasses what is and always has been the great American film - suspense, emotion and drama that is totally believable. Argo fits all of these categories as an almost-accurate depiction of the rescue mission of six American fugitives in the wake of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. This suspense-filled picture is a dramatization of the events following the nail-biting rescue mission of these six escapees with the support of the Canadian government and the CIA - led by intelligence operative Tony Mendez in his attempt to get the fugitives to pose with him as a Canadian film crew on location in Iran as a cover-up so they can safely return home.\n\nThe supportive performances of John Goodman as makeup artist John Chambers and Alan Arkin as acting legend Lester Siegel are used as comedic tools to instigate some kind of amusement in a picture that could have been - considering the historical context that this film's based upon - a truly depressing and sad story. Goodman and Arkin's performances are, interestingly, the only performances where we see some true and authentic acting come through. The roles of Mendez and the six hostages do not seem to be performances at all - let alone those done by professional actors. It's like watching a documentary intermitted with the reconstruction of a horrific event and that's why this picture worked. You seem to forget you're watching actors in a dramatized account of what happened in the fall of 1979.\n\nI kind of wished Affleck would have stayed out of the picture completely and simply stuck to directing and producing - after all, the endless awards he won for this picture were for his behind the scenes work, not for his acting. Nonetheless, the film really isn't about acting at all or Affleck in that sense. It's really about retelling a sad and desperate time in world history that endless manipulated government reports cannot tell so well as a visual depiction such as this movie. \nGeorge Clooney's print on the picture is also fiercely evident as one of the film's producers. The deep political atmosphere and context that \"Argo\" is based upon indicates that the film is more than just a drama; it's a piece of history that needs retelling and the almost-collapse of democracy.",

            "content": "This Oscar-winning film of 2012 was a pretty cool and accurate thrill ride through an important event of the Iranian revolution. \n\nPLOT:During the Iranian revolution in the 1970s, the people of Iran break into the U.S. embassy in Tehran and take 52 Americans hostage. However, six of the hostages are able to slip away and reside with the Canadian ambassador's house. No one has any idea what to do until Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) comes up with the absurd idea of making a fake movie set in Iran, entitled Argo, to sneak beyond Iran's border and rescue the six hostages. With the help of director John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), he attempts to sell his idea of the fake sci-fi and make his way into Iran. It's a great plot executed very well. \n\nACTING:The acting in here was pretty good. I don't think it was truly exceptional, but it was still really good. Ben Affleck played a pretty good part as the clever Tony Mendez. John Goodman and Alan Arkin were pretty outstanding as John Chambers and Lester Siegel, however. There were really no bad performances in the film, but aside from these guys, no one really stood out. \n\nSCORE:The score in here was pretty good. I didn't think it ultimately stood out, but it got the movie along well. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film was pretty cool. I like how it was based on a true story. Aside from the lead performances and good execution, this film seemed very accurate. From what I've learned about the Iranian revolution and the time period, this seemed very much accurate, along with the pictures showed at the end to clarify. However, I didn't like how it lagged in the middle and then suddenly picked up at the end. It makes it seem a little unbalanced. Do I think it deserved it's Best Picture award? Yes, I do. It's still a finely-done, accurate, thrilling for the most part, darkly-humored film that reminds me a lot of The King's Speech in structure. \n\nOVERALL,an awesome film with a great plot, pretty good acting, pretty good score, strong accuracy, dark humor, and thrills, but it felt uneven due to a lag in the middle.",

The movie accurately showed that the Shah's Iran was ripe for revolution and that revolution was inevitable if not warranted. It also showed accurately that the revolution turned ugly and that the religious fanaticism shown by the newly installed regime may have been populist but was hardly worthy of the popular support it at first received.\n\nAside from that the story was basically factual and poetic license was only used for entertainment, suspense and excitement. It certainly wasn't used to show America in any great light nor did it show Iran in an unfairly poor light.\n\nIn it's own right the tale was a good yarn and this film told it well.

The film is infused with dark humor, vast in terms of information and have fine characterization all around. Alan Arkin and John Goodman really nailed it at the end but the real star here is Ben Affleck -- both in the lead as well as a director. His is a really commendable directorial venture that deserved the top honours i.e., Academy Awards.

Sometimes even way after the movie - at least in my case.\n\nI absolutely love the direction and the script. The movie goes so smoothly and realistically in a way that you hardly sense a flaw at any given moment.\n\nWhen someone who has never seen Iran regime before portray Iranian security forces with such balanced image between skepticism, harshness, practicality and yet positivity, one should appreciate the efforts the screenwriter put in this work.\n\nAssuming that it's meant to be a totally-real documentary, this tells about how much Hollywood ganges know about their usual lies so they are always able to eliminate them then required.\n\nI don't want to argue about the truthfulness of events (a hot topic here in the Middle East). I will leave that to history, not to cinema. I believe everyone has the right to see things from different perspective and to do so in a movie.\n\nWhat I want to focus on here is that the director, Ben Affleck, has an absolutely unique and deep way of building connection to people from a very deep point in a way which can leave a quality touch I do not remember I experienced in anything showing on a screen before.\n\nI don't know what's Mr. Affleck's next, but what I know I will make time to watch everything he does from now on.\n\nAli",

Don't get me wrong....Argo is not a terrible movie. But it does teeter dangerously on the border of \"mediocre\" and \"sucks balls.\"  And that is only because of gifted performances by John Goodman and Alan Arkin.  Otherwise, it would drop right past \"sucks balls\" and into \"destroy every copy.\"\n\nBased on historical events, Argo attempts to recount the secret operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the horrific Iran hostage crisis. As the Iranian revolution reached its chaotic peak in 1979, radical militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. Six \"lucky\" Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador.\n\nThe Argo team went to great lengths to get to the gnat's ass detail on the cheesy fashion, embarrassing hairstyles and Burt Reynolds-esque facial hair trends of the late 70's.  But after the initial embassy takeover, Argo veers off into a fictional \"fantasy land\" re-creation of the historical facts.  Worse yet, Argo completely ignores the REAL story of the 52 hostages who were held captive and tortured for 444 days.  Instead, they focus on a tiny sliver of success associated with one of the most humiliating chapters of US history.  Why, you ask?  Because Hollywood was involved in this great escape. Naming Argo \"Best Picture\" allowed the Academy to celebrate Hollywood's heroic involvement in this sidebar event.  High fives!!\n\nHollywood and dim witted movie goers everywhere seem to be enchanted with all things Affleck.  And for the life of me, I can't figure it out. The genesis seems to go back to the unimaginably over-rated Good Will Hunting. He can seemingly do no wrong - as an actor, screenwriter or director.  STOP!! Hold on a second - as Affleck may be involved in more unwatchable pieces of shit than any actor of his generation.  A small sampling includes Phantoms (1998), Armageddon (1998), 200 Cigarettes (1999), Reindeer Games (2000), Daredevil (2003), Gigli (2003), Surviving Christmas (2004), Smokin' Aces (2007) and the just released To The Wonder.  And let's not forget his directorial/writing/producing debut (no, this is not a joke), 1993's \"I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meat Hook, and Now I Have a Three-Picture Deal at Disney.\"\n\nThere were dozens of 2012 films better than this middle-of-the-packer.  From Academy ignored gems like Moonrise Kingdom, Seven Psychopaths, Killing Them Softly, Bernie and Holy Motors - to mass consumption flicks like Skyfall, The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers.  Even the animated Wreck it Ralph and Frankenweenie offered more bang for the buck.  Not that the Academy gave us a whole lot to choose from. Amour (getting old sucks),  Beasts of the Southern Wild (cute kid in a crappy movie), Life of Pi (bad book, worse film), Lincoln (superb acting in a lifeless movie), Silver Linings Playbook (mental illness can be cute, and funny!), Zero Dark Thirty (very good - even though I do not like pseudo documentaries) and Django Unchained (outstanding but overlooked).  Take out Zero Dark Thirty and Django Unchained, and Argo just may be \"king of the shit heap.\"",

            "content": "Oh man. I have so much to say about this film. Let's start with its accolades: Argo won Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing at the Academy Awards, Best Picture Drama and Best Director at the Golden Globes, Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the SAG awards, and a couple of BAFTAs. All in all, the movie has done well.\n\nArgo is about a hostage crisis in Iran in 1979, in which the US embassy was stormed because the US had taken Iran's previous dictator in, a person that the people of Iran wanted to be tried and hanged, and in protest to CIA operations in Iran. Six embassy employees escape out the back door, and find refuge in the Canadian ambassador's home, where they tensely wait for a way to get home. Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA operative, has an idea to make a fake movie, make the trapped employees pose as a film crew, and wheedle them out of Iran that way. An idea that may be crazy enough to work.   \n\nThe acting in this film was spot on. That SAG award was well deserved. Ben Affleck was great as the burdened Tony Mendez, Bryan Cranston killed it as Mendez' supervisor Jack O'Donnell, and John Goodman was an amazing supporting act as John Chambers, a Hollywood makeup artist who already previously worked for the CIA. But who stole the show in every single scene that he was in? Alan Arkin, who played Lester Siegel, the film producer. The guy was the perfect blend of witty, intelligent, and just downright cool. I cannot imagine the film without him. With all of the dramatic stuff happening in Iran, the film definitely needed a character to ease the tension, something that made the film very relatable and not too stiff. Kudos to Ben Affleck on that. Other than that, the roles of the Canadian Ambassador, and the six American employees were done very very well. I'm just too lazy to list everyone's names.\n\nNow on to the film as a whole. The film was great, the dialogue was realistic, and Ben Affleck did a great job of keeping me on the edge of my seat without firing any guns. Many other reviewers have said this and I totally agree: that even if we know the outcome, it's still very exciting to watch. I loved how real news reports from 1979 were actually included and integrated into the film, it made everything feel all the more real.\n\nMy criticism? Well I'm not gonna bash too hard cause Ben Affleck is my hero. I understand that sometimes, dramatic license needs to be taken to make a film more watchable, but the whole making Tony Mendez the hero and giving the Canadians credit in the media and showing it as if they didn't earn it was garbage. Tony Mendez played a role in the actual crisis, but it was not as big as the Canadian ambassador, who in the film is merely regarded as a chauffeur. Ex-president Jimmy Carter and the Canadian Ambassador himself called Ben Affleck out on this, who changed the end, but it still didn't do Canadians much justice. It's also mentioned that the British and the New Zealanders turned the six employees away, when in fact both helped with getting them out of Iran. To me, logically, I feel as if these details could have easily been fixed in the film without screwing it up too much, but hey! Affleck had his reasons, I guess.\n\nThe next thing I wanted to talk about is the world's perception on Iran. Way to release a film bashing their country in the midst of a hostile nuke crisis with Iran and the States. The film definitely had too much 'look at all the killing and how crazy and terrorist-like these people are' and not enough 'these are the reasons for why they did what they did'. Just like, well, the US perception on all Muslims today. In the starting of the film, a reason for their outrage is summarized, but the violence and antics of the people in the film overshadows it by the end of the film, and I found myself unrightfully being a little pissed at the Iranians. I see a money making perception on this, as many people around the world are already pretty islamophobic and want films like Argo and Zero Dark Thirty to confirm their beliefs, but boy, did it still make me frustrated.\n\nFor ratings, I would like to give this film 4 stars because as I said, if little factors like making the film a little less pro-America and tweaking the historical facts so they don't piss anyone off happen, then it would be perfect. As a film on its own, it's great. As a film that's based on a real life event, more work could have been put into making sure the facts were straight.",

Ben Affleck had impressed me with 'The Town' and I was keen to see what else he had in his locker. I must admit he is certainly keeping the bar pretty high! Other than one, very debatable, comment about the fugitives being turned away by the British & New Zealand Embassies, it's a pretty fine film. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nAfter the Shah of Iran left in 1979 the country was in chaos. Fanatical religious factions took over who saw the USA as a great evil since they gave the, much hated, Shah a safe haven. This made life very difficult for the staff at the Embassy in Tehran; every day huge crowds gathered outside and chanted threats against the USA. Eventually they broke through the gates and took over the buildings but six of the staff escaped to the Canadian Ambassador's residence. As plans were drawn up to get them out, one man, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) comes up with something so audacious that it might just work! They were to pose as a film crew scouting locations in Iran, but to make it plausible; they'd need to make it look real. Enter John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin); these guys set up all the marketing and press to make it look legitimate. So Mendez sets off to Tehran with his boss, Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), holding things together in Washington. Can he get the fugitives to agree to the scam, and what's more, can they pull it off and get out of Iran?... Guess I'd better leave you hanging there.\n\nBeautifully made with all everything from the costumes to the technology accurate to a tee. I loved the way the film was intercut with archive news footage of the time; this really gave the audience a sense of the world at that juncture. All the performances were excellent with Ben Affleck taking centre stage, but I really enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin as a Hollywood producer; he stole it for me! There was real tension towards the end of the film; it slowly builds for quite a long time and I found that quite masterful. It's something that has been missing from many Hollywood films for a long time now but Affleck seems to have rediscovered the art. Because it's a film based in real events, there's little time for character development and I think it suffers slightly because of it. Other than that, it has some interesting songs on the soundtrack and it's well worth a look!\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.6/10",

The movie didn't focus on the lead character so much and his flaws, but instead on the complicated situation and how he maneuvered through it.  It's an incredible story that just happens to be true, and Affleck successfully translated it to the big screen.  Throughout it all, American patriotism did not run rampant, in fact, Americanism seemed to be slightly mocked if not grounded.

The Americans holed up in the Canadian embassy are wholly unsympathetic, and apart from one character, mere props, undeveloped. Affleck needs to work on closing his mouth when he isn't talking. There were several potentially interesting avenues left unexplored, like the allied embassies who turned the six Americans aside before the Canadians took them in. This is a film about an event that still shames most Americans right down to their toes, and it does nothing to make us feel better about what happened in 1979. Frankly, it angered me all over again, and for the skimpy punchline that underlays the story, hardly worth the effort.",

Affleck did a great job in this role and really got one involve in the telling of the tale.  Some intense scenes at the end of the movie really added to the finish.

The producers conveniently failed to compare this rescue to the ill fated helicopter rescue at the US embassy that lead to many american service men losing their lives, they somehow were trying hard to vindicate Jimmy Carter from that bigger historical failure, again just read the postscipts. Politics aside, I believe it was crafty, a brilliant film! The tension was so bottled up that I almost cried when the plane finally took off with the escapists.

Affleck created a movie that not only captured the era very well, but also made for a lot of suspense despite the audience basically knowing what was going to happen.\n\nThe most impressive part, to me, is the dating of the film. I don't get too picky and I'm sure I overlooked something, but it really does feel like a movie in the late 70s, early 80s. I've heard people complain that Affleck the actor was the worst part of the movie and that he almost ruined. I don't buy that. I thought he did a pretty good job and really helped the movie.\n\nThe political history is pretty interesting. You get a very brief synopsis at the top of the movie. Really only one character makes mention of just how shitty a thing the US did to the Iranians, and that comment is made in passing. But it truly is pretty disgusting, and we've shit on that region for decades. Gee, I wonder why they hate us. \n\nOverall, just a pretty interesting story. One of those tales that, with just a little movie skill, can be made into a great movie. I think Affleck did an above average job, and he was rewarded with Best Picture. Definitely nice to get lost in a movie for once instead of just sitting through them.",

That is what made argo one of the best movies we had in 2012. \nOf course, the true story has been powdered a little, especially at the last airport climax, but it has been done very smoothly by brilliant director Ben Affleck you could actually believe everything you were witnessing. \nThe photography, script, costume design, art direction and editing were all top notch, making this easily a near-perfect technical film. \nMoreover, the film never slowed down in pacing, hence was always entertaining ; Mr. Affleck has been doing extremely good pictures (three in a row now.....and they are the only three), so we can't overlook that he has become a brilliant director, despite his young age.\nI completely disagree that Argo has won all those awards this year due to political factors, despite the facts that it's always good for the states to show and point out they have vanquished their enemies, but Argo deserved all those awards it got, even though I would have always preferred life of pi for best picture. \nArgo will however always be remembered as one of the best films of 2012.",

This directly made sure that an even more ruthless dictator, Khomeini got in power. Well now the US had their badguy. In the rest of the film, this fact is never again addressed. Again a film that shows us how innocent, yet how brave Americans are. How they strive to uphold diplomacy and peace in the world, when in fact the US and the CIA does everything but. The film ends with cheering and moved Americans, celebrating themselves for a job well done. And again showing how the evil Muslims are disappointed, that they didn't get to decapitate some Americans. This is a peace of US propaganda, to show how the West can't never be wrong, and that we do all in the name of peace and democracy. The film was boringly shot and edited. The CGI looked cheap. The story was vague and we have seen it a hundred times before. It was clearly the best choice for the Best Picture Academy Award!",

Unfortunately, the rest of the film lacks the interesting stylistic vision of its opening moments.  Don't get me wrong; it is a well-made, competently acted, and engaging film that alternates between humor and suspense with some depth of political engagement underneath.  The plot is fascinating, particularly since it is based on a declassified CIA operation; however, the film devolves into a bifurcated narrative that never quite coheres in a truly meaningful way.  On the one hand, it wants to be a satire of Hollywood and its powers of illusion.  On the other hand, it wants to be a political thriller dealing with a controversial political event.  While it is entertaining on both fronts, it fails to bring the two together into something meaningful, and it really ends up downplaying the hostage crisis itself.  We never really get a sense of any Iranian characters.  Even interesting historical figures like Masoumeh Ebtekar (or \"Mary\" as the foreign press labeled her in a move of what Said would definitely call \"Orientalism\"), the spokesperson for the students who took over the U.S. embassy and still a prominent political figure in Iran.  The problem is that the film's fascinating opening section sets up the film to be a look a diplomatic nightmare that was--at least in part--caused by the United States' unwanted interventions into Iranian politics.  But the film leaves this behind as Affleck becomes a U.S. CIA superhero.  Too much of the film just feels way to slight for the intensely emotional and problematic event it depicts.  I would honestly love to see it redone with more of an objective, clinical approach to the events (like Bigelow adopts in Zero Dark Thirty or even a Michael Haneke type of disconnected presentation ) that presents them for our consideration without turning into a self-congratulatory tale about the United States will always win the day.",

As the film drove forward at the perfect pace, I found myself feeling the true emotion this film was meant to bring out. At the end, I had my fingers crossed and my heart pounding, fiercely hoping that the six Americans would make it out, even though deep down inside I knew that they would. I even breathed a deep sigh of relief when I saw the film take off. Walking out of that theater I knew two things: Argo was very much deserving of that Oscar win, and Ben Affleck was indeed robbed of his own nomination for best director.",

Argo tells the story of 6 Americans who barely escaped the U.S. Embassy as it was being taken over by hostile Iranian citizens after the overthrow of the Shah. While the rest of the embassy staff become hostages, the 6 find refuge in the home of the Canadian Embassy's director. Knowing that the Iranians will soon figure out they are missing and hunt them down, CIA extraction specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) hatches a wild scheme to sneak them out disguised as a film crew scouting locations for a make believe science fiction epic called \"Argo\". Ben Affleck takes Chris Terrio's script and crafts a suspenseful, thrilling and extremely entertaining true life historical drama that manages to be a lot of fun despite the serious nature of the story. Affleck deftly weaves in some welcome humor to give us a bit of relief from the almost non-stop tension, in just the right amount to gives us a break and make us even more susceptible when he decides to turn the screws again. He gets great performances out of his top notch cast including, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and a wonderful Alan Arkin as the Hollywood producer who helps him fake the production of the sci-fi flick Argo. He and his crew also do a great job of recreating the look and feel of that moment in time. This is a movie that lives up to every bit of the hype and deserves every award and nomination it received. And despite knowing how it all turns out, you still find yourself embroiled in some intense white knuckled suspense. Great flick!",

Just tell the story, you get several positive conclusions about what they want to show \"Argo\", a political thriller that perfectly recreates historical events and characters involved, who thanks to the sly direction and screenplay by Affleck and Terrio make the audience enjoy an unique experience where there's lots of tense, exciting, and therefore, entertaining, as well as informative moments. It is worth mentioning the following. Apart from an odd but amazing styling of the '70s, the scenery of Iran in those years is just perfect, every minutest detail has been taken care of the place with a lot of work. The performances are quite powerful and fine wrought the person who are reincarnated, I must admit is quite unrecognizable Affleck as Mendez, Arkin surprises and continues to surprise with its role as Siegel, Goodman adds some dark humor to the film as Chambers and finally I appreciate Cranston as an interesting Mr. O'Donnell. \n\"Argo\" is winning all the attributes and ticket you received because it shows a good story and interesting to try to reach the perfection, and despite not reaching, is one of the best movies based on real events and one of the best I saw.

He is outstanding. The film ratchets the tension up nicely and the film is well worthy of all the awards bestowed on it. \n\nHowever, for me, it looses a half-star for that wonderful American trait for conveniently ignoring the efforts of the UK (and New Zealand come to think if it) in the true story. In Argo, the efforts of the both countries are not even recognised. Think U571, Braveheart and the Patriot....",

The problem I had with The Town, which was still an excellent movie, is that it peaks too early and goes on too long.  This film sees Ben at the top of his game.  This film is just excellent, there is a real sense of place.  The film just looks authentic.  Not that it's shot cinema verite style, just that the events of the film truly look like they're set in the late 70s.  That authenticity adds a lot to be honest.  The film, even with its inaccuracies, tells the incredible story of a courageous operation to rescue six Americans stuck in Iran during the hostage crisis.  and all this was with a very strange plan: using making a film in Iran as the cover to get these people out.  I think the most impressive thing about the entire film is just how far they actually went in trying to make the entire fake movie look like it's legit.  They set up a fake production company, had a very public script reading, they had posters, they had storyboards, they had newspaper articles.  It's just impressive to see how much they actually did to get their six diplomats out of a situation where, if they stayed any longer, they'd probably have been murdered.  Unlike The Town, the film does sort of build to an excellent climax with the last half hour of the film being outstanding.  There's just great tension and suspense to the entire operation, so kudos to Mr. Affleck for knowing how to build an atmosphere of tension.  The acting is, unsurprisingly, strong.  I mean with this cast, even if all else failed, you're guaranteed strong performances.  Even Ben Affleck, who I've never liked as an actor, turns in a strong performance.  He has a quiet confidence about him, it's clear that he knows what he's doing and he's fine not getting the credit he deserves just as long as he does his job.  I'm not gonna sit here and say that nobody else would've done this as good, or even better, than Affleck, but he does hold his end of the bargain on the acting side.  Really this is a top-to-bottom excellent film.  Did I think it was the best film of the year?  Probably not.  I can think of at least four other films I enjoyed more than this (Django Unchained, The Perks of being a Wallflower, Looper, Seven Psychopaths off the top of my head), but that doesn't make this any less great.  Even if the Canadian involvement was downplayed in the film, the film does tell a great story about an operation that, when hearing it at first, should've gone wrong but didn't.  Great film with a great cast and, surprisingly, a lot of funny moments as well.  Definitely recommended.",

There aren't any stand-out acting performances (other than Alan Arkin, who steals the show) and the character construction isn't great either- Tony Mendez never really strays beyond the cliche of the workaholic divorcee in the film. However, it is impossible to argue against the inspired cinematography, part of what makes Argo so tonally consistent.

And it took me awhile to get the chance to see this, but I am happy to say I finally had a chance to see the 85th Academy Awards winner for 'Best Picture'.  So my biggest question before I watched the movie was: Do I believe it deservedly won this award?  I'll answer that last, but first my thoughts on the movie.  \n\nMany of my friends had already seen this movie.  My parents too.  Every time I asked what they thought of it, almost all of them had one word come out eventually: intense.  And boy, is this movie intense!  Now let me make it clear:  the last 20-25 minutes are intense.  I mean INTENSE.  But other than that?  Eh.  Most of the movie consisted of talking.  And I'm sorry but if I'm going to listen to people talking for an hour and a half, I want Quentin Tarantino making this movie.  But Ben Affleck still does a very good job.  He brings in a great cast and a great script.  The movie is good.  There is no denying that. It's well shot, well acted, and well written.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin are great.  Ben Affleck is great.  I mean this is a very good movie.  But I wouldn't say this isn't one of my personal favorites.  It's not really a movie I will remember for years to come.  Do I think this movie should have been made?  Absolutely.  Ben Affleck gives the best effort he can in portraying a truly terrifying escape from hostel territory.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think it will be a movie I continuously watch throughout the years.\n\nNow to the big question:  Do I believe this movie was right to win 'Best Picture'?  No.  But let me be clear, it's not MY personal pick.  Many people absolutely adored this movie.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I still believe 'Django' was my personal favorite of the year.  I still need to see 'Lincoln', 'Beasts of the Southern Wild', and 'Amour'.  But as of now, I don't believe this is the best film.  That aside, it absolutely deserves a nomination and it does have a strong argument for winning.  But in my opinion, still not the best film of 2012.\n\nOverall, once again Ben Affleck proves that he continues to improve in his superb filmmaking abilities.  He is quickly becoming a classic of his generation.  I think I may have enjoyed 'The Town' more than 'Argo' but in terms of filmmaking as a whole, this is an improvement.  'Argo' is a very good, very intense movie.  I recommend everyone see it at least once.  Learn the harrowing story portrayed by a great director.",

Even in the movie they knew it was ridiculous. It is ridiculous. But I can not believe that this actually happened, pretty accurately portrayed from what I can tell. The reality makes it some much more rivetting.\n\nSecondly, it's a a thrilling thriller with like no violence. Bryan Cranston breaks a mug, and that's pretty much it. Not really but almost. The last minutes of this movie are crazy and you're anxious throughout just the ways a regular thriller would. This movie is so dynamic and original in so many ways that it undoubtebly deserved its Oscar win(s).\n\nThirdly, but definitely not finally, the cast is PERFECT. Affleck, Cranston,  Arkin, and Goodman, among others just make this movie amazing. I am thouroughly impressed with every performance that they all deserved Oscar nominations. Imagine if Affleck was nominated for director and actor. \n\nOverall, ridiculously, almost unaccpetably good. Phenomenal. I cannot wait for Afflecks next film. He has an extremely impressive, albeit short resume already. See Argo now. Or Argo F*** yourself.",

Directed and starring by Ben Affleck (Reindeer Games, Phantoms), Argo tells the true accounts of a declassified operation launched by CIA during the hostage crisis in Iran. The film opens up with a prelude into Iranian history, setting up the events of the film. It is 1979 and Shah or Iran flees the turbulent country. The people still unhappy and looking to even the score, seize the United States Embassy in Tehran taking a number of hostages. However, six workers have managed to escape and hide in house of a Canadian ambassador. Back in the US, the country is in cahoots with half of the Americans hoping and praying for the release of the hostages while the other half take vengeance on the mosques, Iranian flags, and people. The politicians are running around in circles while Jimmy Carter makes it clear they do not negotiate with terrorist. The CIA is pretty much bewildered, but find out six employees have escaped. They try and figure out a plan. This is when Tony Mendez comes in played by a shaggy Ben Affleck. He notices and objects to all the terrible plans proposed from bike riding out of Iran to farmers to Tehran while there is snow. Okay, you figure it out then Mr. Smart Pants. While on the phone with his son, Tony suddenly gets an idea while watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Why don't we make a fake movie and set it in Iran and have the hostages pose as our crew to get them out! His supervisor Jack O'Donnell and him then contact John Chambers (John Goodman). Chambers then gets producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to produce the fake film only on one condition: if I am gonna make a fake movie, it is going to be a fake hit!The film then transpires into a story of hope and determination. Tony tries to keep the mission going despite doubt and skepticism from superiors. Scripts are looked for possible production until a scripted titled Argo is chosen.  When asked what does Argo stands for, Siegel replies \"Argo f**k yourself!\" This fake film is will be in the spirit or more correctly, Star Wars rip off. The plans is \"hi, we are Canadians looking to make a movie, so I came here to Iran for that exotic location.\" Get to Canadian ambassador and pick up the six Americans and have them play Canadians and then get to the airport and get out! Director Ben Affleck then takes us inside Iran. There is not a whole lot of personalities and identities just shots here and there along with turmoil going around the country. He meets up with the six which feel rather mixed at the idea. Tony does not have a lot of time because sooner or later the Iranian government is going to find out six embassy employees have escaped and will hunt them down. Director Affleck delivers a strong and effective film. It was intense watching this film as days go and every minute is crucial for the mission. Despite the turmoil, there are some delightful, feel good, and entertaining moments with Arkin stealing most of the laughs. Affleck also manages to deliver a darn good performance even though he also was in the director's chair. Goodman and the supporting cast are excellent in their parts. Now, like all films based on a true story, there are controversies. First, I am not sure about the history in the film; however, I do believe there are significant inaccuracies since this is history according to Hollywood. I also believe some scenes were added to jerk us around especially in one climatic scene. Argo does generalize some crucial points prior to the Iranian revolution, but was there any depth to it? I would imagine, but that is another film for another time. Anyways, it did not take too long for the film to click inside my head. I immediately sat back and watched the film. It is also no wonder it won Best Picture at the Academy Awards.",

When the embassy in Iran gets raided, and seized by Islamic militants, six American diplomats managed to escape and find secret sanctuary with the Canadian ambassador. Months later, Mendez devises an audacious plan to get the six diplomats back to America, posing as a film crew looking for locations to shoot, along with the help of John Goodman (The Big Lebowski, Flight) and Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine).\n\nI feel as a whole Argo is the weakest Best Picture winner in many, many years. Although a technically very sound film, it suggests that the film business can solve the world's problems, including terrorism. For this reason I can see why those in Hollywood love this picture.\n\nThe film is well directed, I am under the opinion that Ben Affleck can direct anything that he is given, yet, for me, Affleck is better suited to Boston thrillers, he should stick to what he knows.  Furthermore, it's interesting that his portrayal of Tony Mendez is one that focuses on his trusting nature and smarts in terms of his mission, yet it fails to question Mendez' separation from his wife. It seems to me that that sub-story is just included so that it will form a nice ending when his wife takes him back.\n\nOne thing that surprised me about Argo is that the story expands in an oddly uncomplicated and non-shocking way. This creates a much more believable environment. If this film was a fiction, and not 'based on truth', there would be many more plot twists, or tense encounters that would dramatise and, in a sense, take the film too far into the realms of a Hollywood, fiction, action/thriller.\n\nAn extremely enjoyable film, although not Affleck's best.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n6.5/10.",

Affleck delivers in both acting and directing. He builds the tension so naturally and does a stellar job directing the film.

From the direction including the incorporation of archival footage in a delicate yet effective fashion really lent itself to the time period and the mayhem that was sweeping the nation and the world at the time. Several standout stars - Alan Arkin and John Goodman in particular really brought the work to new heights. However, there were several glaring issues with the script including an unnecessary and very cartoonish opening sequence that didn't let things off with a bang. Also, being that this film was supposed to be so focused on the hostages and their mission the hostages themselves barely got any lines of dialogue which seemed counterproductive to the action at stake. The most obvious and unfortunate issue with the whole film is the immense screen time that Ben Affleck took up himself. Many of those scenes were wasted with close ups of his eyes, smirking or brooding. All in all though, an impressively mounted and faithful production but nothing to really write home about.",

The film is a contradiction and twist on reality that satisfies the American appetite for...we are BOSS..basically..even if it is not the truth..Therefore anyone that says Aflfeck was snubbed..no he wasn't. The film won based on politics, Ben was snubbed based on truth in media to which I say BRAVO!...For the one time in my life I would actually say that... For the first time a director wasn't nominated for best picturebecause the picture was a lie. Travesty that it won IMO..There have been many films, British, and European that are true to real story without glorification, fabrication, or stray from true or fiction that are excellent that are truly worthy of an Oscar nod. Yet the film that is full of contradiction, lie, and minimization of outside aide is the one that wins..go figure...GO America!",

Congratulations to Ben Affleck for his Oscar (R) winner in this film's Best Picture at the first time, believe me it's his second Oscar (R) since he was awarded for his 1998's Best Original Screenplay in Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon. And it was disappointed Affleck wasn't entitled to be nominated for the Best Director Oscar (R). \nIn the past five years, Affleck has mad the kind of comeback usually reserved for Rocky films. having been written off as \"the least talented one\" in the Affleck-Damon combo, the lantern-jawed actor has found a second life as a director with two acclaimed films. here he adds \"producer\" to the mix and sets about proving his \"Bennifer\" days are long behind him.\nBased on the true story of a covert operation that was declassified in 1997, Argo sets about weaving together multiple elements with great efficiency: a handy history lesson on the conflict within Iran segues into armrest-gripping tension as 52 Americans are taken hostage from the US Embassy in 1979. Soon we're deep within the bowels of the CIA as troubled exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) relays \"the best bad idea we've got\" to the Powers That Be on how to save the six diplomats: enter Iran under the pretense of location scouting for a film, then smuggle out the quarry as crew members.\nThe film then successfully shifts tone as Mendez hits LA and Argo briefly becomes a biting (and hilarious) Hollywood satire. Alan Arkin steals every scene he's in as a wily producer who helps Mendez; John Goodman a delight as the make-up artist assisting in the charade. It's a short breather before the movie kicks back into \"political thriller\" mode as the director skillfully ratchets up the tension to unbearable levels.\nAffleck again proves himself a talent behind the camera: Argo is well paced and several story strands are juggled skillfully. He's ably assisted by an A-grade cast: Bryan Cranston as a CIA higher-up, six relative unknowns as the diplomats and Goodman and Arkin in fine form. And proving he's better off directing himself, Affleck is solid as a CIA man-on-the-edge who everyone thinks is on a suicide mission. The sharp screenplay from Chris Terro is terrific, and despite a tying-up-the-loose-ends finale that reminds you you're still watching a Hollywood film, this is a triumph for all involved.",

The plot involves the real-life CIA & Canadian bid to rescue six American diplomats who narrowly escaped being held hostage (as were 52 others held for 400 something days) and instead holed up in the Canadian Ambassador's house.  Affleck ratchets up the tension and even creates some suspense despite the predictable ending.  As is true with most action movies, there is little focus on creating real characters and Affleck chooses not to engage with the rich political themes available.

CNN's Tom Charity pointed out that Ben Affleck had artifully recreated the and feel of 70s suspene films. I am deeply appreciated by Ben's efforts to make Argo looks and feels like a 70s vintage movie.In my humble opinion, I think Looper is a better thriller than Argo because the dramas and actions in Looper are more intense and entertaining. Looper is a gripping action thriller without any dull moment. However, Looper is a science fiction, not a movie that bases on a historic event of CIA saving Americans from Iran. As Americans' national pride is attached to Argo, therefore, it won the best movie and other awards at 2013 Oscar.Argo presents Ben Affleck's great leap forward in his movie career and tells the world that he is capable to be a world class movie director. However, Argo was written by Chris Terrio. I would still be skeptical to the movie scripts that are written by Ben.",

Six US ambassadors escaped and went into hiding at the Canadian embassy. The CIA found out they escaped and started to try and come up with ideas on how to get them out. They agreed on an idea to make a fake movie and say they were scouting locations to film in Iran. They came up with a fake script and storyboard and everything to make it as believable as possible. To get them out, they would say that the six of them were part of the production crew. The man that came up with the idea went to Iran and ended up getting them all out just barely. He later was presented with the highest award a civilian can receive for his brave actions.\n\nAwards Won\n\nThis movie won the award for best picture in 2013. I think this is justified because when I was watching this, it seemed to have very good camera angles and picture.\n\nThemes\n\nI think the theme of this movie is stick together. I think this because the six of them that escaped stuck together and never left each other. Also, the US didn't forget about them and went and saved them.\n\nTechnical Elements\n\nThis film had very creative camera angles and very good picture. Which is probably why it won best picture. Also on very suspenseful moments, they would add very suspenseful music to it. This made the movie very engaging. Overall this film had very good technical elements.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis film was very good. I would highly recommend for people to watch this. One because it is a very engaging movie, and it also it is a true story so you can learn a lot from it. Overall this was a very great film and I can see why it won an award.\n\n-GU, 8th Grade Student",

The one emotion that I did see from Affleck was his typical Boston emotionless tough guy image.\n\nAlso, I did not like the lack of foresight for the viewer in explaining \"the why\" for the Iranian hostage take embassy takeover. Yes, it showed the western influence in prerevolutionary government but overall it was weak and light, in my opinion.\n\nFuthermore, I thought the \"hollywood heros\" in the movie came off too unconcerned about the Iranian crisis, where as the news reports in the movie made you believe that every American was holding their collective breath.",

From the opening Warner Pictures emblem to the musical score you experience nostalgia. To open, the short narration of the history of Iran/Persia gave just enough information to understand enough of what was many years of build up to the horrible events that took place. There's plenty of suspense available following the operation from its inception to completion, with a few subtle comical remarks from time to time that one could even find reference to some of the actors or present day events. Overall it was just shy of excellent. You could tell throughout the movie that Ben Affleck was doing his best to pretend he was a genuine cigarette smoker as he looked awkward doing so. It may have not added to the overall movie but a bit more coverage of the events at the embassy could have been expanded, although that wasn't the focal point of the movie. At times there is a patriotic theme noted with heart wrenching visuals and accounts of sacrifice from the good guys. A-",

            "content": "\"Argo fuck yourself.\" After watching Argo post Oscar ceremony, I remain unconvinced that the film warranted the top prize at the award ceremony, as well as the best writing award. While the film itself was well made, it was never stellar or mind blowing. The story follows CIA agent Tony Mendez as he tries to get six Americans out of Iran by posing as a Hollywood filmmaker to get them out safely. Admittedly the finale was tense and thrilling but there was nothing bold or riveting about the film that gave it the privilege to be called the best picture of the year. Fun, simple and safe, Argo is not a bad piece of entertainment, but when the ever deviant line \"based on a true story\" comes up on screen, in this case it looses merits as Affleck took some creative liberties with the story, specifically the role of the Canadians in the film. While Affleck's Mendez's story is the focal point and was the part that was hushed by the government, the portrayal of the Canadian involvement in the \"Canadian Caper\" as it was called was cut very short, making the involvement almost none existent. Of course I was not around during this event and I did not know about the caper before Argo, but that's not to say what Hollywood says is true. Also, the film never reveals the fate of the other hostages left in the American Embassy, where the film opens up, leaving that piece of information  very open and unfinished. So if you want a fun, quick, easy spy thriller that doesn't get political, Argo is a fun distraction. If you wanted a deep political thriller with answers, well you may want to finance your own movie.",

Like I said, Argo was a very good film. Ben Affleck has proven once again that he's not only a fantastic and underrated actor but that he's becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood. Argo had great pacing for the type of movie it is, the plot developed perfectly, the characters all felt real and authentic, etc. The only negative I would really have is that some of the suspense felt cheap and forced. Sure, they truly did escape Iran. That part is a true story. However, how close they were to getting caught is not necessarily known. So the fact that the final 30 minutes of the movie was close call after close call and that these scrapes didn't develop authentically but felt manufactured was not ideal. Nonetheless, I'd say this is a really good movie that, while it's a little overrated and overhyped (it won Picture of the Year when I'm not even sure it's the best true story CIA film of the year - that would probably be Zero Dark Thirty), most people would still enjoy. \"Argo f*** yourself!\"",

It was an intense and frightening era in modern history; this film chronicles the daring operation to rescue six of the hostages after they fled the besieged embassy.\n\nI'm not at all familiar with the Iranian Hostage Crisis, so I have no idea how much of Argo is fiction and how much of it is fact (reading up on it, I see that the film is criticized for over-emphasizing the role of the CIA, and for presenting more peril than what really happened). Regardless, the film made the events feel very real. The film does it best to replicate the era, the settings, and the danger to immerse the viewers into the situation and make them feel the suspense. I certainly felt the suspense, as the characters ran up against all manner of political, diplomatic, and cultural barriers in a frantic race to escape a treacherous and unstable country. The film definitely kept my attention and had me at the edge of my seat.\n\nThe story is well-told, presenting its ideas and sequence of events on a manner that's both logical and sensical. Even though there is a lot of political intruige involved, the film never looses its audience with jargon or politics. It also looks and feels very realistic; despite some thrilling scenes, the events appear plausible and the various interactions between people and governments appear authentic. Characters have just enough depth and emotion to make audiences care for them, and once again, come off as seeming authentic.\n\nEven the film itself feels authentic, featuring some rough and gritty-looking camera work and editing. The camera is steady and solid, as is the editing, but it looks like a film that could have been made in the 70s, due to the way it's composed and put together. Same goes for its production design, which goes to great lengths to replicate genuine-looking sets, props, and costumes. Acting is decent: Ben Affleck is surprisingly strong in his role, Bryan Cranston is a fun to watch as ever, and everybody else fulfills their parts admirably. Writing is great. Music isn't bad either.\n\nArgo might just stand as a new favorite among political thriller movies; it's certainly one of the most real-looking and historically interesting films I've seen in the genre. Above all, it's intense enough to maintain interest.  Recommended!\n\n4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",

It's hard to make a genuinely gripping, perfectly-paced, immaculately-timed thriller. But not, it seems, for Ben Affleck. The film is exciting and nostalgic from the get-go, with some comedy and scope provided by Alan Arkin and John Goodman's characters; but things really heat up, much like real life, in Iran. The last forty minutes of Argo are immaculate.\n\nThe score boosts things; Affleck directs perfectly, as well as producing and acting very well; Bryan Cranston turns in an exciting performance too.

But after it won the Oscar for Best Picture this year I made an effort to download it and watch it.  \nFirst of all, out of all the other films nominated in the same catagory, I think Argo definitely deserved to win the award.  It's extremely tense in the exact places it needs to be, and since I made a point of not researching the real events the film is based on, I genuinely didn't know how things were going to \"go down\" (Although, of course, I assumed they'd succeed)  But Affleck has done such a good job that even though I subconsciously \"knew\" what was going to happen, I didn't know at the same time, if that makes any sense?  \nIt also uses humour very well.  I'm not saying it's a funny film by any means, but when comic relief is employed it does so extremely effectively.  \nIf I have any criticism (There isn't much I didn't like) I would have liked the film to delve a little deeper into Ben Affleck's strained relationship with his wife, and how he copes being so far away from his son.  It's briefly touched upon early in the film, but I feel if it was done a little more extensively, we as an audience would have felt even more tense and nervous during the Iran hostage extraction because there would have been a whole lot more for Ben Affleck to lose.  \nSo yes, a very tight and well done film that hits all it's marks very well.  It's still not my favourite film of 2012, but that doesn't take away from how good I think it is.",

If I catch them on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'll end up liking most of the ones I watch. \"Argo\" is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.\n\nIn 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled \"Argo.\"\n\nBen Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Mallrats,\" and \"Chasing Amy.\" The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as \"Armageddon,\" \"Daredevil,\" \"Pearl Harbor,\" and \"The Sum of All Fears.\" Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?\n\nOne thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his \"Good Will Hunting\" script and continues to collect awards for \"Argo.\" The movie is nominated for an Oscar for \"Best Picture\" and it deserves the honor.\n\n\"Argo\" appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" and \"Planet of the Apes\" fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.\n\nAdd to that the fact that award-winning \"Planet of the Apes\" makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran. I remember seeing the news broadcasts about the hostage situation as a boy, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time. The whole event is interesting to learn about.\n\n\"Argo\" is an exciting political thriller which will have you white-knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat. Director Ben Affleck did a great job keeping up the suspense and pacing in the film. Even though you know how it's going to end, you are still nervous for the characters as you watch. That's just good filmmaking in my book.\n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

In order to rescue six Americans in enemy territory, a CIA agent (BA) must pose as a Canadian filmmaker, who is scouting the country of IRAN as a possible shooting location for his made-up film, ARGO.  \n\nThe film is good, in every aspect but what impressed me the most was the tension.  As a kid, I never really realized how bad things were getting in the Middle East.  I remember when the hostages were freed but I never really got it ( I was a kid! I cared about the Empire Strikes Back...& a bunch of kid crap).\nBA brought THAT (tension) to the table.  The film brings ton of it and it works great.  You invest in BA's character & you want to see him succeed.  When a filmmaker does that, the film succeeds.  \n\nAll in all, ARGO is worthy of a Blu-Ray purchase. WTTP, P!",

Maybe if Ben Affleck had been nominated for best director it wouldn't have won, but so what?  So it tells a little known tale of the ones who got away, while 52 others were captured in the infamous Iran hostage crisis. The thing that seems most known about it today is that the crisis was the last straw for Jimmy Carter, but there's also something else in that Iran is currently staged up to be one of America's chief enemies.  Anyway, it's a fairly brisk drama with some added suspense that plays fast and loose with what really happened.  There was a lot of manufactured hysteria over Kushner's script of Lincoln and how certain congressmen really voted, but this film makes up stuff that never even remotely happened.  Again, not bad, just not good enough.",

Without the requisite knowledge, I tend to get frustrated when I can tell by chase scenes and frantic music that shit just got real, but I have no idea what the political stakes are. Argo knocked it out of the park from the get-go with a nifty little storyboard introduction to the Iran hostage crisis that gave me a better understanding of the Iranian Revolution than did the entirety of the film Persepolis. With the political stakes properly explained within the first five minutes, Argo becomes cinematic stimulant. Ben Affleck the director was so effective that Ben Affleck the actor's sleepy-eyed calmness couldn't chill me out. And good grief that airport finale was some of the most thrilling cinema I've ever seen.\n\nPS-Bryan Cranston should've been nominated for Supporting Actor over Alan Arkin.",

Well, one thing I can say is this film is masterfully done. Every member of this film's staff and crew should be acknowledged for this great work. This is probably one of the most fundamentally made films I've seen. It is just technically well-made! From the camera work to its editing, it is simply beautiful! But the plot is another story. It is based on real events set in the 70's with the American government trying to bring home hostages from Iran while pretending to be a film crew. That is a great concept! But as real and accurate as it feels, there just seems to be something missing. Sure, it generates enough suspense for you to be invested and the atmosphere feels so real. The cast are great especially Alan Arkin and John Goodman. The other cast did a great job but none of them particularly stood out. Overall, it is a very good movie. This is something that most people would enjoy except probably Iranians and Canadians.  It is the best decision of Ben Affleck's film career that I can't believe he's not nominated for Best Director! Does it deserve the recognition? Absolutely! It just feels like it needs one more intense/memorable moment for it to be called a masterpiece, or the hype it generated to say the least.\nScore: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Generally, there are three themes that tend to be favored by award community and film critics, the winning themes are about humanity (\"Schindler's List\" {1993}, \"The Shawshank Redemption {1994}, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" {2008}, etc.), patriotism (\"Saving Private Ryan\" {1998}, \"Black Hawk Down\" {2001}, \"Lincoln\" {2012}, etc.) and the world of cinema itself (\"Cinema Paradiso\" {1998}, \"Hugo\" {2011}, \"The Artist\" {2011}, etc.). Well, thiz movie has all three of them. Producer, Director and Actor Ben Affleck is smart enough to realize it and takes advantage of that. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who is responsible for covert operation to extract six American embassy employees out of the rage of Iran revolutionary by pretending to be Canadian film crew.  It seems that Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job as the Director. He starts with an effective prologue to provide sufficient information and every time the scene heats up, particularly when the scene of American embassy is invaded, he cleverly adds relaxing piano instrumental music to cool things down and doesn't try to provoke audience into infuriated reactions. Thiz is his third feature films behind the camera after \"Gone Baby Gone\" (2007) and \"The Town\" (2010). For the acting, Ben Afflecks looks cool, calm and confident. John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber give brief but consistent performances and the last but definitely not least, Alan Arkin creates a powerful and believable emotion as fearless Hollywood Producer. I also have to put some credit to the Production Designer Sharon Seymour who successfully makes everything look like 1980s such as costume, hairstyle, glasses, car, furniture, television, telephone, everything! How they put attention to detail is undoubtedly amazing. Personally, for me, the power of thiz movie is in the last half hour. Thiz is a good example of what you can get when great script and great editing are perfectly combined. My heart nearly stopped while watching thiz final scene which takes place in Iran airport. They use almost all aspects to create tensions from ticket, telephone, soldier, bus, you name it and they have done it. When it's over, there will be some satisfying and gratifying feelings. In the closing scene, when the camera pans over the toys of Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and other sci-fi movies one by one. It simply wants to remind us that they are not only inspirational icons in our pop culture, but also they have ever saved lives. Great movie, great story, great moviemaker!\n\nVisit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

In the movie, there is only a brief mention of other ideas for the rescue and no mention of Canadian plans and/or ideas.   Canada (likely as well as the US) had spent 3 months working on plans to get the 6 Americans to safety but apparently none were deemed viable.  In he movie they say the movie crew idea was the best worst idea.\n\nIn a recent interview, Jimmy Carter confirms that the majority of the work was actually done by Canadians",

Ben Affleck has a great performance as CIA ex-fil operative Tony Mendez.  Along with Brian Cranston, John Goodman, and Allan Arkin, \"Argo\" is made all the more enjoyable.  I must say that I'm still disappointed that Brian Cranston wasn't nominated for Best Supporting for his role in this.  His classic line of, \"We're a fucking spy agency!  Find him!\" still brings a smile to my face.\n\nI think the best part of this film is the third act.  Affleck masterfully keeps mounting the tension, leaving you on the edge of your seat almost out of breath while you're along for the ride.  \n\nA lot of emotion, stellar casting, and phenomenal camera work, \"Argo\" is my favorite pick for the Oscars this year and is easily my favorite drama in the last 2 years.

When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA - according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that \"there was not enough time to fit it all in\".\n\nIn other words, for Ben, making the Americans \"centre of the universe\" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp - which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport - not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel.\n\nDramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers.\n\nBen in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised-face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie - nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years.\n\nNo doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow. There is no defense, however, for the damage inflicted on the historical record, those who buy into that distortion, or the Canadians, and the lives of six US hostages whose lives depended on real intervention by real people.\n\nZiek / bamfrmcan",

            "content": "Man, Iran just cannot catch a break, and apparently Canadians can't either, because even when it's their film crew whose launching a daring rescue mission, and people are still remembering Americans the most as heroes. Eh, maybe it's the Canadians faults for not getting a whole lot of credit for this stunt, because I can see them disowning this faux sci-fi film before production was even launched, as it is so cheesy that they stopped just short of going so far as to call the men of space in it - you guessed it - Argonauts (Speaking of cheesy, is anyone else having trouble thinking of Jason and the Argonauts and not thinking about a '60s pop-rock band?). You can of course see the irony in the fact that the real film about this faux film is good, even if it's not too much less cheesy, simply because it features cream-white Bostanite Ben Affleck as some guy named Antonio Mendez. Thank goodness Mendez prefers the nickname Tony, seeing as how it makes him sound more American, because when I hear a name like the one on the person Affleck is portraying in this film, I'd sooner expect Luis Guzm\u00e1n in the role, though, in all fairness, that might just be because Affleck is sporting Guzm\u00e1n's trademark beard in this film. I must say that Brian Salisbury of Spill.com hit the nail right, smack-dab on the head when he said that this film is so authentic to the '70s that Affleck went so far to put shag carpet on his face, possibly from Bryan Cranston, which shouldn't be too hard, because as much as Cranston goes bald with a beard, then beardless with as about much of a full head of hair as he can have behind his receding hairline, I'm beginning to think that his hair and beard are detachable, and that the windows of time between his films and \"Breaking Bad\" aren't as wide as he might claim. Jeez, thinking about it, Cranston's got a lot of work under his belt from 2012, so it's only fair that his streak end with this film, a grand finale that is certainly a better relfection of Cranston's taste in work than \"Rock of Ages\" and - woah, boy - \"Red Tails\". Still, no matter how good this film is, if you think that the mission to shoot a fake film in Iran in order to rescue captured Americans is an impossible one, then you should look into the task of making a flawless film.\n\nThis film wouldn't be doing its job as a rescue thriller too well if it disregarded the people who our protagonists were going to rescue, especially when their subplot merges with the core story half-way through the film, so of course, before Ben Affleck's Tony Mendez character confronts the hostages about an hour into this film, storytelling switches focus onto the hostages in Iran, whose story's presentation is inspired enough to compel and all, but would have been even more engaging if the hostage point-of-view switches didn't feel rather obligatory, to where the film jars into its crucial, but repetitious subplot with little grace, thus sparking a bit awkward focal unevenness. If nothing else's consistency is thrown off by sudden focal shifts, then it's tone's consistency, as this film's core story will often keep up a lively atmosphere, only to swiftly shift into darker notes with the presentation of people who are pretty much just sitting around, waiting to die, which isn't to say that tonal inconsistency occurs only when we switch focus onto the hostages' subplot, because even though this film is generally organic in its tonal layers, there come times in which the film finds itself too eager to abandon all of the fun and games and get into more tense moments that are indeed effective, but would have been more potent if their incorporation wasn't so sudden. Needless to say, the lack of full assurance in tonal dynamicity dilutes this film's kick, though it's not like the film at least keeps consistent in having a firm grip on the intrigue within whichever tone its focusing upon in the first place, because as entertaining and compelling as this film is, slow spells never drift too far away from pacing momentum, not quite looming over this film as much as they did in Affleck's previous effort, \"The Town\", but being pronounced enough to bland things up a smidge, and help in making shifts in pacing every bit as inorganic as shifts in tone and focus. Pacing is generally tight and gripping in this film, but grip goes loosened time and again by a kind of awkward unevenness in pacing that has this film dancing between smooth and gritty in progression so often that, after a while, repetition hits rears its ugly head into things, leaving you to slowly, but surely predict the next beat in this film's formula, which is so engaging, but not enough to obscure Affleck's further proving that he's just not entirely ready to be the directorial heavyweight that many people are calling him. Each one of his three films, including this one, acclaimed, Affleck, as director, is recieving a lot of praise as a revelatory filmmaker, and I'm happy to pay Affleck some pretty high compliments, as I have found every one of his films, including this one, rewarding, yet I couldn't ever shake some sense of awkwardness within Affleck's previous efforts, as surely as I can't fully shake some sense of awkwardness within this effort, which is inspired enough to compel thoroughly, same as \"Gone Baby Gone\" and \"The Town\", but not as assured as it should be. Tonally, Affleck feels a bit distanced as storyteller, and that gives you enough time to meditate upon all of the unevenness and repetition that can't battle back this film's reward value, but holds the final product back when it comes to achieving full potential. Nevertheless, this film accles more than it trips up, being neither as smoothly structured or confidently told as it should be, but still charged enough to sustain your investment through and through, while the film's musicality helps in sustaining entertainment value.\n\nSet in the final days of the 1970s, as well as so soon in the early days of the '80s that some cheesy '80s tunes don't have enough time to kick in, this film boasts the potential to deliver on an awesome soundtrack, and sure enough, while this film's mainstream soundtrack isn't too heavily played up, you can expect plenty of lively '70s tunes - from Booker T. and the MG's' \"Hip Hug-Her\" and Van Halen's \"Dance the Night Away\", to Dire Strait's \"Sultans of Swing\" and Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks\" - to liven things up, while Alexandre Desplat delivers on a score that isn't too upstanding or refreshing, but still quite strong in its diverse and atmospherically pronounced kick and rhythm to both entertain and add a bit of color to this film's substance. What further adds to the kick of this thriller is, of course, William Goldenberg's editing, which occasionally gets to be kind of overbearing its being so actively tight, but is generally just comfortable enough in its tightness to really grip, slickly snapping footage together with a nifty storytelling style that both augments liveliness and helps you in getting a grip on the freneticism that drives much of this film's intrigue. Musically and technically, at the very least, the film accels with just enough assurance to spark a sense of style that breathes quite a bit of life into this film's substance, though it's not like substance needs such reinforcements a style to earn your investment, being gripping in concept, alone. This film's subject matter isn't as well-handled as it would have been if Ben Affleck was more assured in his story structure and atmospheric storytelling, but it is still valuable and interesting enough to hold your attention with its being both valuable and just crazy enough to be real, or at least just crazy enough to present screenwriter Chris Terrio with something of a challenge that he, more often than not, overcomes strongly, for although Terrio's story structure is far from consistently smooth, it is generally tight and taut, with slick momentum whose liveliness goes complimented by sharply clever dialogue and humor, as well as by colorful characterization that is itself complimented by a team of confident performers. There's very little for our performers to work with dramatically, as surprising as that may seem, yet most everyone brings his or her well-wrought character to life with distinct charisma, with someone like Alan Arkin all but stealing the show as the charming jerk of a has-been film producer, while Ben Affleck, as lead actor, convinces you enough of Tony Mendez's intellignce, wit and humanity to make him a memorable lead. As the head of this film's cast, Affleck doesn't really do a whole lot that's all that extraordinary, but he puts enough heart into his performance for it compel, and I wish I could say that about him as a director, as Affleck just isn't as assured as he should be as storyteller, which isn't to say that Affleck isn't inspired enough in his direction to do quite a bit as a driving force of this film's compellingness, standing to be smoother in his storytelling, but still putting quite a bit of nifty attention to detail into the crafting of this film's setting, while keeping pacing generally quite grippingly tight, not to where unevenness doesn't bleed through, but decidedly to where the film's tonal and focal layers, more often than not, pull through smoothly. Whether when he's keeping things entertaining or keeping things tense, Affleck, as director, keeps the film thoroughly compelling, and although he could have - nay - should have hit harder, what Affleck does as storyteller is enough to craft a rewarding final product.\n\nAt the end of the mission, you may find yourself a bit thrown off by the film's slight focal unevenness, moderate tonal unevenness, and fair bit of pacing unevenness, which leaves slow spots is disengage, and more frenetic spots to overbear at times, thus you're to grow more aware of Ben Affleck's simply not being as confident as he should be as storytelling, while the film itself is left to fall short of its full potential, something that isn't totally lost in this generally rewarding thriller, which boasts a strong soundtrack and sharp editing to liven up valuable subject matter, which recieves quite a bit of justice from Chris Terrio's clever and generally tight script, charisma within most every member of the cast, and enough inspiration within Affleck's layered and engaging storytelling to make \"Argo\" an entertaining and engrossing thriller that all too often trips up, but ultimately pulls through as worthile.\n\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "After a great directorial debut with \"Gone Baby Gone\" in 2007 and a brilliant sophomore effort with \"The Town\" in 2010, all eyes were on Ben Affleck in his third outing as director. Questions were asked as to whether he could do it again. And the answer? The answer is a resounding, 'Yes'. Argo completes Affleck's hat-trick behind the camera and confirms that he's definitely a director that has an abundance of talent and awareness.\n Based on true events in a post-revolution Iran in 1979. A mob of Ayatollah supporters storm the US Embassy and take 56 American hostages. 6 officers managed to escape, however, and take refuge in the home of a Canadian Ambassador. After two months in hiding and their sanctuary becoming increasingly risky, the CIA hatch a plan to get them home and extraction officer Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is given that responsibility. His plan is to create a fake movie called \"Argo\" and pretend that the six officers in hiding are his crew, scouting for shooting locations within the country.\n Before going into Argo, I admittedly expected a heavy-handed political thriller but that's not exactly what it delivers. Apart from the first five minutes of a brief overview of the, questionable, political relations between the U.S. and Iran, it sidesteps any political agenda and gets down to capturing the thrilling, human drama at it's core. I'm not adverse to political film's at all. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy them but Affleck is wise not to get too bogged down in boardroom banter and bureaucracy when there's an brilliantly exciting story to tell. It does share similarities with the great political tinged thrillers of the 1970's like Alan J. Pakula's \"All The Presidents Men\" or \"The Parallax View\". The late 70's and early 80's style is captured to perfection by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Affleck's orchestration can sit comfortably beside any from that great decade of cinema.\n Chris Terrio's solid screenplay delivers many dialogue driven scenes but Affleck keeps things moving at a frantic pace and not for a second, does the film ever get dull or drawn out. The tension is almost unbearable at times. Why Affleck didn't, at the very least, nab an Oscar nomination for his substantial and well-constructed direction here is beyond me. There's no doubt that he's in complete command of his material as he leaps from Tehran to Washington to Tinseltown and delivers completely satisfying environments and effortless shifts in tone for the whole film to gel and come to life. He has the ability to capture a politically ravaged country; the backroom jargon of the CIA and the dark humour of Hollywood (that shares a strong resemblance to Barry Levinson's \"Wag The Dog\"). In order to capture this ludicrous, stranger-than-fiction story in it's entirety, it demands a maestro at work and Affleck can certainly consider himself one.\n This is the edge-of-your-seat tension that \"Zero Dark Thirty\" wishes it had. With only three film's under his hat, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Affleck has been at this directing malarky for a very long time. The comparisons with actor, turned quality director, Clint Eastwood will rage on and if anyone thinks otherwise, then Affleck can tell them to \"Argo fuck yourself\".",

The CIA was involved in the last few days and only in that Tony Mendez came out the day before they flew out and flew back with them. Yes the movie was written very well and the suspense was amazing but it is so important to know the difference between fiction and truth. This movie is based on a true event with wildly fictitious liberties taken that make the Americans look great.",

His masterful direction  and pacing of Argo induced nail-biting suspense in spite of the fact the movie is based on a true story and the outcome is known.  Neat trick.\n\nFolks my age remember well the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, but fewer remember that 6 Americans escaped the embassy and holed up in the Canadian Ambassador's house.  That the CIA rescued them was known at the time, but the operation details were classified until President Clinton declassified them.  Affleck gives a fine, understated performance  as the operative who conceives and carries out the rescue.  In fact, all the performances are very good.  But the devil's in the details and it's Affleck's execution of those details that bring this story home and brought it a well-deserved Oscar nomination.  Step-by-entertaining-step he makes us feel this story of a fake movie designed to reap not box office gold, but human lives, all the way to the harrowing run to the airport.  Argo proves that movies can be enjoyable AND about something.",

Reason being is that unlike Zero Dark Thirty that felt much like a documentary with characters that you might like in the background, it felt as if Argo was about the personal story of the characters with a documentary in the background. This would be acceptable had the movie been written with deep stories about the characters, but it wasen't. It's hard to explain what I mean. In short form, I didn't feel like I was watching a  complete documentary movie nor a complete movie about these characters, but instead a mixture that was a little off putting. It got too personal with the characters while not getting personal enough, if that makes sense. This made it feel a little stale throughout.\n\nOther than that confusion, it was great. Good acting (but not close to other nominated contenders), brilliant direction, and a well adapted story. It also probably had the best picture of the year, in my books.",

Eh...\" In a highly competitive field, this Warner Brothers picture seemed like an indie film in comparison to the likes of Spielberg's giant \"Lincoln.\" However, this film does something a bit unique that draws people in. No, it doesn't have a flashy cast (save for a few actors), or stunning visuals, or even the most steady camera angles. But it takes audiences on a dizzying journey of suspense around every corner - especially towards the end. It's almost as if you're one of the hostages trying to escape from the clutches of very militant Iranian forces. Part of you feels just as much doubt in the success of the operation as the characters onscreen. Yet despite this film's under-the-radar nature, it somehow finds its way as the frontrunner for Best Picture at this year's Oscars with six more nominations to boot. Personally, I don't think this was my favorite film of all time, or even of this year.

Another great note about Argo is the emotion and dialogue between the hostages. You can really tell the detail and development put into the characters.

The movie is almost entirely driven by the performances of Ben Affleck, John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and even the supporting actors feel just as strong and important as the leading men. Much of the film's success is due to Ben Affleck's extraordinary directing talent, which he uses skillfully to pull out the best of every single shot and every single character. He truly understands how to create cinematic tension, and there is always something at stake, and the stakes get higher as the film progresses. When the final scene unfolds, you can't stop biting your finger nails, hoping that they will somehow survive and make it home safely, and that is exactly what makes \"Argo\" the best film of 2012. It perfectly balances style and substance, and while being highly intense and deeply emotional, it also preserves a sense of realism and carries a timeless message of true heroism, which does not come from the act of violence but from the act of caring.\n\n5/5 stars",

            "content": "Since bursting onto the Hollywood scene with 1997's \"Good Will Hunting\" (and winning an Academy Award for writing it), Ben Affleck has had a bit of a spotty career as an actor.  There were some good movies (\"Dogma,\" \"Changing Lanes,\" \"Boiler Room\") and there were some bad movies (\"Pearl Harbor,\" \"Phantoms, \" \"Surviving Christmas\").  It's been up-and-down, but leaning more towards down.\n\nAs a director, however, he's 3 for 3.  In 2007, he directed his younger brother Casey in the complex, provocative \"Gone Baby Gone.\"  In 2010, he delivered a crime thriller in the vein of Michael Mann's \"Heat\" with \"The Town.\"  Now he's helmed his best film yet with the masterfully suspenseful and fact-based \"Argo.\"\n \nLike fellow Best Picture nominee \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" we already know the outcome before going into the movie.  Also like that film though, \"Argo\" somehow manages to inject an extreme amount of tension into the proceedings, despite this.  Affleck displays an almost Hitchockian ability to create feelings of unease and wariness.  The fact that the movie also contains some rather humorous moments makes it an even bigger triumph.  I loved that I could go from wringing my hands in one scene to laughing out loud in the next.  This is a great film, perhaps the best of the Oscar nominees, along with \"Django Unchained.\"  There's been some  minor controversy over the fact that Affleck did not get a nod for Best Director and now that I've seen the film, I can see why.  He most definitely got snubbed.\n \nThe backdrop of the film is the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis of the U.S. Embassy.  A bit of history: Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran and took its staff hostage.  They were demanding that the U.S. return their recently deposed Shah so that he could \"stand trial\" for the crimes he committed against their country.  Six employees managed to make it out of the embassy during the siege, and they took shelter in the home of the Canadian ambassador.  Knowing that it's only a matter of time before the militants figure out that some personnel are missing and begin conducting door-to-door searches, the CIA desperately tries to come up with a way to get the six Americans safely out of the country.\n \nEnter Tony Mendez (Affleck), an exfiltration expert.  He comes up with a seemingly insane idea: he'll fly to Iran with paperwork for the embassy employees, and the seven of them will pose as a Canadian film crew on a location scout for an upcoming sci-fi movie.  In order to make this cover story as convincing as possible, the CIA actually had to commission this imaginary movie to be made.  They buy a script, entitled \"Argo,\" and recruit a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin) and special effects man (John Goodman) to assist in the process.  They hold casting calls, submit press releases, and create a film poster.  The lengths they went to to sell the cover story are astounding, but they were also, as it turns out, very necessary.\n \nWhen Mendez arrives in Iran, the film really kicks into gear.  The suspense is ratcheted up in scene after scene, with the most intense arguably being the one in which the Americans actually go out in public to make it appear like they are scouting locations for their \"movie.\"  This movie is filled with those white-knuckled, grip-the-theater-chair-arm-rest-as-hard-as-you-can moments.  What a life Tony Mendez must've lived; at one point, he tells the embassy staff, \"This is what I do\" and \"I believe my cover story is the only thing between your head and a gun.\"  To come up with exfiltration missions and then carry them out as your daily job...I can't even imagine.\n \nAffleck is very good in his understated performance as Mendez, but the real gems here are Arkin and Goodman, who inject the very welcome comic relief in between the scenes of almost unbearable anxiety.  \"If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit,\" Arkin crows at one point, with one of his many funny lines.  The rest of the supporting cast is also strong, with a who's-who of reliable character actors such as Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Phillip Baker Hall.\n \n\"Argo\" tells the kind of story that, on its surface, seems too preposterous to be true.  How could anyone have pulled off such an insane scheme?  It's humorous to note that even the CIA knew how crazy the whole thing sounded.  \"They're all bad ideas,\" states Cranston, as Mendez' superior, \"but this is the best bad idea we have.\"  Perhaps the lunacy of the whole thing worked out in its favor; perhaps the Iranian officials just couldn't believe anyone could be so reckless.  Also, when considering how far Mendez and his crew went to portray their movie as the real deal, perhaps it's really not as surprising as one might think.\n\nThe irony of this whole thing is that the story sounds exactly like the plot of a Hollywood thriller, and now Affleck has made it into just that; art imitating life imitating art, as it were.  The real-life \"Argo\" never got made, but Affleck's \"Argo\" is an out-and-out triumph.  It seems to be the new favorite to win Best Picture, and truthfully I'm having a hard time coming up with arguments against that.",

When I left the theater after the movie ended, I still found myself closely watching everyone around me.  Sure, there were some cliche moments here and there in the movie such as everything that could go wrong, did go wrong and the most skeptical member of the group became three most relevant. The overall acting, story, and cinematography overcame any flaws with this movie.  I found myself cheering for the group and urging them on.  I also cried with them.  The carefully placed memories from the time period added to the appeal of this movie.  There were some young newscasters.  There were also toys every child from the time period should remember:  Star Wars action figures and the 2XL robot/8-track player.  I highly recommend this movie.  Beware that it deserves its R-rating due to a couple of disturbing death scenes and some profanity.",

            "content": "A crowd pleasing oscar bait ridden film that showcases Affleck's directorial capability with his material choice in the post-9/11 terrorist paranoia era. Affelck's careful choice in scenery, camera levels and stylized cintematography work in very of the film, especially when recreating historical facts and scenes that had been captured in media. There were of course problems in that the film focuses primarily on the American involvement of the operation and downplays the Canadian segment and I think over lauding with particular actors such as Arkin whose character really isn't of interest, yet enjoys an oscar nomination. Overall a crowd pleasing but calculated film that does not spare brandishing the American flag or sending up the Hollywood achievements, but it is not without merit. \n\nI should note however that as this is a major Best Picture contender I had a much higher expectation than most of the other nominees. First time rating 8.0/10",

I like to think we are more civilized - but are we really more civilized, or are we just more sedated? Thinking back on the riots we've had in the U.S. over history, I think our people definitely have the potential to perpetrate mob-crimes in a similar manner as the embassy storming and kidnapping, particulalry when provoked by foreigners...\n\nThe film had an interesting premise, but in order to make an entertaining movie was obviously embellished with stock-movie suspense-builders, character sympathy-generators, and easy laughs. So in the end, while telling an interesting story, I was disengaged by the hackneyed plot and character devices tacked on...But if they hadn't done it, I probably would have been bored to death anyways. \n\nThe scene at the end with the movie storyboard cells was a nice climax that I did appreciate. I think the lesson that our erstwhile middle-eastern 'enemies' see themselves as storybook underdog heroes fighting against an alien [foreign] invader/oppressor is a valuable one. The parallels between star wars (rebels vs. empire) and the modern middle eastern insurgency continues to be interesting.\n\nIt's worth a watch if you are really into Iranian history, but otherwise is not a must-see by any means.",

Well it wasn't easy. A cover story had to be concocted. The story that the CIA settled on was having an agent Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) come to Tehran posing as Canadian film-maker looking to scout locations for a fake science-fiction movie called \"Argo.\" The seven Americans would then be pulled out of Tehran under the guise of belonging to his \"film crew.\" Was it a \"lousy plan?\" Yes, but it was the \"best lousy plan\" that the CIA had and it played on the Iranian regime's desire to portray itself as \"normal,\" that is, eager to accept foreigners, if _not_ Americans, coming to their country \"do business\" even perhaps \"making films.\"\n\nAnyway, the film's based a true story and it offers a bright spot in an episode in American history that most of us Americans would probably want to forget.  -- Fr.

            "content": "The true star of this stunning political drama-thriller is Ben Affleck, the director.  Growing more assured in his third outing behind the camera, Affleck effectively exorcises the Ghosts of Shameful Blockbusters Past (Pearl Harbor, Gigli, anyone?) in proving to the world that he is a whip-smart, cast-iron filmmaker of class, wit, depth, vision and craft - and that he's here to stay.  Taking an unbelievable true story from a declassified 1970's CIA operation, Affleck tells his story with tension, politics, humour and an acute understanding of the politics of the time.  Deftly mixing America's political climate with its immediate storyline - the extraction of five American Diplomats hiding in Tehran's Canadian embassy during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979 - the film is tense without being laborious, pacy without sacrificing content and time-sensitive without being incongruous.  Argo is a thriller that is sensitive and critical at the same time, moving at a deft, nimble speed, aided in no small measure by the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto, who creates muted, hushed tones in recreating the 70's, Sharon Seymour's sensitive production design and the editor William Goldenberg's insightful, perceptive movement between scenes.  Affleck also shines in front of the camera as Tony Mendez, the man tasked with bringing in the five, who must pose as a film crew looking to make a Star Wars rip-off with Iran as its main location.  Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and the always dependable John Goodman also put in stellar work, but in the end, it is Affleck the director's show - a tour de force of pacing, tension, politics, and agile storytelling.  He would be well within his rights in dismissing anyone insinuating otherwise with the most unforgettable quip from the film: \"Argo fuck yourself!\"",

I realize that this is a true story and you can only take so many liberties before it becomes completely fiction, but nothing ever amounted to anything, just tons of build up over and over again.

The story is laid out, albeit straight-forwardly but still suspensefully on it's tracks and towards the end, the levels of suspense are close to horror movie scales, so you truly care (if you don't know the real story already, that is) about what happen to the characters. \nSo in the end, \"Argo\" continues Affleck's great stride as a director and while he doesn't give anything super special on screen, he has real talent behind the camera and it is good to see an actor turn into a good director, even though he still casts himself to the lead part.",

It's the most complex and interesting film of the nominees, and while it will be ignored by the Academy, it should not be by audiences.\n\nArgo is about a group of Americans who are stuck in Iran with no way out. That is until Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) has an idea to disguise himself as a film maker, and goes in to get them out. He doesn't just have to pretend he's making a film, but he needs to make posters, storyboards, and hold press conferences. \n\nThe casting is perfect, mostly because the actors look like their real life counterpart. The actors all play it straight, and even though they're well known, you almost forget it and think of them as the characters only.\n\nAffleck is a fantastic actor, but he's an even better director. At this point, he can do no wrong between Argo and The Town. I do hope he keeps up directing, because he is bringing new things to cinema that only he can.\n\nMy favorite scenes in this film are the escape scenes from Iran. Even though you know they get out, you still feel tense and still have this feeling that they'll get caught. This is again thanks to great directing and acting.\n\nI could keep going on about this film, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Just a well made film that everyone needs to see.

The acting is solid, no stand-out performances but everyone plays their part well and many of the cast were very similar to the real people, I was slightly distracted by how many actors from genre TV were present though. I was also reminded of how cool the late 70s looked.  Superior in every way to Zero Dark Thirty.",

Hopefully this will mark the start of him choosing someplace else to make his films. First of all, Affleck should really stop cast himself in his own films. He's distracting and I couldn't get over the fact that in Argo he looks a lot like his pothead character in Extract. Secondly, I find it pretty amusing that this film is being touted like a mature political thriller for adults, Oscar-worthy, like a serious film. It isn't. It's just a decent heist film. It's a pretty incredible story although it isn't so interesting, as we all know how this is going to play out before we watch the film, and it is certainly well made, but it feels like they just scratched the surface. The opening sequence was amazing, and I loved the addition of actual footage. The scenes in Hollywood were funny, but because the narrative structure bounces around so often balancing the story lines, I never got a sense of who were these people that were being rescued. I never felt like I got to know anyone, or got really emotionally invested with any of the characters. They were just faces. Affleck seemed much more interested in moving the plot along than getting to know anyone. And because of this, the climax doesn't really hit nearly as strong as it could have. It kind of reminded me a film I watched a couple of months ago, The Next Three Days. I also liked that, but it was sort of the same kind of thing, a well made story but it had no to little emotional impact. Also, the film had no real climax. Really. The big climax were minor instances of Affleck milking some tension out of supposedly tense moments. The part with the tickets being cleared, the phone call not being picked up, the bus not working or the (attempted?) chase scene after they get on the plane felt so forced that it took me out of the experience.",

The ticket confirmation, the boarding of the plane, the answering of the phone by the movie guys, the takeoff of the plane, the Canadians leaving their house were all last second. There came a point where I was getting tired of the last second crap. It was way too Hollywood. Despite it trying to be so dramatic, I still think that it was too long, and too boring during a lot of the movie. I believe the thinking was it couldn't be just good, it had to be epic. And in order to be epic, it has to be at least two hours. Well they got what they wanted at the expense of the movie's greatness. I believe if this was a 90 minute movie, it would have been very tense and dramatic the entire time, and it could have been great. As for the acting, I thought it was nothing spectacular. Not bad, but really nothing too difficult. Since it should have been 90 minutes, not 120, that is a 3/4 ratio, or 75% goodness. I will round down because of the over-dramatizing, and give it a 70. Not really that great, but enjoyable. Not worthy of best picture.",

            "content": "\"Gone Baby Gone\", \"The Town\", and now, \"Argo\". Ben Affleck scores a hattrick with three acclaimed films that exhibit his command behind the camera, and you'll probably find it tough to find anyone not convinced he makes a better director than in front of the camera as an actor. Producing the film with George Clooney and Grat Heslov, who did the award winning \"Good Night, and Good Luck\", \"Argo\" is also based on history (with its fair share of dramatic licence) that uniquely combined Hollywood's role during the tumultuous times of the Iran hostage crisis of the late 70's to 80's. \n\nIn 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans are taken hostage. However, six manage to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador, and the CIA is eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options and with great concern, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) devises a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as as a production crew. Once the operation gets the green light from Washington, \"Argo\" goes to Hollywood, where a makeup man played by John Goodman and a producer played by Alan Arkin, advise Tony on how to set up a phony movie -- a shockingly easy feat in a town where, as Arkin's character observes, \"people lie for a living.\" Like \"Wag the Dog\" before it, \"Argo\" takes full advantage of the overlap between trade craft and showbiz, depicting the movie industry as deceitful and vindictive. \n\nWorking from a well-crafted script by Chris Terrio, Affleck threads viewers through the dauntingly geopolitics and tonal shifts of \"Argo\" with an utterly flawless sense of control, starting with an efficient, boldly graphic prologue explaining the roots of the Iranian Islamic revolution and putting viewers inside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran when it is stormed in November 1979. From the chaos of those moments and ensuing days, he moves to the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), who has agreed to house six Americans who managed to escape the takeover. He then smoothly shifts back to Washington, where the State Department and the CIA weigh rescue options. \n\nThere is a notable lack of on-screen bloodshed or violence, confident in it's story, plight and characters having the strength to invoke the thrills and edge-of-your-seat tension that makes it such a compelling view. Throw in the injection of humour, grounded as they are by being based on actual events. A surprisingly celebratory, feel-good tone that rather than dwelling on any political overtones or commentary, instead focuses on the spirit of camaraderie and co-operation. Technically, the production values are fantastic demonstrating great attention to detail paid in recreating production sets. The film quality is made to resemble something coming out of the era, relying also on archived footage to lend that documentary feel to the retelling of the \"Canadian Caper\", as it is known. \n\nA closing-credits side-by-side montage shows to what lengths Affleck has gone to re-create the real-life places and people of \"Argo\", but it's his command of his craft -- the staging, editing and judiciously calibrated unfolding of the story, especially its harrowing final moments -- that solidifies Mr. Affleck as a talented and formidable director. \"Argo\" deserves to find the discerning audience it has been made for: After all, if we buy tickets, that means more smart, sophisticated filmmaking.",

Despite some historical inaccuracies (the Canadian ambassadors + embassy were the true heroes and not the CIA really but this is a dramatization of the true story so I guess it's all right. Really really harsh depiction of the Iranians though), Argo is rightfully nominated as one of the best films in 2012. Affleck's direction is impeccable and the editing is spot on as he was able to make a really THRILLING thriller and at the same time, a dark comedy. He was able to string together various genres and he was able to make it work. I agree with Dr. Kermode that the funny parts were genuinely funny and there were a lot of on-the-edge-of-your-seats moments. Best of all, this was a movie that enabled discussion and debate afterwards because it showed that you genuinely cared for these characters/based-on-real-life-people. The movie actually kind of reminds me of Hotel Rwanda because of the urgency and the high stakes of the mission. \n\nI can't recommend this enough. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS!",
