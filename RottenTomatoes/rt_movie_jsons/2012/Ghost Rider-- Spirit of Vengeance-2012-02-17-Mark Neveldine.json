Johnny meets a priest named Moreau (Idris Elba), who asks Johnny to find a boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) and bring him back. But there's a catch -- Satan (Ciarán Hinds) is looking for the boy too, and has a personal stake in the matter. But if Johnny can find Danny first and save the boy's soul, there's a chance Johnny can save his own soul as well.",

Pra piorar, o filme não possui os melhores atores do primeiro: Sam Eliott (que já tinha a sua não-participação esperada, pois o seu personagem faz a sua última corrida no fim do primeiro filme, e depois nunca mais o vemos: ou seja, é provável que ele tenha morrido.E Peter Fonda , como Mephisto, que foi substituído por um aluno de atuação de filmes de baixo custo, pois tem uma péssima atuação, que não chega nem as unhas do pé de seu substituído. Continuando, o CGI inexplicavelmente piorou em relação ao primeiro, com um motoqueiro fantasma com aspecto escuro e mais acabado ( o que poderia ser bem aproveitado, mas eles utilizam dessa nova aparência para inserir no filme uma cena sem sentido nenhum do motoqueiro fantasma urinando. E por fim, esse roteiro horrível, contando com uma direção de um segurador de câmera amador, ainda tem a proeza de deixar o impecável Idris Elba um personagem chato. Um padre bêbado que inferniza Johnny Blaze, que poderia ser cortado sem alteração na história, assim como esse filme, que poderia não existir para termos só o primeiro para lembrar como bom.\nConclusão\nDireção: 2,0\nAtuações: 3,5\nHistória: 5,5\nRoteiro: 4,0\nCGI: 6,0\nNota Final: 3,5/10",

            "content": "A miserable, soulless sequel to a heartfelt adventure.\n\nDirectors Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine's comic book thriller Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) really ruined any interest I had gained from loving Mark Steven Johnson's original Ghost Rider. Gone is Johnson's moody atmosphere and pleasant humor. Instead Taylor and Neveldine shoot everything during the day and it ruins any dark feeling for Ghost Rider, let alone the complete lack of any humor or character drama. This is truly a bargain bin movie. The budget is clearly lower as the practical effects are mostly gone and everything is hideous CGI and awful lighting. The goofy animated transition sequences are pretty amateur and the CGI looks worse than the first movie. Writer David S. Goyer's Antichrist storyline is tired and boring with every cliche imaginable. Screenplay writers Seth Hoffman and Scott M. Gimple writes corny, unfunny jokes with terrible dialogue. Everything is exposition instead of natural conversations. I hate this movie.\n\nNicolas Cage is given nothing to do or say as Johnny Blaze. He tries to be heartfelt, but there's nothing he can do, but act insane. He overacts this weird twitchy because suddenly being Ghost Rider is painful unlike before. I just thought all the cool moments were when he was Ghost Rider with the flaming skull. They barely even gave him skeleton hands except for one scene. I loathe the retconned flashback with Ionut Cristian Lefter as Young Johnny Blaze. Why show up Ghost Rider's origins, but different? Johnny Whitworth is awful as the bad guy henchman Ray Carrigan. He delivers lines like he's on a television show. He also looks like an uglier young Kurt Russell. His decay powers as Blackout were boring and the darkness abilities barely did anything. Fergus Riordan is annoying as the kid Danny Ketch. He's always angry and dismissive, so his character is just obnoxious.\n\nThey could not even get Peter Fonda back as Mephistopheles. His portrayal of The Devil was fun and scary. Ciarán Hinds is strange and not scary as The Devil, now called Roarke for no reason. Violante Placido is given nothing to do as Danny's Romani mother Nadya Ketch. We know hardly anything about her and she does next to nothing but be suspicious. She looks like they could not get Asia Argento for this, so Violante will have to do. She is very pretty though. Idris Elba is phoning in his performance as Moreau. A secret religious society priest or something, who likes to drink and shoot guns. All the other characters are basically just stunt men. \n\nBrian Berdan's annoying editing style has all these jerky cuts that never cease. It pulls you out of the movie every time, so Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance feels like 3 hours even though it is only 96 minutes. Brandon Trost's cinematography is basically all shaky camera in wide shots. The camera never stops moving and every single scene looks like it was shot by the stunt team's co-ordinator in 20 minutes. I hate the visual look of this horrendous sequel. Kevin Phipps' production design looks like they found a few ruins and made cheap tv quality sets that are ugly and plain. Dominic Capon's set decoration is so sparse, it's like why did they even bother?\n\nComposer David Sardy's score tries to one up the original with the rock and metal noises incorporated with the symphonic elements, but it's just loud and annoying this time. There's only like two cool rock tracks that even standout. They either needed a bigger score or way more metal songs that fit Ghost Rider's aesthetic. Bojana Nikitović's costumes for all the people look just like whatever they had lying around. I hate the charred black leather jacket for Ghost Rider and his burned bike as they both looked cooler in the first movie.\n\nIn short, skip Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and just stick with the first movie Ghost Rider. I'll always wonder how this turned out so horrible compared to the humorous, cool, and exciting thrills of Ghost Rider.",

And the way it began I was even convinced that it's gonna be better. Turns out this one is even worse.\n\nYou gotta give them this one - the CGI flame on Ghost Rider now looks a lot more believable. But the VFX of anything else is terrible. Occasionally the movie uses weird emboss and black-and-white effect as if it's a Bollywood movie. It seemed as though the editors had just got After Effects and they wanted to add every effect they could find.\n\nThe story has no connection with the first film whatsoever. They even get the recap wrong! It shows that Johnny fell to the Devil's feet and cut his finger intentionally to sign the contract, while in reality the Devil had come to his tent when he was repairing his bike, and his finger accidentally got cut and the blood fell on the contract. The setting also doesn't make any sense. Johnny moved to Middle East because he didn't want to hurt anyone. But that's literally what he does there also. And in spite of being set in Middle East they don't show anything related to Middle East throughout the movie.\n\nThe acting continues to hold the same momentum as the prequel, by which I mean the same campy overacting. At least this time Johnny doesn't point at people and say \"You!\". Instead in the end he said \"Hell yes.\" after pushing the Devil back in hell.\n\nI'm really grateful that this series didn't have a third movie. Ghost Rider needs to be a grim, gritty movie with a lot of violence and heavy metal music, not this campy film series. Because no matter what you say, I can never take Nicolas Cage seriously. He's a fusion of Govinda and Uday Chopra. And I can't consider that to be the demon hunting Ghost Rider.",

Cenas de medo, angustia, drama e \"psicóticas\" se tornam cômico de tão pastelão que é. Simplesmente não convence. A historia do filme anterior foi super ignorada, apenas para tapar os furos e não precisar justificá-los, afinal, é muito mais fácil só pegar o que interessa. Os personagens são terríveis, e ponto. Não há o menor desenvolvimento, apenas baseando-os em arquétipos pobres e fingindo que basta.\n\nPra não dizer que tudo é ruim, a CGI do motoqueiro me parece legal. A mudança de comportamento dele seria interessante se o filme fosse razoável, mas como quase tudo é demasiadamente ruim, fica difícil associar isso como um fator isolado bom.\n\nAudio: English, with Portuguese subtitles.

On occasion the movie certainly got wacky but it never locked in on that style for long. Whether it was studio meddling, the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, or general reluctance to push the envelope, the movie fell flat. It never settles in on a proper tone, because sometimes we watch Nicolas Cage unhinged like only he can do as he’s half-transforming into the Ghost Rider, but other times we have serious conversations about destiny and regret. Often these two totally different styles of scenes will come one right after the next, or Nicolas Cage will go from 1 to 100 within a single shot. Sometimes the bad guys seem frightening and intimidating, and other times they come across as bumbling and goofy. Even the characters themselves don’t have consistent personalities from one scene to the next (or even consistent accents in the case of Idris Elba.) I’ve never been a big fan of Ghost Rider as a character, and Spirit of Vengeance did not help with that at all. Here they try to overcomplicate the origins of the Rider, probably in an attempt to explain why he’s a good guy, but none of it makes sense anyways so I’m not sure why they feel compelled to work so hard at justifying the character’s existence. I was also surprised they added literally zero special effect in this film to his penance stare, so it’s just these long goofy shots where we see a CGI burning skull staring at an actor who is doing his best to look like something is happening to him. Meanwhile, we get a new villain that can magically make everything decay until he can’t or doesn’t want to for the convenience of the plot. It’s all nonsense, and since the story lacks structure, I never felt a desire to try and comprehend what was happening. While a few of the visual effects were fun, and they used some interesting shot selection in the action scenes, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is still a bad film that actually managed to be worse than the origin story.",

The action sequences are better, the Ghost Rider is better utilized, if only because the shorter runtime creates the illusion that he has more screen time than he actually has and Nicolas Cage is having more fun with his performance this time around. But does that make it a good movie in its own right? The star rating has already answered that question. The CGI, while not terrible, has a more uneven look, compared to the first film. The story and script are rather generic and not wholly original. In fact, they even put in 3 animated sequences done in a comic book style to cut corners. I love those types of sequences in films but here, they feel like they're mostly there in an attempt to keep your attention. Though considering that the directors were also writers on Jonah Hex, a comic book movie on par with the first Ghost Rider film, to say the least, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. There are some rather bizarre things in this movie that have to be seen to be believed. Ghost Rider peeing fire and 2 instances of Johnny Blaze v Ghost Rider that's edited like a '90s/ early 2000's heavy metal music video. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is so bad, it's good but I'd rather take a movie that embraces that rather than the first film's more boring, slow-paced nature.",

The script comes from David Goyer of Blade and Dark Knight theme, but then they got the directors of crank to create it and those two creative forces don't feel like a particularly good fit. It feels like you can tell where David Goyer is trying to write this movie with biblical types and symbolisms, and then the guys from crank are like \"And let's have ghost riders start peeing\". The movie starts and closes energetic enough, but the middle section slows to a halt when they go and visit some monks. I feel like this movie could have been quite a bit better in the hands of a different director, probably a more horror based director, but as is this movie feels like eating ice cream covered in ketchup.\n",

The action sequences were also top notch. However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general. Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with. In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist. In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place. So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya (Violante Placido) escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help. The Ghost Rider - is a vengeful, fiery spirit who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how small the infraction - anything from genocide to a white lie - the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) aka The Ghost Rider into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him with some ease and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthood's ability to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse forever... \n\nReviewers who viewed an early preview screening at the December 2011 Butt-Numb-A-Thon in Austin expressed negative reactions to the film. Two attendants said it was worse than the first Ghost Rider film, and one said that the sequel makes the first film \"look like The Dark Knight\" by comparison. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"With a weak script, uneven CG work, and a Nicolas Cage performance so predictably loony it's no longer amusing, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance aims to be trashy fun but ends up as plain trash.\" \n\nThe first Ghost Rider movie was ok, not top notch, but ok despite Nicolas Cage being in his usual overdrive mode. But, to be honest \"Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance\" looks like a poor Eastern Europe low budget production and the feeling of being a bad tv-film looms all over the film. The plot, the script, the acting, and the special effects are just poor. Nicolas Cage can´t play Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider, it´s a fact. He just fucks it up. Idris Elba seems lost and you just know when Christopher Lambert has a part it simply won´t be a film to remember and when a film is not screened in advance for critics you can figure out the end result by yourself. \"Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance\" classifies as a pretty bad comic superhero production.",

I liked the first ghost rider movie and I thought this movie would sorta fix what the first movie did wrong but nope but one thing that stayed the same is ghost rider himself and how he kills people and his fiery on fire face with revenge but that's another question I have why does he have revenge, he's saving not his movie but some other random girls kid, like what, ghost rider didn't have to be in this movie but because he's the start and they can't come up with any good ideas, yeah Sony I'm talking to you, give all marvel rights you have to Disney, I forgot at the time this movie came out Disney didn't own marvel but now give them to Disney, Disney makes everything good except some pirates of the Caribbean movies but just give it to them. The plot / story was unoriginal, saving the kid from becoming something bad, was it even in the comics, I highly doubt it because that's the cheesiest plot ever.

            "content": "Spoiler filled review\n\n(Synopsis)\n\nNicolas Cage returns as the Ghost Rider for this sequel (of sorts) to the 2007 film \"Ghost Rider\".  This time we see Johnny Blaze traveling the world  around Eastern Europe taking refuge.  Until he is confronted by a Monk (Idris Elba) asking for his help in protecting a special young boy.  At first Blaze is unwilling until the monk explains to him that he can in fact get rid of his \"curse\".  The only catch is that Mephistopheles/The Devil (Cirian Hinds) wants him too.  So bad he even endows some of his power to bring about a new foe for the Rider to face.  Johnny learns that The Devil (going by the name of Roarke) is wanting to use this boy as a host to walk the earth and spread his will.  What Roarke doesn't know is that when the Ghost Rider is involved, nothing is that easy.\n\n(Review)\n\nThe definition of â??Sequelâ?? states:  A published, broadcast, or recorded work that continues the story or develops the theme of an earlier one.  So, yes this is a sequelâ?¦ just checking.   Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor tag team this effort in bringing Ghost Rider back to theatres.  You would think that two brains are better than one?  Not in this case.  Now, as far as a Ghost Rider â??movieâ?? I liked this movie better than the first one.  Even with the lackluster critical acclaim it fit more of the Ghost Rider character than the earlier attempt.  Devoid of  the Elvis crap, and â??pointing at everything that movesâ?? as well as Eva Mendes.  So, I canâ??t give them fault in trying to resolve all the 2007 moviesâ?? faults.  They even decided to make Nic Cage do the physical acting for Ghost Rider this time around.  Look kids itâ??s not Franken-Rider!! In trying to resolve these problems they've created some new ones.  Ooh, let's find out shall we?\n\nThe acting and actors themselves were a turnaround that was definitely welcomed.  Except for one Nicolas Cage-bot that hampered many scenes with his overacting and his uncomfortable exchanges with the other actors.  It was unexpected to see them cast him again but honestly it helps keep continuity in play but his second chance was wasted.  Examples may include but not limited to 1) The exchange with the nurse â??Iâ??m flirtingâ??.  2) The exchange with Nadya in the car â??The rider is gonna â?¦ Come out!â??  3)  The exchange with the low life at the underground fight club â??Scrapinâ?? at the door!, Scrapinâ?? at the door!â??  and about 30-40 more small instances where you really question this guyâ??s ability not only to act but to function in society.  Iâ??ll tell you though Moreau (Idris Elba) was the highlight of the movie for me.  Loved his acting and his character was great.  Ray Carrigan/Blackout (Johnny Whitworth) had to have gone to the Stephen Dorf acting school for lame side villains.  I can almost guarantee it.  Cirian Hinds (Roarke) plays his part as the Devil but doesnâ??t stand out.\n\nThat brings up Roarke.  Why â??Roarkeâ???  I mean Mephisto, no wait... The Devil, Mephistopheles, Lord of Evil, Prince of Devils, Prince of Lies, Lord of the Lower Depths, Satan, Beelzebub, Maya, Lucifer, Nick Scratch, the Friend, Legion but he has never ever been called â??Roarkeâ??.  What, there wasnâ??t enough name choice to choose from?  As far as Danny Ketch is concerned it seems like they (David S. Goyer) just wanted to use the name for fan-boy recognition.  Danny Ketch is the 3rd Ghost Rider in comic history.  He is not the following:  Son of Satan, a kid when Blaze meets him, Son to a woman name Nadya.  Blackout was a constant villain for Danny Ketchâ??s Ghost Rider iteration in comics but that is another change that was made to fit into the story?  Somebody needs to proofread Goyerâ??s work.  Ray Carrigan/Blackout was a gun-runner for Roarke and at death when Roarke imbues his mystical bad guy powers to him.  This gives Blackout the power of Darkness and Decay.  To find out more about the real Blackout character click here.  Blackoutâ??s comic book persona had the power of Darkness but this new â??Decayâ?? thing is new to the character.  Probably added due to the Twinkie scene.\n\nThis movie had a certain â??grittinessâ?? that is needed for the character.  I felt the cut scenes helped push the audience through giving them the knowledge needed to continue on.  I could have done without the over the top action camera movements.  I was glad to see Ghost Rider traveling the world as he has been known to do and it catches that same vibe of him running into situations based on his location.  Although, I did not feel that Ghost Rider needed to be â??Horrorâ?? movie flick type scary-guy.  Which is what I feel was the direction.  At moments itâ??s pretty cool, but there is too much of it and it takes away from the character.  I loved all action scenes with GR and I wish he would have had more speaking lines.  â??Road-killâ??.  I also loved that they expanded more on Zarathos the Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nSo, on the whole it was better than the first for me.  Nic Cage needs to stop.  Before I end this I have a final question to the masterwork of David S. Goyer (Blade Trilogy, Batman Trilogy).  Does the Devil honestly need sedatives to make the boy relax?\n\nComic Book Movie Plus:  Idris Elba: Thor, The Losers - Nicholas Cage: Ghost Rider, Kick-Ass",

There are a few fight scenes, but they are so uneventful and slow they are actually boring. Even the special effects are well below par. Nicholas Cage is hard to buy as haunted stuntman and former wild-child. There is nothing stoic about him. The digital form if Ghost Rider is even flatter. At least, Idris Elba has some presence, but his role is limited as a supporting character. Things happen, but they are not exciting and there is no emotion or impact.

The action sequences were also top notch.  However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general.  Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with.  In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist.  In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place.  So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

However, that doesn't make up for the film's shoddy writing, which, if you can believe it, is even worse the film's predecessor, to the point that the story constantly gets worse. It wouldn't be so bad if the writers knew how to handle the film's concept, which would have been decent if it weren't held back by incompetent writing, a lame script, and Nicholas Cage's signature bad acting. The fight scenes are okay, but they look poorly done. In fact, I can't help but think they were heavily neutered just to make the film more accessible, but it just ruins the movie and makes it harder for me to overlook the obvious writing problems. Given everything I just said, it's no wonder why Nicholas Cage doesn't want to be the Ghost Rider more, and abandoning the Ghost Rider franchise might just be the smartest move he's ever made.",

Both have the same faults, or even if they have different ones, the overall level of awfulness generated by them are in the same level. With that said, this stand-alone sequel has one or two cool things, but it's not worth it. The story didn't get any better or bigger, the characters are one-dimensional trash and the movie is not really all that fun, it's mostly a bore...you know, just like the first one.\n\nNicolas Cage does his classic rampage acting that was absent from the previous one, but appears only slightly (if you want to see him going all-out jam, better watch Face/Off) and when he is Ghost Rider, he's mostly acting all quiet and rather quick, so much that you can't catch a thing with your human eyes. It's basically drugs. And we shouldn't be surprised by that, as the director of this movie is the Neveldine & Taylor duo, who is known for the Crank movies starring Jason Statham. Those movies have the character needing some kind of element to be in full energy mode. That creates a lot of drug-inducing-like sequences, which the duo know how to do very well. They forgot to put the same effort and joy here in Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nThe more I think about it, this movie would have been a lot better if they used the style of the Crank movies. Just imagine: a Crank movie but with Nic Cage as Ghost Rider as the main character...that sounded like the craziest yet fittest idea ever. But all we got was trash, just poorly managed and directed trash.\n\nThe story is very thin, practically the whole plot can be written down in one poster tagline. The size is so little that makes the movie really nothing important. In fact, I tell you this: every time you go into a movie store and you see an empty shelve, IT'S NOT AN EMPTY SHELVE. Why? Because Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is there. Still don't see it? Well, it is there, but its importance and presence is so little that the eye can't see it, because our brain doesn't care about it and thus, it practically almost doesn't exist. So, remember, everytime there's an empty movie shelve, it's only because there's a Ghost Rider sequel DVD or Blu Ray right there.\n\nOverall, this movie is just as bad as the first one. For everything it improved from the first, it works it out with another mistake of its own. These movies are unimpressive and ridiculous. Simply watch The Avengers or the first Iron Man, and there's your Marvel Comics movie.",

There are some definite unexpected twists.  The effects are meant to be surreal--dream-like.  They are, and I love it.  Despite the dark atmosphere, there is also some good humor.  Overall, the theme is one of redemption, of things meant for evil being turned around and used for good.  This is an excellent movie.  The acting from all of the main characters is superb.  I'm guessing that those who hated it don't like surrealistic, supernatural thrillers with redemptive themes.

The film's action scenes are  underdeveloped and some of the dialogue is a bit corny, also the characters are also underdeveloped which is what is the main key in the development of any well rounded movie in any genre. The film may have many flaws but the film sort of redeems itself near the very end, and occasionally good scenes, and also the film's intro and title sequence voiced by lead actor Cage have some show of what the film would have been like if it had developed the second and third acts as well as the films first act, but the film is way too formulaic to the point of being absolutely predictable.

The story is basic and needs some more development but the 3D and action totally make up where the story doesn't. The Ghost Rider takes control of several vehicles and tears up location after location, one scene includes a giant quarry digger, it sets aflame and starts crushing bad guys and blowing stuff up taking down multiple enemies, and he also takes on a whole motorway full of the Devil's right hand men which ends up in more destruction. Spirit Of Vengeance shows what 3D can do at it's best alongside the wild camerawork from Neveldine and Taylor. Glass shatters, flames and cinders float out the screen in extreme force.

Unfortunately for fools like me who paid to see it, this one isn't any better.\n\nThat said, \"Spirit of Vengeance\" isn't any worse either.  The light humor of the first film is replaced by strange and bizarre storytelling.  The plot is not engaging, the dialogue is juvenile, and the characters are one-dimensional.  The action is a step above the first film, but is still pretty bad.  What I can say I like about \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is that there is some interesting camera work and really impressive (but also not-so-impressive) visuals.  I especially like the nice touch added of Blaze's leather jacket bubbling from the heat.\n\nThe acting in this is bad all around.  Nicolas Cage's performance is just awful; far worse than the first.  His line-delivery is atrocious.  The other cast members are people you've never heard of and will never hear of again.  The only bright point is Idris Elba's character.  I always enjoy Idris Elba, and he makes the best of an otherwise poorly written character.\n\n\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a film behind the times.  With \"The Avengers\" only months away, this film will quickly be forgotten.  \"Spirit of Vengeance\" takes a lot of pages from \"Jonah Hex's\" book (right down to the out-of-place animated scenes), and the results are predictably devastating.  This is a joyless film; the result of it taking itself too seriously.  As it turns out, Ghost Rider not only has the ability to suck the soul out of people...He can suck it out of films too.",

            "content": "Very rarely does a movie fail on every conceivable level. Almost every movie ever made has some kind of redeeming value. I'll bet big money that even Movie 43 has one non-awful moment. This, unfortunately, is not the case with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, the second installment in the Marvel hero film series starring Nicolas Cage in the title role. Now, Cage has never been famous for choosing good movies, but this one really takes the cake. No hyperbole here: There is not one good moment in this entire load of elephant shit. It's a film that qualifies for that criminally underused term: The anus of cinema.\r\n\r\nGhost Rider 2 makes literally no effort in terms of plot, but I will try to explain it anyway: A woman made a deal with the devil, in which she was saved from certain death, but impregnated with the devil's baby. Rosemary's Baby rip-offs aside, this is a horrendous and mind-bogglingly inept premise that should never have gotten past the brainstorming sessions. Nic Cage as the Ghost Rider himself isn't even onscreen that much, and he basically moves through the story without furthering the plot very much. It doesn't center around him at all. Which would be excusable if... you know... his name wasn't in the title.\r\n\r\nWhat kills this movie even more is the godawful dialogue. \"WERE YOU SENT BY THE DEVIL WHO WALKS THE EARTH?\" It's as if the movie's producers pulled a semi-psychotic homeless man with a tinfoil hat off the street and asked him to write a script for them. It absolutely reeks, not to mention the typically over-the-top Nic Cage performance. What differs his gimmicks here from his performance in Con Air or Face/Off is just the fact that the crazy act has gotten old. His freak outs feel manufactured and you can tell he's not putting his heart into it. Even for people who enjoy watching bad Nic Cage movies (and I know there are a lot of them out there), this is not worth the time or the energy. It's not even so-bad-it's-good, it's just bad. Also, the movie squanders the immense appeal and acting capability of Idris Elba, who probably regrets being in this thing immensely.\r\n\r\nWhat blew my mind, however, was the CGI. It was somehow worse than it was in the first one. You would think that a movie completely devoid of plot, character development, a coherent story, and good dialogue would at least offer up some creative visuals. But no, the movie struck out again here. When the Rider walked around, it was almost as if he was a claymation creation by Ray Harryhausen. It was jerky and poorly done, and I can't help but wonder why these effects were even approved. It's not like I care about bad CGI, but if you're banking the entire success of your franchise on stupid people watching it for the visuals, you'd better have some good fucking visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd, as is with any anus of cinema, plot holes simply ABOUND in this thing. For starters, there's a scene in which the Rider is knocked out by a simple RPG blast. Cage has to be rushed to the hospital and everything. Then, twenty minutes later in the movie, he is blown up by a Javelin surface-to-air missile, and he walks away perfectly fine. And of course, he is able to whip his chains around and disintegrate all the expendable bad guys, but when it comes to the main man? Naah, let him live, he couldn't possibly be any trouble later. FUUUCK, THIS MOVIE SUCKS!\r\n\r\nIt's hard to write an honest review of this thing without losing your mind over its decadent badness. Truly, this is a turkey on such an epic scale that it really has to be seen to be believed. The plot points are idiotic, the dialogue is mind-numbing, and the action is truly terrible. Also, the Rider is going up against some guy with the \"Power of decay.\" Whatever he touches starts to rot. GOOD HOLY FUCK. You might as well make a disaster movie about a drought! There are just so many scenes to rant about in this thing, I could go on all day. How about the time when the Devil 'programs' a kid by whispering something through a cell phone that somehow makes him impossible to track? That was fucking smart. Or maybe the fact that it takes a grand total of two minutes to start up the first action sequence? No redeeming value. AT. ALL.\r\n\r\nThe film technique is terrible also. For some reason, the DP chose to have some random cartoons that pop up throughout the film, and they're narrated by Nic Cage. Holy shit, that's just a monumentally bad decision. Also, whenever the decay guy touches someone, the camera focuses in on them, drowns out all the other sound, makes the background black, and turns everything fuzzy. This effect is even more annoying than JJ Abrams's lens flare. Oh, and the soundtrack is bad... but I suppose it's appropriately pulpy, obnoxious, and overdone for this movie.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is truly a rare film. And we can thank the heavens for that. I suppose that, on a primordial level, this atrocious bird shit on the windshield of cinema could be called dumb fun... but never anything more. Nothing went right in the creation of this movie, but then again, maybe everything was supposed to go wrong. Because it sure looks as if audiences have gobbled up another heaping helping of CGI crap, horrible dialogue, bad acting, and anus-of-cinema-level plot holes. Bottom line: Never watch this. At least things like Battlefield Earth are worth watching to make fun of their badness. Ghost Rider 2 isn't even good for that. I rarely say this, but... I wish I had the two hours I spent on this movie back.",

The characters go allover the place for barely-explained reasons, the camera is constantly shaking and going crazy even at the most supposed calm scenes, and it seems that the editors loved to play around with the saturation and glare meters. Half the time there were all these incoherent colors just everywhere, green, orange, red, blue, coming from all directions and ultimately making no sense. The CG effects are much better than the first one though, and the battle scenes are way cooler, but it's simply not enough to save it in my eyes.

Aside from the senseless of the movie and obvious insanity of Cage's character (and I think this is where Cage also lost his mind in real life). The best part of this film was after Roarke turns Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) into one of his minions, Ray drives away in an ill-gotten ambulance and rifles through the slain driver's lunch. Everything Ray touches withers and rots because this is the power Roarke gave him-- the ambulance driver, a sandwich, an apple but when he grabs a Twinkie from the lunch box, it remains unphased, either because the plastic it's wrapped in is not biodegradable or because of urban legend that Twinkies don't expire....funny!

            "content": "I hated the first Ghost Rider film. I thought it was just wasted potential and a dumb piece of crap all-around. So with me hating the first film and me liking its standalone reboot/sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, you people would call me batshit insane. What did Spirit of Vengeance get right that Ghost Rider didn't? #1: SoV is a solid action film. #2: SoV is a fun Nic Cage film. #3: SoV is an actual Ghost Rider film, and a very entertaining one at that.\n\nGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance involves former daredevil stuntman Johnny Blaze, played by Nicolas Cage, who is in self-imposed exile from the world. Blaze has become a tormented soul, convinced that his powers are a curse. Blaze is then approached by Moreau, a member of the monastic order of Michael, the warrior angel. Moreau seeks a protector for Nadya, played by the gorgeous Violante Placido, and her son Danny Ketch, played by Fergus Riordan, who are being pursued by a figure named Roarke, the biblical Devil himself with a detailed knowledge of the Ghost Rider and his different identities over the centuries.\n\nDirectors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor and writers Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman, and David S. Goyer have certainly cleaned up Mark Steven Johnson's mess. I have no fucking idea why this got worse reviews than the original. For those who haven't seen this and have only seen the first, this film has absolutely nothing to do with the original...and that's probably the best thing about this sequel. Johnny Blaze and the origin of the Ghost Rider are vastly different this time around and in here, it works.\n\nNicolas Cage is a hell of a lot better here than he is in the first film. The demon Zarathos being in the Ghost Rider's body fighting within him for control of the Ghost Rider powers occasionally has Nic Cage go absolutely nuts in a few scenes (mainly because Zarathos is driving Johnny to absolute madness), and hell, I love it. You see, in this film, Nic Cage has an actual excuse as to why he's acting like a mentally insane asylum patient on screen.\n\nIn this film, Ghost Rider has a black Harley, a dirty-looking skull, a black leather jacket, and black leather pants covered in soot. Not to mention, Johnny is guzzling alcohol in this film, this trait of which he had in the comics. Good to see David S. Goyer and Neveldine & Taylor actually did their research on the source material like Goyer did with the first two Blade films, Man of Steel (sue me), and the Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nThe main villain this time is Ray Carrigan a.k.a. Blackout, played by Johnny Whitworth, who you may remember as Bradley Cooper's former brother-in-law from Limitless. Carrigan was a former mercenary who's given powers by the Devil after a series of unfortunate events in order to retrieve Danny, who turns out to be the Devil's son. Blackout can make the world around him turn pitch black and he can decay anything he touches. Whitworth does a great job playing the character, who looks exactly like he does in the comics.\n\nA supposed plot hole in this film is that if Blackout can decay everything he touches, how would he be able to retrieve Danny and give him to Roarke without killing Danny? Well, let's look at this logically. If the Devil gave Blackout the powers to combat the Ghost Rider in order to retrieve his son, I'm pretty sure the Devil would make it where Blackout couldn't kill Danny. I'd like to think that the Devil isn't that fucking stupid.\n\nIdris Elba was pretty damn good as Moreau, Violante Placido and Fergus Riordan did solid jobs as Nadya and Danny, and Ciaran Hinds was great as Roarke, but then again, Ciaran Hinds, like Morgan Freeman, is good in anything. Now, I do have some complaints about the film. The ending didn't really feel like an ending. To me, the film just stopped, kinda like Transformers 3, but it wasn't bad.\n\nChristopher Lambert was shamefully given a limited amount of screentime. In fact, he had a swordfight with Idris Elba that was cut out of the film. To Sony: you dare cut a fight between Stacker Pentecost and Connor MacLeod out of a film. Also, as much as I really liked Ciaran Hinds as the Devil, he should be playing Mephisto. In the comics, Johnny wasn't cursed by the Devil. He was cursed by a normal demon named Mephisto. Mephisto isn't Satan. However, in the context of this film, I guess the biblical Devil does have it make more sense.\n\nNow back to the good shit. Danny Ketch made for an interesting character, and from what I've heard, in the comics, Danny was originally Johnny Blaze's brother. However, seeing the present Ghost Rider (Blaze) and the future Ghost Rider (Ketch) was a satisfying treat. Their relationship was well-handled and it actually kinda reminded me of the relationship between John Connor and the T-850 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nThe special effects and action sequences were fantastic. These action sequences destroy, piss on, and burn everything the other Ghost Rider attempted to give us. You can tell in the final action scene, a road chase scene by the way, that there was a real love for Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, with Ghost Rider and Blackout hopping on multiple cars and motorcycles fighting each other. It's awesome. I loved every minute of it.\n\nThe Ghost Rider effects are considerably better this time around. In this film, he actually looks frightening and menacing. He looks like I should be intimidated, whereas in the first film, he looks like a fucking cartoon. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have a directing style that is unique and entertaining. I love both Crank films and I had some fun with Gamer and Pathology, granted, I thought Jonah Hex was a load of ass. The film's dark sense of humor really works, especially with Nicolas Cage.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7.5/10\n\nOverall, there's not much more I can say about this film that I haven't already. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a vast improvement upon its lousy predecessor. The film is well-paced and directed very uniquely with highly entertaining action sequences, top-notch special effects, and a great sense of fun. This is a version of Ghost Rider that is actually worth seeing. If you like Crank or Drive Angry, you'll really enjoy this movie.",

            "content": "Comic book movies are a dime a dozen these days.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as the genre has produced some wonderful gems (Christopher Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" trilogy and the Marvel ensemble \"The Avengers\" are two recent examples of this).  However, there have also been some rather forgettable entries, and 2007's \"Ghost Rider\" falls squarely into this category.  It had some big names (Peter Fonda, Eva Mendes, Sam Elliott, and Nicolas Cage in the title role) and decent special effects, but it was ultimately done in by a weak plot and some terrible villains.  Evidently Hollywood didn't feel the same way, as here we are five years later with \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.\"  And, perhaps not surprisingly, it's even lamer than the original.\n\nI've often defended Nic Cage as an actor, but I'm hard-pressed to defend the movies he's been acting in lately.  I know that he's in some dire financial straits, but even considering that, he's on quite the losing streak.  A good film crops up every now and again--Werner Herzog's \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\" comes to mind--but that seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Even in the turkeys, Cage is usually interesting to watch, but most of the time that's just not enough.\n\nExample: in \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" there's a scene in which Cage's character, former motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze, is desperately trying to keep his alter ego, the fearsome Ghost Rider, in check.  You see, like the Incredible Hulk, the Ghost Rider is buried deep within the protagonist's psyche, and once unleashed, our hero has very little control over his other persona.  The Ghost Rider is a sort of bounty hunter for the damned; he feeds on evil people's souls, so when Johnny is in the presence of evil, he has to constantly fight the urge to transform into the Rider.  Why does he fight it?  Because the Rider doesn't really see things in shades of gray; whether you're a truly evil person or just a casual everyday sinner, chances are pretty good the Rider is going to come for you.  No soul is safe, as it were.\n\nCage has always excelled at portraying inner turmoil.  He's a sweaty, twitching mess in this scene, like a drug addict severely jonesing for a fix, and he uses this to scare an informant into giving up crucial information.  As I stated above, it's a fun scene to watch, but it doesn't add up to anything.  In a good film, like the aforementioned \"Bad Lieutenant,\" Cage's madness serves as a supplement to the story; it's in the service of something bigger, just another cog in the machine.  In lesser films though, it comes off more as a distraction, as if the filmmakers are hoping that Cage's antics will draw attention away from the movie's shortcomings.\n\nOn to the plot.  Since the events of the first movie, Johnny Blaze has gone into hiding in Eastern Europe.  One day he's visited by a French priest named Moreau (Idris Elba), who has a proposition for him: assist him in finding and protecting a special young boy, and Moreau's fellow clergymen will lift the Ghost Rider curse from Johnny's life forever.  I'm not exactly sure how Moreau knew where to find Johnny, but whatever.  The boy, named Danny, is being sought by the Devil (Ciaran Hinds, replacing Peter Fonda from the earlier film) for nefarious purposes, so it's a race against time to see who gets to him first.  Mayhem ensues.\n\nI could say the story is cheesy and derivative, but for a movie entitled \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" that kind of goes with the territory.  The bigger offense is that the movie is really rather tedious and dull.  The Ghost Rider is basically impervious to harm, so there's never any sense that he's in danger, not even when the villain opposing him is the friggin' Devil himself.  We've got machine guns, grenade launchers, car chases, and even flaming construction equipment, yet somehow it all just seems so lame and uninteresting.  Despite Cage's best efforts, I just couldn't get involved in Johnny's plight.  I couldn't in the first film, and I couldn't here either.\n\nIt doesn't help that the movie also seems determined to interject moments of humor to the proceedings...or to be more accurate, I should say \"attempts at humor.\"  You may recall that I previously praised \"The Avengers\" for not taking itself too seriously; in that far superior film, the humorous moments worked.  They felt natural.  Here, though, they seem to come out of nowhere, and again, it feels like the filmmakers are trying to distract us.  The main problem is that these moments are really not funny; they're just weird.  Weird and out-of-place.\n\nOh, and another thing... the CGI this time around is pretty bad.\n\nOverall, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a very weak entry to the comic book genre.  Apart from Cage and Idris Elba--who also gives the movie far more effort than it deserves--there really isn't anything worth seeing here.  There was absolutely no need for a \"Ghost Rider\" sequel, and hopefully Hollywood has realized that now and is not making any plans to produce a third movie...though I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.",

It's not an altogether terrible film. It has a serviceable plot, but of course it stars Nicolas Cage, who's a pretty terrible actor. There isn't much in the way of coolness overall, but there is some unintentionally funny moments sprinkled in there to warrant a watch or two. The style is what I expected, and the movie overall wasn't much, but I expected a less than mediocre movie with some style, and that's pretty much what it is.",

Ghost Rider hijacking the giant digger machine was freakin' awesome. There really are some creative things done visually. On the other hand, the camera movement is ugly, obnoxious, and constant, making it hard to tell what's going on during the action. His new bike sucks (what happened to the old one?). Some of the effects aren't great either. As for the rest of the film...the characters have absolutely no personality or development, the plot is thinner than paper, the acting is hokey, and there are WAY too many continuity errors with the first film. (What happend to Roxanne? Why did they change the devil's name for no reason? Why make a plot point out of Johnny scarring himself on glass signing the devil's contract when that clearly didn't happen in the first film? Why is the Ghost Rider now a spirit that possesses Johnny instead of a transformation? What happened to his stunt career?) It sort of entertained me in parts, but I was disappointed overall.",

            "content": "(1/10)\r\n\r\nHoly Shit, where do I even begin with this film? I'll get this out of the way first: This films is a total mess from beginning to end and nothing in it makes any sense. What I mean by this, is that the film is so scattershot, lazy and chaotic that it's mainly just a series of scenes held together with no cohesion. It has some of the worst editing I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe plot is that Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider doesn't want to be Ghost Rider anymore. He wants to get rid of his \"curse\" for reasons that aren't fully explained. He basically goes on this quest to find a random child so he can be a human again. Once again, this is pointless because it's never explained why he needs to take this child to a random monk temple to do this. Couldn't he have just went there anyway? I don't know and the filmmakers don't know either. It turns out that the Devil also wants this child and it's up to Nicolas Cage to stop him from getting the child. The thing is, to do that, he needs to regain his powers again. This raises the question: WHY THE FUCK DID HE GET RID OF THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE???\r\n\r\nAnyway, now to rip this movie to pieces. The main villain besides the Devil is some generic dude who the Devil granted powers to. He is the blandest villain you could possibly imagine with the blandest powers you could possibly imagine. I guess his power is to make things slowly decay? HOW EXCITING. His main job is to track down this child and bring him to the Devil because the Devil needs him for some stupid reason. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE. HE'S THE MOTHERFUCKING DEVIL!! Couldn't he have just went and got the child himself instead of relying on compost man?\r\n\r\nThis movie was written and directed by 6 year olds with the attention span of a squirrel on bath salts. There's a chaotic action scene that happens for no reason at a construction site and it's so over the top that it's downright embarrassing. There's a part in the movie, I shit you not, where a character asks Ghost Rider how he goes to the bathroom, and then it cuts to a black screen with Ghost Rider just pissing fire everywhere, then cuts back to the movie. This is not funny or clever, it's just downright stupid. With all the random shit that happens in the film, almost none of it is fun, just confusing and boring.\r\n\r\nHow can we talk about a Nicolas Cage movie without talking about Nicolas Cage? We can't, that's how. The thing is, he's mostly just over-the-top when he's Ghost Rider and not Johnny Blaze, so it's not even fun watching Nicolas Cage going batshit crazy in this role because a flaming CGI skeleton is doing it for him. There is one moment though where he channels his inner Cage and flips out. It is glorious.\r\n\r\nThere is only one positive to this movie (hence the 1/10), and that is Idris Elba. Why this great actor is in this piece of shit I will never know, but he is always awesome on-screen. It's too bad he's only in a few scenes.\r\nI would only watch Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance if you're going to tear it apart MST3K style with a group of friends. This is one of the most dumb, poorly scripted, poorly directed and messy films I have ever seen.",

I felt like I have seen this type of story before.\n\nNicolas Cage, I thought had a better grasp of the character here than in the original film. Idris Elba steals the film. I was expecting more from Ciaran Hinds. Peter Fonda, who played the Devil in the original film, did a much better job in the role than Hinds. It was awesome seeing Christopher Lambert in the film.

CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see. The remaining effects are uneven at best, and take a dive during the ugly transformation sequences. With a pointless excuse for a plot is hard to ignore, GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers little more than the occasional eye-candy.",

            "content": "Man, Neveldine/Taylor are so bent on cooling up this franchise that they were so far as to make Ghost Rider's skull black, so you know this is gonna get hardcore, or at least until you actually see the film and end up finding that the black-skulled man just can't catch a break. Shoot, if anyone can't catch a break, then it's, well, Nicolas Cage (Come on, Nick), as well as Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor when it comes to superhero films about vengeance seekers with burnt faces and godless powers. Granted, I liked \"Jonah Hex\" just fine, but this film is making me think back to when I said that Neveldine/Taylor should probably stick to directing, and conclude that they should, in fact, just do their own writing and directing, because they don't appear to be entirely certain of what to do when working with someone else's \"script\", or whatever document it is that they usually use to simulate something of a plot structure. Now that I think about it, if this film reminded me of nothing else, then it was of the slow spells in \"Gamer\", as this film, surprisingly, isn't too much livlier than Neveldine/Taylor's last film. You would think that a film that features Nicolas Cage as a stunt motorcyclist with powers bestowed upon him by Satan, and is directed by borderline masters of neo-exploitation wouldn't be slow, and yet, lo and behold, I present to you a film that is a bit lacking in the fun within campiness that save the original \"Ghost Rider\" for a plummet into contempt. No, this film isn't really that dull... on occasions, but make no mistake, when things aren't sloppy, they're way too steady for their own good. Still, while this film messily disappoints as a \"thriller\", this film goes saved from a plummet into contempt by many a chain of fizzle's going broken up by a couple of undeniable flares, particularly those of a technical nature.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the visual effects of 2007's \"Ghost Rider\" were well-concieved, but when it came down to the bringing of those conceptually promising effects to life, while there were some strong final renderings, most effects fell flat in execution, whereas the visual effects of this film deliver consistently, not just in concept, but in executions that dazzle in their lack of seams and richness in dynamic slickness, thus making this film remarkable as, if nothing else, an effects piece, or at least a technical piece, as Brian Berdan's editing also gets to be pretty upstanding, particularly when really played up as a supplement to a certain other area in which this film genuinely accels, or at least up to a point. Neveldine/Taylor's style is distinctly great and all, but has had a history of going a bit too far in just about every Neveldine/Taylor effort, with this film being anything but an exception, as there come occasions in which technical and storytelling stylistic choices go quite a ways over the top in their near-surrealistic flashiness and freneticism, to the point of sparking cheesiness. Still, on the whole, the stylistic choices all but fall over the entirety of this film, hit hard in their dynamic livliness, brought to life by Neveldine/Taylor's fabulously clever camerawork, which proves dizzingly dazzling in its immersive slickness, complimented by Brandon Trost's strikingly detailed and, at times, lovely cinematographic touches, and adds a lot of color that adds to this film's survival from contempt, especially when action hits the scene. I've praised this film's technicality quite a bit, even though said technicality is behind a mess of a final product, so I'd imagine it hardly comes as a surprise that the moments in which technical and stylistic value come together in the heat of battle are where this film truly shines, delivering upstanding action staging that, when backed up by Neveldine/Taylor's, well, brilliant taste in style and technicality, deliver thorough thrills that this film probably doesn't deserve. If nothing else, this film improves upon its predecessor's technicality considerably, though it's not like glimpses of what this film could have been rest only in particularly stylish moments, because with all of their missteps and being held back by a faulty script, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor will find moments in which they truly deliver on what should have always been delivered in a \"Ghost Rider\" film, whether it be the effective capturing the Ghost Rider's presence as a brutal being of power and terror, or simply engaging fun. Moments such as the ones in question are rare, but they are here, and reward the patient with a taste of the visceral thrills that I expected from a Neveldine/Taylor interpretation of the actually somewhat promising \"Ghost Rider\" mythology. Still, on the whole, while this film doesn't exactly try patience, it's anything but rewarding, meeting occasions of what could have - nay - should have been with many a misguided misstep that nearly destroys this film and certainly leaves you to meditate upon how this film's story is a mess even in concept.\r\n\r\nI have actually heard this film's story described, by one of my favorite critics, as so beyond generic that it doesn't even deserve to be called generic, and really, I wouldn't consider this film's story concept so trite that it's glaringly unnerving, though make no bones about it, this David S. Goyer plot idea, however thin it may be, is consistently conventional, collapsing into trope after trope, and, along the way, establishing predictability that dilutes intrigue, not in the least bit helped by a script that truly marks this film's downfall. There are actually quite a few talented filmmakers behind this project who could have crafted a decent film, yet what you ultimately end up with is a testament to how much a promising project can be undercut by a shoddy script, as Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer essentially ruin this film by turning in a messy screenplay that can't even get humor right, underusing comic relief to the point of creating awkwardly jarring tonal unevenness whenever humor is, in fact, incorporated, and making things all the worse by making the actual humor hardly worth the wait, delivering many a familiar, bland and altogether fall-flat joke. These fall-flat jokes are few in number, but only because the number of actual attempts at jokes are slim, meaning that every piece of humor in this film proves to be a particular height in the dialogue and set piece faultiness, which goes brought more to attention by certain performances, because even though inadequate acting is, regardless of what some say, somewhat rare in this film, with Idris Elba stealing the show with near-glowing charm as a noble yet expertly combative man of God and France (I don't know what's more far-fetched, a priest with exploitation-level firearm combat competence [It must be Neveldine/Taylor's tribute to their buddy from \"Gamer\", Gerard Butler, the other machine-gun preacher], or a black Frenchman; it took me long enough to get used to black Englishmen), when performances fault, they're missteps are glaring, particularly those of a person who I, at least, would expect better from. People poke their share of fun at Nicolas Cage for his recent tastes in roles and often playing the same kind of smooth, when not over-the-top dude, but really, there's no denying that Cage has, at least in the past, proven himself to be a strong actor time and again, and is even now continuing to charm in quite a few films, including this film's predecessor, which he helps greatly in saving with his charisma, but with this film, while he gets a reasonable grip on things at quite a few times, Cage really messes up, turning in moments of embarassing overacting and moments of all-out woodenness as particularly extremes in line deliveries that are all too often awkwardly distant, thus making for a weak lead performance and Nicolas Cage performance whose being a slip-up ever so unfortunately cannot be ignored. Cage has his moments, and in those moments, at least I was reminded of what made Johnny Blaze a saving grace in Mark Seven Johnson's original \"Ghost Rider\", Cage makes Blaze a fall-flat lead, or at least doesn't help in making Blaze a fall-flat lead, as Blaze, like most everyone else in this film, suffers from a lack of flesh-out, an offshoot from this film's script's definitive flaw: uneven story structuring that drive inconsistency into plotting's flow, when not at least keeping consistent with heavy-handedness that spawns anything from a lame cop-out of an a non-ending, to distance from this slam-banged story. This film's script is a total mess that plays the ultimate key part in this film's fall from decency, but really, this screenplay isn't so faulty that it can't be compensated for by a lively directorial performance, or rather, dual directorial performance, something that, in this film, sparks glimpses at what could have been at times, though ultimately doesn't help, as directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, whether it be because they find their hands tied by pressuring fellow filmmakers or because they're not without their own mistakes, fail to keep this film pumping as a whole, and make things all the worse with uneven storytelling pacing that doesn't get to be as consistently slow as I jokingly said in this review's opener, but all too often slips into dullness to break up freneticism that adds to the final product's being either exhausting or considerably bland. This film isn't entirely bad, having its share of undeniable strengths, or at least so much blandness that I found it difficult to actually find all-out disdain, yet the final product is as much a let-down as it is a misfire, backed by a misguided script, worsened by underwhelming performances, onscreen and off, that make this film nothing short of a mediocre mishandling of a promising project.\r\n\r\nOverall, visual effects and certain other technical aspects are exceptional, as is this film's dazzling style, which goes complimented by Brandon Trost's fine cinematography and helps greatly in crafting thrilling action sequences that, like occasions in which directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor deliver on certain effective storytelling moments, provide glimpses of what this film could have been, but isn't, thanks to a generic story that goes executed by a script so riddled with cheesiness - made worse by certain fall-flat performances, including that of leading man Nicolas Cage - and structural messiness - not helped by uneven areas in Neveldine/Taylor's pacing - that is spawns the consistent distance that makes \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" a mediocre misfire that isn't exactly disastrous, full falls flat as a mishap-heavy disappointment.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Mediocre",

Lots of high contrast, fast cutting, shaky cam visuals and a retconned iteration of the rider certainly makes this version visually and aesthetically different to its predecessor.  But, although I'm certain I'm in the minority here, I do prefer the more straight ahead comic book approach of the first.",
