    "summary": "In a world where connections via Facebook, Twitter and other social media networks are the norm, high-school student Lola (Miley Cyrus) is trying to navigate her way through the usual teen pressures of romance, friendship and overprotective parents (Demi Moore, Thomas Jane). Broken-hearted by a break-up with her boyfriend, Lola's world turns upside-down when she realizes that her best friend, Kyle (Douglas Booth), could actually be the love of her life.",

Miley is... barely passable and I'm glad she's thriving in music now. The dialogue is very cringy especially if you were a teen at the time this was made.",

The filmmakers showed excellent understanding of rich color in a dark contrast style providing a delightful 90 minute visual treat to viewers. I found it very easy to empathize with the struggles of the teen characters and the middle aged Mom. Miley Cyrus is a natural on camera and, paired with Demi Moore, delivers a believable and honest performance. It's rare that I experience a film to be both dark and \"feel-good\", however this stark contrast and rollercoaster of emotions is what makes this drama worthwhile.",

            "content": "Wow this movie was actually horrible. I watch a lot of 'so bad they're good movies' and I thought that this would be one of those, but no. This movie was legitimately terrible. Firstly, the main character's relationship with her mom is just straight up weird. Literally in the first few minutes of the film she just strips naked in front of her mother. No teenager in their right mind would do that, its just insane. The rest of the movie ranged from cringey, like all of the texting scenes, to straight up confusing. When the main character goes on her trip to France towards the end of the film for some reason her host family consists of a crazy mother and a child who I assume is supposed to be some kind of reincarnation of Joan of Arc. This family also eats brains for no reason, saying that it is the child's favorite food but the child doesn't even eat the brains. My best guess is that this might be a reference to the French version of this film that was released a few years earlier which I haven't seen. However, I think that since this movie is not a sequel or prequal I shouldn't have to watch the other movie in order to understand the absurdity of this movie. As far as the acting goes it was mediocre at best. Miley Cyrus' acting is the same quality as it was on Disney channel, and the supporting actors could easily be seen on a cringey kids tv show right next to her. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, if you're that interested in watching it you might as well just read a 1-Direction fanfic on Wattpad (and yes I know that I didn't even bring up the fact that the romance side of this movie reads like one of those fanfics, but the movie was so bad that it reading like one of those fanfics wasn't even my biggest qualm with it).",

My favorite part of the movie is the dynamic between Demi Moore and Miley Cyrus. They undress in front of each other, take baths together, snuggle in bed together, everything. It's awkward, uncomfortable, and wrong. I think Demi Moore has to, by contract, take a bath every movie she's in it, and this one is no exception. It's an almost terrifying example of just how mean-spirited and self-centered high school kids can be. I'm sure the creative team behind this movie didn't mean to make it \"terrifying\", but that's really how it comes off as. One of he most shallow, terrible films I've ever seen, but it's really entertaining in that sense, so check it out on Netflix if you like so-bad-it's-good films.",

The movie itself had some potential as it takes a look at the life of today¿s teenager with quite a bit of realism¿as much realism as can be expected once it's passed through the filters of Hollywood cameras. I like that the movie took the time to add some dialogue via texting. This is a staple method of communication in the modern world, so it added to the realism. I like the way the chose to film those sequences. This is a challenge that filmmakers are going to have to play around with in upcoming movies if they want to incorporate this real-life method of conversation in their movies--how do you making typing entertaining to watch? On top of the bad acting, Cyrus's character was not very pleasant, verging on loathsome at times, as a smack-talking, disrespectful teen. Am I supposed to want things to go her way or not? It's also hard to transition Cyrus who has been typecast as Nickelodeon¿s Hannah Montana in both the series and \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" (2009) into a character that is openly involved in drugs and sex. Demi Moore did do well as the disgruntled divorcee trying to deal with the reckless teen. The soundtrack was filled with indie rock tunes from bands like Freelance Whales and Keane. Again, what saved this movie from disaster is the fact that, although with a Hollywood twist, these are the everyday problems faced by teens are their families today. I'd like to watch the French film \"LOL (Laughing Out Loud)\" (2008) the movie from which this one was remade.",

Her mother is struggling with an on again off again relationship with Lola's father.  She also has another pursuer.  Meanwhile, Lola is struggling with a complex relationship with her best friend. \n\n\"Those are for bad girls, with bad grades, and no future.\"\n\nLisa Azuelos, director of Hey Good Looking, delivers Lol.  The storyline for this picture is fairly entertaining and reminded me of a cross of 13 Going on 30 and Mean Girls.  The characters are very interesting and Miley Cyrus does a better than expected job as the main character.  The cast delivers solid performances and also includes Demi Moore, Douglas Booth, Bridget Brown, and Woody Carter.\n\n\"Stop it!  Shove it up your ass.\"\n\nMy best friend really wanted to see this picture so I watched it with her.  I actually found it a bit more entertaining than I anticipated.  The characters were pretty good and the overall evolution of the story comes together well and takes fascinating twists and turns.  I recommend giving this film a shot.  Cyrus is better than you may anticipate.\n\n\"Don't worry about Jeremy.  He totally hates drugs.\"\n\nGrade: C+/B- (6.5)",

There's some typical teenage drama and mediocre comedic attempts throughout the 1.5 hours but, overall, the film was a total miss, for me.\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure what I was expecting when I decided to watch a movie called 'LOL'.  I can't say that I expected it to be great and it definitely wasn't.  It tries to add unique qualities to a dull (and obnoxious at times), teenage love triangle, story by incorporating a \"social networking\" element to the character's interactions but is more awkward than charming.  Even for a \"high school romantic comedy\" the characters are really flat and, in the end, I wasn't much of a fan of any of them, or their incredibly superficial relationships with each other.\n\nIt's not even a stab at Miley Cyrus or Demi Moore, who play the mother/daughter main characters in the film, because I feel like they could both, probably, do better.  I've definitely seen Demi Moore do better.  'LOL' isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's just not that good either.",
