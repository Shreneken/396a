Ranbir Kapoor pays homage to Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Benigni, and others as her deaf and speech impaired rescuer. Filmmakers and screenwriters should be studying Indian film.

Makes me wanna watch Raj Kapoor and Charlie Chaplin stuff soon. Priyanka as Jhimil is so brilliantly depicted - right down to daily mannerisms - that I wondered if the actress herself was autistic! The cinematography and music were awesomely coordinated, and the colors rich and lush.. it's such a beautiful ode to Darjeeling! And the film is a glorious celebration of life!",

I'm just out of my adjectives!!! Ranbir was absolutely brilliant too. Until Priyanka came to the scene, he was blowing it up. And then Priyanka made it Grand! And together, they created one of the Best movies on the earth. Ileana is beautiful and she performed nice too. As Priyanka and Ranbir will take away all the credits, she will not be mentioned that much. But she was also mesmerizing. Anurag Basu, the director, showd some guts to draw his dream picture and let it not go away to be a lush bollywoody flick. Kudos to him. More to mention, I was also amazed how beautifully Ranbir imitated Charlie Chaplin's trademark shots! In total, Barfi! is outrageously beautiful! A full 5.00 out of 5.00 for this piece of art!!",

The actors do a terrific job and carry this story without it drifting into a plain tearjerker or empty comedy. I am new to Bollywood cinema but I was familiar with Priyanka Chopra (Miss India and World 2000). Her performance really caught me by surprise.

            "content": "\"Barfi!,\" from directing to cinematography to editing, is well put together, especially for an Indian movie. I really enjoy how the film tends to focus on the positive as opposed to all the melodrama. Yes, it does get melodramatic, but not for too long. We get some beautiful shots of the scenery, but what would a technically sound film be without a script? This film has top notch writing with interesting characters and a sweet story that will melt the coldest of hearts. The story is pretty simple, but it is done in a unique way. There is minimal dialogue and most of it is conveyed through action, sort of like classic movies of the past. It's cute and adds to the overall charm of the film. However, the story is over complicated by some contrived plot points. One in particular happens towards the end of the film, but for the most part it doesn't take away much from the film. Another issue would be with how the story is told, at times it gets confusing because it jumps from brief moments of three different time periods. Even with some of these issues the film manages to come through with a sweet, touching, and charming story.\n\nActing is top tier for the most part. Ranbir Kapoor proves yet again that he is the new leading man in Indian cinema. His performance of Barfi is touching yet subtle. He has a sense of charm and charisma that bleeds onto the screen. No matter what the character is doing, you can't help, but love him. Priyanka Chopra gives a career transforming performance. She's usually known as the beauty queen, but here she shows a lot of depth and understanding for her autistic character. I couldn't believe that this is the same person. The rest of the cast is good, but the one to look out for is Ileana D'Cruz, who made her Bollywood debut. Her character is emotionally disturbed and indecisive. She's likable and we can root for her.\n\nThe score and songs for this film are great as well. The score has a upbeat style to it that at the same time feels whimsical. It brings you back to an era of your own youth. The songs are equally as good. They are fun and super catchy. They drive their respective scene along and it helps glide over some of the melodramatic moments.\n\nOverall \"Barfi!\" is a fun and entertaining flick with a lot of heart. The story is well told and fairly original. The cast of characters are colorful and their respective actors do justice to their complex roles. Music is a driving force for this film and aids in each scene.  While the movie can get confusing and the third act feels a bit contrived, the film's charm and sweetness more than makes up for it. I give it 4/5, There's enough entertainment and lovable moments to overlook any missteps.",

Seriously! \n\nBarfi! for sure is sweeping all the awards this time and there's no stopping that. I love the way the movie started with that song \"picture shuru...ho gayi picture shuru\".\n\nRanbir is such an amazing and versatile actor. I, personally, love the way Ranbir says \"BARFI (murphy)\". The scene where Ranbir Kapoor explains to Illeana as to why she rejected him is just top class acting. Oh! His mute acting is just so brilliant, so amazing.\n\nIlleana D'Cruz, yes, you are really cute. But Priyanka, without any glamour, steals the show. Ranbir and Priyanka overpower everything. Priyanka proves yet again how versatile she is.\n\nThe music gives a good feeling within. Yes, the background score was a rip-off or intelligently used or whatever but it was apt.\n\nI don't understand the critics though. They say \"the director's not content with a simple story\", \"he complicates the narration with confusing timelines\", \"there's a needless-who-dunnit subplot\" What is your problem? It's really easy to talk when compared to stepping out there and directing a movie! So I personally think sometimes you guys should shut the...\n\nThe movie has a good mix of acting, comedy, drama, love, background score, songs, little twists and turns and above all excellent direction! Anurag Basu is the real hero. Thank you for such a nice and a different movie. My rating - 10/10\n\nP.S - Yes the duration of the movie is around 180 minutes, yes the movie might seem on the slower side but each scene has its own depth and importance. Its been thought out, planned and directed really well.",

This is an unlikely combination, which Doesn't seems like to work in Indian Cinema but things have been changed and great success of Barfi proves that even if the hero and heroine are not stereotypical a good story can lead to utmost success.  Barfi is not a perfect movie, it was too long and becomes complicated as we travel back and forth between 1976, 1979 and 2012. Besides that life being so easy and cheerful for a mute boy and autism girl is hard to accept, there is a time they live alone for 6 months in big Calcutta city, he can't talk and she doesn't understand but apparently they are happier than ever, how they communicate with world is not explained. Anyways I know it's a movie and i should not go onto that much dept. So, kudos to Anurag Basu for making and attempting a brave subject matter. Ranbir Kapoor is great as always, though his performance is almost the same as in a movie \"Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani\" with Katrina Kaif \"where he tries to get her affection\". This time he was only mute. Priyanka Chopra did a fine job and looked the part. Ileana D'Cruz is a fresh faced beautiful girl. Standing next to too famous young actors and still getting noticed is a huge achievement. In the end, Barfi maybe long but it's fresh, beautiful and heartening.",

So this is about a young man, who is both deaf and mute, on his search for love, only it may not turn out how you think.  While I am still looking for a Bollywood movie that I am head over heels for, this is definitely one of the better ones I have seen.  I watched this in two different parts, as there is an intermission, and I think that helped to improve my opinion of it; ultimately, it is a sweet story, and it's difficult not to be won over by it.  What I did like about it was the lead, as played by Ranbir Kapoor.  He brings a lot of charisma to the table without talking, and they pull off a lot of stunts that are akin to those of the silent era of film, and they really work.  It would have helped in a number of spots if I had any familiarity with sign language; you can get the gist of what is being communicated when they are utilizing it, but it is just like watching a foreign movie without subtitles.  Where Barfi constantly lost me is that it has these wacky, goofy scenes all played for laughs right next to these serious scenes about autism, and they don't really fit together.  It even reaches the point where the silly seeps into the serious, like our main character walking into a door after some stuff just went down, and it did get in the way of my enjoyment of the film.  It is also the type of movie where if you changed the music for any given scene, it would completely change the context of the entire story.  Still, it did finish off on a note that I genuinely loved, and I walked away feeling much more positive than negative.",
