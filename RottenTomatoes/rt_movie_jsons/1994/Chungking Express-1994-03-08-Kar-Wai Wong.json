He's also got his eye on a mysterious woman in a blond wig (Brigitte Lin), oblivious of the fact she's a drug dealer. Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) is distraught with heartbreak over a breakup. But when his ex drops a spare set of his keys at a local cafe, a waitress (Faye Wong) lets herself into his apartment and spruces up his life.",

However, the whole movie cannot be purely dependent on that one feature when it comes to gathering favorable reception. This doesn't mean the other present elements are no good; but rather that they simply don't meet up to the expectations and standards which the cinematography potentially sets for the movie. We're talking mainly about the storyline, which may seemingly appear gripping in the beginning, but goes on to express traits of vapidity as it progresses, combined with unneeded elongation which eventually leads the viewer to unjustifiable malaise. In all, it's a tasteful display, but only with a suitable mood prepared afore.",

The movie is trying to tell the stories of everyday people which is admirable, but it is just not always all that engaging. I feel like the movie starts to drag and even though it looks really nice the whole way through, the story just isn't one I connected with. Overall, it is a film that has many truly impressive technical merits but lacks in the storytelling department for me.",

He hangs around a little food stand desperately trying to get his ex to return his calls on the pay phone. The night before his birthday, he tells himself he will fall in love with the first woman who walks through the door of the bar (the infamous Bottom's Up Club, of The Man with the Golden Gun fame). In walks a drug smuggler in a blonde wig. The second two-thirds is about another cop who is a regular at the same little food stand. He has been dumped by his flight attendant girlfriend, while an employee at the food stand breaks into his apartment everyday to redecorate it in her taste while listening to \"California Dreamin'\" on loop. Both stories are intriguing, but if you're waiting to see how they are connected or how they will interact, you will be disappointed. It should really be seen as two distinct stories ironed together at the seam.

While waiting for some equipment to arrive, they had free weeks and decided to fill it with another project √¢\" a kind of movie that students make, as it was described by the director. The film has been shot in just 3 weeks and became an example of work on the incomplete script. Provided the screenplay was a formality, the things depended a lot on the actors being able to improvise or come up with ideas on how to play their roles. Also, Chungking Express was very dependent on Christopher Doyle's cinematography who had to handle lights and colours in a totally new way to give a fresh glimpse into Hong Kong reality and daylight.\n\nAll the scenes were shot during the day time in the overpopulated parts of Hong Kong. We would see the protagonists during the afternoon just a few times. Doyle was trying to make it in a way of creating an emotional response to daily life in crowded Hong Kong where people collide, fall in love, suffer heartbreaks and dream. The colours of Chungking express and its light have created an unmistakably famous image of Kar-wai's style.\n\nChungking Express was initially supposed to consist of three stories, but director ended up shooting just two of them due to lack of budget and time. It was an experiment of telling different stories with unrelated plots in one film. Yet there are some similarities in these stories: both of them concern young Hong Kong policemen dealing with a breakup and hoping to fall in love happily again. The young men wander around the district of Hong Kong where Chungking cafe or express is, and we observe different emotional moments from their lives. The connection between the stories is an emotional, romantic, atmospheric thing. Chungking express is pretty sketchy, it doesn't focus on the narrative part but employes many methods to emphasize the romantic mood of characters √¢\" the mood for love which is going to be developed and polished by Wong Kar-wai later works. It is a very unusual film for the Hong Kong industry, something completely different from what had been produced there in the last decades. This is one of the main reasons why it was Chunking Express which became a moment of the international breakthrough for Wong Kar-wai and not elaborate Ashes of Time which took such a long time to shoot and edit.",

Let me end by saying that there's this very human quality to the movie that's not seen in American cinema. Like how the two male cops coped with losing their girlfriends.

A major pop star in Asia, the gamine Wong is incredibly luminous and winsome without over playing her character's eccentricities. In those moments when she daydreams, frequently accompanied by The Mamas and The Papas singing \"California Dreamin',\" the feeling is ecstatic.

The movie is broken into 2 parts which make us wonder what ever happened to the first couple and how does their story end? \r\n\r\nWatching this has presented to me a small picture in what I believe some streets of Hong Kong would look like. The director and cinematographer have done a great job in being able to capture the essence of this country and display it in comparison to Hollywood made movies. Handheld shots make it a winner by bringing in the true nature of the environment. \r\nIn addition script was fantastic, taking us into the mind of some characters, listening to their genuine thoughts on life and their daily routine was another intriguing aspect. \r\n\r\nThe only bad thing I can say is how one story ends and another begins. No smooth transition to it, no satisfying solution to the previous tale, it got confusing especially since I thought both female characters might've been the same person. \r\n\r\nOverall it was great, no doubt about it, and a strong recommendation to anyone who lives and breathes film.",

At the end of the day, it's a great little character study of four people who fall in love in two completely different ways.  An interesting approach and a great entry in Hong Kong cinema (admittedly, I'm not an expert in that field), this is one that probably should be seen twice to be really enjoyed; at first glance, one doesn't notice that the two separate stories in the film are actually intertwined.

That said, it was still interesting and it made sure that the total lenght never got too streched. I must definitely check out the follow up, \"Duo luo tian shi\" and hopefully it's somewhere near as good.\n\n8.5 out of 10 pineapple cans.",

The entire movie is really pretty though. I can see why Christopher Doyle is such a big deal now, hahah. There's also great use of the movie soundtrack, which makes you want to check it out afterwards. Actually, I would just say to skip over the Takeshi Kaneshiro part and just watch Tony Leung's and Faye Wong's love story carry out. It's absolutely adorable. It's a good movie, even if the first part confuses you and makes you wonder how earth is this movie going to get any better with all the blurry violent visuals (that didn't make it very \"suspenseful\" as the movie perhaps wanted it to be?).",

            "content": "Vibrant Hong Kong drama dealing with love and urban solitude. Two separate stories about lovelorn policemen are told consecutively in the dense, sweaty city.  Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) is a heartbroken young officer whose girlfriend left him nearly a month ago. Struggling to move on, he looks for the hand of fate in the expiry dates of tinned pineapples. He crosses paths with a mysterious blonde-wigged woman (Brigitte Lin) - who is deeply tied into the criminal underworld - and it begins to look as if 223 is capable of letting the past go. As one story closes we meet another lovelorn cop, 663 (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) who is crushed by the recent break-up with his flight attendant girlfriend. An eccentric free-spirited girl, Faye (Faye Wong) begins working at his regular snack bar and, after hearing of his separation, secretly ingratiates herself in his life in an effort to lift his spirits.\n\nTold in a fast cutting collage of handheld shots and colour, this film has all the sensation of claustrophobic city life, together with the loneliness that can arise from perpetually being in a crowd. It's a fluid, poetic look at love, never narratively satisfying as much as it promises but still leaving a warm contentment - and a degree of ambiguity and depth that requires additional viewing. 'Chunking Express' is expertly paced; the striking cinematography, pop soundtrack and disparate lost lovers meld together into a swirling cohesive experience that defies convention. The ceaseless movement of the city is set nicely against the feeling of waiting and dead time, be it waiting for a decision from fate or a customer in the bar - all the characters are seemingly paralysed in their lives, expecting 'something' to come along. The film is less concerned with the relationships of the couples and is more focused on their isolated lives, capturing a subtle individual tranquility while resonating with the intensity of the urban setting.\n\nIt's probably most memorable for the performance of Faye Wong as the oddball, cropped-haired Faye whose youthful energy and peculiarities light up the screen. Her obsession with 'California Dreaming' brings a whole new life to the song and speaks volumes about escape and the world's obsession with America. Played with an overall naturalism the film still has plenty of farcical comedic elements and a western pop soundtrack that sit nicely alongside the more sentimental drama, keeping the overtone fairly breezy while skilfully weaving in thoughtfulness along the way. 'Chunking Express' is a delicately evocative experience that brims with longing and solitude, while remaining thoroughly vibrant and accessible. A wonderful piece of filmmaking that will become increasingly relevant as our cities grow wider and higher.",

            "content": "In the same year that Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" has unexpectedly revolutionized an entire film culture, a film entitled \"Chungking Express\", directed by one of Tarantino's film heroes, Wong Kar-wai, came forth with a similarly unique visual flair but on a wholly different emotional scale, and the rest, folks, is cinema history. With an imagery that resembles that of paintings created by the most turbulent-minded of artists and with an emotional center that seems so innocent yet so knowing, the film is a stimulating reminder of how nice it is to live and, more importantly, to love. Well, and also maybe some hints of how lovely it really is to eat (the film, after all, is filled with endless shots of food). \n     \nShot mostly within the confines of a cheap but suggestively lucrative lunch shack named \"Midnight Express\", the film chronicles, in achingly beautiful sounds and colors, the story of two lovelorn police officers, Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and how they painfully (and humorously) cope up with their romantic grief via their own personal idiosyncrasies. The first, a mid-twenties officer, is so pained by the estrangement of a certain girlfriend named May that he decides to buy a can of pineapple every single night until it piles up to 30. But the catch is that he only buys the ones that have an expiry date of May 1 (his birthday) so that when the said date finally comes and 'May' is still not back in his arms, it's only then that he can arrive at the conclusion that she really doesn't want him anymore, and that those fast-expiring pineapples need some desperate eating. \n\nThe second one, an officer literally living beside the airport, is silently devastated when her stewardess of a girlfriend has suddenly left him alone, needy and slightly schizophrenic, as he begins to talk to his stuff toys, console his towels and scold his soaps, among others. \n     \nBut with utter disconnect, naturally, also comes a chance to connect anew. First, there's the mysterious, blond-wigged woman (Brigitte Lin), possibly a high-class low-life who has caught 223's love-hungry eyes. And then there's the infinitely quirkier Faye (Faye Wong), a short-haired young woman who's got this idiosyncratic affinity with the song \"California Dreamin'\". By emotionally patching these characters together to cope up with an increasingly apathetic Metropolitan existence with all their personal frustrations, vulnerabilities and imperfections intact, Wong Kar-wai has cleverly toned down \"Chungking Express'\" potentially overbearing angle on love to the point that the film itself is not anymore a dual tale of love but simply, in itself, a mere cinematic slice of life. \n     \nWell, granted, a more stylized version of life, that is, but still, with Wong Kar-wai's wisely organic yet weirdly fascinating approach on characterization and his purely artistic sensibility of merging his sometimes frantic but often times observant imagery with stirring music to create an audiovisual kaleidoscope, \"Chungking Express\" has attained a cinematic form that is wholly its own. Is the film a romantic fare? Sure, but it has something more to say than that. Is the film, then, an existential feature? Perhaps, but the film evokes so much joy and na√Øve wonder that problems of existence just cannot seem to feign its enthusiasm and vigor for life (and love) at all. \n     \nWith those certain indecisions about the film's real categorization, I think it's more than safe to assume that \"Chungking Express\", in the process, has created a new, specific type of cinematic language, specifically on how it has meandered and reflected on the qualms of love and life yet preserves its pristine affinity to just breathe, hope and desire. If \"Chungking Express'\" main intent is to shake me out of my apathy and convince me into wandering the streets of wherever to search for a person who may or may not repay the love that I may offer, then the film has failed. The film, after all, is never an operational 'how to' guide on finding a lost soul to connect to. Instead, it is, more significantly, a film that shows the leaps and bounds of how a certain love is lost and once again found; of a life merely wasted and a life well-lived. \"Chungking Express\" is just a reminder of how beautiful and reassuring it is to know that in every stream of people you may come across, there's always that one person who may just return your smile with an even bigger, more luminescent one. And better yet, there may also be that someone who may just go their way to draw you a crude boarding pass that may bring you somewhere worthwhile. \n     \n\"Chungking Express\", with its one-of-a-kind cinematic approach, is more concerned, in the context of love and existence, on how to say things rather than what to say, how to feel than what to feel, and how to properly enunciate emotions rather than how to choose the right words for it. And for that, I fully commend it. Only few films can make you feel so alive, and only few films, simply put, can make you feel very fortunate of having seen them. This counts as one, and I hope that its ability to make people feel may last more than 223's pineapples.",

            "content": "Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express is a composite of two love stories set in 1990's Hong Kong. The first story is a noir-style romance involving police detective He Qiwu and a mysterious woman in a blonde wig. This is the stronger of the two narratives, mixing the bloody consequences of the drug trade with the whimsical romanticism of pineapples and expiration dates.\n\nQiwu is a very relatable character if highly eccentric; exposing the hopeful nature of humanity. After breaking up with his longtime girlfriend May, he spends a month eating pineapples expiring at the end of April. This story of longing is both humorous and insightful into the workings of human emotion. Along the way Qiwu gets indirectly involved with a drug smuggling scheme involving the Woman in the blonde wig. The crime narrative is not as strong and is only somewhat fleshed-out and the mysterious wigged woman is not nearly as well developed as a character as Qiwu.\n\nStill this half of the first story has its moments of greatness; specifically it takes a look into the city of Hong Kong as a character in itself. You don't only see a stereotypical view of the city; rather Chungking Express introduces the viewer to the multicultural layout of this eastern center of trade and commerce. Whites of British descent are present, as are drug mules from India. Even Qiwu himself is noted to have been raised in Taiwan. At least four languages are present in the short segment as well as a plethora of eclectic and multi-national musical additions.\n\nThe second story drops the noir undertones for a more lighthearted feel; but is also about lost love. Beat cop number 633 is left by his flight attendant girlfriend and enters a very unconventional romance with a girl working at a Hong Kong fast food restaurant. Faye, the love interest, falls for 633 while he is still hung up on his ex. She falls into the possession of a key to his apartment and uses it to covertly enter his life. This story starts out with a romantic charm but quickly devolves into something more bazaar and off-putting.\n\nBoth stories when looked at separately have a lot to offer the viewer; however when brought together into one film these two disparate halves seem to add up to less than their sum. Furthermore the editing, story, and direction make it very hard to distinguish the course of events. For example; Qiwu and 633 are both cops who go to the same restaurant and both are involved in breakups. Compile those similarities with the fact that 633 never receives a formal name; make both characters meld into one. While watching; I believed them to be the same character. Dream sequences, which sprinkled into the stories, further confuse the narrative but without much seeming visual cue. It's not that I find abstract narratives frustrating, but here it seems like the abstraction works more to alienate rather than invite the viewer into the experience.\n\nOverall the films positive aspects far make up for its loose narrative. The actors' performances are delightful to watch, the script is filled with fun and emotion, and the general direction leads to a very realistic seeming view of Hong Kong. Still if Chungking Express had offered a more involving more cohesive narrative; it would be even better.",

But the story isn't the best  thing about this film, the blood in the veins of the movie is the cinematography and direction. Not to sound pretentious, but this truly is one of those films that you can call poetic; every still of the film can be placed in an art gallery. Its weaving style was like Terrance Mallick on acid, so it has all his beauty but without the unrelenting slow pace. I would most definitely watch this film on a Sunday evening if you want to have a good week and I will also be watching it again pretty soon coz I saw know it will be more rewarding on my second watch. I will be seeking out more Kar Wai Wong films asap.",

There are some quirky and inventive moments (especially the dog refusing canned food moment) which demonstrate Wong Kar Wai's keen eye for everyday moments of genius. But apart from that the film lacked a certain emotional core or warmth one could identify with.

Moving at the irregular pace of life, its intentionally uneven gait is mesmerizing at times, slow and repetitive at others. Though the four alternating leads aren't the most varied bunch in cinema history, (the two men are overly self-absorbed and detached, while the corresponding ladies share a propensity to crazed social disorders) the inward-staring confessional nature of the story itself gives them each a special chance to shine as unique, relatable characters. There's a certain degree of the audience in each of them, and that makes each story tough to turn away from, even on the occasions when the plot has slowed to a walk. Though occasionally a bit over-ambitious in the wide variety of different shooting techniques it employs, the film is beautifully composed if somewhat firmly planted in the early '90s. Unspectacular at a glance, it's also strangely hypnotic and potently personal.",

            "content": "If you look at the cover of Chungking Express, you will catch a glimpse of some of the stylistic choices made by director Wong Kar-Wai. This is a film that intrigues me because of its style rather than the plot itself. Many of the images are blurred deliberately to reflect Hong Kong's fast-paced life. Other segments are shown in slow motion.\n\nThe story is in two parts and shows a glimpse into the lives of two policemen. The first has just broken up with his girlfriend, but he's in denial because it happened on April 1 and she might just be playing a joke on him. He decides to give her one month to reveal that she's joking. As she likes pineapple chunks, he decides to buy one can per day until she comes back to him. The cans must have an expiry date of May 1 as that's when her time expires. When she fails to return, he eats all of the 30 cans in one night. I mention that scene as an example because it demonstrates just how original the script is. The way the characters think and behave is extremely strange and that's part of the reason the film works so well for me.\n\nThere are essentially four characters in the movie. The first cop, after eating the 30 cans of pineapple chunks, decides to talk to the next woman he encounters. She turns out to be a drug dealer with an interesting story of her own.\n\nThe second story is probably the stronger of the two. It concerns a second cop who is about to break up with his girlfriend. She leaves a letter for him at a food bar he regularly frequents. A woman working at the food bar has a crush on him and steals the key to his apartment from the envelope.\n\nThe film contains a lot of humor, as well as drama and romance. It's just interesting to visit this strange world and hang out with the characters once in a while. The color palette and quirky plot reminds me somewhat of Amelie and it's not meant to be taken completely seriously. The story offers some thoughts on how random life can be. We can pass strangers in the street and they could become an important part of our lives in the future. One of the characters loves listening to California Dreamin', so be prepared to hear that throughout the second story.",
