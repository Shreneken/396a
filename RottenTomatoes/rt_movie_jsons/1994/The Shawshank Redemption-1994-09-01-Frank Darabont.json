Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a novella by Stephen King, the film is a powerful meditation on hope, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary. In prison, Andy forms a friendship with fellow inmate Red, played by Morgan Freeman, and sets about using his intelligence and resourcefulness to survive and even thrive in the brutal and oppressive environment of the prison.\n\nOne of the strengths of The Shawshank Redemption is its nuanced portrayal of the characters. Andy and Red are complex and multifaceted individuals, and their friendship is depicted with a depth and authenticity that is rare in Hollywood films. The movie also features a talented supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the sadistic Warden Norton and William Sadler as the troubled and tragic Heywood.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest strength of The Shawshank Redemption is its message of hope and redemption. Even in the darkest and most hopeless of circumstances, the movie suggests, there is always the possibility of redemption and the potential for a better future. Andy's determination to survive and maintain his humanity in the face of incredible adversity is inspiring and uplifting, and the film's ultimate message of hope and renewal is both moving and profound.\n\nVisually, The Shawshank Redemption is also a masterpiece. The film's cinematography and production design are both striking and memorable, and the use of music, particularly the haunting and beautiful score by Thomas Newman, adds to the movie's emotional impact.\n\nOverall, The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and deeply moving film that resonates with audiences on a profound level. Its themes of hope and redemption are universal, and its message of the transformative power of human connection and resilience is one that will continue to inspire and uplift viewers for years to come.",

            "content": "The movies that were called the dark horse of the industry were unexpected and impressive movies that will stick in your mind for a long time. A drama film called Shawshank Redemption is the story of a banker, Andy Dufresne, who was caught up in the murder of his wife and her adultery then. Their story is about the rest of his life in the Shawshank prison, the friendship, and the pain of reality. One of the most interesting parts of this movie is that it is told from a third-person point of view, which gives a new perspective by using an indirect approach. It depicts a lot of inequity in prison life, but the focus point in this movie is hope. The hope that could rarely be found in a place that was called \"hopeless,\" such as prison, is the reason why the movie wants to show freedom in ways that people could never have imagined that people in prison would still have hope. This is not the normal prison film that audiences expect about jailbreak, but this movie leads to a different feeling. It's gained emotion through the situation that the characters have been through, and even more emotion is gained by the impressive ending. The movie always showed you some phases that demonstrated the truth of being human; that will definitely hit you. You will be able to relate a scenario, a character, or a situation in this simple movie to something deeply personal in your own life after experiencing it. This kind of movie is great to keep watching more than once because your thoughts and perspective on it will change as you grow up.\nShawshank Redemption could of course be called an encouraging film, and that is also the aim of the director, but in my understanding, this film is bittersweet and more bitter than sweet. Because the character's pain is shown a lot in this film, the key is how he deals with the situation and how it would be if there were a condition in the situation. But what is beautiful is the strong relationships that exist in this place, and you will feel that while watching it. Along with great performances from actors like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, it was one of the best. But there are also live support acts that are absolutely brilliant and impressive. Although most of the scenes of the film take place in a tense place. \nI would recommend this movie for the two and a half hours that it is worth for people who want to experience a simple but golden movie story like The Shawshank Redemption. You will even more clearly understand why this movie is the highest rated on IMDB. However, I recommended this movie to older teenage audiences because some of the content in the movie is violent, and the context of that content will become clearer to this generation or older. Finally, The Shawshank Redemption offers you a variety of experiences that will definitely give you brilliant pleasure.",

The story is told so that we don't really realise what is happening until it has happened, but when we realise we can only marvel at the quality of scriptwriting. This movie feels like every single word is chosen specifically to build to something, absolutely everything that happens in this movie is relevant to the ending and that is what makes this movie so good. \n\nAlthough this movie isn't as gut-wrenching as The Green Mile, it still has some very emotional scenes. There is truly nowhere that this movie falls down; the cinematography is 10/10, the writing 10/10, and the ending 1000/10. I can truly not oversell how incredible this movie is.\n\nBravo Darabont, truly the master of prison movies!",

            "content": "The Shawshank Redemption follows a group of prison inmates as they serve out their sentences.\n\nThis film is nothing short of phenomenal and I can see why it is considered among many as the greatest film ever created. My favourite two kinds of films consist of crowd pleasers and deep dive dramas that focus on certain lifestyles. This film fills both those slots. We get to see how exactly prison affects people and everything that is involved with being a prisoner. We also get some great moments towards the end that put a smile on your face every time you watch it.\n\nAcross the board incredible acting, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give probably their greatest performance, along side the rest of this perfect cast.\n\nTim Robbins character Andy Dufresne gives us the angle of an innocent man entering prison, but not just an innocent man an intelligent innocent and I'll get to why his intelligence is so important later. We get to see Andy go through different stages of prison as we see what happens to people that are alone in prison, how they get targeted out by rapists and how they are treated with zero respect. Then we get to see what happens when you have something to offer the guards and the warden, in Andy's case it's is knowledge of banking. We see Andy begin by helping guards set up savings accounts and help them with their taxes all of which help him get in good with guards. But eventually we get to see how certain guards or in this case the warden may be worse then the people imprisoned. Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton recruits Andy to help him launder money, but once Andy has a chance at getting out the Warden makes sure he can't leave by killing the person that could lead Andy to freedom. This again gives us a great angle into what goes on in these prisons and how guards and wardens take advantage of their authority since they know inmates can do nothing to stop them. \n\nWe don't find out until the end of the film but throughout his time in prison Andy has been digging a hole to escape, which really adds another layer onto why he does the things he does. Andy has been attempting to make the lives of these inmates better so when he eventually escapes he doesn't feel guilty for leaving his friends in a unsafe environment. We see him build up a large library as well as teach certain inmates so they can receive their high school diploma. Then at the end Andy is responsible for the arrest and ‘almost arrest' of the warden and captain hadley.\n\nAnother side of prison we get to see are the prisoners who have essentially spent their lives in prison. Red played by Morgan Freeman has become somewhat of a tycoon in prison, as he is one of the people that smuggle into the prison. By the time Red is released he had spent 40 years in prison and isn't accustomed to life outside, so when he is released and begins working he realizes that he is not meant to be outside of prison. \n\nAnother character in this film had the same revelation. Brooks Hatlen played by James Whitmore was released from prison earlier in the film but when he had that revelation he committed suicide. Red on the other hand was lucky enough to have a friend like Andy. Before Andy escaped we get to see him give instructions to Red on where to find a rock, and under that rock is where Andy had hidden something. Under that rock was a letter to Red explaining where Andy was and that he would love to have his help with a new project of his. That is when we get to see the two reunite in a very satisfying conclusion.\n\n10/10",

The prisoners, hard core as they may be, are like mythical creatures: Morgan Freeman as the kindly convict, James Whitmore as the tragic librarian, and Tim Robbins as the soft spoken but conniving Andy. None of them are realistic. They're romanticized. But we're captivated by them thanks to a great screenplay and strong performances.\nIt's a man's movie. This was obvious the first time I watched it. I thought women might have a hard time relating to it. But after my recent viewing, I realized that a great story transcends gender issues and has universal appeal.\nWilliam Sadler, in an early role, gives a strong supporting performance.\nRoger Deakins is, without doubt one of the finest cinematographers in the history of film. His camera work in this movie alone could be an entire class in film school.\nThere are so many improbable scenes, like the beer drinking scene on the roof and the scene in which Andy broadcasts an opera record over the prison P.A. It's sheer romanticism—and we eat it up.\nClearly, Andy is a Christ-like figure. It's a story that never fails. His \"death\" is his sentence and the beatings he takes in prison. His \"resurrection\" is his prison break. He does good for his brethren, but he has no mercy on the warden. The corrupt and hypocritical warden represents the money changers in the temple, and Andy, in righteous anger,  overturns his table. \nThe denouement of the film ties in nicely with an earlier mention by Andy of Robert Frost. The poem in question is \"Mending Wall.\" Those who have read it will understand.\nLastly, I've never understood why this film, now regarded as a masterpiece,  was a box office failure. What were people thinking in 1994? Or maybe they weren't thinking.",

The Shawshank Redemption has been nominated for a total of 43 awards and has won 21 of them. The movie is an excellent choice for a lot of people that enjoy serious drama movies. It depicts the harsh prison life and the unfairness of the world, creating an extremely real feeling of dread that follows Andy Dufresne. \n It shows us that even though a man can lose everything his story does not end as long as he has hope.

Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

It's first-rate cast enlivens Darabont's tremendously well-written script based upon the acclaimed novel by eminent novelist, Stephen King. I was amazed at how easy it was to sympathize with some of the film's convicts. The characters served as true to life exemplars of the effects of the cruelty of institutionalism. The theme of one's mindset and ability to hope determining their freedom gives the story THAT much more significance and merit. To have any kind of hope in a predicament as hopeless as serving a back-to-back life sentence is exceptional and well worth figuring out what the hell the two hours and twenty-two minute runtime is all about.\n\nOddly enough, the film does not display itself as bulky as it's runtime suggests. The film takes place over the course of several decades, only focusing BRIEFLY on any period of time. The clever editing and marvelous directing maintained the picture's steady pace. We're able to focus on and be more intrigued with the development of the two leads rather than how long they've been imprisoned. I was interested with how some characters were able to change their actions, while still transitioning between a mindset that is not so healthy to a mindset that would lead them to a better, freer life. It's immensely realistic and I'm certain that other viewers could see some of their selves in the characters made infamous by the phenomenal actors involved.\n\nI'm glad I gave this film a chance. 94%!",

Yet it's just about a convicted banker who befriends Morgan Freeman and gets used to his life as a prisoner in Shawshank men's prison. But there's a lot more to this film than the blue-eyed setting up of modern movie clichés.\n\nFor the crux of The Shawshank Redemption already lies in its ensemble. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as the leading men in their absolute prime as actors. Secondary characters that integrate ideally into the scenarios of the protagonists and all have essential functions as their companions. Villains that seem generic from today's point of view, but for those times were unparalleled in cruelty. All of these ingeniously written roles have a hand in the plot, none of them feeling superfluous at any point. Of course, the film's trump card is the chemistry between Robbin's character Andy and Freeman's Red. After an initial distance, the two grow closer and closer as the film progresses, and within the nearly 30 years over which the plot takes place, they become almost inseparable. A down-to-earth and simple male friendship, where both of them share a terrible fate. How the two manage to carry each other through the cold harshness of prison life is gripping to follow. The individual scenes mainly belong to Robbin's Andy. This one is characterized by Red's over-voice and while this movie tool works in very few cases, it's a bull's eye here. It's not for nothing that Freeman's voice is considered iconic to this day. You have from the start that a man is telling his friend's story. Freeman's screen time suffers a bit as a result, but it doesn't take anything away from what is arguably the best performance of his career. Robbins delivers the much quieter and subtler performance, while Freeman excels in empathetic and even comedic monologues and dialogue at times. The rest of the cast adds to an all-around perfect ensemble performance. Foremost among them is Bob Gunton as the corrupt Warden Norton, under whose hypocritical posturing as a sensible Christian lurks a malicious layer that lends the film some (necessary) devastation.\n\nWhether The Shawshank Redemption is really the best film of all time is debatable. However, one thing can't be denied: From an objective point of view, it is without major weaknesses. If anything, the slightly pathetic and conventional ending actually fits seamlessly with the previous plot. In this respect, this is perhaps a point of criticism, but merely one without much significance. Otherwise, it's a film that still did a lot to me at 22 years old, even 27 years later. The sensations of pain, shock and happiness regularly catch up with you. Despite its epic running length and slow build, the film is always entertaining and engaging, and it's also beautifully directed and photographed. Hard to find any flaws here.",

Seeing this film doesn't make you want to go in jail. In fact, the message is, first before everything, that everywhere in the world there some place for you. Even though Red found it hard when he went out of Shawshank, he was better free and had someplace where he could do his live. Same thing for Dufresne, he didn't belong in prison, but it was a place where he was able to do something of his life just like in Mexico. So, where I want to go with this is that they had comfort in the prison but nothing beats the life, freedom and not knowing how something will end. Brooks couldn't live in the outside world because HE DIDN'T KNOW what to do of his live and how to be free. So, that's the principle reason why I'm in love with this movie. It's because it has a incredibly strong message that will echo in everyone's head for those who watched the film. Apart from this, I found Shawshank redemption deeply well-written. Each line, every twists and every characters were just perfect. And so was the filmmaking. Let's put this into my favorite films, NOW!",

The story follows a man named Andy Duphrane who is accused of murdering his wife and the man she had been cheating with and is sent to the Shawshank prison where he becomes friends with another criminal named red. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, John Sandler, and Clancy Brown, the movie has an excellent cast that knows how to deliver a masterpiece. The story is written in a way that makes the audience care about them and their plight. The highlights of this movie are the costume design and setting within the prison. It captures the feel of the prison incredibly well and makes you feel like you're actually in 1947. The score by Thomas Newman is just as wonderful as always as he delivers an emotionally powerful and heart-wrenching soundtrack. The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful movie that knows where it shines and a brilliant movie that knows exactly how to tug at the heartstrings of the viewer, with phenomenal writing, cinematography and score. This movie knows how to pull off an excellent screenplay. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it before, and even if you have, revisit it, you might even notice something you didn't before.",

Every performance is incredible with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins being the highlight. the set design of the prison is incredible and this movie doesn't hold back from showing how truly awful prison is from the harsh rules of the guards to all the forced labour to the fact that eventually you feel you can't live without the walls of the prison as we see when Brook eventually kills himself (that was really heartbreaking); you really feel immersed in it but it's balanced with a beautiful friendship between Red and Andy's characters and you can really tell they become such good friends. It's also a beautiful story of hope and how holding on to hope and that human spirit will help you survive and that shot in the rain when Andy escapes from the prison is beautiful and we cannot forget that unforgettable reunion betwen Red and Andy. Has some issues though. This movie does have a bit of a bad habit of mainly telling us what's going on in the prison through Martin Freeman's (albeit lovely) narration rather than showing us and also, for people who've been in prison for who-knows-how-long, most of the characters still look the same but regardless, just an amazing movie (A)",

I love that the movie didn't focus much on Andy trying to prove his innocence - he knew he was innocent, and so did we, and we also both knew there was no point in trying to prove it. Once you're in Shawshank, it doesn't matter who is innocent or guilty, and that's part of what makes this film so powerful. The characters are flawed and grow throughout the movie, and the ones we lose along the way are truly heartbreaking. My only complaint with this one is that we see a 20+ year stretch for all of these characters, yet only the main ones seem to age at all, and even those effects are questionable at best. It took me out of the film occasionally every time I noticed it. But keeping in mind that this is over 30 years old at this point, it's a pretty minor gripe. This film is astounding regardless.",

Now I know why that is true. The main character, played beautifully by Tim Robbins, was incredibly smart, patient, and inspiring. I loved seeing him influencing others around him and carried out his missions. The best aspect about him was hope and determination. \n\nThe story was told mostly through Morgan Freeman's character, Red. Because of this, audiences didn't know entirely what the main character did or thought, which made the revelation incredible and amazing. The relationship between these two characters were endearing, as they helped each other out. \n\nThe theme of hope was strong and essential to many characters. The scenes with some of the prisoners coming out after serving decades were heartbreaking and made me doubt about hope for these old men. However, contrast to this was the strong determination from the main character. One glorious scene near the end showed just how rewarding hope could be. Also, the friendship between the characters was another way of keeping the hope and dream alive.\n\nOverall, freedom at last, and a masterpiece. 9.5/10",

Directed by Frank Darabont, in 1994-this masterpiece of a movie, revolved around two inmates-Andy Dufresne (Potrayed by Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) and the close bond the two shared. The film is narrated by Red as he reflects on the various trials and tribulations Andy had to go through, whilst at the prison-named Shawshank. A minor detail but the deep baritone of Morgan Freeman's voice, never fails to seduce the viewer's attention and interest. However, no movie or rather-no good movie, is complete without a good soundtrack; This is where Shawshank Redemption's music composer-Thomas Newman, flexes his musical expertise. The soundtrack in the movie is almost akin to a tender dance between two ballerinas-one portraying hope and the other, portraying the melancholy that Andy feels. Apart from this, Frank Darabont's creative decision of playing Italian opera music at a notable scene in the movie-and conveying, without words; the emotions and mindset of every single prisoner at one go. Before we talk about the story-the cinematography has to be applauded. The minor changes in the lighting that usually go unnoticed-but which subconsciously lend to the very atmosphere of the scene is present in spades. Besides, the gross change in atmosphere during a happy scene or a bleak proverbial fog-covering the sad ones, can be found throughout the movie. The story is one tinged with hope, sadness and sheer desperation. Hope for freedom and a bright future, outside the walls of the prison. Sadness at the sight of the heavily armed guards and inescapable layout of the prison, preventing the dream from becoming reality-and sheer desperation to achieve it. The viewer is entangled in a web of emotions as they sink further and further into the movie until, pausing the movie and going about their daily lives becomes a distant thought, nay, a taboo. It is impossible to describe the movie in detail without delving into spoilers-but one has to experience it, instead of reading the words of another. True praise has to be given to the actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Their acting was so sublime and so well performed that at one point, one had difficulty believing that they were actors and not real inmates. The level of dedication and commitment the actors had put in, was off the charts and some of the behind-the-scenes and facts about the film, further certify it. To end, one would have to say that The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that will put a curse on you-that of not being able to forget it or even stop thinking about it, long after the credits have stopped rolling. This film is not a masterpiece, but a sublime show of magic that will continue to trap audiences, throughout the ages.",

Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".\n\nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.",

From the violence and disrespect given by the guards to the abuses and beating done from one inmate to another, it was all shown here without ever trying to soften the blow. It also shows us how hard and difficult post-prison life still is, to the lengths that prison changes a person that it can destroy us and mark us even after leaving that dreadful place. The way these facts were portrayed was so real that a person can even feel more compassion for Andy and other inmates for the conditions that every single one of them had to pass, and let's not forget that some of these prisoners were criminals and made atrocious crimes. Regarding the compassion for Andy, he is not the only character here that you feel compassion for, Brooks is also a character that you feel very much a connection with, showing to what extent this is a great movie that even secondary characters have a connection with you.\nWhich proves how well thought out the characters were.",

The juxtaposition of the dreary, dull prison setting with the mindset of the protagonist is beautifully engaging. The intrinsic theme of hope balances out with the dreadful and horrific situation the characters are in. The main character finds himself in a pretty condemning life sentence for the murder of his wife and lover which he claims not to have committed yet makes most the most of it. The acting is phenomenal and allows for a deep emotional connection with the characters. The ending is wonderfully circular and referenced throughout the film. From my personal experience, I have never watched an ending that is so fulfilling and left me as the viewer extremely content. Although I was always introduced to this film as being THE long film, it did nit feel that way in the slightest. Although, it is not action packed, there is always an underlying activity that can be sensed through the behaviour of the characters and is rather engaging. In conclusion, I highly recommend this film!",

            "content": "(Spoiler Review)\n\nSo for my birthday, I got a 100 Movies Bucket List poster that consists of a variety of titles that also has a scratch-off sticker to reveal an image related to the movie (for Shawshank Redemption it was the small rock pick). As a challenge for myself, I have decided to watch and write reviews for each of these 100 movies starting from top to bottom. And at the top of the list was Shawshank Redemption.\n\nThis movie was adapted from a Stephen King novel which surprisingly enough, wasn't about something horrific. I knew he wrote other movies that didn't have supernatural elements like the Green Mile, but I didn't know that this movie was any different. All that I knew going into the movie was that the leads were Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and that it was about a man who was innocent but given a life sentence. The only reason I knew that was because of the film synopsis though, so I'd say I went in pretty blind.\n\nI think I would've preferred the film synopsis to say something different than that though because it could've just said that Andy has been given a life sentence in prison but it also would have avoided saying he was innocent. This would have been a good reveal later in the movie when it is finally revealed to us as the viewer. I mean the back of the Stephen King novel says that the book is about \"a fiercely compelling convict named Andy Dufresne, who is seeking his ultimate revenge.\" Either way, just make sure your film synopsis doesn't spoil the actual movie. But don't worry, you'll have plenty to be shocked about.\n\nThis film doesn't shy away from dark plot developments, which helps the movie stay interesting while also providing world-building for life in the Shawshank prison. From the first scene within Shawshank, we see a new inmate named \"Fat-A**\" get beaten to death upon his first night there. And although we don't know if he died right away, just the fact that the guards just left him there to die was just shocking. So within our first 5 minutes within Shawshank, we are introduced to cold-blooded murder.\n\nAnother thing to consider when talking about these dark plot developments is the film's inclusion of the issues of institutionalization. Institutionalization is defined as the act of establishing something as a convention or norm in an organization or culture. If you need an example, take the death of \"Fat-A**\" because most of the inmates upon hearing that he died, were not surprised. They see inmates dying at the hands of Hadley as normal, as they have probably experienced it enough times to not question why. \n\nThis creates disconnects with Brooks and Red when they are introduced back into society outside of Shawshank. When Brooks leaves, he admits that he misses his pet crow Jake and his job as the prison librarian, as it gave him purpose within that society. The only purpose the new society gave Brooks was to bag groceries, and even people belittle him for not doing a good enough job. As he gets lonelier and lonelier, he starts to think about committing a crime to go back to prison, but he ultimately chooses suicide to end his turmoil. \n\nRed's return was a bit different though because he knew Andy left something for Andy outside the walls of Shawshank, and all he had to do was find it. This simple task gave Andy a purpose, a purpose that Brooks simply didn't have. And that purpose gave Red hope, hope for a meaningful rest of his life, hope for finding his old friend, and hope for true freedom. \n\nIn fact, this entire movie's theme is that hope makes you alive, and that it is the one thing that people can't take away from you. This is shown through the constant struggles of the main character Andy trying to make everyone's lives better within the prison, and holding onto the hope that one day he will be proven innocent for the crime he didn't commit. This hope that he carries throughout the movie keeps him from breaking down crying like other new inmates, so instead, he channels his focus onto making the prisoners feel hopeful again. \n\nAmong these acts, Andy helped make a better prison library, played music for all the inmates, and convinced the prison guards to give his friends a cold beer. My favorite act though was Andy helping inmates with their high school equivalency test. This was because we got to see the impact that Andy had on individuals within Shawshank, like how he helped Tommy. Tommy became hopeful for his future, and to see him believe that he could be more than just a criminal, was amazing to see. And we too as the audience felt just as proud as Andy did when Tommy passed.\n\nBut we all know now that Tommy dies right after he passes his high school equivalency test. Now I shouldn't have been too shocked when the warden kills Tommy but I was naive to think that the warden would let Tommy set Andy free. So when I saw it on screen, my jaw dropped to the floor, not because I was shocked by the warden's actions but mostly because I felt so bad for Tommy. This movie doesn't shy away from gruesome death scenes, and they make you feel sadness (like for Brooks and Tommy) but also joy when the warden finally commits suicide later on in the movie. The deaths have such an impact on the story that if this movie didn't have them, I think it would be worse because of it.\n\nBut Tommy's death wasn't the only twist in this movie because we haven't talked about Andy's great escape. So before Andy's getaway, he got 6 feet of rope from a friend, and Andy never specified what he would use it for. The movie kept us from predicting what would happen by misleading us from the true events, and it does it in two ways. The first is that the movie told us that escaping by using the rock pick was impossible, they even made Red laugh at how long it would take to mine a hole through the wall with that kind of pickaxe. So when he escapes by using the pickaxe, we aren't expecting it. The second way was by making all the characters believe that Andy was going to take his own life with the rope, making us expect that he will be hanging himself that night as well.\n\nSo when it is revealed to us that Andy escaped through a hole in the wall, we feel shocked as the warden when we see the long tunnel that Andy dug to get out of Shawshank. After this, Red narrates how Andy succeeded in his plan to get out of Shawshank, and the plan explained a lot about Andy's behavior. His confident walk around the prison yard? He was dumping gravel through his pant legs to be discrete. The posters? To block the main hole from being seen, and the other posters to lead attention away from the one guarding the hole. Andy thought of everything and although it took a whopping 19 years to dig that hole, he made it out. \n\nIf you tell me you weren't smiling while Andy was basking in the glory of freedom while being soaked by the rain, I don't know what to tell you. That moment was absolutely glorious. It was like all the worries and troubles that Shawshank had given Andy were being washed away by the rain. Absolutely beautiful.\n\nNow the character of Andy Dufresne was brought to life by Tim Robbins. He was an actor I was unfamiliar with when I watched this movie, but now I look forward to when I'll see him again. Just by his face alone, I always believed him to be deep in thought but since the narration is from Red, his thoughts are kept secret from us, unless he tells someone else about them. If I didn't know he was innocent because of the film synopsis, I don't think I could've told you that Andy was innocent or not because although he looked like a regular man, he spoke like a very intelligent man who always knew what people thought of him. Heck, even Red was saying how confident he looked for being such a regular man.\n\nSpeaking about Red, Red was played by Morgan Freeman. Don't worry guys, I promise I know who Morgan Freeman is so you don't have to be worried about my lack of film education, but man Morgan Freeman is so dang good at his job. When I listen to him speak one sentence, his tone alone is so engaging that it just demands that you listen. Hearing him narrate the entire movie from Red's perspective was a great directorial decision as without it, I wonder how much of the movie would really work. \n\nBut this movie does work, and it makes me so happy to say that I think that this movie is a masterpiece. It made me feel all sorts of emotions from happiness and sadness, it made me laugh, and it kept me thinking about institutionalization even after I finished the movie. This movie was written and directed by Frank Darabont, so I say thank you sir for making this movie. Although I know many people won't read this, I love to think that in some way I'm doing you amazing people a service by watching and reviewing your movie. Even if it is a small gesture.\n\n10/10 Thanks to everyone who worked on this project, it was amazing.",

The movie shows you how strong routine is and how after being in prison for so long makes it more difficult to live outside than inside.

Personally I believe that Shawshank Redemption succeeds in its purpose but it gave all the answers at the end and I didn't liked that, I wanted to find some of my own.

Andy never loses hope and he really \"gets busy living\", because he knows that as long as his mind is free and as long as he has still hope, he will never really be a \"prisoner\". The success of the screenplay and the dirctor can be found in having perfectly managed to arouse complete empathy in the viewer towards a prisoner like Red, who has never denied his actions and who, thanks to Andy, has understood that the conditional release will never be what will make him free, but the awareness, of no longer being that man capable of killing other human beings, has led him to be truly free. It's quite a pity that Morgan Freeman didn't get an Oscar or a Golden Globe for his performance, however he had to contend with a Tom Hanks who brought one of his most famous performances to theaters: Forrest Gump.\nIn conclusion, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is a masterpiece that everyone should see at least once in their life; despite its duration, it is very discursive and never heavy.\nFinal grade 10/10",

Seemingly insignificant incidents over the course of the film have meaning we can't understand until the climax of an intricately woven plot.  On top of that, the acting is top-notch from start to finish, especially Morgan Freeman in the best role of his career.  The only possible criticism would be the fact that the film, at times, is openly manipulative as the music swells at all the right times to tell the viewer how to feel instead of just letting the audience make up its own mind on how to react emotionally to a given scene.

            "content": "The Shawshank Redemption, directed & written by Frank Darabont, is a definitive top twenty-five movie of all time. With the chemistry Darabont has with Niki Marvin & Stephen King, he decided to take a homerun-swing on Rita Hayworth & Stephen King's book. Niki Marvin may only have two below average movies coming into this movie, but she constructed this beautifully crafted picture, being nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Picture.\n\nI have seen hundreds of movies in my time, and I'd arguably say that Frank Darabont had one of the best senses of direction; everything just flowed perfectly together, creating this fantastic crime/drama. The story was a brilliantly told, fresh & original take on a jail bird story, being flawlessly paced out, keeping everyone engaged at all times! The overall message of hope & optimism, spoke to so many different levels, giving this movie great layers of depth. The only nitpicks I had with the story, some set ups, and scenes were a little cliché, but tremendously easy to overlook.\n\nDeborah Aquila did a great job casting this talented bunch of actors. You can tell all of the characters were invested so much into their roles, to the point where it felt like they were actual prisoners. This was my personal favorite performance by Morgan Freeman. His character is intuitive & so full of knowledge, being a positive figure the prisoners look up to. His character development was the best out of all of the characters, connecting us to his character more & more as the acts go on. Tim Robbins was a diamond in the rough casting. Sure, he's had a few good performances, but nothing before nor after holds up to his performance here. Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins' characters are basically cut out of the same cloth. Robbins put on such a star studded performance, being so optimistic & witty. His character development is so pure, it's nothing short of genius, making it so easy to get behind his character, and root for him. Seeing Bob Gunton in this movie, being more than a plot device like his previous titles, was pretty exciting. He showed off his talent when the lights were the brightest, putting on a great performance. James Whitmore stood out the most, out of the side characters. His character may not have meant the most initially, but his character development becomes a big part in the overall message. The characters as a whole were very enjoyable, although having a few characters with predictable personalities.\n\nThe screenplay by Frank Darabont was outstanding! There was so many pieces of dialogue that spoke to high levels, being super clever, and sliding in a few laughs here and there.\n\nThe score by Thomas Newman (who went on to be one of the most accomplished composers), was an absolute masterpiece on it's own. Newman originalized this style of dramatic & haunting score, adding great tention to each scene.\n\nOverall, this movie did everything almost flawlessly. Another movie to see before you die !",

The directing is very good also. Everything comes together smoothly and makes this movie great and extremely memorable. The dialogue is some of the best on film. There are several quotable lines but more importantly the dialogue drives the plot forward. The use of narrating in this movie is done with great effect. The narration adds a deeper element to the story and to Freeman's character (who does most of the narrating). The emotion and inspirational moments that culminate in this film effectively influence the viewer's feelings in many diverse ways. We feel the character's struggles and triumphs which make this film a rewarding experience. The depth to the characters is very good and allows us to be able to connect with them. The cinematography is done tastefully and enhances the movie. There is really nothing to hate about this movie. It is a very well-crafted piece of cinema and is one of the best films ever. Overall, I give this movie a 10/10.",

            "content": "From Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robins) strong sense of optimism to Redding's (Morgan Freeman) unwavering loyalty, The Shawshank Redemption is a classic that offers it viewers more than what meets the eye. When Dufresne is charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, he was found guilty and convicted for a life time in a prison. Upon his arrival in prison, Redding takes a bet with his co-inmates: Dufresne would not be able to survive his first day in prison. Nonetheless, as the events unfold, what was perceived as a frail man turns out to be the strongest character one can imagine. From the onset, Dufresne was convinced of his innocence. It has to be the sincerity of Dufresne's claim that when met with unflinching hope paved his way towards freedom. The story of Dufresne, though in a subtle way, can be generalized in a sense that it highlights the shortcomings of criminal justice system where presumably an innocent can face severe consequences. It also highlights the inhumane treatment meted out to the prisoners as the proverbial adage \"Hate the crime and not the criminal\" dies a thousand deaths every single day across the prisons. By not portraying what is traditionally expected from a prison movie i.e. violence between inmates, the film certainly seeks to reveal the aforementioned subjects of greater social importance. It also shows that how hard the corrupt may try, he cannot fulfill his responsibilities in a proper way. By showing how Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) used Dufresne's expertise as an accountant to illicitly expand his wealth, the director alluded to Dufresne innocence in a way. By not being able to keep Dufresne incarcerated, Warden Norton's evil came in the way of his duty as the truth of Dufresne subsided the wickedness of Norton. Another important take away is the importance of loyalty as enunciated by the character of Red. Red tried many a time to win parole but was not able to do so. When he got impressed by the kind-heartedness of Dufresne, he befriended him. As selflessness is the fuel of a friendship, Dufresne portrayed exactly that when he negotiated bottles of beer –despite himself being a non-alcoholic– for his fellow inmates in lieu of handling tax matters of one of the captains of the prison.  The friendship that was a byproduct of these gestures was what helped Red get his parole eventually. When he got his parole, he kept his promise and followed the instructions of Dufresne, who already escaped the prison, and ultimately joined him on an island, where both lived as free men. The fact that Red chased Dufresne after getting his freedom shows his loyalty and that he was aware of the fact that Dufresne has inadvertently played a role in his parole. With all this said, The Shawshank Redemption indeed is more than just a classic. It draws the attention of viewers to messages such as the importance of integrity and loyalty while portraying the shabby picture of criminal justice system and the fate of prisoners.",

The relationship between Andy and Red is the heart of the movie, but every character adds something to the whole experience. \n I related with all of the characters on some level (except maybe Boggs--man, I hated that guy!)--even the warden and the evil Captain Hadley.  But it is Andy we relate to the most, and his \"redemption\" at the end has to be one of the best feel-good moments in the history of cinema.  If you've never seen this movie, then you must be living under a rock (or maybe you're locked up someplace like Shawshank).

            "content": "THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION\n\n\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.\" \nThe film is a perfect blend of emotions, thrill, faith, love, friendship ,  perfect screenplay and a genius narration by Morgan Freeman. The movie, which is based on the novel ‘Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' by Stephen King, flows seamlessly in the 2 hours of screen-time. You can't be bored for a second. Surprisingly, Stephen King charged just one dollar for the movie rights.\nThe movie starts with Andy Dufresne, an investment banker, a logical mind (as it seemed in the courtroom scene), getting indicted for the murder of his wife for having an affair with a pro golfer. The movie becomes gripping when Andy is sent to Shawshank prison. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding ( Morgan Freeman) and his other friends. Andy who is a first-time offender finds it difficult to adjust to the insensitive environment of the prison and fight off Bogs, a prisoner who constantly tries to trouble Andy. The prison is run by wicked Warden Norton and Captain Headley. As the movie progresses, the depths of Andy's character are reflected ever-so bright. Andy is a smart banker, who would outplay you in every aspect of the game right when it's needed. He has a taste for good music and believes that music is something that can't be touched by an external force such as the prison authorities. He has a belief, a belief so strong that it can't be mended by the ‘hole' or Captain Headley. \nThe brilliant narration by Red is the most crucial ingredient of the movie. The subtle narration flows smoothly through the varied scenes of the film. The narration's language is backed by the uncanny way of Morgan's story-telling. He doesn't speak words, he sings them with all the calm of the world. Morgan uses words and phrases to express emotions that you think of speaking out loud but can't because you simply can't describe it well enough. Red's narration in the background makes the movie so enjoyable, you could probably listen to its podcast if it ever came out. He gives life to the most epic scenes of the movie, from the \"rooftop scene\" to the climax. He fills it with the warmth of friendship and respect towards Andy. \nThe relationship between Red and Andy Dufresne transcends the boundaries of conventional friendship. Red was more than a friend to Dufresne. From getting things from the outside to making him believe they were all innocent, Red was one guy Andy could always talk to. \nThe story revolves around Andy and his uncanny way of handling troubles. Andy was just a bird who wasn't meant to be caged, his feathers were just too bright.  It was a sin to keep him there. Andy changed the whole perspective of Red and the viewers too. He taught us that there are things that no one can take from you, it is deep inside you. It is called Hope. And as Andy finally succeeds to make Red, along with the viewers, believe that hope is a good thing. The story unfolds with an essence of love and life in it. It is not a conventional prison escape, as you might expect, it is a once in a century movie that teaches you the little things of life, it relaxes you to immeasurable comfort, makes you forget your problems and gives you a memory that you will treasure and share with your loved ones forever. It is a movie that will live on forever.",

And at the same end of the film, it makes you feel good inside, and I felt like crying, honestly. Overall, this isn't just the best film of the 1990s, in my opinion, but also a superb classic in the history of cinema, and it's one, if not my favorite movie. Terrific flick and totally recommended for anyone!!",

            "content": "For such a beloved and widely praised film I am surprised it took me so long to get around to watching it as I have seen far less popular 1990s Best Picture nominees such as The Thin Red Line (1998) and Shine (1996). I must say that it didn't quite grab me the way it must for those who proclaim it to be uplifting and heartfelt but maybe with repeat viewings I will be able to fully understand it's appeal. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film and understand that it was an exceptionally well crafted piece of cinema with some lovely moments in amongst the overly cloying and emotionally manipulative ones.\n\nIn 1947, wealthy banker Andy Dufresne, Tim Robbins, is sentenced to life in prison after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He proves himself to be resilient and patient in prison as he does not draw the ire of the prison guards and easily befriends the resourceful Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, Morgan Freeman, who is able to smuggle items into the prison. Dufresne uses his skill as a banker to ingratiate himself with warden Samuel Norton, Bob Gunton, and gain privileges such as being able to retain a smuggled posters of sex symbols in his bedroom. He builds up a library over time and begins to discuss the prospect of escaping as one of his friends commits suicide when he finally leaves prison and the corruption of those running the prison gets worse. Dufresne and Redding never lose the will to keep living over the years and a seemingly miraculous event uplifts the two of them and provides them with inspiration to live out the dreams that they described to one another in prison.\n\nWhere the film finds itself is in exploring the bond that develops between groups of downtrodden people as they have a camaraderie built on mutual respect and the same fears which they discuss with rambunctious humor. Of course Dufresne's rise is slightly fantastical as it is shocking that a corrupt leader would allow an underling of very apparent intelligence this amount of access to valuable secrets that could easily be used against him. But there is such pleasure to be found in this wishful thinking as a kind group of men who are willing to put in the effort to gain the privileges that enrich their lives so much. Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story onto the screen works nicely as it focuses in on these small interactions and never gets too lost in the espionage occurring in the background or the fights between the guards and the prisoners.\n\nRobbins and Freeman also make fantastic leads as they are both incredibly likable while leaving a certain enigmatic quality alive in their characters. We never do know too much about these characters before their time in prison and because Redding appears to have been so young this makes sense, he really never lived before serving time, while our unease about Dufresne serves to put us in the headspace of the other prisoners. We are left to assume that he did not kill his wife and it was instead another man, a burglar known to a young prisoner whom Dufresne mentors, is responsible but he always remains somewhat at a distance from the other men and the audience. Redding speaks of him reverentially as a man of qualities to aspire to and even in their final meeting it is Dufresne who has shown Redding the way and who stands independent and self-sufficient on the beach. Fortunately this does not make us dislike him but allows us to understand some of the more ‘magical' elements of the film as it is Redding recounting the story and he does not view Dufresne as a normal man but a figure capable of extraordinary acts.\n\nElements of the film that I did not appreciate were the score which laid on the sentimentality thick and an unnecessary subplot in which a former prisoner commits suicide. Thomas Newman can bring enormous emotional depth to film's that lack in obvious visual symbolism and pathos but this is a very obviously sweeping and emotional film so it would have been nice to have a slightly more stripped down, restrained score to leave the audience some room to interpret the meaning of certain scenes for themselves. The suicide subplot felt the most false of all of the emotional strands in the film and I would have liked to see an issue with as much importance and pain attached to it treated with more respected and not milked for an emotional response from the audience.",

In the film it shows all the emotions fear, anger and disappointment. I have to say in this film my favourite character is Brooks played amazingly by \nJames Whitmore with his range of emotions\n from his anger at another prisoner for being \nlet go is so well done and I also think it is so sad that when he is free he still takes his own life as it is not like how he imagined it. Another great thing about this film is the warden played by Bob Gunton who when ever I think about film antagonists I always think about the terrible things this man did and it feels so satisfying when he finally gets his comeuppance at the end. The best thing in this film is the end, when the guards check behind the 1000000 B.C poster and the hole and you see Andy at the other end kneeling in the rain and getting Ellis out of prison and seeing them reunite is so satisfying. In conclusion this is one of the best films of all time from characters, emotions and a satisfying conclusion all lead to an amazing film.",

Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, John Sandler, and Clancy Brown, the film has an impressive cast that gives good performances.  Additionally, screenwriter/director Frank Darabont does an excellent job at developing the characters and relationships; making the audience care about them and their plight.  The set and costume designs too, are especially well-done; capturing the time-period and giving the prison a real, lived-in feel.

            "content": "A life affirming experience.\n\nFrank Darabont's prison drama The Shawshank Redemption (1994) will bring you to tears as its simple honesty and brutal trauma explore the prison industrial complex. Stephen King's story is a profound and timeless parable on the effects of political corruption, police brutality, legal loopholes, and prison life. You will find someone to relate to herein as The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time because it champions hope, bravery, kindness, empathy, friendship, and freedom. King's writing is brilliant and poignant with realistic drama stemming from horrendous cruelty and glaring flaws within the justice system. The Shawshank Redemption is an apt companion to The Green Mile, Escape from Alcatraz, and Cool Hand Luke.\n\nDarabont's direction is stellar as he keeps your attention in every scene. You are completely swept into Shawshank's gritty world of broken men. Darabont finds new ways to coherently tell King's compelling story, so that you are always intrigued at where the story is going. Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning and warm with many of his most clever shots herein. A shot looking down from the sky with a man's arms to represent freedom is absolute genius. Thomas Newman's score is riveting as it only chimes in to reaffirm The Shawshank Redemption's mysterious, intense, scary, or emotional sequences. Newman elevates a gorgeous film into a moving one.\n\nTim Robbins is perfect as the intelligent lead Andy Dufresne. Robbins portrays one of cinema's most thoughtful, pensive, and sympathetic figures with an empathetic face, eyes, voice, movement, and persona. Robbins is as brilliant in The Shawshank Redemption as he is in Mystic River. Robbins is a phenomenal actor because he depicts large themes in subtle displays of acting.\n\nMorgan Freeman is as affecting as Robbins because Freeman gives his inmate, Red, a distinct air of hopelessness. His character has given up until he befriends the optimistic and motivated Dufresne. On the other hand, Bob Gunton is brutal and vile as the revoltingly corrupt and cruel Warden Samuel Norton. He knows how to appear fearsome without screaming. His quiet fuming and purposeful vindictiveness is astounding as Gunton acts to peak villainy.\n\nOverall, The Shawshank Redemption is a revelation in allowing an audience to empathize with prisoners on a personal level. You should watch it as I'm certain you will love it.",

The direction from Frank Darabont throughout just kept pulling me in to this world and made what is probably one of the best prison dramas ever. He was able to develop a very heart felt story and made you feel you in Shawshank Prison with all of them. The characters all felt real and every scene was beautifully crafted from the best and worst parts in prison. Some of my favorite scenes were Morgan Freeman's Red in the parole room and how he answers each time shows his development as a character and his friendship with Tim Robbins' Andy as a motivation in the end. The scenes where Andy was helping out in the prison and his motivation to get out and dream to be on a beach near the Pacific was another great part of what is already an amazing film overall. Other characters like the Warden, and Brooks helped move the story in different ways, but were important in their roles as well. The movie also knows when to tug at your heartstrings and does in perfectly, and the ending is still one of my favorites to this day.",

It does not spoon feed you information and it allows for viewers to truly become immersed in the story. Based on the novella by Stephen King, we get to witness a master class in storytelling, character development and an early example of plot twists coming out of nowhere. Following the unlucky story of Andy Dufresne as he navigates the brutal, unforgiving life of a maximum security prison inmate, we get to watch this brilliant former banker manipulate his way through the system and leave those in charge believing they have him by the short and curlies when in reality he was playing them like instruments the whole time. On his journey, he is joined by Red, a man who can get things and is always there to lend a helping hand, ear or advice whenever needed. We also meet Brooks, an elderly man who has spent the majority of his life incarcerated within Shawshank's walls. As the story unfolds, we watch as Brooks leaves the prison, only to become entrenched in that life even on the outside. It leads him to suicide in a scene that is as heart-wrenching as it is educational (showcasing the downside of long terms in prison and becoming institutionalized). We also lay witness to Andy weaselling himself in to the financials of the prison and creating a persona that technically does not exist. Everything culminates in the escape of the century, a man desperate for freedom crawling through the sewage pipe, not knowing what is on the other side, not caring just wanting out. Red so poignantly states, \"He crawled through 500 yards of shit and came out clean on the other side.\" This is a movie that needs to be on everybody's to watch list.",

            "content": "Hoping for Redemption\nSpiritual and uplifting, The Shawshank Redemption is an old-fashioned prison flick that leaves you with lots to think about. Gripping you to your seat, the motion picture wrestles with your heart leaving you speechless.  Released in 1994, both Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red transcend through their characters and bring you back to the 1940s.  \nBased on famous author Stephen Kingï¿ 1/2(TM)s short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, this film shows the beauty of actress Rita Hayworth as the symbol of hope throughout Robbinsï¿ 1/2(TM) time in his lonely jail cell.  ï¿ 1/2Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever diesï¿ 1/2Â?. Only explained in the last few minutes of the movie, the theme of hope is woven through the movie.  \nUp-and-comer Frank Darabont directed this marvelous film.  Darabont later went on to direct The Green Mile and The Walking Dead but is still most recognized for his ingenious work directing one of his first films, The Shawshank Redemption.  As it may seem long, slow and at some points too outwardly sentimental, it all adds to the overarching theme of hope throughout the film.\nFalsely convicted of killing his wife and her lover, Robbins is sentenced to life in prison.  During his first couple years, heï¿ 1/2(TM)s harassed by the warden, beaten by the guards, and sexually abused by inmates.  It takes Robbins a few years to fit in at the penitentiary but he evolves into one of the most cherished inmates.  \nDarabont created one magnificent scene mastering the use of acting and photography. One day, a few lucky inmates were tasked with tarring the roof of a prison building, including Robbins and they all heard the guards talking.  The captain of the guards, Captain Hadley, was going to inherit $35,000 after his brotherï¿ 1/2(TM)s death and didnï¿ 1/2(TM)t want to lose a big chunk of it to the government.  Captain Hadley threatened to push Robbins off the roof for confronting him and explaining a way he could keep the money legally.  The high angle shot on Robbins makes him look small as he is being scolded by the Captain.  As Robbins explains his legitimate plan to Captain Hadley, the camera angle begins to lower and makes Robbins look strong and worthwhile to the audience.  This is a turning point for Robbins.  This incident earns Robbins the guardï¿ 1/2(TM)s gratitude and in return, the Captain gets beer for all of the inmate workers. The use of robust acting and precise photography in this scene is a stunning example of what Darabont was capable of capturing in The Shawshank Redemption. \nRobbins doesn't quite know all the rules inside Warden Nortonï¿ 1/2(TM)s prison and ends up breaking a good many of them, even after heï¿ 1/2(TM)s won their affections.  Some acts are seen as acceptable, such as offering to complete the prison staffsï¿ 1/2(TM) tax returns and asking for money from the State to fund a new library. Others, not so much.  When a new inmate arrives and reveals new information about Robbinsï¿ 1/2(TM) murder allegations, Robbins asks the warden for a new hearing.  But instead of gaining support from the warden, heï¿ 1/2(TM)s punished for the request and sentenced to a month of solitary confinement. As the film evolves, so does Robbins.  He learns to fit in and do good for others. \nFreemanï¿ 1/2(TM)s role is one portraying some sort of God.  He definitely has the voice.  In 2003, Freeman even played God in Bruce Almighty.  Both Darabont and Shadyac, director of Bruce Almighty, capture Freemenï¿ 1/2(TM)s recognizable voice as God.  Award -Winning actors Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood, and Paul Newman, auditioned for Freemanï¿ 1/2(TM)s part, but Darabont wisely pursued Freeman instead.\nFreeman develops a special friendship with Robbins in prison and becomes a mentor of sorts to him.  In the end, Freemen serves his term and is released back into society.  Unlike a previous inmate who killed himself after getting out, Freeman told himself, ï¿ 1/2Get busy living, or get busy dyingï¿ 1/2Â?.  There is hope for everyone in this world, you just have to believe in it.  \nThe Shawshank Redemption is an incredible work of art.  It masters all aspects of what makes a movie great.  Definitely a movie worth watching.",

Their friendship is very well developed throughout the film's plot which spans numerous decades and the end result is a deeply uplifting ending.

            "content": "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.\n\nInteresting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.\nFrom Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\"\n\nThe key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?\n\nPeople like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about \"redemption\" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.\n\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture).\n\nThere wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a \"prison drama\" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Clearly this was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience, and indeed business was slowly but steadily growing when it was yanked from theaters. If it had been left to find its way, it might have continued to build and run for months, but that's not what happened.\nInstead, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it found its real mass audience on tapes and discs, and through TV screenings. Within five years, \"Shawshank\" was a phenomenon, a video best seller and renter that its admirers feel they've discovered for themselves. When the Wall Street Journal ran an article about the \"Shawshank\" groundswell in April 1999, it was occupying first place in the Internet Movie Database worldwide vote of the 250 best films; it's usually in the top five.\n\nPolls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value \"Shawshank\" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.\n\nThe movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.\n\nThe Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free, and the board releases him.\nThere's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind.\n\nFrank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties. I think such movies are slower to sit through than a film like \"Shawshank,\" which absorbs us and takes away the awareness that we are watching a film.\n\nDeliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro.\" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know.\n\nRoger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime.\n\nDarabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.",

La perfetta sincronia dei personaggi rende la storia ancora più intensa, con interpretazioni magistrali da parte di tutto il collaudato cast. Lo stile narrativo della pellicola è sicuramente il suo punto di forza, probabilmente il miglior adattamento dalle spiccate storie di Stephen King.

It deals with hard topics like rape and suicide but hope is always what drives Andy forward. As the poster said \"fear can hold you prisoner but hope can set you free.\" When things look terrible for Andy he holds hope for finally getting to live on the pacific ocean own a beach front motel and just take care of a broken boat. Red's outlook on life in the beginning seems trivial, he goes through the prisons schedule and when he gets to the yard hangs with gang and gets people what they want or need. Andy however changed everything Red finally felt a speck of freedom that culminates in the Opera scene. Red puts it best in the narration \"amd for all of us.........it felt like we were free for the first time.\" Characters like Johnny held hope for the future with his Highschool equivalent carrying a C+ average were crushed. Everyone besides the prison staff felt human, they wanted to achieve goals and have lives but their only way to keep it alive was by being one of many innocent men in Shawshank. Eventhough Andy is behind bars, the only way for him to feel part of the outside world is by helping people. Helps a guard with his brother's inheritance and how to hide it from the IRS just to get his friends some beers. Sends 2 letters everyweek to congress to expand the prison library just to give the people educations and freedom. This film expresses freedom in the most human way not by being a basic right but being a basic human emotion. Watching this film made me glad to be alive because nothing has ever made me more happy.

Seeing the value of friendship, hope and courage, it has put forward bring out so many emotions from me. \n\nAndy (Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife. However only Andy know he didn't commit the crime. He is an outcast among the untaught and scary vandals inside the prison population, he's a closed book and only interacts with Red (Freeman) to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Andy does not crack inside instead he holds on the hope of the truth coming out which allows him to prevail behind bars. As the plot unravels, the two protagonists begin their unlikely friendship in the prison with each one encouraging the other to keep their sanity in the midst of top class criminals. \n\nA great performance comes from an actor who gets under the skin of the character, and both Freeman and Robbins have done this really well. \n\nEveryone I know has been encouraging me to watch this blockbuster, but at first I didn't the initiative as the genre as the genre doesn't appeal to my taste. However, when I watched it after much procrastination, I really enjoyed it, and I am pleased to say that It was worth the 142 minutes of my time.

Nothing in this movie could have been done better. being 100% perfect The Shawshank Redemption truly is the greatest movie of all time",

It was actually based off a book by Stephen King titled \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" and from what I read online, it follows the book fairly well. Still, when I was watching the movie I was holding off on my annoyance on just how cliche the film really was. \n\nThe twist was spectacular and it left me with a wide-ass grin on my face. But with the knowledge that it's all from a book, the scene with the giant oak tree and Red trying to find the rock now sounds goes from neat to pretty stupid. The entire time I was thinking if this were in the real world and not a movie, there's no way in hell I'd find that rock in just a few scene montages with one song playing in the background while wearing a damn suit in that summer heat. But movies gotta movie and well... he finds it alright. And then just based off of a note and a few hundred dollars, he finds a way to cross the border as a parole evading convict and find Andy somewhere in Zihuatanejo. I wish it was as easy as Morgan Freeman makes it.\n\nAnother aspect of the film that got ruined for me with my book realization was Tommy William's role. I thought that it was extremely convenient that Andy would happen to be teaching the only person alive who could prove his innocence. And to make the movie more dramatic, Warden Samuel Norton refused to let Andy go to trial so he had Tommy killed while inhumanely locking Andy up in solitary confinement for two months. It seems to be a popular thing for wardens in films to be power abusing assholes, doesn't it?\n\nRegardless of all of that, The Shawshank Redemption was still a very entertaining film with great storytelling (I mean it is Morgan Freeman narrating) and with one of the best twists to a film ever! Well worth the watch just for that.",

Every facet of movie making--from the script to the acting to the directing to the cinematography to the editing to the score--are  done to the highest degree of precision and expression.\n\nAs a result, viewers experience the full spectrum of human emotions over the course of the movie.  When asked, \"What is it that people love so much about movies?\" My answer is always the same: because they make us FEEL.  Happiness, sadness, terror, love ... whatever the emotion, it's the act of feeling that creates that indelible bond between the person and the picture.",

It is about a man who was falsely accused of murdering someone, so he is sent to prison and the story revolves around his friendship with other people in prison. This piece of art is a masterpiece. It is one of the best Stephen King adaptations of all time. The movie displays the intensity of prison violence in a realistic way.  Morgan Freeman's character is the character with the best dialogue and is the most likable character in the story. The Shawshank Redemption hit all of the right notes as far as being a drama. The acting was top notch, the screenplay was gold, the cinematography couldn't have been any better, and everything else was ahead of its time.\nOver all, The Shawshank Redemption has been voted into the top 10 greatest movies of all time by several different people.

            "content": "As most of us know, Stephen King is quite an interesting fellow. His movie adaptations haven't always been well received, perhaps due to the fact that most people don't relate well to his bizarre creations. \nThe Shawshank Redemption, however, is simply an incredible film. There are (many) reasons why some of the most respected critics rave about this film. \nThe Director, Frank Darapont, beautifully captured the essence of King's storytelling in this edge-of-your-seat rollercoaster. \nMaybe it's the connections you find yourself identifying with throughout the film.  The film was filled with some incredibly talented actors, a group that worked very well together having numerous stellar portrayals. Perhaps it's the way Frank Darabont tugs at your heart strings with hope, friendship and the meaning of life. This film truly touches on all the \"deep stuff\" in life. Watching this film for the first time was like discovering a newfound sense of meaning, I left uplifted with a sense of boundless gratitude, ready to take on the world! I feel that certain films that move you to feel certain emotions are among some of the most powerful. The Shawshank Redemption is well-deserving of such a description. \nTim Robbins shines as Andy Dufresne- a skinny young banker from Maine. To Dufresne's unfortunate luck, he is accused of killing his cheating wife and her lover. His promises and cries of innocence in court don't carry much weight, but his shy manner and likable personality do. Andy soon makes friends at Shawshank Prison with \"Red\", played by Morgan Freeman. Red is a veteran con who takes an authoritative position at Shawshank. Andy soon draws a circle of prisoners around him, and before he knows it has quite the group of friends. One of which, played by James Whitmore, plays an elderly man who will certainly toy with your emotions at some point in the film. \nThere's a reason why this film is constantly on \"Top 10 Movies of all Time\" lists. A must see for all.",

This is the movie you have to show to your kids when they don't know what they want to do with the rest of their lives, because The Shawshank Redemption offers some of the most valuable life-lessons and messages that a single movie can give you. This movie makes you care about even the smallest side story it has to offer and the main story (off course) is shocking and very moving. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely perfect in their roles. The characters they play in this movie are in my opinion the best characters they have ever played in their lives yet. The side characters are unforgettable too. Especially Bob Gunton deliveres. The movie is also beautifully shot, from wide shots of the prison, to the different angles in the dialogues.\nThe dialogue is top notch and it gives us a lot of famous quotes we still use today. Most notably: ''Get busy living or get busy dying''.\nThere simply isn't a bad thing to say about this movie, I litteraly can talk for hours about how great it is. Of course this movie is a must see.",

            "content": "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" Movie Review\n\nA typical prison movie consists of bad food, dirty surroundings, and physically abusive inmates and guards, while \"The Shawshank Redemption\" takes this genre to a completely different level. While still including the filth and violence, emotion plays a bigger role. When directing the movie, Frank Darabont ought to have wanted to hit the entire spectrum of emotion. During the movie, the audience will feel themselves cheering from the couch, irritated, or holding back a few tears.\n \nAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of killing his wife and the man she was cheating on him with, and he is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. While serving his sentences Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman), who slowly becomes one of his greatest strengths. Andy uses his previous banking skills to get a job in prison that he enjoys and passes his time with hobbies and devious schemes. The movie, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is made perfectly using strategic acting and not to forget about how basic the setting is.\n\nTim Robbins does a fantastic job playing the main character, Andy Dufresne. He captivates the audience and keeps them watching his every move. He creates a walk and a way of speech for his character. I watched an interview of Tim Robbins shortly after the film was released, and I took special notes of the way that he walked into the room and his tone of voice. He talks softly and walks as if he holds himself up a little higher than he does anyone else when he is not playing the part of Andy Dufresne. During the movie, he walks with more of a lost-like stroll and speaks in a deeper, seductive sound. \n\nFor a movie filled with drama, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has the most basic special effects. The story took place in The Shawshank Prison for the majority of the movie, so the only props and backgrounds consisted of brick walls, dirty floors, and rusted metal bars. The simplicity of the special effects not only contradicted with the action-filled plot, but it was able to bring the audience into the movie. Everyone can relate to being in a room with brick walls wanting to break free because of how lonely you may feel, which is exactly how the inmates felt.  \n\nWhile the special effects and the props are basic, the plot of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" could not have been more exciting. The actors did a phenomenal job at pulling the audience into the movie and making them feel like they are there with the actors. Not only does the movie entertain the audience for a little over two hours, but it also educates the typical movie-goers on some issues in prisons in the past. At the time the wardens of prisons were finding scandalous ways to make profits and keep the money for themselves instead of using it for their jobs like they should have been doing. The purpose of this movie was to pass on the tale of the famous prison escapee and to shame the prison systems.",

He is the perfect narrator to bring Steven Kings classic story to wonderful life. This might just be his best performance as the 'man who can get things', Red. The movies strongest point is it's realistic portrayal of prison life. This includes rape, suicide and the need to remain in prison. No other prison movie has portrayed the want to stay in prison. Because, the truth is, when people are out of prison, they don't know what to do. They can either cope, kill themselves or do something so terrible that they stay right where they are.

When we observe this, it gives us motivation to keep going as well, not because he escaped eventually, but because others told him the impossibility and consequence of escape and he endured the largest degree of adversity, and still escaped. Now we know that anything is possible if we have the smarts and motivation to achieve it. 5/5.",

            "content": "One of the most renowned films ever made, The Shawshank Redemption can easily be found in most top 10 movie lists. But does it deserve the praise? In short, absolutely. What Frank Darabont has developed for the silver screen is completely breathtaking. First and foremost, you have the strength of the two leads. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's chemistry is so infectious that you are begging for more with each passing line of dialogue they share. These two lost, beaten down souls finding hope and the will to live is beautifully executed.\n\nOf course you can't forget about the other actors. The casting is pitch perfect, with special attention to Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown as the antagonistic warden and prison guard. Despite the warden bordering on being an over the top, unrealistic cartoon, Gunton's performance makes it very watchable.\n\nBut perhaps the truly greatest achievement of this film is the grand scale of it. While the majority of the narrative takes place inside a prison, you get the sense that it's a whole world of its own; almost a character itself. You watch it age over the years, losing and gaining new prisoners and their changing personalities, exploring every nook and cranny of it. In many ways, the prison is claustrophobic and small but it's also huge and epic. This added element, which engulfs the viewer in its atmosphere, makes the film all the more engaging.\n\nMore than 20 years later, Shawshank still holds up incredibly well and is fully deserving of its praise. If there are any complaints, some of the story beats and characters come off as somewhat clichéd and hokey considering how many these elements have become more prominent in the passing years (Morgan Freeman as the wise mentor and narrator, the crazed religious authority figure, the power of friendship and hope, etc.). \n\nStill, the cast and crew's obvious passion put into the final product is highly commendable and elevates the material to a whole new level. Be sure to check this excellent movie out.",

            "content": "Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption (1994) focuses on both physical and mental architectures of confinement, as well as the role of religion in terms of human behavior. The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne who gets sent to Shawshank Prison for a crime he hasn't committed, meets Red, struggles through the prison life, and finally manages to escape only to be reunited with Red later at Zihuatanejo. With these three themes brought together, and using camera angles, music, and narrative dialogues, the movie transcends a view of how life is really like be it within, or without, the walls of Shawshank.\n\n\nThe inmates of Shawshank prison are put in physical confinement the moment they enter. Their autonomy is taken away, and they become like animals in a cage. This is made clear when Hadley tells the inmate, \"You eat, when we say you eat. You shit, when we say you shit, and you piss, when we say you piss\" (00:13:45). The inmates forget what it's like to be free. This is further implied when Red explains to the others how Brooks became \"institutionalized\" (00:59:12), and that the walls of the prison were all what he knew. Institutionalization is a concept that is not necessarily witnessed when inside prison. It happens whenever there is some sort of deprivation of freedom, which leads to people forgetting what it's really like to be free. When Red is released, he asks for permission to go to the bathroom, which is something that no human can be deprived off, yet this is just the case with the inmates. Institutionalization can sometimes occur to people without them noticing it as they simply \"go with the flow\", only to realize later that they are nothing but machines following a certain routine dictated by a higher system. In addition, Red also says, \"They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take,\" (01:00:17) indicating that the physical confinement didn't merely act at the level of freedom, but rather at the level of simply existing. In a metaphoric way, this is how many people actually \"live\" their entire lives. They spend their lives first worrying and fussing about studies, then work, then marriage, then children, only to reach the end of their lives realizing that they haven't been really \"living\". Again, they were only following the physical limitations of an already-dictated system.\n\nThe inmates are also put in a more serious mental confinement. Their spirits have no hope and they are filled with fear, which holds them prisoners. This line between fear and hope is drawn elaborately in the movie. Andy's character is nothing but the rock that Red dug under the tree at the end of the movie (02:14:00). Andy was the \"rock that had no earthly business in a Maine Hayfield\" (01:56:44); he \"had an invisible coat that shielded him from this place\" (00:28:50). He tries to instill the idea of hope within the spirits of his friends, especially Red and Tommy. He goes on to play the Mozart piece sung by the 2 Italian ladies, depicting a sign of fearlessness, all the while adding a sense of mental freedom to the inmates. This diegetic music brings all inmates, along with the audience, to a tentative and soothed state. Andy's hope is the reason to his eventual physical and mental freedom. An important scene where a line is drawn between fear and hope is towards the end of the movie, when the warden is seen to have given up on hope, and that did not work out well for him. He fills several bullets in his revolver and points it at the door in hopes of fighting off the police. However, the light of hope is shut inside him, and he shoots a bullet through his head (02:03:48). At this scene, the camera focuses on his face, and sweat is seen leaving his forehead, taking with it the last drips of hope. Another scene where a clear distinction is made between fear and hope with aid of camera angles is the scene where the camera focuses on the gun then shifts to the compass (02:10:30). The audience first thinks that Red is going to commit suicide; however, the compass indicates his search for his friend. Also, the frame shot of \"Brooks was here, so was Red\" (02:16:45) draws a fine line between two characters with opposing views of hope and fear. The ultimate mental realization of hope is what allows the characters to be set free from their confinements. The calm elevating music during Red's search for the tree, and his journey to Zihuatanejo, helps in indicating that Red has slowly managed to fill his spirit with hope.\n\n\nAnother important aspect of the movie is its frequent references to religion when it comes to Warden Norton's character. His first rule to the inmates is \"No blasphemy\" (00:13:26). He's a good reader of the Bible, and has most of its verses memorized. These are traits of a pious man of good will; however, the warden is the most evil character in the movie. Why does he do it? It is known that throughout the history of mankind, and ever since the dawn of civilizations, religion has often been used as means of justifying evil deeds, or protecting those who commit the evil deeds. The warden does exactly that. He uses the Bible in order to shield his dark side, or perhaps to justify his evil deeds. Towards the end of the movie, Norton drops the Bible on the floor (02:02:30), and the camera view focuses on where the Bible lands: right next to his feet, indicating disrespect, degradation, and blasphemy! This can come as a surprise to some people, but this is the case with Jules Winnfield in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, which was released only a few weeks after The Shawshank Redemption. Jules also uses references to the Bible and acts pious, when in fact he is nothing but a cold-blooded murderer. \n\nMore than 20 years later, The Shawshank Redemption still stands as one of the movies that set a mark in the world of cinema. By diving into issues of confinement and religion, the movie manages to portray aspects that are present all around the world. These are aspects that were, are, and will remain in play throughout the course of humanity.",

            "content": "There are only a select few movies that I would say are genuinely perfect, but Shawshank Redemption is on that list. I literally cannot think of one thing that I would change in this movie. While I haven't seen the whole movie from start to finish in a long time, it is one of those films that snags me whenever I catch it on TV and I cannot change the channel. There's a lot of praise I could lavish on this film, and I would probably bore you to tears. Instead of exhausting the entire thesaurus of positive adjectives and adverbs let me just take a few sentences to try and explain why this film touches me so deeply. For starters, Shawshank manages to get us sympathizing with the protagonist from the very beginning. Despite the fact that we have no evidence presented to make us believe Andy's story, the courtroom scenes at the beginning are designed to make the prosecutor look overly aggressive and Andy look innocent, so we're on his side instantly. As a result we're going through this ordeal with him, and every harsh moment he suffers feels like a personal offense to me.\n\nNext is probably the most shallow of my reasons for loving Shawshank, but it's the narration from the amazing Morgan Freeman. When the film reaches those moments where it could drag, instead we get to listen to his dulcet voice explaining what happened as we skip a section of time. Because of this I don't feel a single frame of film is wasted in the entire 2+ hours of the movie. But the big thing that pushes this film over the edge for me, into being one of my favorite films of all time, is the Redemption. I don't feel like I'm spoiling anything because it's in the title, but that conclusion makes my heart swell so much that I almost can't contain it. When a film takes you through the lowest depths of despair and suffering, but then has a redemptive and happy ending, it is something truly special. The highs become so much more enjoyable because the lows were so terrible. Again, I could write for days about the greatness of Shawshank Redemption, but I'll simply say WATCH IT! And if you've seen it, WATCH IT AGAIN! Every single time I see any segment of the film (even just the last few scenes) I feel like my time was not wasted.",

            "content": "Rob Rompala\nThe Shawshank Redemption \n\n\tFrank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is not just the best film of 1994, (tie with Pulp Fiction) but also one of the best films of all time. This addicting cinematic experience successfully delivers a powerful film with an engaging story that you won't want to end.  \nBased on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayward and Shawshank Redemption, this uplifting prison drama revolves around the friendship of two men who spend 20 years together. \nMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. That sums it up. As good as the story is, it's hard to say it would work without these two magnificent performances. Freeman plays Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, an inmate who has been at Shawshank State Penitentiary long before Andy Dufresne (Robbins) arrives. \nIn 1947, Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He pleads his innocence, but regardless is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank. You will feel deep sincerity for Dufresne, but it's for the best because that's when Freeman starts to narrate. \nAs soon as Dufresne walks off the prisoner bus at Shawshank, Red doesn't think much of him. Red wagers a pack of cigarettes that Dufresne will be the first of the new inmates to sob during his first night locked up. Dufresne doesn't make a sound. \nThis sequence is narrated with Freeman's impeccable storytelling voice, as is much of the film. The pace of the plot is perfectly accompanied by Freeman's remarkable tone. It's easy to underestimate the significance of his narration. His voice is our guide through their compelling journey. \nDufresne recognizes that Red is able to smuggle in different types of contraband into the prison. He asks Red for a small rock hammer for his sculpturing hobby, and a poster of actress Rita Hayworth. The two quickly become friends. \nThere are many moments throughout the film that show us how different Dufresne is from the other inmates. There is something about him. He sees things in a way others don't, and Red's narration helps paint a clear picture for the audience. \n\tIn 1949, Dufresne and Red are doing some rooftop work with other inmates. Dufresne overhears the intimidating prison guard, Captain Hadley (played convincingly by Clancy Brown) complaining about an inheritance, in which he has to pay taxes. Dufresne, a former banker, offers to help Hadley legally secure his money with the exchange for his friends to drink beer on the rooftop. \n\tThis leads to Dufresne providing tax services to other prison guards, eventually leading to him unwillingly helping the ruthless Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) in his illegal money-laundering scheme. \n\tThe film gives us an ironic balance of good versus evil. The good is Dufresne and Red; the evil is the Warden and Captain Hadley. The interactions between these characters are enjoyable, and create intriguing storylines. \n\t Darabont's direction is flawless and his pacing is excellent. He perfectly blends the plot with the years spent in prison. He uses quality transitions and looming shots that zoom into the center of the subject. This shows us the realism of prison in a compelling way. \n\tThe Shawshank Redemption gives us compelling direction and interesting writing, but it's overshadowed by the memorable performances and narration. This triumphant story shows the horrors of incarceration, yet offers satisfying redemption. \n\tThis 122-minute epic will engulf your mind and lock your emotions in a holding cell that you don't want to be free of any time soon. It feels like only a half hour, because the story is truly engaging. The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes cinematic history. Yes, it's that good.",

            "content": "Andy Defresne was a prosperous man who lived a life of wealth and prestige as a successful banker until that one life-shattering night.  When his wife is found murdered along with her secret lover, Andy is strongly assumed the offender.  Without a strong alibi, the highly-esteemed banker is condemned to serve two life in prison sentences despite his firm plea of innocence.  Andy is forced to let go of everything he is used to and adjust to the prison lifestyle, one in which he is ill suited for.  During Andy Defresne's sentence the realities of prison become apparent when a few of atrocious prisoners become fascinated with him, leading to trouble for Andy.  Fortunately, Andy Defrense eventually adapts to this new surroundings, using the skills he acquired prior to his sentence to attract relationships with people you wouldn't expect.  If you're a fan of enticing dramas, The Shawshank Redemption(1994) is a must watch.  \nThe soundtrack to The Shawshank Redemption elevates scenes throughout the movie which already hold strong emotion.  The majority of the soundtrack is not flamboyant or flashy but carries a strong influence with its simplicity during critical scenes.  For instance, when Andy's prison cell is randomly inspected, soft violin sounds arise.  This hints that this encounter could be meaningful while allowing the actors' interaction to dominate the scene.  Thomas Newman, the composer, justifies the overall mood of the movie by gracefully incorporating subtle music to the film.\nInteractions between the characters feel real and conceivable as natural dialogue is used throughout.  Tim Robbins portrays his character (Andy Defresne) brilliantly.  Andy Defresne's personality and personal attributes are uniquely different from every other character in a movie concerning life inside the walls.  He walks around the prison yard in a composed, self-assured manner as if he's one step ahead of the game, a trait few inmates possess.  Andy's initial weakness is shown through his slumped body language. and his eventual confidence can be seen clearly by the distinct look in his eyes.  Morgan Freeman (Red) adds a different, yet intriguing element to this film.  Freeman displays Red as a confident, content prisoner in the beginning of the film.  As time passes, Red becomes more questioning of what more there may be to life by acquiring a constant look in his eyes as if he is examining Andy's words of hope and its validity.\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a film that draws you in from its beginning and keeps you entertained until the very end.  Morgan Freeman's narration throughout the film is intriguing.  While the film offers intense and defining \"action\" scenes, it proves to have much deeper deceptive characteristics and activities rooted within.  The film presents us with a simple yet useful lesson when you feel your life is losing purpose, \"Either get busy livin', or get busy dying\".",

Expecting a semi-sappy feel good tale, I had no idea the impact this movie would have on me, let alone the mass group of followers it has.\n\n     With stellar performances from the cast you could really feel the cold walls of Shawshank prison, not to mention the firm hand of the warden. The story is constantly twisting into new ideas, new failures and accomplishments, more struggles and rewards. As expecting as I was to be unbrushed by the films emotion, the brilliant screenwriting crammed multiple very recognizable personalities into the two and a half hours, making it a force not to be reckoned with.

It's what I would call a slow movie, not much action, no real special effects. Just a great story with good acting, the way movies used to be. This movie came out in 1994 and is based on a Stephen King short story called Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption, featured in his collection called Different Seaons. The movie is about Andy Dufresne,(Tim Robbins) a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the course of almost 20 years in prisons, to goes over Andies Changed life, his adventures behind bars and his friendship with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding,(Morgan Freeman) who runs one of the prison black market rackets, but is a decent man. I'ts a somewhat sad, melancholic story, with moments of humor, both light and dark. It does end on a note of optimism and hope. It was a box office failure, sad to say I didn't go see it, but don't recall it ever making it to Longview or Kelso to be honest. Have the dvd, watch it at least once a year. If you haven't seen it, and you don't mind a movie that doesn't have a lot of bells or whistles, please watch it.",

The plot to \"The Shawshank Redemption\" during the 1940's a wealthy banker named \"Andy Dufresne\" portrayed by \"Tim Robbins\" is charged with murdering his wife and a golfer whom she was sleeping with at the time. Later on \"Andy Dufresne\" is taken to the \"Shawshank\" prison where he meets a man named \"Red\" portrayed by \"Morgan Freeman\" who is guilty of murder. The movie starts off with \"Andy Dufresne\" in his car drunk holding a gun outside his wife's house. This scene is both intense and thrilling. For the most of the movie the relationship is shown between \"Andy\" and \"Red\". During the movie it also shows how \"Andy's\" intelligence can be used for the better at \"Shawshank\" prison. These scenes are very interesting to watch. The film's climax is very surprising and amazing, but what are even better are the scenes that follow. The acting in this movie is truly stunning; \"Morgan Freeman\" and \"Tim Robbins'\" performances were both stunning. \"Thomas Newman\" did a marvellous job at composing sad, happy and thrilling music for \"The Shawshank Redemption\". Certain scenes with have music that sounds both weird and is misplaced. One of the best things about \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the way it is filmed, the movie uses wide-shots and close ups whenever needed which makes a great scene. If you are a person who enjoys \"Stephen King\" movies' or movies with \"Morgan Freeman\" than I highly recommend you watch \"The Shawshank Redemption\" as it has an incredible plot, amazing visuals and marvellous acting. Although there is only one issue with the film and that is the music, there are only one or two scenes that could have had  some different music. I give 1994's \"The Shawshank Redemption\" a 9.5/10.",

The contrasting tone of the hardship and hopeless of prison and the levity and hope of the inmates makes for a beautiful and heartfelt film which explores the mind of someone who must accept life without freedom for an unbelievable length of time in which you watch them transform slowly into a part of their new reality.",

It's so harsh, so difficult to watch, and so dramatic that you want yourself out of Shawshank Prison. My surprise is, nominated for 7 Oscars, and no wins! Nominees: Best Picture, Best Actor(Morgan Freeman), Best Writing/Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Film-Editing, and Best Music, Original Score(Thomas Newman). Newman has done Oscar winning soundtracks, but this movie is at the top of the league! What could possibly be better than this movie in those nominees?! Whatever. Shawshank describes Jacob Singer now convicted for murder 50 years before his torture. Singer is actually Andy Dufresne, who is wrongly convicted (what a coincidence!) of murder, and sent to innocent Shawshank Prison. Apparently, everyone is innocent at Shawshank so no one causes real trouble, unless your that dude that is a bully, who has like 4 lines. Tim Robbins(andy) has 1,000 times that amount! With so much sadness, and tears falling down my cheek, I think Shawshank is my favorite so far. Compare this movie to other crime movies, but keep out To Kill A Mockingbird, and My Cousin Vinny. This movie rocks, just not as much as Room on the Broom and Heidi Ewing's Documentary. I love this movie, it's on hope, and believing, and committing suicide when you have no clue what to do next.

This film is outstanding and spectacular in nearly every way possible; teaches us the values of life's lessons, showing us audiences that even when everything looks pale and bleak, that, with hope, anything is possible.  The emotional human character development is also done very well; we care for Andy and everyone else in the film (well, Andy and his friends, for that matter).  Probably the most sad, unnerved wracking moment in this movie is to see what happens with Brooks Hatlen's life when he's finally granted parole, after serving fifty years in prison.  Imagine, being in jail since 1905, and finally getting out fifty years later.  Prison life was all he knew -- in jail, he was an important man; outside, he's nothing but an annoyance and a bag of wind to people.  Fed up with the sudden changes and constant state of fear, Brooks decides to escape the pain by ending his life (as he vaguely put it, \"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.  Not for an old crook like me.\")  Poor Brooks... the ending, wow.  The ending for this movie is one of the best I've ever seen, and one of the most satisfying, I might add.  Again, absolutely fantastic.  In my honest opinion, this film should've won the \"Best Picture\" Award for 1994, not \"Forrest Gump.\"  Comes highly recommended... Ã¢~Âº",

One of them has hope. One doesn't. Same with Andy and the warden. I only recently noticed how both of them hide their secrets behind a wall decoration. They even have parallel scenes of loading a gun. Andy chooses not to use his gun. The Warden does. The movie kind of functions like a metaphor for anyone struggling with anything and the movie's strong message of holding on to hope is timeless and powerful and resonates.

            "content": "In the world of cinema, there are two ways to categorize prison dramas. They can be considered effective or moving, rarely both. The Shawshank Redemption is the quintessential example of the perfect concoction of both themes. The way that this story is brought to screen from the beloved Stephen King novel plays out like an adventure through the eyes of a prisoner. When a movie takes the perspective of multiple characters it makes a story and the character's action all the more believable and even understandable. Through the eyes of Andy and Red, we understand the way they act and where they go with their actions and dialogue because they understand their surroundings. The way that these two interact with each other is what makes this movie so enjoyable. Their charisma and attitude are the motors that keep the story running and never fails to impress and fascinate. The reason I got so invested in the two leads is because of the way they bounced off of each other with quick and smart dialogue and the way they function in prison. I'm sure a given by now is that you can assume that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave great performances since I became invested and on board with them as their characters. The plot of the movie never feels overcomplicated or dull, every aspect of the story is completely necessary and totally effective on many scales. Through the writing, the writers show the harsh conditions of what the characters encounter and perfectly show the functions and attitudes towards the harshness of a situation. If a character was brutally beaten, the violence and roughness was on display and is honestly frightening at some scenes. The cinematography by the great Roger Deakins is magnificent as always. He's able to make a dark situation look dark and full of despair and a inspirational moment passionate. The complete twist at the end of the movie is possibly the best I've seen. Through all the details that the writers portray to us that don't seem particularly much at the moment, they are put to full use at the end and makes for a fantastic and redeeming ending. Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that gets a special spot in cinema as one of the greats. It's heartfelt, harsh, effective, inspiring, thought provoking, adventurous, and passionate. The movie buff's movie in more than one way. A",

            "content": "Prison movies are very often trumped up pieces of garbage with a leading man who can't act, a story line which doesn't stand and set pieces which can bore you to tears. However, The Shawshank Redemption shows the world of film that no matter how overdone the subject, a good character and a good story can make any setting into a great film. \n\nThus we meet Andy Dufresne. He is quiet, lean, not much to look at really and blessed with a somewhat icy persona at a first glance. But upon getting to know the man behind the dull and faded covers is one of the most rewarding experiences film can give you. Andy's withdrawn nature gives way to a tough, complex man who, while he is taken lightly at first, clings stubbornly to life and holds to the idea that a man can overcome any circumstances surrounding him if he is patient. He may not be blessed with Jason Statham's physique or the chiselled perfection of many other actors but Tim Robbins has real talent, a thing which is lacking in much of Hollywood today. He plays Andy perfectly, a quiet, demure individual who only opens up to those he chooses to after careful consideration. He doesn't talk himself up even though he is very smart, and he doesn't jeopardise his plans by blabbing them out to every passerby. He has a quiet strength which is priceless in a situation like the one he finds himself in.\n\nRed, too, is a great character. A prisoner who doesn't believe in hope, an unusual occurence for a prison film. His narration, which could be perceieved as lazy storytelling, gives great insight into the character's secret thoughts and emotions. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is spot on in his portrayal of the 'man who can get things.' \n\nThese two great characters are just the tip of the iceberg for this movie, as every character on screen is filled with rich backstory and as complex as a real person. This gives a film which would otherwise be average an edge over all of the others in its genre. \n\nThe film refuses to be rushed, taking its own time to unfold stories and show you different characters, though it is never boring and each scene brings some new insight into character's lives and into themselves. Whilst another film would have focussed on very different aspects of prison life, this one focusses on the prisoners inside. At the same time, however, this film goes where many films refuse to, as our hero is degraded in the worst way possible time and time again. The film does this with a certain elegance, however, not simply glossing over the fact, but not making it a focus point either. The story itself is fantastic, a coming of age story almost; the story of a man finally deciding to take initiative and do what he needs to. \n\nThere are standout performances all around from James Whitmore, William Sadler, Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton, though Tim Robbins' restraint throughout the film is the most standout of them all. \n\nNo focus has been lost on the technical aspects either, with some stunning cinematography (see the helicopter panning shot around the spires of the majestic Shawshank Prison. Beautiful) and lighting is impeccable. The music, too is perfectly suited for the film, beginning with an old, scratched record playing a song from around the time the film was set in. \n\nThe themes evident here are some very poignant ones; displaying crooked wardens for all their greed, startling moments of conspiracy, the injustice in the system and above all, hold onto hope. \n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film which is so inspirational, you can't help but to be moved by it. \n\nDefining Scene: \nAndy plays a gramophone to the entire prison. The stillness is breathtaking.",

One that tends to stand out from most others is the 1994 best picture nominee 'The Shawshank Redemption,' which is at its heart about the power of friendship and perseverance in the face of adversity. Set in mid-20th century Maine, 'Shawshank' looks at how two very different men (portrayed by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) can develop a friendship and make differences in the lives of their fellow inmates through regular acts of kindness in a federal prison. The film has all the makings of a classic, from solid, smart dialogue to bursts of drama and a quality soundtrack. The ups and downs experienced by both Robbins' character, Andy Dufresne, and Freeman's character, 'Red' Redding, are both rewarding and painful. One of the greatest strengths of 'Shawshank' is its climax - one that is not exactly expected based on the progression of the film. As things can go from bad to worse, 'Shawkshank' demonstrates there is always the chance for redemption, which is apparent based on the film's namesake. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has already proven to stand the test of time, and it's likely it will continue to do so.",

Oscar winners Timothy Robbins and Morgan Freeman lead this well-played cast as life lessons are passed down to each inmate involved in the story of Andy Dufrene (Robbins), a successful banker who is given a life sentence for killing his wife and her lover. With time on his side, Dufrene is soon motivated to bust out of his wrongly accused cell and make it back to the real world to live out his days as a free man. In the end, as Red (Freeman) put it, Andy Dufrene had made it to Mexico. 5 stars.",

To further explain, I've been stuck on this screen for fifteen minutes trying to figure out what to say, so I'll put it like this: The Shawshank Redemption is a unique film that will seamlessly pull you into the grimy and moss-ridden walls of its incredible set-pieces and realistic-at-its-peak cast. Most will indeed to find the movie overrated (being #1 in IMDB's Top 250), but all I can say is that most will be pretentious hipsters thinking they know more about movies than you do. Don't listen to them. Seriously. \n\nNow, the only real thing that bugged me was Adam. Believe me when I say that Tim Robbins' acting is beyond stellar, but I found his character... hmm... This is a very hard thing to explain, but I'm thinking that Adam had some \"mixed emotions\" about his wife that seemed too... hypocritical. Not sure. \n\nTo summarize, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that everyone has a right to see at least once in their life. It pulls you in and doesn't lift a finger until it's two-and-a-half runtime is depleted. \n\n9/10",

            "content": "This was from a speech that I made for one of my college class, and what better way to tell about my favorite movie than to show my speech to Rotten Tomatoes where everyone who does read my reviews will see from what I thought of The Shawshank Redemption. It was a few years ago when I was bored and I didn't have anything else better to do. I was going through the internet in terms of movies, and when I was looking through a list of the best movies of all time, I saw Shawshank Redemption as the highest rating movie on IMDB. I was curious enough to rent it and see what made this movie special. When I was finished with the film, I was in shock and pretty much said to myself that this movie is a special one. I wanted to do this because everybody has their own favorite film, and it's probably different from everyone else's special film. So for me, I'm going to tell you why it's my favorite based on some aspects: plot and setting, characters and actors who portrayed them, and writing and direction.\n    The Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by Stephen King, a banker that has received a life sentence for killing his wife and her lover while intoxicated. Even though he says that he's innocent, no one believes him, and the story begins with him living his life in the Shawshank Prison. Now, I don't know how faithful it was to the source material, but the movie probably expanded on the short story. The plot elements going on whether it be the main character trying to make the best for himself in the prison, making friends, and dealing with three people that wants to do, well, horrible things to him like it typically goes in prison, can get you interested in what's going on. It takes place at the Shawshank Prison, which in real life is an actual place called the Ohio State Reformatory that takes place in Mansfield, Ohio, and it's actually a tourist attraction for people to visit the set of the film that it takes place.\n    Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the banker that's in the prison who at the beginning of the film is spending his first days in prison. He acted like his life was over, and had nothing else to go back to other than his everyday life outside of prison. As the days go by, he briefly acted a little suspicious like he was holding something in, but only to end up being friends with a murderer name Red that's played by Morgan Freeman. He was more of a people-person who was the first person to be friends with the main character, while knowing who to trust and who to stay away from as he had been in prison for many years. He tried to get parole, but he failed to do so. He brought joy into the film, so it didn't make the movie too depressing. Showing from his eyes, he did have a few exhausting moments where he kept getting declined for parole. The movie has interesting characters like a greaser who's likable and intentionally full of himself and not bright that gets some character progression unlike the characters from Grease, I'm just kidding I haven't seen Grease for years and I don't remember much so don't kill me for those who are fans of the film. There's the warden who is a mysterious character that you don't know whether he's a good guy or not until later on. Then, there's  Brooks who has a pet bird and has lived in the prison for decades to the point that he wants to stay in it.\n    Whenever the characters have conversations with each other, they talked about human stuff, whether it be girls, what they liked in the days before they went to prison, and tried to help out in any way that had been going on in the prison, which is thanks to the script by Frank Darabont. He directed and wrote other Stephen King adaptations like The Green Mile, which was one of my favorite childhood films that I grew up with, and The Mist, which I only remember the ending when I first saw it because it kind of traumatized me of how messed up that ending was. The dialogue was so genuine that I felt like the characters talking were actual people, and whether you think they deserve to be in prison is totally up to you, but at some point you do feel like some of the character's time had definitely been served. The direction is also great that the structure of the film never seemed to have a boring spot, and there was never a scene that was unnecessary to this movie, which is cool knowing the fact that it's 2 hours and 22 minutes long. There are scenes like when Brooks is out of prison that it could've easily have been taken out of the film, but it shows something that you don't typically see in a prison film, and that's the aftereffects of a person that has been serving in prison for decades that even one of the characters says that he's basically \"institutionalized\", and Brooks even has the thought of doing something illegal in order to go back to the Shawshank Prison. \n    If what I say doesn't convince you otherwise, there are top critics from Rotten Tomatoes like Roger Ebert from Chicago Sun-Times who says this, \"If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.\", and James Berardinelli that says, \"The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic.\" Those were the reasons why The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite film: interesting story that doesn't bore the audience, three-dimensional characters that you learn enough about to the point that you want some of them to get out of prison, and the script and direction being top-notch that creates a film that everybody will talk about for a long time. When you come across The Shawshank Redemption on DVD, your favorite film, or  just found a film on the internet that interest you in free time, give it a watch or go back to it because you'll maybe get something out of it that causes you to ask your own friends to watch this film just like I'm informing you guys of my favorite movie with this speech.",

Such a rare movie to come by now a days as it captures the brutal pathways for humanity and it's consequences. Definitely a very entertaining film that kept me involved throughout the whole time.",

            "content": "Most prison dramas come across as pretty clichéd these days. The innocent convict and hero of the story is sent to a really brutal prison. There's usually a hard-ass prison guard to deal with, and a warden working to undermine our hero's efforts. There will be time spent in solitary confinement, and a prisoner, someone close to the our hero will likely be killed. We've seen it so many times before. But for good reason. The Graybar hotel is a great place to set a drama. Each convict's sordid history is potential fodder for a compelling story. So when we see characters in that setting grow and change for the better, we care about it, and when a character like Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison and starts to shake things up, it's easy to connect to that character and root for him.\r\n\r\nIt certainly doesn't hurt when Tim Robbin's is playing the part either. Nor is it a problem when his best friend(Red) is played by Morgan Freeman. In fact, this story is narrated by Red, and usually the constant need to explain story points and character feelings with a voice over really bothers me. But this is Morgan Freeman, and that voice gets a pass!\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption in my opinion is a near perfect film. There isn't a single aspect of this film I didn't like. It's superbly acted, written and directed. Thomas Newman's score is quite frankly amazing, and the inspiration behind my most listened to Pandora radio station! The pace of the film is pitch perfect too, and the story is heart warming. If I did have a complaint it might be that it's too short. I enjoyed the time spent with these characters so much, that I didn't want the film to end.\r\n\r\nMovie Prep:\r\n\r\nThis film moves at a slow but steady pace. If you liked films like Birdman of Alcatraz, you should like this one too. This is a must see for fans of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's not especially violent, but there is a fair amount of bad language. This is set in a prison after all!\r\n\r\nBest Format:\r\n\r\nIt's extremely well made - but a HD viewing at home is good enough. This film is more about the characters and dialog, and would entertain equally on any device you care to watch it on.\r\n\r\nBest moments for me:\r\n\r\nI love the moment when Andy Dufresne is bused into Shawshank Prison. It's a gorgeous aerial shot starting outside the prison walls, and follows the bus as it heads inside. The shot then pans up and over the main entrance to Shawshank to reveal the entire prison. We see other prisoners head toward the area they unload the new convicts, and all of this is done to Thomas Newman's fantastic score. Take a look and listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n-> http://talkiegazette.com/the-shawshank-redemption-1994/\r\n\r\n\r\nI also really liked Red's third parole meeting. Here's the dialog.\r\n\r\nThere's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit. \r\n\r\n\r\n-> http://www.talkiegazette.com\r\n\r\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\r\n\r\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

This prison drama is a masterclass in good acting and it's done with a sensitive touch. It's one of the best King adaptations, and shows there was more to King than just horror works. In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for murdering his wife and her lover, and he's sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve 2 life sentences. It's here that he meets contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who is serving a life sentence, but he's able to get Andy anything he needs. Andy soon wins the respect of Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), after Andy helps the prison guards with their finances, and Norton has Andy work with elderly librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), but Andy lives in hope that one day he will leave Shawshank, but Red believes he'll never do it. It's a great drama, one of the best prison dramas ever made, it has some brilliant characters and some brilliant dialogue. It sadly didn't connect with audiences when it came out in cinemas, but thanks to VHS, it became a hit, and it's become of the best loved films of all time, and it's a film which manages to engage everytime.",

The Shawshank Redemption is truly a story about friendship, and hope. Upon Andy arriving at the prison we see something very interesting. And that would various prisoner's reaction to Andy. This is one of the most unique things about the film because it leaves a sort of mysteriousness about Andy. Really makes you wonder why he keeps to himself, all the time? The end will have you feeling uplifted and... hopeful. The Shawshank Redemption is a carefully crafted film, and does more than just display the cruel prison life, but somehow also manages to fill us wiith optimism.\n\n4/5",

It was very depressing. That being said, I definitely see why it has more staying power than Forrest Gump. Of course, the Academy Awards are never fair. We can also question The Silence of The Lambs winning over Beauty and the Beast or dive into the short films categories, but it won't change it. I would highly recommend this film. It should be watched at least once. Maybe many times more. This is one of the few times that I've liked a movie at the same time I didn't, and for all the same reasons.",

            "content": "I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:\n\n \"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion.\"\n\n I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.\n\n 1. It's too slow.\n\n The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.\n\n 2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.\n\n Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing \"Kumbaya\"? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.\n\n 3. This is not realistic.\n\n Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.\n\nI would rate it higher if I could.",

Beautifully presented, I could not help but quickly become absorbed in the prison environment, and interested in the dynamics that were clear to see. The acting is expertly delivered, so as to become truly interested in each of them, and the journey that they being taken on. The story is somewhat unique in that the finale is not discussed or developed to a great extent. The impact of this is that it comes somewhat out of the blue, and re-gauges the audiences attention on the next phase of the film. I like this technique, whether deliberate or not, and it sets the last few scenes up nicely. A film that everyone simply must see at some point, and worthy of its five star rating.",

During my days as a student, I never really liked the film, or gave it any of my attention as, at the time, it was heavily forced on us, and I tend to not enjoy something that was treated as a compulsion. As I got older, mature and more aware, I saw this film in a new light. I watched this film on my own time and on my own terms, and it gave me a more positive experience. It was during this that I realised how much this film had to offer, and it made me kind of regret on not paying attention in school.\n\nThe film was based off a Stephen King novel entitled \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\", and it was adapted to the screen by Frank Darabont. I have not read King's novel, so I came into the film blind and not having any pre-existing feeling towards the film. Darabont has written a film that explores the themes of hope, institutionalisation, corruption, and friendship. The main focus of the plot is the life of Andy Dufresne during his time in prison. Andy is simply a metaphor of hope. He is a walking beacon of hope in the prison, and we can see his effect he had on his environment and the prisoners inhabiting within it. Andy is the closest thing to the life of the outside world, which is why people, especially Red, seem to cling on to him. Hope is a powerful agent, and this film demonstrates that perfectly, without hope, we start to find reasons to not live. The thing that made the character, Andy, a great man and symbol is that he is described and narrated by the perspective of another man, which in this case is Red. If the film decided to be narrated by Andy, then it wouldn't work because naturally he himself wouldn't think that he was a symbol of hope to these prisoners, and if he did, then he would have just come off as egotistic and pretentious. The Shawshank Redemption, in a way, can also be seen as a friendship film, as that aspect of the film truly drives the film along. Seeing Andy and Red together, is so interesting and engaging as their relationship feels so organic and never at all forced. The film also explores the concept of institutionalisation, saying that it sucks the life out of a person and that all individuality and perception of freedom is diminished from their system. It truly is a scary outcome, and something that nobody would ever want for themselves. The little short segment in the middle of the film on Brooks could have easily been a misfire if it wasn't written very well. The character Brooks is the only figure in that prison that seems to be genuinely kind and loving, and to see what he has become in the real world is heartbreaking. It's also interesting to see that the guards themselves who are conventionally a symbol of good and virtue, is instead the most despicable of them all. The film looks at the Warden as the devil, someone who at first wouldn't look like one but ends up showing his true colors as the film goes on. The Warden is too clever to just reveal all of himself at the start, he has to draw both Andy and the audience in before inflicting any damage. I found that theory to be quite interesting. The dialogue in the film was fun to listen to, not only because it contained well written lines but that it also has meaning to it. Every little thing that is being said kind of relate itself to the themes that floats throughout the film. It may be a bit down you throat for some people, especially if they want something more edgier, but I felt that it was a great way of showing the audience that this film is not just something that we can experience once and never revisit again. Darabont wants us to go back to Shawshank prison, because it felt good going through it and that it brings out something us that we never truly anticipated before.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is Frank Darabont's first feature film, not counting Buried Alive. What Darabont has created is a wonderful prison drama that gives us something more than what is offered on it's surface. Darabont is trying to tell us with The Shawshank Redemption, to not give up on hope, and the film succeeded on that as I have heard many stories of people being completely touched by this and that they made a complete change on their perspective of life. Darabont consistently kept this film to feel optimistic, regardless of the events that transpire during the middle passages of the film. But Darabont didn't let it's optimism keep this from a being a great drama. There are still moments of pitfalls for the film's characters and they are treated with enough seriousness that we end sympathising for the victims, but like I said, the film's atmosphere has kept this optimism to it which in a way let's the film feel much more accessible and easier to connect with. At first the film may feel quite long, but that just makes the experience of prison feel more real and I think that is very important in order to sell the agony of time that he had to endeavor. Darabont was able to truly capture the horrors of prison. The film was able to create this sense of claustrophobia on Andy, whether be the size of his cell or that he is neither safe with the people around him, whether they are guards or inmates. It's as if he can't get out. Darabont has kind of made the prison itself seem like a character and that is tough to do.\n\nThe film's cinematographer was Roger Deakins and I praise this man's work, not just for The Shawshank Redemption but also for other films like Skyfall and his work with the Coen brothers. What Deakins have made for The Shawshank Redemption is very impressive. Deakins and Darabont clearly wanted this film to be in the eyes or perspective of a certain person looking back on his experience with a particular person, so therefore the film needed to feel more like a cinematic imagination or vision instead of keeping feeling grounded and organic, like as if we were standing next to these characters. The film contains still shots that doesn't require major movements from the camera other than the occasional zoom into a character's face, and the film also contains wonderful tracking shots when the film does start to move along. The film also has these beautiful helicopter shots and brilliant composition of crane shots. Deakins understands that this film has significant depth, and that also Andy doesn't particularly talk in abundance, with silent moments showing introspection. The film's image is lifeless when shooting in the prison, to create this contrast on when we do get a glimpse of the outside world. When the film takes place in prison, Deakins has created this feeling of claustrophobia in his shots, in order to really feel the suffocation that our protagonist is agonizing from. As we get closer and closer to the end of the film, the claustrophobia starts to shed itself away, representing freedom.\n\nThe film's score was handled by Thomas Newman. His work for this film is beautiful, at times it was close in making me cry as Newman really knows how to hit those sentimental notes. In understanding with Darabont's direction, he has given this film an optimistic approach and only in rare occasions does it show any sort of melancholy in it's score. The score here may not be the most unique or experimental work he has created, and it may not even be his best score, but nevertheless his work here is one of the main reasons why the film's power is so strong. The score was able to give off both the feeling of friendship and the power of living. The highlight of the score is the scenes with Brooks living in the outside world, as I have said before, this moment broke my heart and a lot of it had something to do with Newman's score. There was so much sorrow in it that it almost feel inevitable in it's outcome. There are a couple of scores here that feels similar to his future works like Road To Perdition and Revolutionary Road, but everyone has their trademarks.\n\nThe main focus of the film is on Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boy \"Red\" Redding. Andy is played by Tim Robbins and he did a great job playing this character. As Andy stays in the prison for so many years, we see the rise and fall of his experience there. During the speech about living and dying, would have you left feeling ambiguous about him, as he seems to be deciding on the path that he would be taking, and we don't truly find out his intentions until later on the film. Robbins at the beginning of the film trying to adjust to his life in this haunting prison is one of the best moments of his performance, because along with great direction and writing, there is so much more that needed to be known about this character as he has yet shown his true colors, and Robbins understood this by allowing introspection to take charge of character development. Morgan Freeman was great as Red, and he seems to be a representation of us if we ever personally have met Andy. His narration was excellent in it's execution, as it felt genuine and not at all for the sake of telling a story or talking up Andy, there seems to be more of it rather than what is just projected on the surface. It is Red that we truly feel connected to because he is the only one that we ever get inside of. We see the effect that Andy has had on him, and in a way we feel that too. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman was fantastic. As the film explores both of the characters, we get to see the friendship that they have created for each other, and it is heartwarming. The supporting cast also has done a great job in this film, especially Bob Gunton, James Whitmore and Bill Sadler.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is an amazing piece of cinema, and Darabont has created something that has inspired so many people to not give up on themselves and believe in hope. If a film has the ability to touch so many people, then it is definitely something very special.",

In fact, I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a simple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....\n\nWe have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim's character). It's told through the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan's character). The narrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and flow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration - extreme simplicity. It's stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it around and \"apply\" it diligently. The others, only observe the snowball effect.\n\nI hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them.

I completely bought everything he said and did, I loved his character and at the end, when he finally speaks his mind, it was so fresh and outstanding to hear. I loved it.

The story, based on a Stephen King novella, is about the friendship between two men who bond over a number of years while locked up in prison. The film's most touching aspect, and the one that one would find fulfilling about the film, is the way in which it portrays the longing and pain of the fight for freedom and even redemption. But The Shawshank Redemption is also about human connections and human warmth, both feelings that would not be identified in the confined setting of a prison, but still exist because, as the story implies, it is necessary for survival. But what also makes this film deeply satisfying is the wonderful and tasteful direction with which Darabont brings the story to the big screen and a beautiful and meticulous cinematography that feels faithful to the emotions the film carries across. Robbins and Morgan head a great cast with great performances that complete the picture of an excellent touching and poignant film.",

            "content": "تيم روبنس كـ اداء واختيار كان مثالي ومكتمل تماما لأننا لو نظرنا للشخصية ورسمنا صورة لها سنجد هذه الصورة اقرب ما يكون الى تيم روبنس من حيث الشكل والاسلوب،  الامر الذي جعل المشاهد يعطي نوع من الاريحية والتعاطف تجاه هذه الشخصية عندما ظهرت في البداية،  مما جعل من تيم روبنس يقدم اداء ممتاز وراقي ومناسب جدا بعيد عن اي ثغرات ممكن ان يقع فيها الممثل بشخصية كـ  التصنع المبالغه عدم الانسجام في مشاهد ما التشتت و..الخ\r\nكان روبنس يقدم دور بـ احترافيه تامة وساعده بذلك الشخصية نفسها ثوب الشخصية يليق تماما بـ روبنس بكل الفترات التي مرت بها الشخصية ..علامات الهدوء والغموض كان يُظهرها بشكل ولا اروع في بداية وصول الشخصية للإصلاحية والرهبة التي كانت تبدو من عيونه الامر الذي يدل على انه بداخله يوجد نوع من الخوف ويتجلى هذا الخوف بعدم اقتناعه تماما بأن هذا المكان يناسبه بغض النظر عن جرمه وما مدى كان مظلوم او مذنب،  لن اتكلم اكثر عما قدمه روبنس بثوب ايدي لأن الجمال يظهر للعيان ولا داعي احيانا للتوغل في الحديث عنه.\r\n\r\nنأتي الي الاسمر الداهية والبارع في اختيارات اعماله الى حد كبير،  لطالما كان مورغان فريمن او عرفناه بأدواره الثانويه المساعده لأنه مؤمن ان اتقانه يكمن فيها وبالفعل اتقانه وجد ايضا في هذه الشخصية بكل تفاصيلها واجمل تفصيل فيها هي الراوي كيف يروي ليجعل منك حتى من نبرة صوته وكأنها قصة  تحفر في ذهنك احداثها ، كنت اُفضل لو ان النص الموكل لشخصية ريد ان يكون اطول واكبر لكن هذا لا يعني ان النص لم يكن كافي لا بالعكس كان ممتاز لشخصية محورية في العمل وثانويه في الاداء لكن من باب الطمع الفني الذي اريده احياناً. \r\n\r\nالمخرج الفرنسي فرانك دارابون لعل الاسم متواضع او غير معروف للأغلبية واسم العمل الذي قدمه يفوق اسمه بسنوات ضوئية هذا الامر جعل العمل ومخرجه مثال حي وحقيقي على ان السينما والفن السابع بعمره لم ولن يكون مقتصر على نجوم الشباك من ممثلين او مخرجين ، اغلبنا يختار افلامه على اسم المخرج او الممثل لكن هذا العمل جاء ليدحض الانفراد بتلك الاختيارات، لكم اعزائي ان تتخيلو ان دارابون هذا الفرنسي قد قام بـ اخراج الفيلم وهو في عمر 35 سنة تقريبا فقط وانظروا ماذا قدم مع مورغن فريمن وتيم روبنس ، بالمناسبة حتى تيم روبنس لم يكن نجم شباك في تلك الفترة لعل النجم الوحيد الذي كان هو مورغن فريمن، ، بالعودة لـ دارابون فهو قدم لنا مثل لوحة من الجمال والحلوى الفرنسية سطرت من خلالها قضية انسانيه تحيا مع الأمل ـ المخرج كان رائع في التصوير وفي السينماوغرافيا وفي المشاهد بأكثرها من حيث الصورة الانسانيه التي قدمها  ايضاً بالسيناريو الذي هو كاتبه بنفسه ..دائما المخرج عندما يكون كاتب السيناريو هو بنفسه هذا الامر يمكنه من ركوب الفيلم جيداً والسيطرة عليه كان دارابون يجعل الفيلم ينساب تماما بكل سهولة بمجرياته واحداثه كما ينساب ماء من جدول مخصص له  ولن تشعر سوى بذلك الانسياب وهو يمتعك ويجعلك تشاهد سينما بفنها واصالتها، ، نعم ان عناصر الفيلم ساعدت المخرج خاصة الاداءات الممتازة التي قدمها الثنائي روبنس و فريمن وكتابته للسيناريو  ايضا اضف لها القصة ومحاورها وتقلباتها رغم برودة وبطئ تقلباتها لكن سنشعر لوهلة ان هذا البطء بالأحداث وكأنهُ هو المتعه نفسها.  الانسان بشكل عام بأي شيء كان إن وجد نفسه مستمتعا يتمنى ان يمر الوقت بطيء ولا ينقضي هذا الشيء.\r\n\r\nالفيلم: كونه رواية للكاتب الشهير ستيفن كنغ فأنت امام متعه قصصية جميلة.\r\n \"الامل\" كثيرا ما نسمع عنه ونتناوله في مواضيع معينه واحيانا يكون تناولنا له سطحي لسبب اننا لم نذقه!!\r\nالامل يتجلى ابهى حلله في امر وقع بين ظالم ومظلوم حيث ان هذا لاخير سيخلق بداخله امل هذا الامل وُلد نتيجة لإيمانه التام بأنه في خانة المظلوم والحق معه،  اذاً في بعض الاحيان ما يحدث للانسان من عقبات في حياته هي التي تأذن بان يولد ذلك الشعور لا بل تلك القوة الكامنه ألا وهي (الامل)\r\nاندي كان امله بالحرية لأنه كان مظلوم منذ وصوله يظهر لنا اندي انه بطبع غريب وهذا شي اككيد فهو ليس بسجين قديم او انه اصحاب سوابق او ما شابه بل هو من طبقة اجتماعية مثقفه و واعيه و متعلمه  بل انه مظلوم بقتل زوجته ..بالطبع اخذ وقت حتى اعتاد على السجن ومجتمعه الموحل بقضايا فساد والرشوة النتنه وكوّن لهُ اول صديق وهو ريد، هنا نقطة يجب الحديث عنها في بداية معرفتهما ببعض برع المخرج والسيناريو بأن يكون روبنس حذراً حتى بمعرفته بـ ريد فأننا لم نرى ان روبنس ذلك الحمل الوديع الذي ليس له احد وطوال الوقت مع ريد او انه يتكلم عن ظلمه ويبكي لـ ريد او او الخ..\r\nبل ظهرت لنا شخصية متماسكه رغم ما مر بها داخل السجن ورغم ان مجتمع السجن لا ينتمي لها اطلاقاً لكن شخصية اندي كانت تعمل بـ هدوء وصمت وشعرت ان معرفته بـ ريد فقط من باب ان يؤمن له اغراض تلزمه للفرار من السجن هذه كـ بداية لكن الوقت الذي تطلبه الحفر جعل اندي يتقرب من ريد اكثر وان هذا شيء طبيعي في فطرة الانسان حيث كلما زاد الوقت كلما زاد التقرب واحيانا احد المتقربين لا يشعر بهذا القرب الذي وصله إلا اذا جلس وفكر قليلا كيف كانت علاقته بالبدايه.\r\n\r\nاندي اشتغل على اولويات الاحتياجات كانت اولويته الأولى الانهماك في العمل على حريته التي توقدها نار الامل بداخله \r\nوكما قلنا مع مرور الوقت اصبح ريد اقرب اصدقاءه اذاً بالنسبة لـ اندي لا مانع بما انه يعمل على اولويته.\r\nوفي ظل هذا العمل وجدنا اندي يتقرب اكثر من اصحاب له ممكن لعدم اشعار اي احد بالسجن ان اندي يقوم بشيء ما لأننا كما نعلم ان في السجن حتى من يشي بالآخر ممكن ان يكسب اموال وحتى اندي وصل بتقربه لـ رئيس حرس السجن من خلال  المشهد  الجميل على السطح وطلب البيرة لـ اصدقائه ..لنجده مع مرور الوقت اكتر اصبح حتى يفيد السجن والسجناء من خلال المكتبة التي عمل على تكبيرها وجلب كتب مختلفة وبثقافته افاد بعض السجناء وكل هذا وهو ((ينهمك بالعمل))...كانت شخصية بكلمتين (دؤبة-مثابرة)\r\n\r\nبروكس هذه الشخصية التي ألفت السجن واصبحت جزء منه وعاشت نصف قرن بين جدران هذه الاصلاحية وعندما اتى امر بأطلاق سراح بروكس المشروط لم يتحمله عقله كيف ذلك وهو اصبح السجن له كالماء بالنسبه للسمكة فـ هدد بمشهد هستيري احد اصدقائه بالقتل وسحب عليه السكين و وضعها على عنقه ظاناً منه ان بقتل صديقه سيسجن في هذه الاصلاحية ويتابع حياته التي اعتادها لكن في النهاية رضخ للأمر الواقع  وتسرح وخرج الي مجتمع لم يعرفه منذ نصف قرن ..وكان هذا المجتمع قاسي عليه كـ رجل بعمره فعمل العجوز بروكس بأحد المحال التجارية بتعبئة المشتريات بالأكياس بعدما كان مدير لمكتبة!!\r\nواين؟ في سجن!!\r\nيالها من مفارقة قاسية ومضحكة مبكية لهذا قال بروكس لم يعد بالعمر بقية وسامحوني يا اصداقائي وحفر \" بروكس كان هنا\".\r\nهناك من وجد مقارنة بين بروكس واندي احدهم \"انهمك بالعمل\" والآخر لم يحرك ساكناً \"انهمك بالموت\"\r\n\r\nاحيانا بـ ضمور الأمل بطبيعة النفس البشرية تسمح لظهور الكسل بشكل احيانا يعطي لأمور اكبر من حجمها بـ عشرات الاضعاف رغم صعوبة هذه الامور:  عندما كان ريد يروي طريقة هرب اندي كان يقول \" ان النفق الذي حفره اندي توقعت انه يتطلب حفره 600 عام لكن اندي حفره بـ 20عاما فقط \"\r\n\r\nبعض الامور: انا مع اظهار فساد السجن الاداري من رشاوي وغسيل اموال لكني وجدته بـ شيئ من المبالغه الى حد ما  ايضا وجدت ان شخصية ((تومي)) كانت ثغرة غبية ولم تكن ناجحة لأنها ادت الى امرين وهما المبالغه-صدفة فنتازية\r\nالمبالغة وهي في تقذيرالسجن وادارته من خلال مقتل تومي والصدفه الفنتازية كيف ان تومي كان مسجون مع الرجل الذي قتل زوجة اندي وحبيبها !!!  صراحة لم يقنعني وجود هذه الشخصية وكنت اُفضل عدم وجودها.\r\n\r\nالفيلم: جيد جدا\r\nاعطيه:  \r\nB+",

He faces the struggles some may see in prisons but while in jail he keeps his cool and repeatedly makes the prison feel as if they were free men.

The acting, the score, the directing, the story, and the uplifting messages make for an satisfying movie-going experience.

It is a movie in which you want the innocent man to go free and for the old man to live his dreams, outside of prison. Director Frank Darabont does an excellent job playing to the emotions of his viewers, as well as creating an engaging script with an even more impressive cast.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, we see Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, in a trial being convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. This very opening scene grabs a viewer right away. It is as though Andy's stoic and reserved facial expressions make his statements of innocence even more believable. As a viewer, I wanted to see Andy go free. I wanted to see him be innocent.  Nonetheless, he is sent to Shawshank prison, notorious for long and brutal sentences. Within this prison, we meet Red, played by Morgan Freeman, who has already been there for 20 years, convicted of murder as well. Red is the man that is friends with anyone and can get anything you could want outside the prison walls. He is able to play to the viewer's emotions and really show that the relationships that he forms are genuine. \n\nThe warden and Officer Hadley, head of the guards, are out to make sure that everyone's lives in Shawshank Prison are living hell. Andy was a great friend with Red, but he also made sure to be on the good side of the warden and Officer Hadley. This was worked in well with the rest of the plot. As time went on, Andy would begin to take care of these two men's money problems. He became the man that did the books for the prison, and in this way, the viewer is convinced of the relationships that are being formed. The warden treats him extra special, by letting him be in the offices and build a library for the prison, and Officer Hadley beats up any men that even try to come at Andy, in any kind of physical attack. These two men do a wonderful job of creating a menacing role that would scare the viewer into the next lifetime when it comes to being at a prison, but the \"soft\" side can also be seen. The viewer hopes that these two men will actually turn out to be good guys in the end, because of all of the help that they are giving to Andy. Andy knew how to play the game the correct way, though; keep your friends close and your enemies closer. \n\nThe engaging script keeps the viewer hooked throughout the entire movie. This movie spans over 20 years, and the viewer never loses interest. Not only that, but the script was full of unique, yet easy language to follow along with. This movie is not for the young crowd, but it is a good educational tool that can be used to truly convey what happened in some of the prisons in the early-mid 1900s. That is something that not all movies can really do. This is a must see movie, no matter what.",

Dufresne is sentenced to life in Shawshank prison. There, he befriends a Morgan Freeman's character Red. The two of them become inspirable and they become each other's support as they both serve harsh time.\n\nThe audience watches as Dufresne makes his special mark on Shawshank prison. Whether it was because he helped expand the range of books in the library, he helped a young misunderstood boy achieve his high school diploma, or he helped most of the guards as well as the warden file their taxes just in time for tax season, Dufresne seemed to have made Shawshank a little less like a prison and a little more like a center for rehabilitation.\n\nAs 19 years came up, Dufresne discovered who had actually killed his wife and her lover. Dufresne is determined to become a free man, one way or another, even if the warden should attempt to gets in his way.\n\nThis film is a piece of art and I encourage everyone to experience if just as I have. This film is about friendship, loyalty, strength, truthfulness, and fighting for what's right, even when you seem outnumbered.\n\nNo words can describe how beautiful this film truly is. The film's title even gives it an epic kick to it.\n\nThe screenplay was written beautifully smooth with no dull moments. Thomas Newman composed such a lovely and pleasing yet epic score that I fell in love with. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give once in a lifetime performances that melt your heart.\n\nOverall, this film is amazing, simple as that.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption, I give you a 100%.",

There's no law like that?  Here we go, then.\nDoes this movie tell a complete story?  From back story to the rest of Red and Dufrane's lives, yes.  One raging, murderous star.\nAre the acting and effects believable?  The movie goes full immersion, and doesn't break until the credits.  One cheating wife of a star.\nDoes the movie avoid cliche? Not only does it steer clear, it flips a U and goes in the opposite direction.  One contraband-arrangin' star.\nDoes this movie do what it set out to do?  It makes an effort to be a serious prison movie about that one weird guy that just doesn't belong.  It's dramatic, has excellent pacing and story progression, and has just enough humor sprinkled about to not drop us to Brooks' level of depression.  One bull queer ball-busting star.\nDoes this movie have a takeaway?  If you don't walk away feeling like you have to get busy living, you probably need to pay more attention to the movie.  One busy-dyin' star.\nFinal score: Five stars.  Now stop reading the review and actually go watch the movie.  Have an intelligent day.",

            "content": "Frank Darabont's less-than-enthralling direction and screenplay can be summed up as such: a bland, pseudo-intellectual, and quite lazily told story that follows a set of totally unsympthetic characters. To clarify, it is not a bad film per se, but the popular appeal evades me. The puported depth of the film could be explained by conjuring images of you diving into a murky lake expecting the water to be deep enough to substantiate the dive, though awkwardly enough the water is shallow and it would appear you're headed to the emergency room.  \nBlandness just seems to envelope the film and its unsympthetic cast of characters. The storytelling is far from bad, intially at least, but it just seems to contently lull in its own sauntering pace. But the blandness doesn't seem solely perpetuated by the storyline, rather it seems the characters ensure the film's humdrum script will remain as such for the duration. Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dusfrane is honestly just boring and uneventful, I'm not demanding spectacle but there's just nothing about this character that draws me in. His innoncence is obvious, his predicament is unfortunate, yet nothing about Andy brings about any sympathetic feelings, and most concerningly his abuse at the hands of the other inmates just comes across as matter of fact. The inability of his tragedy to draw any real raw emotional response from me isn't isolated to his performance. Bob Gunton's portrayal of the warden was bland as well. This is a role, unlike Andy Dusfrane, that I can saw would easily evoke some raw emotional response from me. But problematically Bob Gunton failed to achieve this, the Warden's inherently evil actions and even his (*spoiler alert*) inevitable suicide drew nothing. The lack of reaction is simple in its roots and I don't want to fall into repition here but its just a bland portrayal. \nMorgan Freeman is \"on the fence\" for me so to speak. I didn't find his portrayal or narration overly bland like many of his fellow castmembers. However I can't say it was overly inspiring or emotional evoking. To be honest his final meeting with the board kind of pissed me off. I'll be honest this is going to sound childish and maybe I'm missing something here (my first watch through was at 3am so I was tired as it was), but am I supposed to take this seriously? All of a sudden he turns around from affirming rehabilitation to questioning rehabilition as a whole? Am I supposed to feel sympathy? Your character is a murderer, so I don't feel sorry that you've spent the past 40 years of your life in prison. \"To tell you the truth I don't give a shit,\" and after that bombshell the board decides to release you? Because that makes a load of sense, rather than when he was affirming it years in the past there's a sudden change of heart? I won't say what Morgan said in this little speech of his wasn't meaningful, it was kind of of powerful in its own right, but I can't help but feel like this is nothing less than lazy storytelling to have the board release him on that. Its satisfying, but it just comes across as an easy way of the storyline so he can be reunited with Dusfrane outside of prison. To be honest the logic of the board accepting this explanation and affirming his release, might as well have been accompanied by a slow clap from all of the board members. It has that melodramatic quality and frankly that quality only affirms the laziness of the storytelling here.\nThe blandness of the film overwhelms me and I get more intellectual enthrallment from watching Segei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin than I do from this. And that's Soviet propoganda mind you.",

            "content": "The Shawshank Redemption stands as one of the greatest films I've ever seen in my life, with an interesting story and plot structure, memorable and likeable characters, and a fantastically shot setting.\n\nBased on the Stephen King short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\", the movie follows Andy Dufrane's (Tim Robbins) time spent in Shawshank prison for murdering his wife and her lover. Throughout the movie he maintains his innocence. During his time in Shawshank, which is run by an extremely religious though morally corrupt warden who makes his life miserable, he befriends another prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman) who brings him things for a price.\n\nA major theme throughout the film is the absense of freedom in a supposedly free world and the freedom in the world of the prison. It's an interesting idea that's explored through both the characters of Brooks and Red. The story is interesting and keeps you interested in all the characters...except for Dufrane, who is kinda a boring protagonist really. Robbins just plays him as this detached character who just happens to have a skill that helps him survive the life of a prisoner. More interesting, luckily, is the supporting cast. Freeman is amazing as usual in the role of Red, and the actor playing the Warden excells in conveying a quietly menacing, unlikable character. The cinematography is absolutely exsquisite, giving the prison a grim and dank environment.\n\nThis is definitely a must see for cinemaphiles and Stephen King fans alike. This is not only in my opinion the greatest adaptation of a Stephen King short story, but just an amazing film in its own right. If you haven't seen it right, see it as soon as possible.

There are moments in this movie that were quite depressing but there were also plenty of moments in the movie that made me feel happy and I thought it was all done perfectly because Darabont is magnificent story teller. The Shawshank Redemption's story is one of the greatest story's ever put on screen, it truly is magnificent. Darabont also does a great a great job at writing the film's dialogue and the film's characters. Darabont does an extraordinary job at creating characters that you actually care for and that's what many filmmakers lack now a days. Darabont also does a brilliant job at directing the film, he helps tell the story through his great visuals and manages to get the actors to give the best performances they possible could. Of course Darabont's vision wouldn't have come to life it weren't for Roger Deakins cinematography, Deakins's work is just fascinating because everything just looks so beautiful. Another beautiful thing about this movie is Thomas Newman's score which fit the film perfectly. The performances in this film are just absolutely stunning, the whole cast is just wonderful. Tim Robbins gives a superb performance along with Morgan Freeman, both actors give it their all and it definitely pays of. What works so well about their performances is that they have some great chemistry, they are so amazing when they are on screen together. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are the film's antagonists and they are excellent because they made me hate their guts. The rest of the cast is very good and that includes James Whitmore, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows to name a few. Overall The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and is a must see, if you haven't seen it than go see it immediately!",

The Shanwshank Redemption tells the story of a mild mannered banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is accused of killing his wife and her lover, he is sentenced to two consecuetive life terms at Shawshank prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman in an Oscar-nominated performance) The man who can get anything for you. The film chronicles the twenty years Andy spent in prison, the ways he helped launder money for the warden and the events leading up to his most daring and and emotionally charging escape. This film is really a true masterpiece that shows humanity exists in friendship and really shows you that a person who really wants to be free will do anything to achieve it. The credit for this film really belongs to Frank Darabont, who tells the story with such fierce passion and shows you that people who are truly innocent will be free again. The ending is a testament to beauty at its highest form. this film is a classic that deserves to be honored. The film is told in narration through Red's point of view, of how he sees Andy and how he never could have expected what Andy did, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are beautifully brilliant in their performances, and they set a new standard for acting. If I learned one thing from the character Andy in The Shawshank Redemption is that no matter what people do to you, if the incarcerate you, or control you in some way, they can never touch what is inside or how you feel. Get busy livin' or get bust dying. Just Beautiful ****",

This film also featured one of the best finales ever portrayed on screen and it will leave you with a smile on your face. Frank Darabont directs this movie with such care and dedication to the acting and plot and the result is one of the most  deeply satisfying prison dramas of all time and one of the best movies ever made.

After reading the book I've decided that The Shawshank Redemption successfully and accurately used dialog and conversation in the book to turn it into an accurate film adaptation.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Morgan Freeman's character, Red, begins to narrate as he does in the book. Most film adaptations of books change dialog and actiom to add more of an appeal but, Frank Darabont stuck as closely to the book as possible when directing this film.\n\nThere isn't much conversation in The Shawshank Redemption, it is mostly narration, but, when there is conversation it is the same in both the film and book. One of my the best parts of the story is when Red gives gives a lesson about hope. I had to look back a few times but Freeman had given the speech word for word. The fact that this is a turning point in the story makes it very important that it is included word for word in the film.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorite movies and I enjoyed having the opportunity to write a paper about it. All of the reviews I had read have the same opinions as i do. That the film and the book are extremely similar and that adds to its popularity. One thing that I can point out is that Andy Dufresne, in the book, is described as a tall lanky man with gold glasses. in the film, Tim Robbins is not very lanky more of a husky type build. I'm not saying he was a bad choice to play Andy Dufresne, I just think that thats one thing that the film had a little leeway with handling.",

        {
            "content": "Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticise - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.\n\nIt's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).\n\nIt's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favourite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.\n\nEven without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.\n\nShawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\".\n\nOn top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalisation, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.\n\nShawshank approaches the theme of institutionalisation with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realise how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realise that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.\n\nThe characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalisation. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.\n\nShawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognise our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.\n\nThe film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it \"a poster child for Christianity\". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labours the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.\n\nAn equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.\n\nWhether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humour. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).\n\nThe only fly in the ointment with Shawshank is its ending. The film is about hope as a value in and of itself, emphasising the importance of having it even if it is not rewarded. Red's transition to embracing hope is far more important than his reunion with Andy, and this reunion shifts the film's message from celebrating hope to justifying the characters' pain on the basis of a happy ending. It's also clear that this ending was put together at the last minute, with subtle shifts in the cinematography and a far more rushed pacing to it.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts.",

I guess having that notion that all classic films have to be complex, with a bunch of overarching themes can influence one's perceptions of what is supposed to be a quality film. I have learned that every director has a vision with its own distinctiveness that differs from other directors. Whether its small or large in its scope, sometimes that is not the point. Some directors want to prove something to make a point, while some just want to just make a story that's basically good, without the need to be over-politically or socially conscious to the point where it becomes pretentious.\r\n\r\nAnd 'Shawshank' is basically that. A good simple story about one's will to hold on to hope despite how heavy the circumstances. Sure, some might not view it as realistic for a story about prison life, but applying to the concept of life in general is what fits and not if it rings true to how life in prison really is. It's a more of a 'life' film than a prison film. When one feels like they are in their own type of 'prison,' sometimes just having a friend to bring you a little freedom is all you need to feel free again, and that is a comforting message in all its beautiful simplicity.\r\n\r\nWith its 'floating on a cloud' atmosphere, it really has a soothing, calm, and tranquil atmosphere, despite the setting being a prison. This tone is what separates 'Shawshank' from other films and becomes its own distinct world and with that the film comes off feeling more hopeful than dark at times, and I think that's more than I can ask for from this great movie, at the end of the day.",

You feel \"sad,\" \"angry,\" \"happy,\" but you always have hope. You have hope because of how Andy Deufrene becomes everybody's favorite in the prison. You feel angry because of the evil warden, and you hate him so much. The sisters also made you angry. \n\nBut you feel a lot of warmth in this film, because of scenes like the one where Andy Deufrene is standing out in the rain. So amazing, and everything works out the way you want it to in this film. \n\nThe whole idea of how you become dependent on the prison after a while is shown in such a great way, and I felt like I got a good impression as to how life in prison is like. I had such a fascination with this film for reasons like that. It is so awesome. \n\nThe acting is also amazing. The best scene is when Red gets sent in, and they ask him do you feel rehabilitated, and he just asks what does that mean. it was such awesome scene, and Morgan Freeman delivered his usual amazing acting in that scene. I kept thinking \"Yeah!\" when he was talking to that guy. \n\nOne movie that I would compare this to is Clint Eastwood's \"Escape From Alcatraz.\" It had similar elements such as dealing with the rapist, a warden that you hate, dumping all of the rocks you dug out the night before, when you were trying to escape. It also had the same library that Shawshank had. However the big difference between the two is that \"Escape from Alcatraz\" is more of an exciting bad ass thriller, while Shawshank is more of an epic drama. Shawshank is still the greatest prison film of all time, and one of the greatest classics just in general. \n\nThis film is on a list of movies that I will show my kids in about 20 years or so. This will always be great, and it will never die.",

La trama se desarrolla practicamente idéntica al cuento original, pero la visión de Darabont fué clave para el impacto fílmico ya que fué su decisión la de usar a Morgan Freeman en el papel de \"Red\", y que sin duda, sin Freeman, la cinta nunca hubiera sido lo mismo. Ciertamente Tim Robbins desarrolla bien a su personaje, pero es la presencia de Morgan Freeman la que define el nivel de la producción. Pero sin duda, el resto del elenco son bien elegidos y cada uno aporta su grano de arena para consolidar esta gran película. El ritmo del filme es perfecto donde usted en dos horas y resto realmente llega a sentir el paso de 20 años dentro de la trama. La primera vez que la ven, te sorprende, pero inclusive, cuando la vuelves a ver, aunque ya sepas elementos clave de la trama, igualmente la vuelves a disfrutar, apreciando las impecables actuaciones y las memorables escenas. Si quisiera cambiar algo, creo que sería algo mínimo del inicio de la cinta, donde arrancan con \"Andy\", el personaje de Robbins que es el principal, y hasta luego de unos minutos entran con \"Red\", el personaje de Freeman. Como Freeman es el narrador de toda la película, creo que hubiera sido mejor, arrancar con él, y que Robbins entre en la trama, tal y como lo hacen al llegar a la prisión y presentar los minutos iniciales como un flashback. No es nada que vaya a cambiar la película, simplemente es algo que pienso cada vez que la veo. Altamente recomendada.",

If it's ever proved profitable it's been on the basis of subsequent TV broadcast and videotape/DVD sales & rental.  This same director, Darabont, made horror movies till then.  Other credits:  This is a perfect role for Morgan Freeman as narrator/actor, and Tim Robbins is fine as our protagonist Andy.  This marks the third film Robbins has appeared in that merits my All-Time Top 100 Movies list!  The other two pictures being by Robert Altman:  The Player, and Short Cuts.  \n     Given the critical success of this Darabont then made another prison film, also based on a Stephen King short story, called The Green Mile.  Definitely not as good as Shawshank Redemption, but not a bad picture, It was far more costly to make, yet generated better B.O. and probably was profitable.  Go figure.",

There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.\n\nShawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabontâ(TM)s screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.\n\nThe film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.\n\nAndy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.\n\nThe movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.\n\nIt didnâ(TM)t do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to criticâ(TM)s high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.\n\nFrank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of Kingâ(TM)s books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of Kingâ(TM)s books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.\n\nHere is a DVD every home should have.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
